Part of the \"Ideologies of Desire\" series edited by the queer theorist [[David M. Halperin]], the book was published by [[Oxford University Press]].\n\nThe book received positive reviews and was praised by philosophers and other commentators, who described it as an important and well-researched work and credited Stein with carefully examining the assumptions underlying scientific research on sexual orientation and refuting the idea that biological research on sexual orientation should be used to support arguments for gay rights. However, reviewers disagreed over Stein's style of writing, some finding ''The Mismeasure of Desire'' well-written and others poorly written. Some commentators remained unconvinced by Stein's discussions of topics such as social constructionism and the ethics of research on sexual orientation. Reviewers complimented Stein for raising important issues, but noted that he left many questions unresolved.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Stein discusses Freud's views.]]\nStein discusses the origins, nature, and importance of sexual orientation, including relevant legal and ethical issues. He critically examines scientific research on sexual orientation, questioning its assumptions, its methods, and its relevance.{{sfn|Stein|1999|page=ix}} He provides a philosophical discussion and criticism of \"social constructionism\" and \"essentialism\", which he defines respectively as \"the thesis that sexual orientations are mere social constructs\" and the thesis that \"sexual orientations are more than mere social constructs.\"{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=7\u20138}}\n\nResearch criticized by Stein includes a 1995 study by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ferveur ''et al.'' that was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. He finds it and other studies that claim to have identified genes that cause [[homosexuality]] in ''[[Drosophila]]'' (fruit flies) to be guilty of [[anthropomorphism]]. He argues that such research is irrelevant to understanding sexual orientation in humans. Stein criticizes the journalist [[Chandler Burr]] for uncritically accepting \"courtship\" behavior between male fruit flies as an example of animal homosexuality. Stein criticizes the philosopher [[Michael Ruse]]'s views on social constructionism. Stein criticizes the neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]]. He also discusses the work of the psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and the psychiatrist [[Richard Pillard]]. Stein argues that the political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] failed to show that social constructionism is false. Stein argues that it has not been shown that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups (\"natural kinds\"). In his discussion of natural kinds, he draws on the work of the philosopher [[Hilary Putnam]]. He also argues that the ethics of sexual orientation research are open to question, and criticizes the geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] and the psychologist [[Daryl Bem]].{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=iii, 78, 105, 108\u2013109, 120, 154\u2013162, 166, 193\u2013195, 243\u2013250, 338, 350, 366}}\n\nDiscussing Halperin's social constructionist views, Stein writes that Halperin's claims about the development of contemporary categories of sexual orientation are not universally shared: while Halperin maintains that the word \"homosexual\" was coined by the journalist [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] in 1869 and attaches significance to this event, others such as the historian [[John Boswell]] argue that the concept the word refers to has existed for centuries.{{sfn|Stein|1999|page=100}} Stein also discusses the views of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], and the work of the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]].{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=233, 268}}\n\nStein calls ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' (1981) one of the most detailed retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation. Stein writes that while the study has been criticized on various grounds, including that all of its subjects were living in [[San Francisco]], arguably an atypical place with respect to the sexual orientation of its inhabitants, Bell ''et al.''\u2032s conclusions about theories attributing sexual orientation to the effects of experience have been accepted and confirmed. Stein adds that the study \"suggests that early sexual experience does not play an important role in the development of sexual orientation\", and that it also fails to support theories relating homosexuality to family dynamics. Stein summarizes its data as showing no difference between gay men and straight men in the strength of their attachment to their mothers, and only a weak connection between unfavorable relationships with the father and male homosexuality and gender non-conformity, with similar findings for women. Stein writes that the study does not support the \"parental manipulation theory\" according to which \"children with no siblings would almost never be lesbian or gay and...children with a large number of siblings would be likely to be so.\" Stein observes that many other retrospective studies have been conducted on childhood gender non-conformity partly because of Bell ''et al.''\u2032s findings relating it to homosexuality.{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=235\u2013237}}\n\n==Publication history==\n''The Mismeasure of Desire'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1999. The book was published as an Oxford University Press Paperback in 2001. The book is part of the \"Ideologies of Desire\" series edited by queer theorist David M. Halperin.{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=ii, iv}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Mismeasure of Desire'' was praised by some reviewers, but based on citation analytics received little attention in the mainstream or LGBT press. [[Roger Lancaster]] described the book as a \"methodical, meticulous, and highly readable critique of scientific research on sexual orientation\". He added that while Stein covers many of the problems of the research of LeVay, Hamer, Bailey, and Pillard, his \"important and cautionary text was given less attention than it deserved in the gay press, and it was hardly noticed at all in the mainstream media\".{{sfn|Lancaster|2003|pages=270\u2013271}} Corvino gave the work a positive review in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]'',{{sfn|Corvino|2002|pages=421\u2013423}} and, in 2013, described it as a \"dated but still excellent\" book on sexual orientation research.{{sfn|Corvino|2013|page=101}} The book also received positive reviews from Jeffrey Ingram in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Ingram|1999|page=220}} the radical feminist [[John Stoltenberg]] in ''[[The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide|The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review]]'',{{sfn|Stoltenberg|1999|pages=61\u201362}} the historian [[Michael Bronski]] in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'',{{sfn|Bronski|2000|page=64}} the psychologist [[Bertram Cohler]] in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'',{{sfn|Cohler|2000|pages=284\u2013287}} J.

Grasswick in ''[[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia]]''.{{sfn|Grasswick|2004|pages=203\u2013208}} The book received negative reviews from the journalist Michael Hemmes in ''Lambda Book Report'',{{sfn|Hemmes|2000|pages=28\u201329}} the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy in ''[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]'',{{sfn|Murphy|2000|pages=376\u2013378}} and the psychologist Scott Hershberger in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''.{{sfn|Hershberger|2000|pages=437\u2013438}}\n\nCorvino, discussing the work in ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', described it as a \"useful corrective\" to oversimplified views of sexual orientation, and \"lucid, engaging and ambitious\". He credited Stein with eliminating some of the confusions regarding the \"essentialist/contructionist debate.\" However, he nevertheless suggested that Stein might have misconstrued the debate, given that it often appeared to be more about how much significance sexual orientation should be given rather than whether it is a \"natural human kind\".{{sfn|Corvino|2002|pages=421\u2013423}} Ingram called the book \"intelligent, well-researched, and well-written\", and wrote that it \"should be the first title on any queer studies reading list\" and was \"more interesting and more accessible than its rather daunting title would suggest\". However, Ingram wrote that like many philosophical works, the book \"poses a lot more questions that it answers\".{{sfn|Ingram|1999|page=220}}\n\nStoltenberg wrote that, despite Stein's \"careful method and measured tone\", the book was \"radically discombobulating\". He considered it a \"landmark book\". He credited Stein with writing \"simply and straightforwardly\" despite his philosophical approach, and with refuting \"biological arguments for lesbian and gay rights\" and discrediting the \"conventional wisdom\" about the nature of sexual orientation, including the question of whether it makes sense to classify people on that basis. He was convinced by Stein's argument that, even if a sound scientific case for a biological basis to sexual orientation were made, this would not advance gay rights.{{sfn|Stoltenberg|1999|pages=61\u201362}} Bronski called ''The Mismeasure of Desire'' \"a smart book that raises skepticism to a fine art\", \"groundbreaking\", and \"meticulously researched and argued\". He credited Stein with discrediting gay politics based on genetic theories of sexual orientation and showing the harmful consequences of arguing that sexual orientation is innate. However, according to Bronski, LeVay expressed disagreement with many of Stein's conclusions.{{sfn|Bronski|2000|page=64}} Cohler considered the book \"important for any scholar interested in a detailed review of the assumptions, methods, and findings emerging from the biological study of homosexuality\". He also wrote that it may be \"the most careful and detailed exploration to date of the claims of those maintaining biological factors as essential in the origin of a same-gender sexual desire fixed from earliest prenatal life\", and that it cogently countering such claims. However, he was unconvinced by Stein's argument that his views should not be labelled social constructionist, and found Stein's discussion of the ethics of the research less impressive than his review of the scientific findings.{{sfn|Cohler|2000|pages=284\u2013287}}\n\nCroissant wrote that the book was important and that Stein \"meticulously articulates the assumptions of the current paradigms\" governing scientific research on sexual orientation. However, he found Stein's critique of \"constructivist theories\" weak, attributing this to the fact that \"Stein's argument converges with constructivist insights\".{{sfn|Croissant|2000|page=1336}} Appiah credited Stein with helping to clarify the issues surrounding social constructionism, but argued that, because of his avoidance of some technical philosophical issues, Stein failed to make the strongest possible case against some forms of \"essentialism\". He complimented Stein for his discussion of early scientific research on sexual orientation, as well as his criticism of more recent work by scientists such as LeVay, Hamer, and Bem. He wrote that Stein clarified the debate over the relevance of choice to sexual orientation, and considered Stein's \"notion of nondeterminism\" to be one of his most original contributions. He endorsed Stein's view that the science of sexual orientation is not relevant to debates on gay rights, but was less convinced by Stein's arguments that future technologies that might make it possible to determine a child's sexual orientation would encouraged prejudice and thus be unethical. He welcomed Stein's contribution to the debate over the morality of conducting scientific research on sexual orientation, and concluded that his was \"a rich and rewarding work that should be read by anyone who wants to think about what is at stake in the scientific exploration of sexual orientation.\"{{sfn|Appiah|2002|page=151}} ''The Diversity Factor'' described the book as a \"masterfully argued study\". It credited Stein with providing a comprehensive overview of approaches to sexual orientation, showing the relevance of the idea of natural kinds to understanding sexual orientation, showing the methodological flaws of scientific studies on homosexuals and making useful suggestions for improved research. It agreed with Stein that gay rights should not depend on whether homosexuality is biological in origin and that it is important to consider the social effects of scientific research on the subject.{{sfn|''The Diversity Factor''|2000|pages=39\u201340}}\n\nNussbaum wrote that the book \"will advance the public debate about homosexuality and the law\" and praised its \"rigor and clarity, its wide-ranging and ingenious arguments, and its accessible style.\" However, she also found Stein's account of natural kinds, and hence also the debate over social constructionism, unclear. She maintained that the \"issue of natural human kinds\" is less important to the legal and ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation than Stein suggests.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2002|pages=316\u2013334}} Hacking called the book an \"encyclopedic study\", \"an authoritative history of twentieth century scientific approaches to sexual orientations\", and \"a rich body of analysis, distinctions and arguments.\" He credited Stein with being the first philosopher to expose the confusions involved in asking whether homosexuality is a natural kind. However, he criticized Stein for defining natural kinds through reference to Putnam's work, questioning his use of Putnam. He also found some of Stein's claims about natural kinds confusing, and questioned the idea of the natural kind was useful for Stein\u2019s purposes, Stein's use of his ideas, as well as his uses of the terms \"essentialism\" and \"constructionism\".{{sfn|Hacking|2002|pages=95\u2013107}} Stein replied to Nussbaum and Hacking, writing that while they both claimed that he believes that the question of whether sexual orientations are natural human kinds is relevant to ethical and legal issues, he sees no such connection.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pages=349\u2013353}}\n\nGediman and Abbott called the book \"refreshingly daring\", but criticized Stein for his writing style and for separating his review of scientific and psychological research on sexual orientation from his discussion of the philosophical and ethical issues surrounding it. They believed some readers would find the book tedious. They complimented Stein for questioning the desirability of scientific research on sexual orientation, but concluded that, \"he so frequently refrains from taking sides that his analysis raises more questions than it answers.\"{{sfn|Gediman|Abbott|1999|page=63}} Zicklin maintained that Stein succeeded in \"demonstrating the problematic epistemological and scientific status\" of the concept of sexual orientation, but in the process tested \"the reader's ability to follow an all-too-closely reasoned argument\". While he found Stein's goal of diminishing \"the cultural and psychological significance of the gender of one's sexual partner\" laudable, he wrote that it \"cannot be accomplished by simply analyzing the concept of sexual orientation.\" He criticized Stein for claiming to have eliminated cultural presumptions associated with the concept of sexual orientation, arguing that this was impossible \"given how densely this concept is woven into our culture.\" He concluded that a better approach would be to abandon the concept of sexual orientation entirely and \"publicize the moral bankruptcy of research into the etiology of homosexuality.\"{{sfn|Zicklin|2002|pages=1207\u20131216}}\n\nGrasswick called the book an ambitious attempt \"to delve into the difficulties of executing and assessing scientific research on sex and sexuality.\" However, she wrote that while Stein endorsed a \"multiple-origins\" model of sexual orientation in which biological factors played only an indirect role, he did little to develop the framework of such a theory. She commented that \"in the course of strategically accepting and working with\" a framework that involves \"dualisms of nature/nurture, essentialism/constructivism, and science/ethics ... Stein leaves himself little room to explore the interactive complexities that his own analysis seems to point toward.\"{{sfn|Grasswick|2004|pages=203\u2013208}}\n\nHemmes found the book informative, but also poorly written. He accused Stein of writing in \"too much detail\" and of presenting \"tortuous examples\".{{sfn|Hemmes|2000|pages=28\u201329}} Murphy considered the book poorly written, writing that parts of it resembled an \"ossified philosophical dialogue.\" He criticized Stein for providing an \"overlong discussion of possible views about the nature of sexual orientation.\" He summarized Stein as maintaining that \"there are methodological and evidentiary problems in the contemporary science of sexual orientation\" and that \"there is insufficient reason to think that sexual orientations are natural kinds\", agreeing with both points. However, he disagreed with the idea \"that sexual orientations are purely social inventions.\" He found Stein's point that sexual orientation research is irrelevant to most ethical questions correct but unoriginal, and his discussion of whether it should be restricted to avoid harm to gay people unsatisfactory. He also denied the book's originality, finding nothing in it unprecedented in the philosophy of science.{{sfn|Murphy|2000|pages=376\u2013378}}\n\nHershberger wrote that while Stein argued that there is no conclusive evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined, the evidence was in fact \"overwhelming\". He faulted Stein for criticizing only a limited number of scientific studies, ignoring \"others that could only rationally have a biological interpretation\", adding that LeVay had already answered the criticisms that had been directed against his study. He was unconvinced by Stein's criticisms of the concept of sexual orientation, and wrote that Stein wrongly elevated philosophical reasoning above empirical fact. He found the book well-written, and agreed that arguments for gay rights should not be based on scientific findings.{{sfn|Hershberger|2000|pages=437\u2013438}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry]]''\n* ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]''\n* ''[[Virtually Normal]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n;Books\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Corvino|first1=John |title=What's Wrong With Homosexuality? |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-985631-2 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Lancaster|first1=Roger N. |title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0520236202 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Stein |first1=Edward |title=The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-514244-6 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mismeasureofdesi00stei_0 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n;Journals\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |title=The Mismeasure of Desire (book) |last1=Appiah|first1=Kwame Anthony |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2002 |doi=10.1300/J082v42n01_08 |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Blinded by science |last1=Bronski|first1=Michael |journal=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |volume= |issue=804 |year=2000 |doi= |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=The Science of Sexual Desire |last1=Cohler|first1=Bertram J. |journal=[[Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2000 |doi= |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Book Reviews |last1=Corvino|first1=John |journal=[[The Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=52 |issue=208 |year=2002 |doi= |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=The mismeasure of desire (Book Review) |last1=Croissant|first1=J.

Part of the \"Ideologies of Desire\" series edited by the queer theorist [[David M. Halperin]], the book was published by [[Oxford University Press]].\n\nThe book received positive reviews and was praised by philosophers and other commentators, who described it as an important and well-researched work and credited Stein with carefully examining the assumptions underlying scientific research on sexual orientation and refuting the idea that biological research on sexual orientation should be used to support arguments for gay rights. However, reviewers disagreed over Stein's style of writing, some finding ''The Mismeasure of Desire'' well-written and others poorly written. Some commentators remained unconvinced by Stein's discussions of topics such as social constructionism and the ethics of research on sexual orientation. Reviewers complimented Stein for raising important issues, but noted that he left many questions unresolved.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Stein discusses Freud's views.]]\nStein discusses the origins, nature, and importance of sexual orientation, including relevant legal and ethical issues. He critically examines scientific research on sexual orientation, questioning its assumptions, its methods, and its relevance.{{sfn|Stein|1999|page=ix}} He provides a philosophical discussion and criticism of \"social constructionism\" and \"essentialism\", which he defines respectively as \"the thesis that sexual orientations are mere social constructs\" and the thesis that \"sexual orientations are more than mere social constructs.\"{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=7\u20138}}\n\nResearch criticized by Stein includes a 1995 study by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ferveur ''et al.'' that was published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. He finds it and other studies that claim to have identified genes that cause [[homosexuality]] in ''[[Drosophila]]'' (fruit flies) to be guilty of [[anthropomorphism]]. He argues that such research is irrelevant to understanding sexual orientation in humans. Stein criticizes the journalist [[Chandler Burr]] for uncritically accepting \"courtship\" behavior between male fruit flies as an example of animal homosexuality. Stein criticizes the philosopher [[Michael Ruse]]'s views on social constructionism. Stein criticizes the neuroscientist [[Simon LeVay]]. He also discusses the work of the psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and the psychiatrist [[Richard Pillard]]. Stein argues that the political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] failed to show that social constructionism is false. Stein argues that it has not been shown that sexual orientations are non-arbitrary groups (\"natural kinds\"). In his discussion of natural kinds, he draws on the work of the philosopher [[Hilary Putnam]]. He also argues that the ethics of sexual orientation research are open to question, and criticizes the geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] and the psychologist [[Daryl Bem]].{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=iii, 78, 105, 108\u2013109, 120, 154\u2013162, 166, 193\u2013195, 243\u2013250, 338, 350, 366}}\n\nDiscussing Halperin's social constructionist views, Stein writes that Halperin's claims about the development of contemporary categories of sexual orientation are not universally shared: while Halperin maintains that the word \"homosexual\" was coined by the journalist [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]] in 1869 and attaches significance to this event, others such as the historian [[John Boswell]] argue that the concept the word refers to has existed for centuries.{{sfn|Stein|1999|page=100}} Stein also discusses the views of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], and the work of the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]].{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=233, 268}}\n\nStein calls ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' (1981) one of the most detailed retrospective studies relating to sexual orientation. Stein writes that while the study has been criticized on various grounds, including that all of its subjects were living in [[San Francisco]], arguably an atypical place with respect to the sexual orientation of its inhabitants, Bell ''et al.''\u2032s conclusions about theories attributing sexual orientation to the effects of experience have been accepted and confirmed. Stein adds that the study \"suggests that early sexual experience does not play an important role in the development of sexual orientation\", and that it also fails to support theories relating homosexuality to family dynamics. Stein summarizes its data as showing no difference between gay men and straight men in the strength of their attachment to their mothers, and only a weak connection between unfavorable relationships with the father and male homosexuality and gender non-conformity, with similar findings for women. Stein writes that the study does not support the \"parental manipulation theory\" according to which \"children with no siblings would almost never be lesbian or gay and...children with a large number of siblings would be likely to be so.\" Stein observes that many other retrospective studies have been conducted on childhood gender non-conformity partly because of Bell ''et al.''\u2032s findings relating it to homosexuality.{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=235\u2013237}}\n\n==Publication history==\n''The Mismeasure of Desire'' was first published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 1999. The book was published as an Oxford University Press Paperback in 2001. The book is part of the \"Ideologies of Desire\" series edited by queer theorist David M. Halperin.{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=ii, iv}}\n\n==Reception==\n''The Mismeasure of Desire'' has been praised by authors such as the anthropologist [[Roger Lancaster]] and the philosopher [[John Corvino]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lancaster|1y=2003|1pp=270\u2013271|2a1=Corvino|2y=2002|2pp=421\u2013423|3a1=Corvino|3y=2013|3p=101}} Lancaster described the book as a \"methodical, meticulous, and highly readable critique of scientific research on sexual orientation\". He added that while Stein covers many of the problems of the research of LeVay, Hamer, Bailey, and Pillard, his \"important and cautionary text was given less attention than it deserved in the gay press, and it was hardly noticed at all in the mainstream media\".{{sfn|Lancaster|2003|pages=270\u2013271}} Corvino gave the work a positive review in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]'',{{sfn|Corvino|2002|pages=421\u2013423}} and, in 2013, described it as a \"dated but still excellent\" book on sexual orientation research.{{sfn|Corvino|2013|page=101}} The book also received positive reviews from Jeffrey Ingram in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Ingram|1999|page=220}} the radical feminist [[John Stoltenberg]] in ''[[The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide|The Harvard Gay & Lesbian Review]]'',{{sfn|Stoltenberg|1999|pages=61\u201362}} the historian [[Michael Bronski]] in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'',{{sfn|Bronski|2000|page=64}} the psychologist [[Bertram Cohler]] in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]'',{{sfn|Cohler|2000|pages=284\u2013287}} J.

Grasswick in ''[[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia]]''.{{sfn|Grasswick|2004|pages=203\u2013208}} The book received negative reviews from the journalist Michael Hemmes in ''Lambda Book Report'',{{sfn|Hemmes|2000|pages=28\u201329}} the philosopher Timothy F. Murphy in ''[[Sexualities (journal)|Sexualities]]'',{{sfn|Murphy|2000|pages=376\u2013378}} and the psychologist Scott Hershberger in ''[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]]''.{{sfn|Hershberger|2000|pages=437\u2013438}}\n\nCorvino, discussing the work in ''The Philosophical Quarterly'', described it as a \"useful corrective\" to oversimplified views of sexual orientation, and \"lucid, engaging and ambitious\". He credited Stein with eliminating some of the confusions regarding the \"essentialist/contructionist debate.\" However, he nevertheless suggested that Stein might have misconstrued the debate, given that it often appeared to be more about how much significance sexual orientation should be given rather than whether it is a \"natural human kind\".{{sfn|Corvino|2002|pages=421\u2013423}} Ingram called the book \"intelligent, well-researched, and well-written\", and wrote that it \"should be the first title on any queer studies reading list\" and was \"more interesting and more accessible than its rather daunting title would suggest\". However, Ingram wrote that like many philosophical works, the book \"poses a lot more questions that it answers\".{{sfn|Ingram|1999|page=220}}\n\nStoltenberg wrote that, despite Stein's \"careful method and measured tone\", the book was \"radically discombobulating\". He considered it a \"landmark book\". He credited Stein with writing \"simply and straightforwardly\" despite his philosophical approach, and with refuting \"biological arguments for lesbian and gay rights\" and discrediting the \"conventional wisdom\" about the nature of sexual orientation, including the question of whether it makes sense to classify people on that basis. He was convinced by Stein's argument that, even if a sound scientific case for a biological basis to sexual orientation were made, this would not advance gay rights.{{sfn|Stoltenberg|1999|pages=61\u201362}} Bronski called ''The Mismeasure of Desire'' \"a smart book that raises skepticism to a fine art\", \"groundbreaking\", and \"meticulously researched and argued\". He credited Stein with discrediting gay politics based on genetic theories of sexual orientation and showing the harmful consequences of arguing that sexual orientation is innate. However, according to Bronski, LeVay expressed disagreement with many of Stein's conclusions.{{sfn|Bronski|2000|page=64}} Cohler considered the book \"important for any scholar interested in a detailed review of the assumptions, methods, and findings emerging from the biological study of homosexuality\". He also wrote that it may be \"the most careful and detailed exploration to date of the claims of those maintaining biological factors as essential in the origin of a same-gender sexual desire fixed from earliest prenatal life\", and that it cogently countering such claims. However, he was unconvinced by Stein's argument that his views should not be labelled social constructionist, and found Stein's discussion of the ethics of the research less impressive than his review of the scientific findings.{{sfn|Cohler|2000|pages=284\u2013287}}\n\nCroissant wrote that the book was important and that Stein \"meticulously articulates the assumptions of the current paradigms\" governing scientific research on sexual orientation. However, he found Stein's critique of \"constructivist theories\" weak, attributing this to the fact that \"Stein's argument converges with constructivist insights\".{{sfn|Croissant|2000|page=1336}} Appiah credited Stein with helping to clarify the issues surrounding social constructionism, but argued that, because of his avoidance of some technical philosophical issues, Stein failed to make the strongest possible case against some forms of \"essentialism\". He complimented Stein for his discussion of early scientific research on sexual orientation, as well as his criticism of more recent work by scientists such as LeVay, Hamer, and Bem. He wrote that Stein clarified the debate over the relevance of choice to sexual orientation, and considered Stein's \"notion of nondeterminism\" to be one of his most original contributions. He endorsed Stein's view that the science of sexual orientation is not relevant to debates on gay rights, but was less convinced by Stein's arguments that future technologies that might make it possible to determine a child's sexual orientation would encouraged prejudice and thus be unethical. He welcomed Stein's contribution to the debate over the morality of conducting scientific research on sexual orientation, and concluded that his was \"a rich and rewarding work that should be read by anyone who wants to think about what is at stake in the scientific exploration of sexual orientation.\"{{sfn|Appiah|2002|page=151}} ''The Diversity Factor'' described the book as a \"masterfully argued study\". It credited Stein with providing a comprehensive overview of approaches to sexual orientation, showing the relevance of the idea of natural kinds to understanding sexual orientation, showing the methodological flaws of scientific studies on homosexuals and making useful suggestions for improved research. It agreed with Stein that gay rights should not depend on whether homosexuality is biological in origin and that it is important to consider the social effects of scientific research on the subject.{{sfn|''The Diversity Factor''|2000|pages=39\u201340}}\n\nNussbaum wrote that the book \"will advance the public debate about homosexuality and the law\" and praised its \"rigor and clarity, its wide-ranging and ingenious arguments, and its accessible style.\" However, she also found Stein's account of natural kinds, and hence also the debate over social constructionism, unclear. She maintained that the \"issue of natural human kinds\" is less important to the legal and ethical questions surrounding sexual orientation than Stein suggests.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2002|pages=316\u2013334}} Hacking called the book an \"encyclopedic study\", \"an authoritative history of twentieth century scientific approaches to sexual orientations\", and \"a rich body of analysis, distinctions and arguments.\" He credited Stein with being the first philosopher to expose the confusions involved in asking whether homosexuality is a natural kind. However, he criticized Stein for defining natural kinds through reference to Putnam's work, questioning his use of Putnam. He also found some of Stein's claims about natural kinds confusing, and questioned the idea of the natural kind was useful for Stein\u2019s purposes, Stein's use of his ideas, as well as his uses of the terms \"essentialism\" and \"constructionism\".{{sfn|Hacking|2002|pages=95\u2013107}} Stein replied to Nussbaum and Hacking, writing that while they both claimed that he believes that the question of whether sexual orientations are natural human kinds is relevant to ethical and legal issues, he sees no such connection.{{sfn|Stein|2002|pages=349\u2013353}}\n\nGediman and Abbott called the book \"refreshingly daring\", but criticized Stein for his writing style and for separating his review of scientific and psychological research on sexual orientation from his discussion of the philosophical and ethical issues surrounding it. They believed some readers would find the book tedious. They complimented Stein for questioning the desirability of scientific research on sexual orientation, but concluded that, \"he so frequently refrains from taking sides that his analysis raises more questions than it answers.\"{{sfn|Gediman|Abbott|1999|page=63}} Zicklin maintained that Stein succeeded in \"demonstrating the problematic epistemological and scientific status\" of the concept of sexual orientation, but in the process tested \"the reader's ability to follow an all-too-closely reasoned argument\". While he found Stein's goal of diminishing \"the cultural and psychological significance of the gender of one's sexual partner\" laudable, he wrote that it \"cannot be accomplished by simply analyzing the concept of sexual orientation.\" He criticized Stein for claiming to have eliminated cultural presumptions associated with the concept of sexual orientation, arguing that this was impossible \"given how densely this concept is woven into our culture.\" He concluded that a better approach would be to abandon the concept of sexual orientation entirely and \"publicize the moral bankruptcy of research into the etiology of homosexuality.\"{{sfn|Zicklin|2002|pages=1207\u20131216}}\n\nGrasswick called the book an ambitious attempt \"to delve into the difficulties of executing and assessing scientific research on sex and sexuality.\" However, she wrote that while Stein endorsed a \"multiple-origins\" model of sexual orientation in which biological factors played only an indirect role, he did little to develop the framework of such a theory. She commented that \"in the course of strategically accepting and working with\" a framework that involves \"dualisms of nature/nurture, essentialism/constructivism, and science/ethics ... Stein leaves himself little room to explore the interactive complexities that his own analysis seems to point toward.\"{{sfn|Grasswick|2004|pages=203\u2013208}}\n\nHemmes found the book informative, but also poorly written. He accused Stein of writing in \"too much detail\" and of presenting \"tortuous examples\".{{sfn|Hemmes|2000|pages=28\u201329}} Murphy considered the book poorly written, writing that parts of it resembled an \"ossified philosophical dialogue.\" He criticized Stein for providing an \"overlong discussion of possible views about the nature of sexual orientation.\" He summarized Stein as maintaining that \"there are methodological and evidentiary problems in the contemporary science of sexual orientation\" and that \"there is insufficient reason to think that sexual orientations are natural kinds\", agreeing with both points. However, he disagreed with the idea \"that sexual orientations are purely social inventions.\" He found Stein's point that sexual orientation research is irrelevant to most ethical questions correct but unoriginal, and his discussion of whether it should be restricted to avoid harm to gay people unsatisfactory. He also denied the book's originality, finding nothing in it unprecedented in the philosophy of science.{{sfn|Murphy|2000|pages=376\u2013378}}\n\nHershberger wrote that while Stein argued that there is no conclusive evidence that sexual orientation is biologically determined, the evidence was in fact \"overwhelming\". He faulted Stein for criticizing only a limited number of scientific studies, ignoring \"others that could only rationally have a biological interpretation\", adding that LeVay had already answered the criticisms that had been directed against his study. He was unconvinced by Stein's criticisms of the concept of sexual orientation, and wrote that Stein wrongly elevated philosophical reasoning above empirical fact. He found the book well-written, and agreed that arguments for gay rights should not be based on scientific findings.{{sfn|Hershberger|2000|pages=437\u2013438}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry]]''\n* ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]''\n* ''[[Virtually Normal]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n;Books\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Corvino|first1=John |title=What's Wrong With Homosexuality? |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-985631-2 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Lancaster|first1=Roger N. |title=The Trouble with Nature: Sex in Science and Popular Culture |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |location=Berkeley |year=2003 |isbn=978-0520236202 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Stein |first1=Edward |title=The Mismeasure of Desire: The Science, Theory, and Ethics of Sexual Orientation |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1999 |isbn=0-19-514244-6 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mismeasureofdesi00stei_0 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n;Journals\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |title=The Mismeasure of Desire (book) |last1=Appiah|first1=Kwame Anthony |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=2002 |doi=10.1300/J082v42n01_08 |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Blinded by science |last1=Bronski|first1=Michael |journal=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |volume= |issue=804 |year=2000 |doi= |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=The Science of Sexual Desire |last1=Cohler|first1=Bertram J. |journal=[[Journal of Sex Research]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |year=2000 |doi= |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=Book Reviews |last1=Corvino|first1=John |journal=[[The Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=52 |issue=208 |year=2002 |doi= |ref=harv}} {{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}}\n* {{cite journal |title=The mismeasure of desire (Book Review) |last1=Croissant|first1=J.

Their original line-up consisted of lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]], guitarist and singer [[Pete Townshend]], bass guitarist [[John Entwistle]] and drummer [[Keith Moon]]. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th&nbsp;century, selling over [[List of best-selling music artists|100 million records worldwide]].\n\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the [[pop art]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod movements]], featuring [[auto-destructive art]] by [[Instrument destruction|destroying guitars and drums]] on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", reached the UK top&nbsp;ten, and was followed by a string of singles including \"[[My Generation]]\", \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\" and \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\". In 1967, they performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and released the US top&nbsp;ten single \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', included the single \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at [[Woodstock]] in August 1969, and the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] in 1970, along with the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' in 1970, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to ''Tommy'', ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's ''[[Who's Next]]'', which included the hit \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\". The group released the album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation of ''Tommy'']] in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of ''[[Who Are You]]'' in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\n\n[[Kenney Jones]] replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a [[Quadrophenia (film)|film adaptation of ''Quadrophenia'']] and the retrospective documentary ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as [[Live Aid]] in 1985, a 25th&nbsp;anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996\u20131997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer [[Zak Starkey]]. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' in 2006, and continue to play live regularly, with Starkey,  bassists [[Pino Palladino]] (2006\u20132017) and [[Jon Button]] (2017\u2013present), and guitarist [[Simon Townshend]] (Pete's brother) serving as touring players. In 2019, they [[Moving On! Tour|toured with a complete symphony orchestra]], which also supported the release of [[Who (album)|''Who'']], their twelfth album.\n\nThe Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the [[Marshall stack]], large [[public address system|PA systems]], use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, Townshend's [[Guitar feedback|feedback]] and [[power chord]] guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:TVU Campus St Marys Road.jpg|thumb|[[Pete Townshend]] attended [[Ealing Art College]] (pictured in 2010), and his experience there contributed to the Who's career.|alt=Photograph of Ealing Art College in 2010]]\n\nThe founder members of the Who, [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Entwistle]], grew up in [[Acton, London]] and went to [[Acton High School|Acton County Grammar School]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=13, 19, 24}} Townshend's father, [[Cliff Townshend|Cliff]], played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the [[Royal Air Force]] during World War II, and both supported their son's interest in [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=15\u201316}} Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a [[trad jazz]] group;{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} Entwistle also played [[French horn]] in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired [[Cliff Richard]]'s d\u00e9but single, \"[[Move It]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of [[Duane Eddy]]. He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} After Acton County, Townshend attended [[Ealing Art College]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=20}} a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}}\n\nDaltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from [[Shepherd's Bush]], a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=14}} He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=31}}\n\nDaltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals.  The band played instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=19}} Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by [[Doug Sandom]], though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nDawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} and after being briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, Daltrey moved to lead vocals. Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act. The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]], and [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]]. The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, [[Mick Green]], who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style.  Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} playing melodies.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=65}} In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours and changed their name.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend and his room-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including \"No One\" and \"the Group\". Townshend preferred \"the Hair\", and Barnes liked \"the Who\" because it \"had a pop punch\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=65}} Daltrey chose \"the Who\" the next morning.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}\n\n===1964\u20131978===\n====Early career====\n[[File:Quadrophenia exhibit 2.jpg|alt=Several scooters on a display|thumb|The Who's aesthetic grew out of [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] with its high fashion, scooters for transport, and shaggy hairstyles.]]\nBy the time the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=68}} They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for [[Fontana Records]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=70}} Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nDuring a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon. Moon grew up in [[Wembley]], and had been drumming in bands since 1961.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}} He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=73}} Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nThe Who changed managers to [[Peter Meaden]]. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing [[mod (subculture)|mod]] movement in Britain which involved fashion, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and music genres such as [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[beat music|beat]].

The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=125}} and [[auto-destructive art]] became a feature of the Who's live set.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=126}}\n\n====First singles and ''My Generation''====\nBy late&nbsp;1964, the Who were becoming popular in London's [[Marquee Club]], and a rave review of their live act appeared in ''[[Melody Maker]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=134}} Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer [[Shel Talmy]], who had produced [[the Kinks]]. Townshend had written a song, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} and sold the recording to the US arm of [[Decca Records]], which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on [[Brunswick Records]], one of UK Decca's labels for US artists.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=151\u2013152}} \"I Can't Explain\" was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in [[Marble Arch]] with [[The Ivy League (band)|the Ivy League]] on backing vocals, and [[Jimmy Page]] played [[fuzz guitar]] on the B-side, \"Bald Headed Woman\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}}\n[[File:The Who in 1965.png|left|thumb|The group pictured in 1965]]\n\"I Can't Explain\" became popular with [[pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=152}} Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and [[BBC Radio]] played little pop music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=100}} The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''<ref name=\"eder\"/> Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding \"typical teens\", and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club.<ref name=\"carr\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Kids are Alright (soundtrack)|publisher=Polydor|year=1979|first=Roy|last=Carr}}</ref> Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} The follow-up single, \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\", by Townshend and Daltrey,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} features guitar noises such as [[Pick slide|pick sliding]], toggle switching{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=58}} and [[audio feedback|feedback]], which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top&nbsp;10 in the UK{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} and was used as the theme song to ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=57}}\n\nThe transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&B covers went unreleased.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=121}} The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the [[West End of London]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=126}} The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's [[amphetamine]]s down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=93}} but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted [[Richard Cole]] as a roadie.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=130\u2013132}}\n{{Listen|filename=My Generation sample.ogg|title=\"My Generation\"|description=\"[[My Generation]]\" includes the line \"Hope I die before I get old\".}}\nThe next single, \"[[My Generation]]\", followed in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal [[stutter]] to simulate the speech of a mod on [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]], and two [[Modulation (music)|key changes]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=182}} Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics \"Hope I die before I get old\" were not meant to be taken literally.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=x}} Peaking at No.&nbsp;2, \"My Generation\" is the group's highest-charting single in the UK.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} The self-titled debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and \"[[The Kids Are Alright (song)|The Kids Are Alright]]\", the album has several [[James Brown]] covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-who-sings-my-generation-mw0000020578|title=My Generation&nbsp;\u2013 review|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|website=AllMusic|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''My Generation'', the Who fell out with Talmy, which meant an abrupt end to their recording contract. {{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=199}} The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=108}} The Who were signed to [[Robert Stigwood]]'s label, Reaction, and released \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\". Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of [[the Rolling Stones]]'s \"[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]\". It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic [[twelve-string guitar]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=200\u2013201}} Talmy took legal action over the B-side, \"Instant Party\", and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, \"Waltz for a Pig\", was recorded by the [[Graham Bond|Graham Bond Organisation]] under the pseudonym \"the Who Orchestra\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=203}}\n\nIn 1966 the Who released \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called ''Quads'';{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\";{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=109}} and an EP, ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'', that tied in with their regular appearances on ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=218}} The group continued to have conflict; on 20 May, Moon and Entwistle were late to a gig having been on the ''Ready Steady Go!'' set with [[The Beach Boys]]' [[Bruce Johnston]]. During \"My Generation\", Townshend attacked Moon with his guitar; Moon suffered a black eye and bruises, and he and Entwistle left the band, but changed their minds and rejoined a week later.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=160}} Moon kept looking for other work, and [[Jeff Beck]] had him play drums on his song \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" (with Page, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and [[Nicky Hopkins]]) because he was \"trying to get Keith out of the Who\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=175}}\n\n====''A Quick One'' and ''The Who Sell Out''====\n[[File:Roger Daltrey -left and Keith Moon-right 1967.jpg|thumb|left|Roger Daltrey (left) and Keith Moon, 1967|alt=Roger Daltrey and Keith Moon backstage in 1967]]\n\nTo alleviate financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" and \"Whiskey Man\" and found a niche role as second songwriter.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=225}} The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\". The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven. The album was titled ''A Quick One''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} (''Happy Jack'' in the US),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-quick-one-happy-jack-mw0000197244|title=A Quick One (Happy Jack)|first=Ritchie|last=Unterberger|website=AllMusic|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> and reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK charts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=229}} It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}}\n\nBy 1966, ''Ready Steady Go!'' had ended, the mod movement was becoming unfashionable, and the Who found themselves in competition on the London circuit with groups including [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=239\u2013240}} Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter [[Frank Barsalona]] for a short package tour in New York.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=243}} The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} and led to their first major US appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the [[hippie]] movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act,{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=188}} and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with the Who winning the argument.{{sfn|McMichael|Lyons|1998|p=223}} The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full [[Marshall stack]]. According to biographer [[Tony Fletcher]], Hendrix sounded \"so much better than the Who it was embarrassing\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and \"Happy Jack\" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}}\n\nThe group followed Monterey with a US tour supporting [[Herman's Hermits]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} The Hermits were a straightforward pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes. They bonded with Moon,{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=193}} who was excited to learn that [[cherry bomb]]s were legal to purchase in Alabama. Moon acquired a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} with a particular interest in blowing up toilets. Entwistle said the first cherry bomb they tried \"blew a hole in the suitcase ''and'' the chair\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: \"[A]ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} After a gig in [[Flint, Michigan]] on Moon's 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=197}} Daltrey later said that the tour brought the band closer, and as the support act, they could turn up and perform a short show without any major responsibilities.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=266}}\n\n[[File:John Entwistle in 1967 with The Who.jpg|thumb|John Entwistle backstage in 1967|alt=John Entwistle backstage with a bass guitar]]\nAfter the Hermits tour, the Who recorded their next single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", which Townshend had written in 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=273}}  Townshend called it \"the ultimate Who record\",{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} and was disappointed it reached only No.&nbsp;10 in the UK.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.&nbsp;9.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}} The group toured the US again with [[The Animals|Eric Burdon and the Animals]], including an appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', miming to \"I Can See For Miles\" and \"My Generation\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=275}} Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by flying cymbal shrapnel. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\nThe next album was ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''\u2014a [[concept album]] paying tribute to pirate radio, which had been outlawed in August 1967 by the [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]]. It included humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=148\u2013149}} a mini [[rock opera]] called \"Rael\", and \"I Can See For Miles\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} The Who declared themselves a [[pop art]] group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded a wide variety of radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the [[American Cancer Society]], in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture.{{sfn|DiPerna|1994|pp=44, 47}} Townshend stated, \"We don't change offstage. We live pop art.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=67}}\n\nLater that year, Lambert and Stamp formed a record label, [[Track Records]], with distribution by [[Polydor]]. As well as signing Hendrix, Track became the imprint for all the Who's UK output until the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=250}}\n\nThe group started 1968 by touring Australia and New Zealand with the [[Small Faces]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=196}} The groups had trouble with the local authorities and the ''New Zealand Truth'' called them \"unwashed, foul-smelling, booze-swilling no-hopers\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=293}}{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=180}} After an incident that took place on a flight to [[Sydney]], the band were briefly arrested in [[Melbourne]] and then forced to leave the country; [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Gorton]] sent a telegram to The Who telling them never to return to Australia.{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=142}} The Who would not return to Australia again until 2004.

The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing.

Their original line-up consisted of lead singer [[Roger Daltrey]], guitarist and singer [[Pete Townshend]], bass guitarist [[John Entwistle]] and drummer [[Keith Moon]]. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th&nbsp;century, selling over [[List of best-selling music artists|100 million records worldwide]].\n\nThe Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the [[pop art]] and [[mod (subculture)|mod movements]], featuring [[auto-destructive art]] by [[Instrument destruction|destroying guitars and drums]] on stage. Their first single as the Who, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", reached the UK top&nbsp;ten, and was followed by a string of singles including \"[[My Generation]]\", \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\" and \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\". In 1967, they performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] and released the US top&nbsp;ten single \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", while touring extensively. The group's fourth album, 1969's [[rock opera]] ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', included the single \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" and was a critical and commercial success. Live appearances at [[Woodstock]] in August 1969, and the [[Isle of Wight Festival]] in 1970, along with the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' in 1970, cemented their reputation as a respected rock act. With their success came increased pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to ''Tommy'', ''[[Lifehouse (rock opera)|Lifehouse]]'', was abandoned. Songs from the project made up 1971's ''[[Who's Next]]'', which included the hit \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\". The group released the album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'' in 1973 as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film adaptation of ''Tommy'']] in 1975. They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of ''[[Who Are You]]'' in 1978 was overshadowed by the death of Moon shortly after.\n\n[[Kenney Jones]] replaced Moon and the group resumed activity, releasing a [[Quadrophenia (film)|film adaptation of ''Quadrophenia'']] and the retrospective documentary ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''. After Townshend became weary of touring, the group split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as [[Live Aid]] in 1985, a 25th&nbsp;anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of ''Quadrophenia'' in 1996\u20131997. They resumed regular touring in 1999, with drummer [[Zak Starkey]]. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed. Townshend and Daltrey continued as the Who, releasing ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' in 2006, and continue to play live regularly, with Starkey,  bassists [[Pino Palladino]] (2006\u20132017) and [[Jon Button]] (2017\u2013present), and guitarist [[Simon Townshend]] (Pete's brother) serving as touring players. In 2019, they [[Moving On! Tour|toured with a complete symphony orchestra]], which also supported the release of [[Who (album)|''Who'']], their twelfth album.\n\nThe Who's major contributions to rock music include the development of the [[Marshall stack]], large [[public address system|PA systems]], use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's lead playing styles, Townshend's [[Guitar feedback|feedback]] and [[power chord]] guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by [[hard rock]], [[punk rock]] and mod bands, and their songs still receive regular exposure.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:TVU Campus St Marys Road.jpg|thumb|[[Pete Townshend]] attended [[Ealing Art College]] (pictured in 2010), and his experience there contributed to the Who's career.|alt=Photograph of Ealing Art College in 2010]]\n\nThe founder members of the Who, [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Entwistle]], grew up in [[Acton, London]] and went to [[Acton High School|Acton County Grammar School]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=13, 19, 24}} Townshend's father, [[Cliff Townshend|Cliff]], played saxophone and his mother, Betty, had sung in the entertainment division of the [[Royal Air Force]] during World War II, and both supported their son's interest in [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=15\u201316}} Townshend and Entwistle became friends in their second year of Acton County, and formed a [[trad jazz]] group;{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=26}} Entwistle also played [[French horn]] in the Middlesex Schools' Symphony Orchestra. Both were interested in rock, and Townshend particularly admired [[Cliff Richard]]'s d\u00e9but single, \"[[Move It]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} Entwistle moved to guitar, but struggled with it due to his large fingers, and moved to bass on hearing the guitar work of [[Duane Eddy]]. He was unable to afford a bass and built one at home.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=29}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=17}} After Acton County, Townshend attended [[Ealing Art College]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=20}} a move he later described as profoundly influential on the course of the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}}\n\nDaltrey, who was in the year above, had moved to Acton from [[Shepherd's Bush]], a more working-class area. He had trouble fitting in at the school, and discovered gangs and rock and roll.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=14}} He was expelled at 15 and found work on a building site.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=11}} In 1959 he started the Detours, the band that was to evolve into the Who. The band played professional gigs, such as corporate and wedding functions, and Daltrey kept a close eye on the finances as well as the music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=31}}\n\nDaltrey spotted Entwistle by chance on the street carrying a bass and recruited him into the Detours.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} In mid-1961, Entwistle suggested Townshend as a guitarist,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=18}} Daltrey on lead guitar, Entwistle on bass, Harry Wilson on drums, and Colin Dawson on vocals.  The band played instrumentals by [[the Shadows]] and [[the Ventures]], and a variety of pop and trad jazz covers.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=19}} Daltrey was considered the leader and, according to Townshend, \"ran things the way he wanted them\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} Wilson was fired in mid-1962 and replaced by [[Doug Sandom]], though he was older than the rest of the band, married, and a more proficient musician, having been playing semi-professionally for two years.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nDawson left after frequently arguing with Daltrey{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=22}} and after being briefly replaced by Gabby Connolly, Daltrey moved to lead vocals. Townshend, with Entwistle's encouragement, became the sole guitarist. Through Townshend's mother, the group obtained a management contract with local promoter Robert Druce,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=21}} who started booking the band as a support act. The Detours were influenced by the bands they supported, including [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], [[Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers]], [[Shane Fenton and the Fentones]], and [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]]. The Detours were particularly interested in the Pirates as they also only had one guitarist, [[Mick Green]], who inspired Townshend to combine rhythm and lead guitar in his style.  Entwistle's bass became more of a lead instrument,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=24}} playing melodies.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=65}} In February 1964, the Detours became aware of the group Johnny Devlin and the Detours and changed their name.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=26}} Townshend and his room-mate Richard Barnes spent a night considering names, focusing on a theme of joke announcements, including \"No One\" and \"the Group\". Townshend preferred \"the Hair\", and Barnes liked \"the Who\" because it \"had a pop punch\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=65}} Daltrey chose \"the Who\" the next morning.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=66}}\n\n===1964\u20131978===\n====Early career====\n[[File:Quadrophenia exhibit 2.jpg|alt=Several scooters on a display|thumb|The Who's aesthetic grew out of [[Mod (subculture)|mod subculture]] with its high fashion, scooters for transport, and shaggy hairstyles.]]\nBy the time the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, including at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=68}} They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for [[Fontana Records]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=70}} Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately turned on him and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not speak to each other again for 14 years.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nDuring a gig with a stand-in drummer in late April at the Oldfield, the band first met Keith Moon. Moon grew up in [[Wembley]], and had been drumming in bands since 1961.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=29}} He was performing with a semi-professional band called the Beachcombers, and wanted to play full-time.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=80}} Moon played a few songs with the group, breaking a bass drum pedal and tearing a drum skin. The band were impressed with his energy and enthusiasm, and offered him the job.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=73}} Moon performed with the Beachcombers a few more times, but dates clashed and he chose to devote himself to the Who. The Beachcombers auditioned Sandom, but were unimpressed and did not ask him to join.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=80\u201381}}\n\nThe Who changed managers to [[Peter Meaden]]. He decided that the group would be ideal to represent the growing [[mod (subculture)|mod]] movement in Britain which involved fashion, [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] and music genres such as [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[beat music|beat]]. He renamed the group the High Numbers, dressed them up in mod clothes,<ref name=\"eder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-who-mn0000577627/biography|title=The Who&nbsp;\u2013 biography|first=Bruce|last=Eder|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> secured a second, more favourable audition with Fontana and wrote the lyrics for both sides of their single \"[[Zoot Suit/I'm the Face|Zoot Suit\"/\"I'm the Face]]\" to appeal to mods. The tune for \"Zoot Suit\" was \"Misery\" by the Dynamics,<ref>{{cite book|title=Icons of Rock|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=240|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8}}</ref> and \"I'm the Face\" borrowed from [[Slim Harpo]]'s \"I Got Love If You Want It\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=91\u201392}} Although Meaden tried to promote the single, it failed to reach the top 50{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=54}} and the band reverted to calling themselves the Who.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}} The group -none of whom played their instruments conventionally<ref name=\"The Secret Jewish History of The Who\">{{Cite web |url=https://forward.com/culture/music/434550/whos-jewish/ |title=The Secret Jewish History of The Who |last=Rogovoy |first=Seth |date=2019-11-12 |website=The Forward |access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref> - began to improve their stage image; Daltrey started using his microphone cable as a [[whip]] on stage, and occasionally leapt into the crowd; Moon threw drumsticks into the air mid-beat; Townshend mimed machine-gunning the crowd with his guitar while jumping on stage and playing guitar with a fast arm-windmilling motion,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=120}} or stood with his arms aloft allowing his guitar to produce feedback in a posture dubbed \"the Bird Man\".{{sfn|DiPerna|1994|p=44}}\n\nMeaden was replaced as manager by two filmmakers, [[Kit Lambert]] and [[Chris Stamp]].

MSNBC. Retrieved 23 November 2012</ref> Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, then picked up another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=125}} and [[auto-destructive art]] became a feature of the Who's live set.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=126}}\n\n====First singles and ''My Generation''====\nBy late&nbsp;1964, the Who were becoming popular in London's [[Marquee Club]], and a rave review of their live act appeared in ''[[Melody Maker]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=134}} Lambert and Stamp attracted the attention of the American producer [[Shel Talmy]], who had produced [[the Kinks]]. Townshend had written a song, \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", that deliberately sounded like the Kinks to attract Talmy's attention. Talmy saw the group in rehearsals and was impressed. He signed them to his production company,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} and sold the recording to the US arm of [[Decca Records]], which meant that the group's early singles were released in Britain on [[Brunswick Records]], one of UK Decca's labels for US artists.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=151\u2013152}} \"I Can't Explain\" was recorded in early November 1964 at Pye Studios in [[Marble Arch]] with [[The Ivy League (band)|the Ivy League]] on backing vocals, and [[Jimmy Page]] played [[fuzz guitar]] on the B-side, \"Bald Headed Woman\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=60}}\n[[File:The Who in 1965.png|left|thumb|The group pictured in 1965.]]\n\"I Can't Explain\" became popular with [[pirate radio in the United Kingdom|pirate radio]] stations such as [[Radio Caroline]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=152}} Pirate radio was important for bands as there were no commercial radio stations in the UK and [[BBC Radio]] played little pop music.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=100}} The group gained further exposure when they appeared on the television programme ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]''<ref name=\"eder\"/> Lambert and Stamp were tasked with finding \"typical teens\", and invited the group's regular audience from the Goldhawk Social Club.<ref name=\"carr\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Kids are Alright (soundtrack)|publisher=Polydor|year=1979|first=Roy|last=Carr}}</ref> Enthusiastic reception on television and regular airplay on pirate radio helped the single slowly climb the charts in early 1965 until it reached the top 10.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} The follow-up single, \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\", by Townshend and Daltrey,{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} features guitar noises such as [[Pick slide|pick sliding]], toggle switching{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=58}} and [[audio feedback|feedback]], which was so unconventional that it was initially rejected by the US arm of Decca. The single reached the top&nbsp;10 in the UK{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=107\u2013108}} and was used as the theme song to ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Aledort|1994|p=57}}\n\nThe transition to a hit-making band with original material, encouraged by Lambert, did not sit well with Daltrey, and a recording session of R&B covers went unreleased.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=121}} The Who were not close friends either, apart from Moon and Entwistle, who enjoyed visiting nightclubs together in the [[West End of London]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=126}} The group experienced a difficult time when touring Denmark in September, which culminated in Daltrey throwing Moon's [[amphetamine]]s down the toilet and assaulting him. Immediately on returning to Britain, Daltrey was sacked,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=93}} but was reinstated on the condition that the group became a democracy without his dominant leadership. At this time, the group enlisted [[Richard Cole]] as a roadie.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=130\u2013132}}\n{{Listen|filename=My Generation sample.ogg|title=\"My Generation\"|description=\"[[My Generation]]\" includes the line \"Hope I die before I get old\".}}\nThe next single, \"[[My Generation]]\", followed in October. Townshend had written it as a slow blues, but after several abortive attempts, it was turned into a more powerful song with a bass solo from Entwistle. The song used gimmicks such as a vocal [[stutter]] to simulate the speech of a mod on [[substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]], and two [[Modulation (music)|key changes]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=182}} Townshend insisted in interviews that the lyrics \"Hope I die before I get old\" were not meant to be taken literally.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=x}} Peaking at No.&nbsp;2, \"My Generation\" is the group's highest-charting single in the UK.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=419}} The self-titled debut album ''[[My Generation (album)|My Generation]]'' was released in late 1965. Among original material by Townshend, including the title track and \"[[The Kids Are Alright (song)|The Kids Are Alright]]\", the album has several [[James Brown]] covers from the session earlier that year that Daltrey favoured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-who-sings-my-generation-mw0000020578|title=My Generation&nbsp;\u2013 review|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|website=AllMusic|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''My Generation'', the Who fell out with Talmy, which meant an abrupt end to their recording contract. {{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=199}} The resulting legal acrimony resulted in Talmy holding the rights to the master tapes, which prevented the album from being reissued until 2002.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=108}} The Who were signed to [[Robert Stigwood]]'s label, Reaction, and released \"[[Substitute (The Who song)|Substitute]]\". Townshend said he wrote the song about identity crisis, and as a parody of [[the Rolling Stones]]'s \"[[19th Nervous Breakdown]]\". It was the first single to feature him playing an acoustic [[twelve-string guitar]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=200\u2013201}} Talmy took legal action over the B-side, \"Instant Party\", and the single was withdrawn. A new B-side, \"Waltz for a Pig\", was recorded by the [[Graham Bond|Graham Bond Organisation]] under the pseudonym \"the Who Orchestra\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=203}}\n\nIn 1966 the Who released \"[[I'm a Boy]]\", about a boy dressed as a girl, taken from an abortive collection of songs called ''Quads'';{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} \"[[Happy Jack (song)|Happy Jack]]\";{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=109}} and an EP, ''[[Ready Steady Who]]'', that tied in with their regular appearances on ''Ready Steady Go!''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=218}} The group continued to have conflict; on 20 May, Moon and Entwistle were late to a gig having been on the ''Ready Steady Go!'' set with [[The Beach Boys]]' [[Bruce Johnston]]. During \"My Generation\", Townshend attacked Moon with his guitar; Moon suffered a black eye and bruises, and he and Entwistle left the band, but changed their minds and rejoined a week later.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=160}} Moon kept looking for other work, and [[Jeff Beck]] had him play drums on his song \"[[Beck's Bolero]]\" (with Page, [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] and [[Nicky Hopkins]]) because he was \"trying to get Keith out of the Who\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=175}}\n\n====''A Quick One'' and ''The Who Sell Out''====\n[[File:Roger Daltrey -left and Keith Moon-right 1967.jpg|thumb|left|Roger Daltrey (left) and Keith Moon, 1967|alt=Roger Daltrey and Keith Moon backstage in 1967]]\n\nTo alleviate financial pressure on the band, Lambert arranged a song-writing deal which required each member to write two songs for the next album. Entwistle contributed \"[[Boris the Spider]]\" and \"Whiskey Man\" and found a niche role as second songwriter.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=225}} The band found they needed to fill an extra ten minutes, and Lambert encouraged Townshend to write a longer piece, \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\". The suite of song fragments is about a girl who has an affair while her lover is away, but is ultimately forgiven. The album was titled ''A Quick One''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} (''Happy Jack'' in the US),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-quick-one-happy-jack-mw0000197244|title=A Quick One (Happy Jack)|first=Ritchie|last=Unterberger|website=AllMusic|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> and reached No.&nbsp;4 in the UK charts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=229}} It was followed in 1967 by the UK Top 5 single \"[[Pictures of Lily]]\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}}\n\nBy 1966, ''Ready Steady Go!'' had ended, the mod movement was becoming unfashionable, and the Who found themselves in competition on the London circuit with groups including [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=239\u2013240}} Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group's future, and arranged a deal with promoter [[Frank Barsalona]] for a short package tour in New York.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=243}} The group's performances, which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums, were well received,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} and led to their first major US appearance at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]]. The group, especially Moon, were not fond of the [[hippie]] movement, and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival. Hendrix was also on the bill, and was also going to smash his guitar on stage. Townshend verbally abused Hendrix and accused him of stealing his act,{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=188}} and the pair argued about who should go on stage first, with the Who winning the argument.{{sfn|McMichael|Lyons|1998|p=223}} The Who brought hired equipment to the festival; Hendrix shipped over his regular touring gear from Britain, including a full [[Marshall stack]]. According to biographer [[Tony Fletcher]], Hendrix sounded \"so much better than the Who it was embarrassing\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} The Who's appearance at Monterey gave them recognition in the US, and \"Happy Jack\" reached the top 30.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}}\n\nThe group followed Monterey with a US tour supporting [[Herman's Hermits]].{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=189}} The Hermits were a straightforward pop band and enjoyed drugs and practical jokes. They bonded with Moon,{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=193}} who was excited to learn that [[cherry bomb]]s were legal to purchase in Alabama. Moon acquired a reputation of destroying hotel rooms while on tour,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} with a particular interest in blowing up toilets. Entwistle said the first cherry bomb they tried \"blew a hole in the suitcase ''and'' the chair\".{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} Moon recalled his first attempt to flush one down the toilet: \"[A]ll that porcelain flying through the air was quite unforgettable. I never realised dynamite was so powerful.\"{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=194}} After a gig in [[Flint, Michigan]] on Moon's 21st birthday on 23 August 1967, the entourage caused $24,000 of damage at the hotel, and Moon knocked out one of his front teeth.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=197}} Daltrey later said that the tour brought the band closer, and as the support act, they could turn up and perform a short show without any major responsibilities.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=266}}\n\n[[File:John Entwistle in 1967 with The Who.jpg|thumb|John Entwistle backstage in 1967|alt=John Entwistle backstage with a bass guitar]]\nAfter the Hermits tour, the Who recorded their next single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", which Townshend had written in 1966 but had avoided recording until he was sure it could be produced well.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=273}}  Townshend called it \"the ultimate Who record\",{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} and was disappointed it reached only No.&nbsp;10 in the UK.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} It became their best selling single in the US, reaching No.&nbsp;9.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=420}} The group toured the US again with [[The Animals|Eric Burdon and the Animals]], including an appearance on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'', miming to \"I Can See For Miles\" and \"My Generation\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=275}} Moon bribed a stage hand to put explosives in his drum kit, who loaded it with ten times the expected quantity. The resulting detonation threw Moon off his drum riser and his arm was cut by flying cymbal shrapnel. Townshend's hair was singed and his left ear left ringing, and a camera and studio monitor were destroyed.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\nThe next album was ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''\u2014a [[concept album]] paying tribute to pirate radio, which had been outlawed in August 1967 by the [[Marine, &c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]]. It included humorous jingles and mock commercials between songs,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=148\u2013149}} a mini [[rock opera]] called \"Rael\", and \"I Can See For Miles\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=149}} The Who declared themselves a [[pop art]] group and thus viewed advertising as an artform; they recorded a wide variety of radio advertisements, such as for canned milkshakes and the [[American Cancer Society]], in defiance of the rising anti-consumerist ethos of the hippie counterculture.{{sfn|DiPerna|1994|pp=44, 47}} Townshend stated, \"We don't change offstage. We live pop art.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=67}}\n\nLater that year, Lambert and Stamp formed a record label, [[Track Records]], with distribution by [[Polydor]]. As well as signing Hendrix, Track became the imprint for all the Who's UK output until the mid-1970s.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=250}}\n\nThe group started 1968 by touring Australia and New Zealand with the [[Small Faces]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=196}} The groups had trouble with the local authorities and the ''New Zealand Truth'' called them \"unwashed, foul-smelling, booze-swilling no-hopers\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=293}}{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=180}} After an incident that took place on a flight to [[Sydney]], the band were briefly arrested in [[Melbourne]] and then forced to leave the country; [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Gorton]] sent a telegram to The Who telling them never to return to Australia.{{sfn|Townshend|2012|p=142}} The Who would not return to Australia again until 2004. They continued to tour across the US and Canada during the first half of the year.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=190}}\n\n====''Tommy'', Woodstock and ''Live at Leeds''====\n[[File:Leeds University refectory stage circa 2019.jpg|thumb|Leeds University refectory stage circa 2019]]\nBy 1968 the Who had started to attract attention in the [[underground press]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=191}} Townshend had stopped using drugs and became interested in the teachings of [[Meher Baba]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} In August, he gave an interview to ''Rolling Stone'' editor [[Jann Wenner]] describing in detail the plot of a new album project and its relationship to Baba's teachings. The album went through several names during recording, including ''Deaf Dumb and Blind Boy'' and ''Amazing Journey''; Townshend settled on ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]''{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=317}} for the album about the life of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and his attempt to communicate with others.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=314\u2013315}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/petetownshend/articles/story/9306658/the_rolling_stone_interview_pete_townshend |title=The Rolling Stone Interview: Pete Townshend |date=28 September 1968 |first=Jann |last=Wenner |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401071039/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/petetownshend/articles/story/9306658/the_rolling_stone_interview_pete_townshend |archivedate=1 April 2009 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> Some songs, such as \"Welcome\" and \"Amazing Journey\" were inspired by Baba's teaching,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=320}} and others came from observations within the band. \"Sally Simpson\" is about a fan who tried to climb on stage at a gig by [[the Doors]] that they attended{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=316}} and \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" was written so that ''New York Times'' journalist [[Nik Cohn]], a pinball enthusiast, would give the album a good review.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=221}} Townshend later said, \"I wanted the story of ''Tommy'' to have several levels&nbsp;... a rock singles level and a bigger concept level\", containing the spiritual message he wanted as well as being entertaining.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} The album was projected for a Christmas 1968 release{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} but recording stalled after Townshend decided to make a [[double album]] to cover the story in sufficient depth.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}\n\nBy the end of the year, 18 months of touring had led to a well-rehearsed and tight live band, which was evident when they performed \"A Quick One While He's Away\" at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' television special. The Stones considered their own performance lacklustre, and the project was never broadcast.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|pp=228\u2013229}} The Who had not released an album in over a year, and had not completed the recording of ''Tommy'', which continued well into 1969, interspersed with gigs at weekends.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} Lambert was a key figure in keeping the group focused and getting the album completed, and typed up a script to help them understand the story and how the songs fitted together.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=220}}\n\n[[File:Roger-Daltrey in Hamburg.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|By the time the Who were touring ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', Daltrey's stage image had changed to include long hair and open shirts.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=344}}|alt=Roger Daltrey singing on stage]]\nThe album was released in May with the accompanying single, \"Pinball Wizard\", a d\u00e9but performance at [[Ronnie Scott's]],{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=222}} and a [[Tommy Tour|tour]], playing most of the new album live.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=326}} ''Tommy'' sold 200,000 copies in the US in its first two weeks,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=223}} and was a critical smash, ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' saying, \"...&nbsp;for sheer power, invention and brilliance of performance, ''Tommy'' outstrips anything which has ever come out of a recording studio\".<ref name=\"Sanctuary\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010522/http://www.sanctuarygroup.com/index.php?page=1&l1=6&l2=10&l3=0&getArticleId=466 The Who].

Daltrey resisted Townshend's wish to add [[Joe Cocker]]'s keyboardist [[Chris Stainton]] (who played on the album) to the touring band.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=425\u2013246}} As a compromise, Townshend assembled the keyboard and synthesizer parts on backing tapes, as such a strategy had been successful with \"Baba O'Riley\" and \"Won't Get Fooled Again\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=247}} Unfortunately, the technology was not sophisticated enough to deal with the demands of the music; added to this issue, tour rehearsals had been interrupted due to an argument that culminated in Daltrey punching Townshend and knocking him out cold.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=359}} At a gig in Newcastle, the tapes completely malfunctioned, and an enraged Townshend dragged sound-man [[Bob Pridden]] on-stage, screamed at him, kicked all the amps over and partially destroyed the backing tapes.

Daltrey was grateful that the Who had saved him from a career as a sheet-metal worker and was unhappy at Townshend not playing well; Townshend felt the commitment of the group prevented him from releasing solo material.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=458}} The next album, ''[[The Who by Numbers]]'', had introspective songs from Townshend that dealt with disillusionment such as \"However Much I Booze\" and \"How Many Friends\"; they resembled his later solo work.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=460}} Entwistle's \"Success Story\" gave a humorous look at the music industry, and \"[[Squeeze Box (The Who song)|Squeeze Box]]\" was a hit single.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=364}} The group toured from October, playing little new material and few ''Quadrophenia'' numbers, and reintroducing several from ''Tommy''. The American leg of the tour began in [[Houston]] to a crowd of 18,000 at [[The Summit Arena]], and was supported by [[Toots and the Maytals]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=365}} On 6 December 1975, the Who set the record for largest indoor concert at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], attended by 78,000.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=443}} On 31 May 1976, they played a second concert at the Valley which was listed in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the world's loudest concert at over 120&nbsp;dB.<ref name=\"Sanctuary\"/> Townshend had become fed up of touring{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=473}} but Entwistle considered live performance to be at a peak.{{sfn|Fletcher|1998|p=465}}\n\n====''Who Are You'' and Moon's death====\n[[File:Daltrey and Townshend.jpg|thumb|left|Daltrey and Townshend, 21 October 1976, Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto, Ontario\u2014their last ever public gig with Moon|alt=Roger Daltrey singing and Pete Townshend singing and playing a guitar]]\n\nAfter the 1976 tour, Townshend took most of the following year off to spend time with his family.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=394}} He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager [[Allen Klein]] had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the [[Speakeasy Club|Speakeasy]] where he met [[the Sex Pistols]]' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, ''[[Who Are You]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=396}}\n\nThe group reconvened in September 1977, but Townshend announced there would be no live performances for the immediate future, a decision that Daltrey endorsed.

The only gig that year was an informal show on 15 December at the [[Gaumont State Cinema]] in [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]], London, filmed for the documentary, ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=406}} The band had not played for 14 months, and their performance was so weak that the footage was unused.

Daltrey clashed with Johns over the production of his vocals, and Moon's drumming was so poor that Daltrey and Entwistle considered firing him. Moon's playing improved, but on one track, \"Music Must Change\", he was replaced as he could not play in 6/8 time.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=496}} In May, the Who filmed another performance at Shepperton Sound Studios for ''The Kids Are Alright''. This performance was strong, and several tracks were used in the film. It was the last gig Moon performed with the Who.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=499}}\n\nThe album was released on 18 August, and became their biggest and fastest seller to date, peaking at No.&nbsp;6 in the UK and No.&nbsp;2 in the US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=430}} Instead of touring, Daltrey, Townshend and Moon did a series of promotional television interviews, and Entwistle worked on the soundtrack for ''The Kids Are Alright''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=504\u2013505}}\n\nOn 6 September, Moon attended a party held by [[Paul McCartney]] to celebrate [[Buddy Holly]]'s birthday. Returning to his flat, Moon took 32 tablets of [[clomethiazole]] which had been prescribed to combat his [[alcohol withdrawal]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=416}} He passed out the following morning and was discovered dead later that day.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=506\u2013507}}{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|p=416}}\n\n===1978\u20131983===\nThe day after Moon's death, Townshend issued the statement: \"We are more determined than ever to carry on, and we want the spirit of the group to which Keith contributed so much to go on, although no human being can ever take his place.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2009|pp=416\u2013417}} Drummer [[Phil Collins]], having a temporary break from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] after his first marriage had failed, was at a loose end and asked to replace Moon, but Townshend had already asked [[Kenney Jones]], who had previously played with the Small Faces and [[Faces (band)|Faces]].

The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared a fondness for clubbing.

{"title_page": "List of confidence tricks", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}\n[[Confidence tricks]] and scams are difficult to classify, because they change often and often contain elements of more than one type. Throughout this list, the perpetrator of the confidence trick is called the \"con artist\" or simply \"artist\", and the intended victim is the \"mark\". Particular scams are mainly directed toward elderly people, as they may be [[Credulity|credulous]] and sometimes inexperienced or insecure, especially when the scam involves modern technology such as computers and the internet. This list should not be considered complete but covers the most common examples. FYI if you want to con you gotta be as unassuming as you can\n\n==Get-rich-quick schemes==\n[[Get-rich-quick scheme]]s are extremely varied; these include fake [[franchising|franchises]], [[real estate]] \"sure things\", get-rich-quick books, wealth-building seminars, [[self-help]] gurus, sure-fire inventions, useless products, [[chain letter]]s, [[fortune-telling|fortune tellers]], [[quackery|quack]] doctors, miracle [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[foreign exchange fraud]], [[#Spanish Prisoner|Nigerian money scams]], and [[amulet|charms and talismans]]. Variations include the [[pyramid scheme]], the [[Ponzi scheme]], and the [[matrix scheme]].\n\n===The \"Money-Box Scheme\"===\n[[Victor Lustig]], a German con artist, designed and sold a \"money box\" which he claimed could print $100 bills using blank sheets of paper.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h20BCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT27&dq=victor+lustig+money+box#v=onepage&q=victor%20lustig%20money%20box&f=false|title=From Paris to Alcatraz: The true, untold story of one of the most notorious con-artists of the twentieth century - Count Victor Lustig|last=Garrett|first=Betty Jean Lustig & Nanci|date=2011-12-08|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781462893836|language=en}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} A victim, sensing huge profits and untroubled by ethical implications, would buy the machine for a high price\u2014from $25,000 to $102,000.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lustig stocked the machine with six to nine genuine $100 bills for demonstration purposes, but after that it produced only blank paper.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-smoothest-con-man-that-ever-lived-29861908/|title=The Smoothest Con Man That Ever Lived|last=King|first=Gilbert|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en}}</ref> By the time victims realized that they had been scammed, Lustig was long gone.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Salting {{anchor|Salting|Salt the mine}}===\n[[Salting (confidence trick)|Salting]] or \"salting the mine\" are terms for a scam in which [[gemstone]]s or [[gold|gold ore]] are planted in a [[mining|mine]] or on the landscape, duping the mark into purchasing shares in a worthless or non-existent mining company.<ref>Dan Plazak ''A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top'' (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-87480-840-7}}.</ref> During [[gold rush]]es, scammers would load [[shotgun]]s with gold dust and shoot into the sides of the mine to give the appearance of a rich ore, thus \"salting the mine\". Examples include the [[diamond hoax of 1872]] and the [[Bre-X]] gold fraud of the mid-1990s. This trick was featured in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', when [[Al Swearengen]] and [[E. B. Farnum]] trick Brom Garret into believing gold is to be found on the claim Swearengen intends to sell him. This con was also featured in ''[[Sneaky Pete]]''.\n\n===Spanish Prisoner{{anchor|Spanish Prisoner|Advance fee fraud|Nigerian scam}}===\nThe [[Spanish Prisoner]] scam \u2014 and its modern variant, the [[advance-fee scam]] or \"[[419 scams|Nigerian letter scam]]\" \u2014 involves enlisting the mark to aid in retrieving some stolen money from its hiding place. The victim sometimes believes he can cheat the con artists out of their money, but anyone trying this has already fallen for the essential con by believing that the money is there to steal (see also [[Black money scam]]). Note that the classic Spanish Prisoner trick also contains an element of the romance scam (see below).\n\nMany con men employ extra tricks to keep the victim from going to the [[police]]. A common ploy of investment scammers is to encourage a mark to use money concealed from tax authorities. The mark cannot go to the authorities without revealing that he has committed [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax fraud]]. Many swindles involve a minor element of crime or some other misdeed. The mark is made to think that he will gain money by helping fraudsters get huge sums out of a country (the classic advance-fee fraud/Nigerian scam); hence a mark cannot go to the police without revealing that he planned to commit a crime himself.\n\nIn a twist on the Nigerian fraud scheme, the mark is told he is helping someone overseas collect debts from corporate clients. Large [[cheque]]s stolen from businesses are mailed to the mark. These cheques are altered to reflect the mark's name, and the mark is then asked to cash them and transfer all but a percentage of the funds (his [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]) to the con artist. The cheques are often completely genuine, except that the \"pay to\" information has been expertly changed. This exposes the mark not only to enormous debt when the bank reclaims the money from his account, but also to criminal charges for [[money laundering]]. A more modern variation is to use [[laser printer|laser-printed]] counterfeit cheques with the proper bank account numbers and payer information.This scam can be seen on the film The Spanish Prisoner.\n\n==Persuasion tricks==\nPersuasion fraud, when fraudsters persuade people only to target their money, is an old-fashioned type of fraud.\n\n===Grandparent scam===\nA grandparent gets a call or e-mail from someone claiming to be their grandchild, saying that they are in trouble. For example, the scammer may claim to have been arrested and require money wired, or gift cards purchased for bail, and asks the victim not to tell the grandchild's parents, as they would \"only get upset.\" The call is fraudulent impersonation, the name of the grandchild typically obtained from [[social media]] postings as well as obituaries listed either in newspapers or from a funeral home's website. Any money [[wire transfer|wired]] out of the country is gone forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-grandparent-scam|title=Don't Let Grandparent Scam Happen to You|work=FBI}}</ref>\n\n===Romance scam===\nThe traditional [[romance scam]] has now moved into [[online dating service|Internet dating]] sites. The con actively cultivates a [[romantic love|romantic relationship]] which often involves promises of marriage. However, after some time, it becomes evident that this Internet \"sweetheart\" is stuck in his or her home country or a third country, lacking the money to leave and thus unable to be united with the mark. The scam then becomes an [[advance-fee fraud]] or a [[check fraud]]. A wide variety of reasons can be offered for the trickster's lack of cash, but rather than just borrow the money from the victim (advance fee fraud), the con-man normally declares that he has checks which the victim can cash on his behalf and remit the money via a non-reversible transfer service to help facilitate the trip ([[check kiting|check fraud]]). Of course, the checks are forged or stolen and the con-man never makes the trip: the hapless victim ends up with a large debt and an [[Broken heart|aching heart]]. This scam can be seen in the movie ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]''.\n\nIn some cases, an online dating site [[online dating service#Misleading advertising|is itself engaged in fraud]], posting profiles of fictional persons or persons which the operator knows are not currently looking for a date in the advertised locality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/facebook-info-sharing-created-zoosk-com-dating-profile-for-married-woman-1.2844953|title=Facebook info sharing created Zoosk.com dating profile for married woman|date=24 November 2014|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]}}</ref>\n\n===Fortune-telling fraud===\nOne traditional swindle involves [[fortune-telling]]. In this scam, a fortune teller uses [[cold reading]] skills to detect that a client is genuinely troubled rather than merely seeking entertainment; or is a gambler complaining of bad [[luck]]. The fortune teller informs the mark that he is the victim of a [[curse]], and that for a fee a spell can be cast to remove the curse. In [[Romany language|Romany]], this trick is called ''bujo'' (\"bag\") after one traditional format: the mark is told that the curse is in his money; he brings money in a bag to have the spell cast over it, and leaves with a bag of worthless paper.<ref>W.

Kephart, ''Extraordinary groups: an examination of unconventional lifestyles'' (Macmillan, 2000; {{ISBN|1-57259-953-7}}), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=izrSSWrKu8cC&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=bujo+gypsy+scam&source=bl&ots=oktYov9_dK&sig=psavI5uf3jd-pQZnvWudOs2R7dA&hl=en&ei=Ci7jTNT1O8ainQeM6IDoDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false 121\u201322]</ref> Fear of this scam has been one justification for legislation that makes fortune-telling a crime.<ref>''Spiritual Psychic Science Church v. City of Azusa'' (1985) 39 Cal.3d 501, 217 Cal.Rptr. 225; 703 P.2d 1119</ref> See the \"Blessing Scam\" below.\n\nThis scam got a new lease on life in the electronic age with the [[virus hoax]]. [[Rogue security software|Fake anti-virus software]] falsely claims that a computer is infected with viruses, and renders the machine inoperable with bogus warnings unless blackmail is paid. In the Datalink Computer Services incident, a mark was fleeced of several millions of dollars by a firm that claimed that his computer was infected with viruses, and that the infection indicated an elaborate conspiracy against him on the Internet.<ref name=\"WCDA1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.westchesterda.net/pressreleases/001108mkarraign.htm|title=Heir to Schlumberger OILfield services fortune fleeced of at least six million dollars|date=November 8, 2010 |work=Press Release|publisher=Westchester County District Attorney|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"EL-GHOBASHY\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703957804575602993406810012|title=Virus Leads to $20 Million Scam |last=El-Ghobashy|first=Tamer|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Fernandez\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/nyregion/09fraud.html?partner=rss&emc=rss|title=Man Held in Defrauding Roger Davidson, Musician|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=9 November 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> The alleged scam lasted from August 2004 through October 2010 and is estimated to have cost the victim $6\u201320 million.<ref name=\"WCDA1\"/><ref name=\"Zetter\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/pianist-composer-bilked|title=Computer Virus Leads to $20 Million Scam Targeting Pianist Composer |last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=November 9, 2010 |work=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Gold brick scams==\nGold brick scams involve selling a tangible item for more than it is worth; they are named after selling the victim an allegedly golden ingot which turns out to be gold-coated lead.\n\n===Green goods===\nThe [[green goods scam]], also known as the \"green goods game\", was a scheme popular in the 19th-century United States in which people were duped into paying for worthless [[counterfeit]] money. It is a variation on the [[pig-in-a-poke]] scam using money instead of other goods like a pig. The mark, or victim, would respond to flyers circulated throughout the country by the scammers (\"green goods men\") which claimed to offer \"genuine\" counterfeit currency for sale. This currency was sometimes alleged to have been printed with stolen engraving plates. Victims, usually living outside major cities, would be enticed to travel to the location of the green goods men to complete the transaction. Victims were guided by a \"[[accomplice|steerer]]\" to be shown large amounts of genuine currency\u2014represented to be counterfeit\u2014which was then placed in a bag or [[satchel]]. Victims then received offers to purchase the money at a price much less than face value. While a victim negotiated a price or was otherwise distracted, another accomplice (the \"ringer\") would switch the bag of money for a bag containing sawdust, green paper, or other worthless items. Victims would leave unaware of the switch, and were unwilling to report the crime, as attempting to purchase counterfeit currency was itself a crime and the victim accordingly risked [[arrest]].\n\n===Pig in a poke (cat in a bag)===\n[[Pig in a poke]] originated in the late [[Middle Ages]]. The con entails a sale of what is claimed to be a small pig, in a poke (bag). The bag actually contains a cat (not particularly prized as a source of meat). If one buys the bag without looking inside it, the person has bought something of less value than was assumed, and has learned first-hand the lesson ''[[caveat emptor]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} \"Buying a pig in a poke\" has become a [[colloquialism|colloquial expression]] in many European languages, including English, for when someone buys something without examining it beforehand.<ref name=\"Brewer, 1898\">Brewer, ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898.</ref> In some regions the \"pig\" in the phrase is replaced by \"cat\", referring to the bag's actual content, but the saying is otherwise identical.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This is also said to be where the phrase \"[[letting the cat out of the bag]]\" comes from, although there may be other explanations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn Portuguese or Spanish speaking countries, the \"pig\" in the phrase is replaced by a hare or jackrabbit. A victim thinks he is buying a hare, when in reality he is buying a cat, hence the expression \"gato por lebre\" (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) or \"gato por liebre\" (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Thai gems===\nThe Thai [[gem scam]] involves layers of con men and helpers who tell a tourist in [[Bangkok]] of an opportunity to earn money by buying [[duty (economics)|duty-free]] jewelry and having it shipped back to the tourist's home country. The mark is driven around the city in a [[tuk-tuk]] operated by one of the con men, who ensures that the mark meets one helper after another, until the mark is persuaded to buy the jewelry from a store also operated by the swindlers. The gems are real but significantly overpriced. This scam has been operating for twenty years in Bangkok, and is said to be protected by Thai police and politicians. A similar scam usually runs in parallel for custom-made suits. Many tourists are hit by con men touting both goods.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nA similar trick in Thailand involves lying about the presence of [[ivory]] in ornaments. Tricksters offer a non-ivory ornament for sale next to a sign in English reading \"It is strictly forbidden to transport ivory into the United States, and the seller assumes no responsibility\". This may make the buyer believe he's stumbled upon \"forbidden fruit\", tempting him to purchase the ornament, usually small and easy to hide, and smuggle it out of the country. The buyer would later discover that the ornament is made out of bone matter with no trace of ivory whatsoever.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===White-van speakers===\nIn the [[white van speaker scam]], low-quality [[loudspeaker]]s are sold\u2014stereotypically from a white van\u2014as expensive units that have been greatly discounted. The salesmen explain the ultra-low price in a number of ways; for instance, that their employer is unaware of having ordered too many speakers, so they are sneakily selling the excess behind the boss's back. The \"speakermen\" are ready to be haggled down to a seemingly minuscule price, because the speakers they are selling, while usually functional, actually cost only a tiny fraction of their \"list price\" to manufacture. The scam may extend to the creation of Web sites for the bogus brand, which usually sounds similar to that of a respected loudspeaker company. They will often place an ad for the speakers in the \"For sale\" Classifieds of the local newspaper, at the exorbitant price, and then show the mark a copy of this ad to \"verify\" their worth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nPeople shopping for [[copyright infringement of software|bootleg software]], illegal pornographic images, bootleg music, drugs, firearms or other forbidden or controlled goods may be legally hindered from reporting swindles to the police. An example is the \"big screen TV in the back of the truck\": the TV is touted as \"hot\" (stolen), so it will be sold for a very low price. The TV is in fact defective or broken; it may in fact not even be a television at all, since some scammers have discovered that a suitably decorated oven door will suffice.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://m.gizmodo.com/5337290/cops-bust-guy-selling-oven-door-disguised-as-hdtv\n|title=Cops Bust Guy Selling Oven Door Disguised as HDTV\n|author=Danny Allen\n|publisher=gizmodo.com\n|date=August 14, 2009\n|accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> The buyer has no [[legal recourse]] without admitting to the attempted purchase of [[receipt of stolen property|stolen goods]].\n\n===Iraqi Dinar===\n[[Iraqi dinar#Speculation|Iraqi currency]] is sold to would-be investors with the belief that economic/financial circumstances will drastically increase the value of their investment. In fact there is no credible rationale or information to indicate that those circumstances will materialize or, if they do materialize, that they will have significant effect on the value of the currency.  Moreover, the dealers sell currency to these investors at substantial mark-up such that a significant appreciation of the currency would be required just to make their investment break even.<ref name=\"MyUser_Investopedia.com_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/081314/iraqi-dinar-investment-wise-investment.asp |title=Is the Iraqi Dinar Investment a Wise Investment? |newspaper=Investopedia.com |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Amltf.com_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amltf.com/blog/warning-iraqi-dinar-scam-on-the-riseagain |title=Warning: Iraqi Dinar scam on the rise...again! |publisher=AMLTF Consulting Agency of Canada |website=Amltf.com |accessdate=December 28, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205054812/http://www.amltf.com/blog/warning-iraqi-dinar-scam-on-the-riseagain |archivedate=February 5, 2016 }} </ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Cnbc.com_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/inside-a-24-million-investment-scam-buy-the-iraqi-dinar.html |title=Inside a $24 million investment scam: Buy the Iraqi dinar |newspaper=Cnbc.com |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Noorseekee===\n{{unsourced-section|date=December 2019}}\nThe Noorseekee (\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0438) scam is a multiple-round variant of the gold brick scam which has entered Russian urban legends from unverifiable incidents during the Afghanistan conflict.\nThe scam consists of multiple \"seller\" and \"buyer\" rounds, the sellers and buyers both being Soviet officers in on the con. The \"sellers\" initially offered a small amount of a mysterious item\u2014small shiny gold-colored cups called \"noorseekee\"\u2014at a prominent bazaar for cheap (\"seller\" round). The first \"seller\" round ended with a minor deal, as the merchants were traditionally expected to buy at least a sample of a new and unknown good \"just in case\". Then the \"buyers\" visited the same bazaar demanding any noorseekee available and credulously paying more than the \"sellers\" had demanded. The merchants, making easy profits, were thus much more enthusiastic toward the next \"sellers\". Noorseekee were small, stackable, reasonably durable, light-weight and would neither spoil nor rust, making the trade especially easy.\n\nThis went on for several rounds to build trust, form messaging pathways and establish the noorseekee as a special ware or even a Soviet-specialized secondary currency. On the pre-final round the \"buyers\" emptied the bazaar's collective supply of noorseekee and left with the announcement of returning soon with an exorbitant amount of money, while leaving an equally exorbitant order for more noorseekee (and even a down-payment). The \"sellers\" gladly agreed to provide the demanded amount of wares, but demanded a higher per-unit price citing e.g. the need to pay more hush money to their commanding officers. Then the \"sellers\" fulfilled the order and the merchants bought massive amounts (e.g. literal truckloads) of noorseekee expecting to make a large profit due to the size of the outstanding \"order\", regardless of the reduced per-unit profit and regardless of the high investment it demanded of them. The size of the final noorseekee order would usually exceed the bazaar's cash reserves, causing the merchants to access their savings and / or barter away stockpiled premium goods.\n\nObviously, the \"buyers\" would never be seen again, leaving the bazaar's merchants with truckloads of noorseekee and no means to sell them. Establishing new contacts with the Soviets would then reveal the noorseekee as worthless brass caps from Soviet gunships' unguided air-to-ground missile packs (\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0438 derives as the diminutive from \u041d\u0423\u0420\u0421, i.e. '''\u043d'''\u0435'''\u0443'''\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 '''\u0440'''\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 '''\u0441'''\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, said unguided missile).

One relatively common scheme involves two cars, one for the con artist, and the other for the [[shill]]. The con artist will pull in front of the victim, and the shill will pull in front of the con artist before slowing down. The con artist will then slam on his brakes to \"avoid\" the shill, causing the victim to rear-end the con artist. The shill will accelerate away, leaving the scene. The con artist will then claim various exaggerated injuries in an attempt to collect from the victim's insurance carrier despite having intentionally caused the accident. Insurance carriers, who must spend money to fight even those claims they believe are fraudulent, frequently pay out thousands of dollars\u2014a tiny amount to the carrier despite being a significant amount to an individual\u2014to settle these claims instead of going to court.<ref>{{cite web|title=What factors impact auto insurance rates? |url=http://www.ifaauto.com/faq/rate.asp |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA variation of this scam occurs in countries where insurance premiums are generally tied to a [[bonus-malus]] rating: the con artist will offer to avoid an insurance claim, settling instead for a cash compensation. Thus, the con artist is able to evade a professional damage assessment, and get an untraceable payment in exchange for sparing the mark the expenses of a lowered merit class.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Melon drop===\nThe melon drop is a scam similar to the Chinese version [[Pengci]] in which a scammer will cause an unsuspecting mark to bump into them causing the scammer to drop an item of alleged value.

The scammer begins with a large pool of marks, numbering ideally a [[power of two]] such as 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>). The scammer divides the pool into two halves, and sends all the members of each half a prediction about the future outcome of an event with a binary outcome (such as a stock price rising or falling, or the win/loss outcome of a sporting event). One half receives a prediction that the stock price will rise (or a team will win, etc.), and the other half receives the opposite prediction. After the event occurs, the scammer repeats the process with the group that received a correct prediction, again dividing the group in half and sending each half new predictions. After several iterations, the \"surviving\" group of marks has received a remarkable sequence of correct predictions, whereupon the scammer then offers these marks another prediction, this time for a fee. The next prediction is, of course, no better than a random guess, but the previous record of success makes it seem to the mark to be a prediction worth great value.\n\nFor gambling propositions with more than two outcomes, for example in horse racing, the scammer begins with a pool of marks with number equal to a power of the number of outcomes, and divides the marks at each step into the corresponding number of groups, thus insuring that one group receives a correct prediction at each step. This requires a larger number of marks at the beginning, but fewer steps are required to gain the confidence of the marks who receive successful predictions, because the probability of a correct prediction is lower at each step, and thus it seems more remarkable. \n\nThe scam relies on [[selection bias]] and [[survivorship bias]] and is similar to [[publication bias]] (the file-drawer effect) in scientific publishing (whereby successful experiments are more likely to be published, rather than failures).\n\nSeveral authors mention the scam: [[Daniel C. Dennett]] in ''[[Elbow Room (Dennett book)|Elbow Room]]'' (where he calls it the touting pyramid);  [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]] in ''The Improbability Principle''; and [[Jordan Ellenberg]] in ''[[How Not to Be Wrong]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/13/how-not-to-be-wrong-hidden-maths-jordan-ellenberg-review\n |title=How Not to Be Wrong: The Hidden Maths of Everyday Life by Jordan Ellenberg \u2013 review\n |first=Alex\n |last=Bellos\n |date=June 13, 2014\n |publisher=[[The Guardian]]\n |accessdate=July 5, 2019\n}}</ref> \n\nEllenberg reports often hearing of the scam told as an illustrative parable, but he could not find a real-world example of anyone carrying it out as an actual scam. The closest he found was when illusionist [[Derren Brown]] presented it in his television special ''[[List of Derren Brown shows#Derren Brown: The System (2008)|The System]]'' in 2008. Brown's intent was merely to convince his mark that he had a foolproof horse race betting system rather than to scam the mark out of money. However, Ellenberg goes on to describe how investment firms do something similar by starting many in-house investment funds, and closing the funds that show the lowest returns before offering the surviving funds (with their record of high returns) for sale to the public. The selection bias inherent in the surviving funds makes them unlikely to sustain their previous high returns.\n\n===Fiddle game===\nThe fiddle game uses the [[pigeon drop]] technique. A pair of con men work together, one going into an expensive restaurant in shabby clothes, eating, and claiming to have left his wallet at home, which is nearby. As collateral, the con man leaves his only worldly possession, the [[violin]] that provides his livelihood. After he leaves, the second con man swoops in, offers an outrageously large amount (for example $50,000) for what he calls a rare instrument, then looks at his watch and runs off to an appointment, leaving his card for the mark to call him when the fiddle-owner returns. The \"poor man\" comes back, having gotten the money to pay for his meal and redeem his violin. The mark, thinking he has an offer on the table from the second conspirator, then buys the violin from the [[violin|fiddle player]] who \"reluctantly\" agrees to sell it for a certain amount that still allows the mark to make a \"profit\" from the valuable violin. The result is the two con men are richer (less the cost of the violin), and the mark is left with a cheap instrument.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe fiddle game may be played with any sufficiently valuable-seeming piece of property; a common variation known as the pedigreed-dog swindle uses a [[Mongrel|mongrel dog]] upsold as a rare breed but is otherwise identical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Low life: lures and snares of old New York|last=Sante|first=Luc|date=2003|publisher=Farrar, Straus Giroux|isbn=0374528993|edition=1st Farrar, Straus Giroux pbk.|location=New York|pages=170|oclc=53464289}}</ref>\n\n===Lottery fraud by proxy===\n{{See also|Lottery fraud}}\nLottery fraud by proxy is a scam in which the scammer buys a lottery ticket with old winning numbers. He or she then alters the date on the ticket so that it appears to be from the day before, and therefore a winning ticket. He or she then sells the ticket to the mark, claiming it is a winning ticket, but for some reason, he or she is unable to collect the prize (not eligible, etc.). The particular cruelty in this scam is that if the mark attempts to collect the prize, the fraudulently altered ticket will be discovered and the mark held criminally liable.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This con was featured in the movie [[Matchstick Men (film)|''Matchstick Men'']], where [[Nicolas Cage]] teaches it to his daughter.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A twist on the con was shown in ''[[Great Teacher Onizuka]]'', where the more-than-gullible Onizuka was tricked into getting a \"winning ticket\". The ticket wasn't altered, but the [[newspaper|daily newspaper]] reporting the day's winning numbers was altered with a black pen.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the USSR this scam left 3 people dead in 1977, after a mark re-sold a fraudulent ticket and the second buyer engaged a criminal to \"clear the issue\", leading to the murder of the original mark and two family members. The investigations using a fake lottery uncovered a large group of marks all targeted by a single artist, a disgruntled former employee of the Mint who used his insider knowledge and skills to produce the high-quality forged tickets.\n\n===Three-card Monte===\n\n[[Three-card Monte]], \"find the queen\", the \"three-card trick\", or \"follow the lady\" is essentially the same as the centuries-older [[shell game]] or ''thimblerig'' (except for the [[theatrical property|props]]).<ref>Tom Ogden ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Magic Tricks'', p. 123, Alpha Books (1998) {{ISBN|0-02-862707-5}}</ref> The trickster shows three [[playing card]]s to the audience, one of which is a queen (the \"lady\"), then places the cards face-down, shuffles them around, and invites the audience to bet on which one is the queen.

This is sometimes enough to entice the audience to place bets, but the trickster uses [[sleight of hand]] to ensure that he always loses, unless the con man decides to let him win, hoping to lure him into betting much more. The mark loses whenever the dealer chooses to make him lose. \n\nA variation on this scam exists in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], but with the addition of a pickpocket.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The dealer and shill behave in an overtly obvious manner, attracting a larger audience. When the pickpocket succeeds in stealing from a member of the audience, he signals the dealer. The dealer then shouts the word \"aguas\" \u2013 colloquial for \"Watch Out!\" \u2013 and the three split up. The audience is left believing that the police are coming, and that the performance was a failed scam.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nA variant of this scam exists in Mumbai, India.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The shill says loudly to the dealer that his cards are fake and that he wants to see them. He takes the card and folds a corner and says in a hushed voice to the audience that he has marked the card. He places a bet and wins. Then he asks the others to place bets as well. When one of the audience bets a large sum of money, the cards are switched.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Spurious qualifications or endorsements==\n\n===Diploma mill===\nGovernmental bodies maintain a list of entities which [[educational accreditation|accredit educational institutions]].

The software then pretends to find multiple viruses on the victim's computer, \"removes\" a few, and asks for payment in order to take care of the rest. They are then linked to con artists' websites, professionally designed to make their bogus software appear legitimate, where they must pay a fee to download the \"full version\" of their \"antivirus software\".\n\n===[[Phishing]]===\nA modern scam in which the artist communicates with the mark, masquerading as a representative of an official organization with which the mark is doing business, in order to extract personal information which can then be used, for example, to steal money. In a typical instance, the artist sends the mark an email pretending to be from a company, such as [[eBay]]. It is formatted exactly like email from that business, and will ask the mark to \"verify\" some personal information at the website, to which a link is provided, in order to \"reactivate\" his blocked account. The website is fake but designed to look exactly like the business' website. The site contains a [[form (web)|form]] asking for personal information such as [[credit card number]]s, which the mark feels compelled to give or lose all access to the service. When the mark submits the form (without double-checking the [[Uniform Resource Locator|website address]]), the information is sent to the swindler.\n\nA similar [[caller ID spoofing]] scheme exists with misleading telephone calls (\"vishing\") facilitated by [[voice over IP|Internet telephony]]. A fraudster can make calls through an Internet-[[PSTN]] gateway to impersonate banks, police, schools or other trusted entities. A random dialer computer or auto-dialer can impersonate healthcare providers to get Social Security numbers and birthdates from elderly patients recently released from the hospital. The auto-dialer call states it is from a reputable hospital or a pharmacy and the message explains the need to \"update records\" to be from the hospital or a pharmacy.\n\nOther online scams include [[advance-fee fraud]], [[bidding fee auction]]s (\"penny auctions\"), [[click fraud]], [[domain slamming]], various [[spoofing attack]]s, [[web-cramming]], and online versions of [[employment scams]], [[romance scam]]s, and [[#fake reward|fake rewards]].\n\n===Fake support call===\n{{main article|Technical support scam}}\nUnsuspecting computer owners and users are being targeted by people claiming to be from [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], i.e., [[Microsoft]] or from their [[internet provider]] and then telling them that their computer/machine is creating errors and they need to correct the faults on their computers.

Some victims of the technical support scam may have their information sold or traded to a new organization that will cold-call them and tell them that they are entitled to a refund for the support they have previously paid for. Alternatively, the scammer may impersonate a security company and convince the victim that hackers are manipulating their bank account. The goal is for the scammer to transfer money between the user's accounts and to use HTML editing in the browser to make it appear as though new money has been transferred into the account by a legitimate company. The scammer sends a large amount of money and convinces the victim that they must send the majority of the money to the scammer via a wire transfer, a money order, or gift cards.\n\n==Religion-based schemes==\n\n===The Affinity Church scam===\n\u201cAffinity\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=https://scambusters.org/churchscam.html|title=Don't be Exploited by Church Scam Artists.HTML}}</ref>simply means something like \u201ca shared understanding, interest or belief.\u201d And claiming to share someone else's viewpoint is the sneaky cover many church scam artists use.\nPretending to share their faith lulls members of religious organizations into thinking a scammer is genuine.\nOften claiming some kind of divine guidance, using religious slogans, or claiming to be raising funds for a religious or other worthy cause, church scammers invite their new \u201cfriends\u201d to invest in what turns out to be nothing more than a [[Ponzi Scheme]] paying for their personal lifestyle.\nThis is such a common crime that the state of Arizona listed affinity scams of this type as its number one scam for 2009.\nIn one recent nationwide religious scam, churchgoers are said to have lost more than $50 million in a phony gold bullion scheme, promoted on daily telephone \u201cprayer chains,\u201d in which they thought they could earn a huge return.\n\n==Other confidence tricks and scams==\n\n===Art student===\nThe [[art student scam]] is common in major Chinese cities. A small group of 'students' will start a conversation, citing a wish to practice their English. In short order they will maneuver the conversation over to education and will claim to be art students wishing to take the mark to a free art exhibition, which will usually be in a small, well-hidden rented office. Once there the students will show the mark some art pieces which they claim to be their own work and will try to sell them at a high price, despite the pieces usually being nothing more than a worthless printout. They will often resort to 'guilt tricks' (e.g., introducing their \"starving child\") to overcome resistance or to discourage price negotiation on the part of the mark.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Bar bill scam===\nThe bar bill scam is common in Europe,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Tourist Scams and Rip-Offs in Europe|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/tourist-scams|website=Rick Steves' Europe|accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref> especially [[Budapest, Hungary]].<ref name=\"UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy\">{{cite web|title=Tourist Advisory for Hungary|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/tourist_advisory.html|website=Embassy of the United States|accessdate=10 June 2016|language=English|date=January 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326024226/http://hungary.usembassy.gov/tourist_advisory.html|archivedate=26 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Budapest Bar Scam|url=http://www.budapestagent.com/budapest-bar-scam.html|website=Budapest Agent|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=8 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sylvester|first1=Phil|title=Bar scams: How to enjoy your S\u00f6r in peace!|url=https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/eastern-europe/hungary/budapest-bar-scams|website=World Nomads|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=11 Jun 2015}}</ref> A mark, usually a man who is a tourist, is approached by an attractive woman or pair of women who start a conversation, such as asking for directions (pretending to have mistaken the tourist for a local). After a bit of conversation, the women will suggest that they go to a bar that they know of. While there, they order many entr\u00e9es and drinks and encourage the mark to do the same. Either the menu does not have prices on it or the menu is later switched with one that has higher prices.\n\nWhen the bill comes, it is many times larger than expected. The women have only a small amount of cash on them, and ask the mark to pay for the bill. The mark is forced to pay before leaving (sometimes with threats of violence), and directed to an ATM on the premises where they can withdraw cash. The women apologize profusely for the situation and arrange to meet the next day to pay them back, but they do not show. In truth, the women are working with the bar and receive a cut of the payment.<ref name=\"UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy\" />\n\nThe con can also be performed with a well-dressed man or a gregarious local rather than an attractive woman. A variation on this is to have a taxi driver recommend the bar to the passenger, who enters alone and orders, not realizing that they will be charged an exorbitant bill. The taxi driver receives a cut of the payment.<ref name=\"UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy\" />\n\n===Beijing tea===\n\nThe Beijing tea scam is a famous variation of the [[Clip Joint]] scam practiced in and around [[Beijing]] and some other large Chinese cities. The artists (usually female and working in pairs) will approach tourists and try to make friends. After chatting, they will suggest a trip to see a [[Chinese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], claiming that they have never been to one before. The tourist is never shown a menu, but assumes that this is how things are done in China. After the ceremony, the bill is presented to the tourist, charging upwards of $100 per head. The artists will then hand over their bills, and the tourists are obliged to follow suit. Similar scams involving restaurants, coffee shops and bars also take place.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.bamboocompass.com/china-scams-the-teahouse-scam-12769.html\n | title = China Scams: The Teahouse Scam\n | date = 8 December 2011\n | website = Bamboo Compass\n | publisher = Ctrip International\n | access-date = 24 August 2016\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160801050604/http://www.bamboocompass.com/china-scams-the-teahouse-scam-12769.html\n | archive-date = 1 August 2016\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blog.beijingholiday.com/travel-tips/tea-house-scam/\n | title = Tea House Scam\n | date = 6 April 2010\n | website = Beijing Holiday\n | publisher = Beijing Holiday\n | access-date = 24 August 2016\n }}</ref>\n\n===Big Store===\nThe Big Store is a technique for selling the legitimacy of a scam and typically involves a large team of con artists and elaborate sets.

The most common form, \"the Short Count\", has been featured prominently in several movies about grifting, notably ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Criminal (2004 film)|Criminal]]'', ''[[Nine Queens]]'', and ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]''. For example, a con artist targeting a [[cashier]] apologetically uses a ten-dollar bill to pay for an item costing less than a dollar, claiming not to have any smaller bills; the change of over nine dollars will include either nine singles or a five and four singles.  The con artist then claims to have found that he had a dollar bill, after all, and offers to change it and the nine dollars for the original ten.  If the con artist can manipulate the clerk into handing over the ten-dollar bill first, the con artist can then hand it back to the clerk in place of one of the singles the con artist was expected to give the clerk.  The con artist then pretends to notice he has \"mistakenly\" given the clerk nineteen dollars instead of ten; producing another single, the con artist suggests he add this to the nineteen and let the clerk give him back an even twenty.  The scam relies on the cashier's desire to keep small bills in the register, and the cashier's failure to notice that the con artist only ever provided twelve dollars (the original ten-dollar bill and two singles); the twenty dollars the clerk is left holding is a mix of the con artist's money and money from the store's register, while the con artist has stolen eight dollars (and, effectively, the cheap item that was purchased).  To avoid this con, clerks should keep each transaction separate and never permit the customer to handle the original ten before handing over the ten ones.\n\nAnother variation is to flash a $20 bill to the clerk, then ask for something behind the counter. When the clerk turns away, the con artist can swap the bill he is holding to a lesser bill. The clerk might then make change for the larger bill, without noticing it has been swapped. The technique may work better when bills are the same color at a glance like, for instance, [[Federal Reserve Note|U.S. dollar bills]].  A similar technique exists when a con artist asks to use a very large denomination bill to purchase a cheap item.  The con artist distracts the clerk with conversation while the clerk is preparing the change, in hopes that the clerk will hand over the large amount of change without realizing that the con artist never actually handed over the large bill.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Sometimes cab drivers in India try a similar con, when customers require some change back. For example, they may pay $100 for a $60 ride and expect a return of $40. But the con would say that he only received $10 and in fact needs $50 more. The mark is baffled, trying to remember and of course, the con has swiftly switched the $100 bill with a $10 one, waving it to show that this was really what the mark gave to him. Since the con has now made the mark look suspicious, the mark feels guilty and pays up. This scenario can also be created in markets, when vendors sometimes team up and support each other's cons, if the mark tries to resist.\n\n[[Tens and a Five|Another variant]] is to use confusing or misdirected language.\n\n===Fake casting agent scam===\nIn this scam, the confidence artist poses as a [[casting agent]] for a [[modeling agency]] searching for new talent. The aspiring model is told that he will need a portfolio or [[comp card]]. The mark will pay an upfront fee to have photos and create his portfolio, after which he will be sent on his way in the hope that his agent will find him work in the following weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.associationofmodelagents.org/become-a-model/beware-rogues.html |title=Beware Rogues &#124; Become A Model |publisher=Association of Model Agents |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> Of course, he never hears back from the confidence artist.\n\nIn a variation on this scam, the confidence artist is a casting agent involved with the [[adult entertainment industry]]. The mark is taken to the artist's office for an interview, in which she is told that she will have to pose for nude photos or shoot a casting video, usually involving sexual acts. Upon her agreement, the mark is sent on her way, as before. She may not have to pay upfront for a portfolio, but any material generated during her \"interview\" may be used and sold by the confidence artist without any payment to the mark.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe fake-agent scam is often targeted against industry newcomers, since they will often lack the experience required to spot such tricks.  Legitimate talent agencies advise that a genuine talent agent will never ask for money up-front, as they make their entire living from commissions on their clients' earnings.\n\n===Phony job offer scam===\n\nVery similar to the casting agent scam is the \"job offer\" scam in which a victim receives an unsolicited e-mail claiming that they are in consideration for hiring to a new job.  The confidence artist will usually obtain the victim's name from social networking sites, such as [[LinkedIn]] and [[Monster.com]].  In many cases, those running the scams will create fake websites listing jobs which the victim is seeking, then contact the victim to offer them one of the positions.\n\nIf the victim responds to the initial e-mail, the scammer will send additional messages to build up the victim's assurance that they are in the running, or have already been selected, for a legitimate job.  This will include asking for the victim's resume as well as assurances that a phone interview will be the \"next step in the hiring process\".\n\nThe goal of the job offer scam is to convince the victim to release funds or bank account information to the scammer of which there are two common methods.  The first is to advise the victim that they must take a test to qualify for the job and then send links to training sites which sell testing material and [[e-books]] for a fee.  The victim may also be provided with an actual on-line test which is usually a fake website created by copying questions from actual certification examinations, such as the [[Professional in Human Resources]] (PHR) certification or the [[Project manager]]'s exam.  if the victim pays for the study material, that will usually be the end of the scam and the scammer will break off further contact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/DHR-Search/Austin-Texas/Douglas-Hurley-Reynolds-DHR-Search-Tom-Thomas-Palmer-DHR-Search-Tom-Palmer-Scam-1101165|title=Ripoff Report - DHR Search Complaint Review Austin, Texas: 1101165}}</ref>\n\nA second, more sinister variation, is when the scammer will advise the victim they have been hired for a job and request access to bank accounts and routing numbers in order to enter the \"new hire\" into the company's payroll system.  This may also involve e-mails containing fake tax forms attempting to gain the victim's social security number and other [[personally identifiable information]].  If the victim complies, their bank account will be emptied and their personal information used to commit identity theft.\n\n===Fraudulent directory solicitations===\n{{OR section|date=January 2018}}\nIn this scam, tens of thousands of solicitations in the guise of an invoice are mailed to businesses nationwide. They may contain a disclaimer such as \"This is a solicitation for the order of goods or services, or both, and not a bill, invoice, or statement of account due. You are under no obligation to make any payments on account of this offer unless you accept this offer.\" (from {{USCSub|39|3001|d|2|A}}) or 'THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS OFFER.' (from USPS Domestic Mail Manual \u00a7CO31, Part 1.2) but are otherwise designed to appear to be invoices or renewals of existing [[display advertising]] in a trade directory or publication. The correspondence is formatted like an invoice, often with a sequential identification number, date, personalized description of the information to be published, payment details and total amount due which includes a token discount if paid within a specified time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/judicial/admin-decisions/1999/for-98421.htm|title=P.

The \"registration\" actually offers nothing beyond a vague claim that the entity sending the solicitation will submit the victim's domain name to existing search engines for an inflated fee. It does not obligate the vendor to publish a directory, renew the underlying domain in any ICANN-based registry or deliver any tangible product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suespammers.net/domain-services-spam/|title=DOMAIN SERVICES SPAM 212-913-9860|publisher=SueSpammers.net}}</ref>\n\nA similar scheme uses solicitations which appear to be invoices for local [[yellow pages]] listings or advertisements. As anyone can publish a yellow page directory, the promoted book is not the [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]'s local printed directory but a rival, which may have limited distribution if it appears at all.<ref>[http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/main/cfb28f1ad880960585256cc9006a3a8c!OpenDocument How to Protect Yourself: Yellow Pages Invoice Scam], Florida Attorney General's Office</ref> Instead of clearly stating [[International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations|audited circulation]], the solicitations will confusingly claim to \"offer 50000 copies\" or claim \"thousands of readers\" without indicating whether the inferred quantity of directories was actually printed, let alone sold.\n\nPublic records listing legal owners of new [[registered trademark]]s are also mined as a source of addresses for fraudulent directory solicitations.\n\nThe intent is that a small fractional percentage of businesses either mistake the solicitations for invoices (paying them) or mistake them for a request for corrections and updates to an existing listing (a tactic to obtain a businessperson's signature on the document, which serves as a pretext to bill the victim).\n\nOne such vendor, World Trade Register (aka European Trade Register, World Company Register, World Business Directory, all related to EU Business Services Ltd), claims \"To update your company profile, please print, complete and return this form. Updating is free of charge. Only sign if you want to place an insertion.\" Only later does it become clear that signing the form incurs a nearly \u20ac1000/year fee for an advertisement of questionable value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Scam-World-Trade-Register-Business-Registration-Is-Free-but-it-Costs-a-Lot-280317.shtml|title=Scam: World Trade Register Business Registration Is \"Free\", but It Costs a Lot|author=Eduard Kovacs|date=10 July 2012|work=softpedia}}</ref>\n\n===Jam Auction===\nIn this scam, the confidence artist poses as a retail sales promoter, representing a manufacturer, distributor, or set of stores. The scam requires assistants to manage the purchases and money exchanges while the pitchman keeps the energy level up. Passersby are enticed to gather and listen to a pitchman standing near a mass of appealing products. The trickster entices by referring to the high-end products, but claims to be following rules that he must start with smaller items. The small items are described, and 'sold' for a token dollar amount \u2013 with as many audience participants as are interested each receiving an item. The pitchman makes an emotional appeal such as saying \"Raise your hand if you're happy with your purchase\", and when hands are raised, directs his associates to return everyone's money (they keep the product). This exchange is repeated with items of increasing value to establish the expectation of a pattern. Eventually, the pattern terminates by ending the 'auction' without reaching the high-value items, and stopping midway through a phase where the trickster retains the collected money from that round of purchases. Marks feel vaguely dissatisfied, but have goods in their possession, and the uplifting feeling of having demonstrated their own happiness several times. The marks do not realize that the total value of goods received is significantly less than the price paid in the final round. Auction/refund rounds may be interspersed with sales rounds that are not refunded, keeping marks off-balance and hopeful that the next round will refund. The Jam Auction has its roots in [[carny]] culture.\n\n===Money exchange===\nThis scam occurs when exchanging foreign currency. If a large amount of cash is exchanged the victim will be told to hide the money away quickly before counting it (\"You can't trust the locals\"). A substantial amount will be missing.\n\nIn some cases, insisting on counting to make sure the money is all there is the basis for a clever scam. The scam is sometimes called the Santo Domingo Sting, after an incident that took place there, reported by a journalist, Joe Harkins, who reported his involvement, in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travelthenet.com/columns/clips/sting.htm |title=The Santo Domingo Sting |publisher=Travelthenet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> It works in countries where only banks and other designated parties are allowed to hold and exchange the local currency for US dollars at an \"official\" rate that is significantly lower than the \"street\" rate. It also requires a greedy tourist who wants to beat the official rate by dealing with illegal money changers. A person posing as an illegal money changer will approach the tourist with an offer to buy dollars at an illegal rate that may be even higher than the street rate. The changer offers to buy only large US currency, typically, a 100 dollar bill. As soon as the victim (the \"mark\") shows his $100 bill, the changer will actually count out and clearly show the promised amount of local currency. He then will push the local currency into the hands of the \"mark\" and urge they be counted as he takes the $100. \"See, you've got the money. I'll wait while you make sure. Count it out loud so there is no mistake.\" And as the mark's careful count exceeds \"street\" rate, the changer pretends to realise he has overpaid the mark, and he becomes irrationally agitated and angry, accusing the mark of cheating. He grabs his money back, pushes the mark's bill back into his hands and takes back the pesos. The scam has been completed. The tourist has just lost $99. The mark has been handed back a prefolded $1 bill that has been swapped for the mark's $100 bill while he was distracted counting the local currency. (Until recently, US currency was largely uniform in size and color, meaning that when folded, a $1 and a $100 bill were almost indistinguishable. Even in 2014, careful folding of a US$100 bill easily conceals the switch).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The money changer's pretended, but very credible, anger is a ruse to confuse the mark and delay his unfolding of the single bill until the scammer has departed.\n\n===Mystery shopping===\nThere is a fraudulent [[confidence trick]] (a form of [[advance-fee scam]]) perpetrated on people in several countries who wish to be [[mystery shopping|mystery shoppers]]. A person is sent a [[money order]], often from [[Western Union]],<ref name=spotscams/> or check for a larger sum than a mystery purchase he is required to make, with a request to deposit it into his [[bank account]], use a portion for a mystery purchase and fee, and wire the remainder through a [[wire transfer]] company such as Western Union or MoneyGram; the money is to be wired immediately as response time is being evaluated. The cheque is fraudulent, and is returned unpaid by the victim's bank, after the money has been wired.<ref>{{cite web|author=Related Items |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre40.shtm |title=Giving the Bounce to Counterfeit Cheque Scams |publisher=US Federal Trade Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> One scam involved fraudulent [[website]]s using a misspelled [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] to advertise online and in newspapers under a legitimate company's name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/08-19-08-adscam.asp |title=Residents warned of job ad scam |accessdate=2013-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322232916/http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/08-19-08-adscam.asp |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> It should be remembered that this is not the only type of mystery shopping scam taking place which involves money being paid, as it has been widely reported in the UK that shoppers should \"Watch out for some online mystery shopping scams which will cost you money for either training or for signing up without the promise of any work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysteryshopperjobs.co.uk/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Is Mystery Shopping A Scam? |publisher=Mystery Shopper Jobs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref>\n\nValid mystery shopping companies do not normally send their clients cheques prior to work being completed, and their [[advertisement]]s usually include a contact person and phone number. Some fraudulent cheques can be identified by a financial professional. On February 3, 2009, The [[Internet Crime Complaint Center]] issued a warning on this scam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2009/090203.aspx |title=Internet Crime Complaint Center warning |publisher=Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov) |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> A legitimate company that occasionally sends prepayment for large transactions says \"We do occasionally fund upfront for very large spend purchases but we use cheques or direct bank transfers which should mean you can see when they are cleared and so can be sure you really do have the money.\"<ref name=spotscams>{{cite web|url=http://www.mystery-shoppers.co.uk/mystery_shopper_scams.htm |title=Mystery Shopper Scams \u2013 How to spot a scam |publisher=Mystery-shoppers.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> It is standard practice for mystery shopping providers evaluating services such as airlines to arrange for the airfare to be issued beforehand at their own expenses (usually by means of a [[frequent flyer]] reward ticket). In any case, it is unlikely that any bona-fide provider would allocate a high-value assignment to a new shopper or proactively recruit new ones for that purpose, preferring instead to work with a pool of existing pre-vetted experienced shoppers.\n\n===Pigeon drop===\nThe [[pigeon drop]], which is depicted early in the film ''[[The Sting]]'', involves the mark or pigeon assisting an elderly, weak or infirm stranger to keep a large sum of money safe for him. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money in an envelope or briefcase, with which the mark is then to be entrusted. The container is first switched for an identical one which contains no money, and a situation is engineered giving the mark the opportunity to escape, with the money, from a perceived threat (e.g., local police or rowdies). If the mark does so, he is fleeing from his own money, which the con artist will have kept or handed off to an accomplice.\n\n===Predatory journals===\nA number of [[predatory journal]]s target academics to solicit manuscripts for publication. The journals charge high publication fees but do not perform the functions of legitimate academic journals\u2014editorial oversight and peer review\u2014they simply publish the work for cash. In this case, the mark's need for publications is the incentive for them to pay the fees. In some cases, predatory journals will use fictional editorial boards or use respected academics' names without permission to lend a veneer of credibility to the journal. A curated database of predatory journals can be found at \"Scholarly Open Access\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/01/02/list-of-predatory-publishers-2014/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422234744/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/01/02/list-of-predatory-publishers-2014/ |archivedate=2014-04-22 }}</ref>\n\n===Promotional cheque===\nThe victim is sent a document which looks, on its face, to be a [[coupon]] or a [[cheque]] for some small amount as \"prize winnings\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/1-800-charges-linked-to-company-accused-of-targeting-seniors-1.2854371 | title=1-800 charges linked to company accused of targeting seniors | work=CBC | date=December 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 12, 2016 | first=Rosa | last=Marchitelli}}</ref> Buried in the fine print is something entirely different; an authorisation to [[telephone slamming|slam]] the victim to an alternative telephony provider or even an authorisation for monthly direct withdrawals from the victim's bank account for \"services\" which were neither used nor desired.\n\n===Psychic surgery===\n[[Psychic surgery]] is a con game in which the trickster uses [[sleight of hand]] to apparently remove malignant growths from the mark's body. A common form of medical fraud in [[developing country|underdeveloped countries]], it imperils victims who may fail to seek competent medical attention. The movie ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' depicts comedian [[Andy Kaufman]] undergoing psychic surgery. It can also be seen in an episode of ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''.\n\n===Rain making===\n[[Rainmaking]] is a simple scam in which the trickster promises to use their power or influence over a complex system to make it do something favourable for the mark.\n\nClassically this was promising to make it rain,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/pay_the_rainmaker.htm|title=Nebraska State Historical Society \u2013 Should We Pay The Rainmaker?}}</ref> but more modern examples include getting someone's app 'featured' on an [[app store]], obtaining pass marks in a university entrance exam, obtaining a job, or a politician implying that they can use their influence to get a contract awarded to the mark.\n\nThe trickster has no actual influence on the outcome, but if the favourable outcome happens anyway they will then claim credit. \nIf the event doesn't happen of course then the trickster may be able to claim that they need more money until it finally does.\n\n===Recovery room===\n{{see also|Reloading scam}}\nA recovery room scam is a form of [[advance-fee fraud]] where the scammer (sometimes posing as a law enforcement officer or attorney) calls investors who have been sold worthless shares (for example in a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler-room scam]]), and offers to buy them, to allow the investors to recover their investments.<ref name=WWang06>{{cite book |author=Wang, Wallace |title=Steal This Computer Book 4.0 : What They Won't Tell You About the Internet |publisher=No Starch Press |location=San Francisco |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-59327-105-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stealthiscompute0000wang_w7x7 }}</ref> A Nigerian [[419 scam]] victim might receive a solicitation claiming to be from the Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or another government agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scam-detector.com/financial-scams/fraud-recovery-fund|title=Fraud recovery fund \u2013 Financial Scams |work=Scam Detector}}</ref>\n\nThe scam involves requiring an advance fee before the payment can take place, for example a \"court fee\".<ref name=\"isbn0-7407-5708-3\">{{cite book |author=Weinberg, Michael C. |title=Careers in Crime: An Applicant's Guide |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |location=Kansas City, MO |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7407-5708-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe red flag in the 'recovery scam' is that the supposed investigative agency, unsolicited, approaches the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams|title=Refund and Recovery Scams|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission}}</ref> A legitimate law enforcement agency would normally allow the victim to make the first contact, and will not solicit an advance fee.

The vendor asks for first and last month's rent up front, sometimes also asking for references or personal information from the prospective tenants. The rent payment clears the bank, the new tenants arrive with a truckload of worldly possessions on moving day to find that the same unit has been rented to multiple other new tenants and that the supposed \"landlord\" is not the owner of the property and is nowhere to be found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/craigslist-luxury-rental-scam-leaves-vancouver-tenants-on-the-sidewalk-1.2896233|title=Luxury rental scam leaves would-be renters on the sidewalk|first=Natalie|last=Clancy|work=CBC|date=January 9, 2015 }}</ref> This kind of scam is often performed online on students planning to study abroad and seeking accommodation, as their means of checking the property are limited.<ref>{{cite arXiv|title=The gift of the gab: Are rental scammers skilled at the arts of persuasion?|author1=Sophie Van Der Zee |author2=Richard Clayton |author3=Ross Anderson |date=November 30, 2019 |class=cs.CY|eprint=1911.08253}}</ref>\n\n===Rip deal===\nThe Rip Deal is a swindle very popular in [[Europe]] and is essentially a [[pigeon drop]] confidence trick. In a typical variation scammers will target, say, a jeweler, and offer to buy some substantial amount of his wares at a large markup ''provided'' he perform some type of under-the-table cash deal, originally exchanging Swiss francs for euros. This exchange goes through flawlessly, at considerable profit for the mark. Some time later the scammers approach the mark with a similar proposition, but for a larger amount of money (and thus a larger return for the mark). His confidence and greed inspired by the previous deal, the merchant agrees\u2014only to have his money and goods taken, by sleight-of-hand or violence, at the point of exchange.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} This scam was depicted in the movie ''[[Matchstick Men (film)|Matchstick Men]]''.\n\nThe same term is used to describe a crime where a vendor (especially a drug dealer) is killed to avoid paying for goods.<ref name=\"isbn1-84310-384-2\">{{cite book |author1=Florence Bruce |author2=Hagell, Ann |author3=Renuka Yeyarajah-dent |title=Children Who Commit Acts of Serious Interpersonal Violence: Messages for Best Practice |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |location=London |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-84310-384-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Unsolicited goods===\nVarious schemes exist to bill victims for unsolicited goods or services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocp.ga.gov/news/press-releases/view/fraudulent-invoices-on-the-rise|title=Fraudulent Invoices on the Rise|publisher=ocp.ga.gov}}</ref>\n\nA common scam targeting businesses is the '''toner bandit''' swindle; an unsolicited caller attempts to trick front-office personnel into providing manufacturer/model or serial numbers for office equipment and/or the name of the employee answering the call. Often, the call will be misrepresented as a \"survey\" or a \"prize\" award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news4jax.com/news/is-that-invoice-a-scam/28068176|title=Is that invoice a scam?|author=WJXT|work=News4Jax}}</ref> The business then receives inflated invoices for unsolicited copy paper, copy machine toner, cleaning supplies, light bulbs, trash bags or other supplies, using the name of the person who answered the call to falsely claim this person ordered the items. When the business objects, the workers are threatened with lawsuits or harassed by bogus collection agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1996/07/small-businesses-churches-nursing-homes-are-targets-bogus|title=Small Businesses, Churches, Nursing Homes Are Targets of Bogus Business Supply Companies|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission}}</ref>\n\nAnother, targeting the elderly, claims a '''free medical alert device''' has been ordered for a patient by a family member or medical doctor. An automated message says \"that someone has ordered a free medical alert system for you, and this call is to confirm shipping instructions\" before the call is transferred to a live operator who requests the elderly patient's credit card and identity card numbers. The device is not free; there is a high monthly charge for \"monitoring\". The family didn't buy or order it, nor did a practitioner; the call is fraudulent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2013/06/09/scam-medical-alert/2397189/|title=Seniors get a warning on medical alert scam|author=Susan Tompor, USA TODAY|date=9 June 2013|publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-07-2013/free-medical-alert-device-offers-hurt-more-than-help.html|title=Free Medical Alert Device Scam Targets Seniors|date=July 1, 2013|author=Sid Kirchheimer|work=AARP}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding planner scam===\nWedding planner scams prey on the vulnerability of young couples, during a time when they are most distracted and trusting, to embezzle funds for the planner's personal use. In the first type of fraud, the wedding planner company may offer a free wedding in a tie-up with a media station for a couple in need of charity, and collect the donations from the public that were meant for the wedding. In a second type of fraud, the planner asks couples to write checks to vendors (tents, food, cakes) but leave the name field empty, which the planner promises to fill in. As most vendors were never hired nor paid, the scam would then be exposed on the day of the wedding. A real life example is a Kansas TV station story of a wedding planner, Caitlin Hershberger Theis, who scammed three couples through her wedding planner consultancy, ''Live, Love and be Married'' using these two schemes.<ref>Wedding Planner Scams{{cite news|title=Newlyweds Say Wedding Planner Scammed Them|url=http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newly_Weds_Say_Wedding_Planner_Scammed_Them_124814899.html?storySection=story|date=June 30, 2011|work=KAKE.com|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175444/http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newly_Weds_Say_Wedding_Planner_Scammed_Them_124814899.html?storySection=story|archivedate=January 18, 2012}} </ref>\n\n===Blessing scam===\nThe [[blessing scam]] targets elderly Chinese immigrant women, convincing them that an evil spirit threatens their family and that this threat can be removed by a blessing ceremony involving a bag filled with their savings, jewelry or other valuables. During the ceremony, the con artists switch the bag of valuables with an identical bag with valueless contents and make off with the victim's cash or jewelry.\n\n===Pay up or be arrested scam===\nThis scam is perpetrated through the phone where the caller threatens the victim with a fictitious arrest warrant. To make this threat seem real, the [[caller ID spoofing|caller ID]] identifies the caller as that of the local [[sheriff]]. Victims are told they must pay a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] to avoid arrest. Fines are in the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars. The payment is requested through [[Western Union]], [[Green Dot Corporation|Green Dot]] [[Prepaid debit card|prepaid card]], or similar form of untraceable currency exchange.\n\nCases have been reported in [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]] and [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Steph Solis |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/08/arrest-warrant-scams/2619187/ |title=Scam: Caller threatens arrest if you don't pay |publisher=USA Today |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Public transport ticket control scam ===\n\nIn this scam, the artists pose as ticket control staff on public transport connections. They tend to look for tourists as easy marks, and therefore target train connections from the airport. They will ask to see the passenger's tickets, and once they have found a suitable mark, will claim that something is wrong with the ticket they hold. They will then claim that an instant payment is required to avoid further legal troubles. In some cases, this scam is even committed by actual public transport staff seeking to rip off tourists.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20160623/how-german-train-conductors-exploit-unwitting-tourists-deutsche-bahn-db|title=German ticket collectors saw I was a tourist and milked me|publisher=The Local Germany|date=June 23, 2016|accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Dropped wallet scam===\nThe dropped wallet scam usually targets tourists. The con artist pretends to accidentally drop his wallet in a public place. After an unsuspecting victim picks up the wallet and offers it to the con artist, the scam begins. The artist accuses the victim of stealing money from the wallet and threatens to call the police, scaring the victim into returning the allegedly stolen money. Cases have been reported in eastern Europe and major cities or railway stations in China.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikivoyage|Common scams}}\n*[[Great Reality TV Swindle]]\n*[[Kansas City Shuffle]]\n*[[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]\n*[[Psychological manipulation]]\n*[[Sick baby hoax]]\n*[[Spanish Prisoner]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Scams and confidence tricks|state=expanded}}\n{{Psychological manipulation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Confidence Tricks}}\n[[Category:Crime-related lists|Confidence tricks]]\n[[Category:Confidence tricks|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}\n[[Confidence tricks]] and scams are difficult to classify, because they change often and often contain elements of more than one type. Throughout this list, the perpetrator of the confidence trick is called the \"con artist\" or simply \"artist\", and the intended victim is the \"mark\". Particular scams are mainly directed toward elderly people, as they may be [[Credulity|credulous]] and sometimes inexperienced or insecure, especially when the scam involves modern technology such as computers and the internet. This list should not be considered complete but covers the most common examples.\n{{toclimit|limit=3}}\n\n==Get-rich-quick schemes==\n[[Get-rich-quick scheme]]s are extremely varied; these include fake [[franchising|franchises]], [[real estate]] \"sure things\", get-rich-quick books, wealth-building seminars, [[self-help]] gurus, sure-fire inventions, useless products, [[chain letter]]s, [[fortune-telling|fortune tellers]], [[quackery|quack]] doctors, miracle [[pharmaceutical]]s, [[foreign exchange fraud]], [[#Spanish Prisoner|Nigerian money scams]], and [[amulet|charms and talismans]]. Variations include the [[pyramid scheme]], the [[Ponzi scheme]], and the [[matrix scheme]].\n\n===The \"Money-Box Scheme\"===\n[[Victor Lustig]], a German con artist, designed and sold a \"money box\" which he claimed could print $100 bills using blank sheets of paper.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=h20BCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT27&dq=victor+lustig+money+box#v=onepage&q=victor%20lustig%20money%20box&f=false|title=From Paris to Alcatraz: The true, untold story of one of the most notorious con-artists of the twentieth century - Count Victor Lustig|last=Garrett|first=Betty Jean Lustig & Nanci|date=2011-12-08|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=9781462893836|language=en}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} A victim, sensing huge profits and untroubled by ethical implications, would buy the machine for a high price\u2014from $25,000 to $102,000.<ref name=\":0\" /> Lustig stocked the machine with six to nine genuine $100 bills for demonstration purposes, but after that it produced only blank paper.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-smoothest-con-man-that-ever-lived-29861908/|title=The Smoothest Con Man That Ever Lived|last=King|first=Gilbert|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2017-12-25|language=en}}</ref> By the time victims realized that they had been scammed, Lustig was long gone.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Salting {{anchor|Salting|Salt the mine}}===\n[[Salting (confidence trick)|Salting]] or \"salting the mine\" are terms for a scam in which [[gemstone]]s or [[gold|gold ore]] are planted in a [[mining|mine]] or on the landscape, duping the mark into purchasing shares in a worthless or non-existent mining company.<ref>Dan Plazak ''A Hole in the Ground with a Liar at the Top'' (Salt Lake: Univ. of Utah Press, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-87480-840-7}}.</ref> During [[gold rush]]es, scammers would load [[shotgun]]s with gold dust and shoot into the sides of the mine to give the appearance of a rich ore, thus \"salting the mine\". Examples include the [[diamond hoax of 1872]] and the [[Bre-X]] gold fraud of the mid-1990s. This trick was featured in the [[HBO]] series ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', when [[Al Swearengen]] and [[E. B. Farnum]] trick Brom Garret into believing gold is to be found on the claim Swearengen intends to sell him. This con was also featured in ''[[Sneaky Pete]]''.\n\n===Spanish Prisoner{{anchor|Spanish Prisoner|Advance fee fraud|Nigerian scam}}===\nThe [[Spanish Prisoner]] scam \u2014 and its modern variant, the [[advance-fee scam]] or \"[[419 scams|Nigerian letter scam]]\" \u2014 involves enlisting the mark to aid in retrieving some stolen money from its hiding place. The victim sometimes believes he can cheat the con artists out of their money, but anyone trying this has already fallen for the essential con by believing that the money is there to steal (see also [[Black money scam]]). Note that the classic Spanish Prisoner trick also contains an element of the romance scam (see below).\n\nMany con men employ extra tricks to keep the victim from going to the [[police]]. A common ploy of investment scammers is to encourage a mark to use money concealed from tax authorities. The mark cannot go to the authorities without revealing that he has committed [[tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax fraud]]. Many swindles involve a minor element of crime or some other misdeed. The mark is made to think that he will gain money by helping fraudsters get huge sums out of a country (the classic advance-fee fraud/Nigerian scam); hence a mark cannot go to the police without revealing that he planned to commit a crime himself.\n\nIn a twist on the Nigerian fraud scheme, the mark is told he is helping someone overseas collect debts from corporate clients. Large [[cheque]]s stolen from businesses are mailed to the mark. These cheques are altered to reflect the mark's name, and the mark is then asked to cash them and transfer all but a percentage of the funds (his [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]) to the con artist. The cheques are often completely genuine, except that the \"pay to\" information has been expertly changed. This exposes the mark not only to enormous debt when the bank reclaims the money from his account, but also to criminal charges for [[money laundering]]. A more modern variation is to use [[laser printer|laser-printed]] counterfeit cheques with the proper bank account numbers and payer information.This scam can be seen on the film The Spanish Prisoner.\n\n==Persuasion tricks==\nPersuasion fraud, when fraudsters persuade people only to target their money, is an old-fashioned type of fraud.\n\n===Grandparent scam===\nA grandparent gets a call or e-mail from someone claiming to be their grandchild, saying that they are in trouble. For example, the scammer may claim to have been arrested and require money wired, or gift cards purchased for bail, and asks the victim not to tell the grandchild's parents, as they would \"only get upset.\" The call is fraudulent impersonation, the name of the grandchild typically obtained from [[social media]] postings as well as obituaries listed either in newspapers or from a funeral home's website. Any money [[wire transfer|wired]] out of the country is gone forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/the-grandparent-scam|title=Don't Let Grandparent Scam Happen to You|work=FBI}}</ref>\n\n===Romance scam===\nThe traditional [[romance scam]] has now moved into [[online dating service|Internet dating]] sites. The con actively cultivates a [[romantic love|romantic relationship]] which often involves promises of marriage. However, after some time, it becomes evident that this Internet \"sweetheart\" is stuck in his or her home country or a third country, lacking the money to leave and thus unable to be united with the mark. The scam then becomes an [[advance-fee fraud]] or a [[check fraud]]. A wide variety of reasons can be offered for the trickster's lack of cash, but rather than just borrow the money from the victim (advance fee fraud), the con-man normally declares that he has checks which the victim can cash on his behalf and remit the money via a non-reversible transfer service to help facilitate the trip ([[check kiting|check fraud]]). Of course, the checks are forged or stolen and the con-man never makes the trip: the hapless victim ends up with a large debt and an [[Broken heart|aching heart]]. This scam can be seen in the movie ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]''.\n\nIn some cases, an online dating site [[online dating service#Misleading advertising|is itself engaged in fraud]], posting profiles of fictional persons or persons which the operator knows are not currently looking for a date in the advertised locality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/facebook-info-sharing-created-zoosk-com-dating-profile-for-married-woman-1.2844953|title=Facebook info sharing created Zoosk.com dating profile for married woman|date=24 November 2014|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]}}</ref>\n\n===Fortune-telling fraud===\nOne traditional swindle involves [[fortune-telling]]. In this scam, a fortune teller uses [[cold reading]] skills to detect that a client is genuinely troubled rather than merely seeking entertainment; or is a gambler complaining of bad [[luck]]. The fortune teller informs the mark that he is the victim of a [[curse]], and that for a fee a spell can be cast to remove the curse. In [[Romany language|Romany]], this trick is called ''bujo'' (\"bag\") after one traditional format: the mark is told that the curse is in his money; he brings money in a bag to have the spell cast over it, and leaves with a bag of worthless paper.<ref>W.

[[Rogue security software|Fake anti-virus software]] falsely claims that a computer is infected with viruses, and renders the machine inoperable with bogus warnings unless blackmail is paid. In the Datalink Computer Services incident, a mark was fleeced of several millions of dollars by a firm that claimed that his computer was infected with viruses, and that the infection indicated an elaborate conspiracy against him on the Internet.<ref name=\"WCDA1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.westchesterda.net/pressreleases/001108mkarraign.htm|title=Heir to Schlumberger OILfield services fortune fleeced of at least six million dollars|date=November 8, 2010 |work=Press Release|publisher=Westchester County District Attorney|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"EL-GHOBASHY\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703957804575602993406810012|title=Virus Leads to $20 Million Scam |last=El-Ghobashy|first=Tamer|date=November 9, 2010|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Fernandez\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/nyregion/09fraud.html?partner=rss&emc=rss|title=Man Held in Defrauding Roger Davidson, Musician|last=Fernandez|first=Manny|date=9 November 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> The alleged scam lasted from August 2004 through October 2010 and is estimated to have cost the victim $6\u201320 million.<ref name=\"WCDA1\"/><ref name=\"Zetter\">{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/11/pianist-composer-bilked|title=Computer Virus Leads to $20 Million Scam Targeting Pianist Composer |last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=November 9, 2010 |work=[[Wired News]]|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Gold brick scams==\nGold brick scams involve selling a tangible item for more than it is worth; they are named after selling the victim an allegedly golden ingot which turns out to be gold-coated lead.\n\n===Green goods===\nThe [[green goods scam]], also known as the \"green goods game\", was a scheme popular in the 19th-century United States in which people were duped into paying for worthless [[counterfeit]] money. It is a variation on the [[pig-in-a-poke]] scam using money instead of other goods like a pig. The mark, or victim, would respond to flyers circulated throughout the country by the scammers (\"green goods men\") which claimed to offer \"genuine\" counterfeit currency for sale. This currency was sometimes alleged to have been printed with stolen engraving plates. Victims, usually living outside major cities, would be enticed to travel to the location of the green goods men to complete the transaction. Victims were guided by a \"[[accomplice|steerer]]\" to be shown large amounts of genuine currency\u2014represented to be counterfeit\u2014which was then placed in a bag or [[satchel]]. Victims then received offers to purchase the money at a price much less than face value. While a victim negotiated a price or was otherwise distracted, another accomplice (the \"ringer\") would switch the bag of money for a bag containing sawdust, green paper, or other worthless items. Victims would leave unaware of the switch, and were unwilling to report the crime, as attempting to purchase counterfeit currency was itself a crime and the victim accordingly risked [[arrest]].\n\n===Pig in a poke (cat in a bag)===\n[[Pig in a poke]] originated in the late [[Middle Ages]]. The con entails a sale of what is claimed to be a small pig, in a poke (bag). The bag actually contains a cat (not particularly prized as a source of meat). If one buys the bag without looking inside it, the person has bought something of less value than was assumed, and has learned first-hand the lesson ''[[caveat emptor]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} \"Buying a pig in a poke\" has become a [[colloquialism|colloquial expression]] in many European languages, including English, for when someone buys something without examining it beforehand.<ref name=\"Brewer, 1898\">Brewer, ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 1898.</ref> In some regions the \"pig\" in the phrase is replaced by \"cat\", referring to the bag's actual content, but the saying is otherwise identical.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This is also said to be where the phrase \"[[letting the cat out of the bag]]\" comes from, although there may be other explanations.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn Portuguese or Spanish speaking countries, the \"pig\" in the phrase is replaced by a hare or jackrabbit. A victim thinks he is buying a hare, when in reality he is buying a cat, hence the expression \"gato por lebre\" (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) or \"gato por liebre\" (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Thai gems===\nThe Thai [[gem scam]] involves layers of con men and helpers who tell a tourist in [[Bangkok]] of an opportunity to earn money by buying [[duty (economics)|duty-free]] jewelry and having it shipped back to the tourist's home country. The mark is driven around the city in a [[tuk-tuk]] operated by one of the con men, who ensures that the mark meets one helper after another, until the mark is persuaded to buy the jewelry from a store also operated by the swindlers. The gems are real but significantly overpriced. This scam has been operating for twenty years in Bangkok, and is said to be protected by Thai police and politicians. A similar scam usually runs in parallel for custom-made suits. Many tourists are hit by con men touting both goods.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nA similar trick in Thailand involves lying about the presence of [[ivory]] in ornaments. Tricksters offer a non-ivory ornament for sale next to a sign in English reading \"It is strictly forbidden to transport ivory into the United States, and the seller assumes no responsibility\". This may make the buyer believe he's stumbled upon \"forbidden fruit\", tempting him to purchase the ornament, usually small and easy to hide, and smuggle it out of the country. The buyer would later discover that the ornament is made out of bone matter with no trace of ivory whatsoever.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===White-van speakers===\nIn the [[white van speaker scam]], low-quality [[loudspeaker]]s are sold\u2014stereotypically from a white van\u2014as expensive units that have been greatly discounted. The salesmen explain the ultra-low price in a number of ways; for instance, that their employer is unaware of having ordered too many speakers, so they are sneakily selling the excess behind the boss's back. The \"speakermen\" are ready to be haggled down to a seemingly minuscule price, because the speakers they are selling, while usually functional, actually cost only a tiny fraction of their \"list price\" to manufacture. The scam may extend to the creation of Web sites for the bogus brand, which usually sounds similar to that of a respected loudspeaker company. They will often place an ad for the speakers in the \"For sale\" Classifieds of the local newspaper, at the exorbitant price, and then show the mark a copy of this ad to \"verify\" their worth.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nPeople shopping for [[copyright infringement of software|bootleg software]], illegal pornographic images, bootleg music, drugs, firearms or other forbidden or controlled goods may be legally hindered from reporting swindles to the police. An example is the \"big screen TV in the back of the truck\": the TV is touted as \"hot\" (stolen), so it will be sold for a very low price. The TV is in fact defective or broken; it may in fact not even be a television at all, since some scammers have discovered that a suitably decorated oven door will suffice.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://m.gizmodo.com/5337290/cops-bust-guy-selling-oven-door-disguised-as-hdtv\n|title=Cops Bust Guy Selling Oven Door Disguised as HDTV\n|author=Danny Allen\n|publisher=gizmodo.com\n|date=August 14, 2009\n|accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref> The buyer has no [[legal recourse]] without admitting to the attempted purchase of [[receipt of stolen property|stolen goods]].\n\n===Iraqi Dinar===\n[[Iraqi dinar#Speculation|Iraqi currency]] is sold to would-be investors with the belief that economic/financial circumstances will drastically increase the value of their investment. In fact there is no credible rationale or information to indicate that those circumstances will materialize or, if they do materialize, that they will have significant effect on the value of the currency.  Moreover, the dealers sell currency to these investors at substantial mark-up such that a significant appreciation of the currency would be required just to make their investment break even.<ref name=\"MyUser_Investopedia.com_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/081314/iraqi-dinar-investment-wise-investment.asp |title=Is the Iraqi Dinar Investment a Wise Investment? |newspaper=Investopedia.com |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Amltf.com_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.amltf.com/blog/warning-iraqi-dinar-scam-on-the-riseagain |title=Warning: Iraqi Dinar scam on the rise...again! |publisher=AMLTF Consulting Agency of Canada |website=Amltf.com |accessdate=December 28, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205054812/http://www.amltf.com/blog/warning-iraqi-dinar-scam-on-the-riseagain |archivedate=February 5, 2016 }} </ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Cnbc.com_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/15/inside-a-24-million-investment-scam-buy-the-iraqi-dinar.html |title=Inside a $24 million investment scam: Buy the Iraqi dinar |newspaper=Cnbc.com |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Noorseekee===\n{{unsourced-section|date=December 2019}}\nThe Noorseekee (\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0438) scam is a multiple-round variant of the gold brick scam which has entered Russian urban legends from unverifiable incidents during the Afghanistan conflict.\nThe scam consists of multiple \"seller\" and \"buyer\" rounds, the sellers and buyers both being Soviet officers in on the con. The \"sellers\" initially offered a small amount of a mysterious item\u2014small shiny gold-colored cups called \"noorseekee\"\u2014at a prominent bazaar for cheap (\"seller\" round). The first \"seller\" round ended with a minor deal, as the merchants were traditionally expected to buy at least a sample of a new and unknown good \"just in case\". Then the \"buyers\" visited the same bazaar demanding any noorseekee available and credulously paying more than the \"sellers\" had demanded. The merchants, making easy profits, were thus much more enthusiastic toward the next \"sellers\". Noorseekee were small, stackable, reasonably durable, light-weight and would neither spoil nor rust, making the trade especially easy.\n\nThis went on for several rounds to build trust, form messaging pathways and establish the noorseekee as a special ware or even a Soviet-specialized secondary currency. On the pre-final round the \"buyers\" emptied the bazaar's collective supply of noorseekee and left with the announcement of returning soon with an exorbitant amount of money, while leaving an equally exorbitant order for more noorseekee (and even a down-payment). The \"sellers\" gladly agreed to provide the demanded amount of wares, but demanded a higher per-unit price citing e.g. the need to pay more hush money to their commanding officers. Then the \"sellers\" fulfilled the order and the merchants bought massive amounts (e.g. literal truckloads) of noorseekee expecting to make a large profit due to the size of the outstanding \"order\", regardless of the reduced per-unit profit and regardless of the high investment it demanded of them. The size of the final noorseekee order would usually exceed the bazaar's cash reserves, causing the merchants to access their savings and / or barter away stockpiled premium goods.\n\nObviously, the \"buyers\" would never be seen again, leaving the bazaar's merchants with truckloads of noorseekee and no means to sell them. Establishing new contacts with the Soviets would then reveal the noorseekee as worthless brass caps from Soviet gunships' unguided air-to-ground missile packs (\u043d\u0443\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043a\u0438 derives as the diminutive from \u041d\u0423\u0420\u0421, i.e. '''\u043d'''\u0435'''\u0443'''\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 '''\u0440'''\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 '''\u0441'''\u043d\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0434, said unguided missile). These caps were used during shipping (and discarded when the missile packs were slotted to the gunships) by the millions and were essentially worth nothing (due to recycling and ecology being non-issues with the Soviet military).\n\n==Extortion or false-injury tricks==\n\n===Badger game===\nThe [[badger game]] extortion was perpetrated largely upon married men. The mark is deliberately coerced into a compromising position, a supposed affair for example, then threatened with public exposure of his acts unless blackmail money is paid.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Medicine: Badgered Doctors|journal=TIME|date=Aug 25, 1930|volume=XVI|issue=8|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740166,00.html|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Bogus dry-cleaning bill scam===\nA [[mail fraud]] that is typically perpetrated on restaurateurs, this scheme takes a receipt from a legitimate [[dry cleaner]] in the target city, duplicates it thousands of times, and sends it to every upscale eatery in town. An attached note claims a server in the victim's restaurant spilled food, coffee, wine or salad dressing on a diner's expensive suit of clothes, and demands reimbursement for dry cleaning costs. As the amount fraudulently claimed from each victim is relatively low, some will give the scammers the benefit of the doubt, or simply seek to avoid the nuisance of further action, and pay the claim.\n\nThe scam's return address is a drop box; the rest of the contact information is fictional or belongs to an innocent third party. The original dry cleaning shop, which has nothing to do with the scheme, receives multiple irate enquiries from victimised restaurateurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-08-13/news/9908130225_1_restaurant-association-maryland-restaurants-restaurants-statewide|title=Restaurants statewide receive fraudulent claims for damages|work=Baltimore Sun}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/01/11/dry-cleaning-scam-targets-restaurants/|title=Dry-cleaning scam targets restaurants|work=New York Post}}</ref><ref name=\"MyUser_Walesonline.co.uk_December_28_2015c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/restaurant-owners-wales-warned-dry-cleaning-2129538 |title=Restaurant owners in Wales warned about dry-cleaning bill scam  |newspaper=Walesonline.co.uk |date=  |accessdate= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Clip joint===\nA [[clip joint]] or \"fleshpot\" is an establishment, usually a [[strip club]] or entertainment [[bar]], typically one claiming to offer [[striptease|adult entertainment]] or [[bottle service]], in which customers are tricked into paying money and receive poor, or no, goods or services in return. Typically, clip joints suggest the possibility of sex, charge excessively high prices for watered-down drinks, then eject customers when they become unwilling or unable to spend more money.

One operator begins the game with the victim, then the second joins in. When the second operator leaves briefly, the first colludes with the victim to cheat the second operator. After rejoining the game, the second operator, angry at \"losing,\" threatens to call the police.

One relatively common scheme involves two cars, one for the con artist, and the other for the [[shill]]. The con artist will pull in front of the victim, and the shill will pull in front of the con artist before slowing down. The con artist will then slam on his brakes to \"avoid\" the shill, causing the victim to rear-end the con artist. The shill will accelerate away, leaving the scene. The con artist will then claim various exaggerated injuries in an attempt to collect from the victim's insurance carrier despite having intentionally caused the accident. Insurance carriers, who must spend money to fight even those claims they believe are fraudulent, frequently pay out thousands of dollars\u2014a tiny amount to the carrier despite being a significant amount to an individual\u2014to settle these claims instead of going to court.<ref>{{cite web|title=What factors impact auto insurance rates? |url=http://www.ifaauto.com/faq/rate.asp |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nA variation of this scam occurs in countries where insurance premiums are generally tied to a [[bonus-malus]] rating: the con artist will offer to avoid an insurance claim, settling instead for a cash compensation. Thus, the con artist is able to evade a professional damage assessment, and get an untraceable payment in exchange for sparing the mark the expenses of a lowered merit class.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Melon drop===\nThe melon drop is a scam similar to the Chinese version [[Pengci]] in which a scammer will cause an unsuspecting mark to bump into them causing the scammer to drop an item of alleged value.

The scammer begins with a large pool of marks, numbering ideally a [[power of two]] such as 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>). The scammer divides the pool into two halves, and sends all the members of each half a prediction about the future outcome of an event with a binary outcome (such as a stock price rising or falling, or the win/loss outcome of a sporting event). One half receives a prediction that the stock price will rise (or a team will win, etc.), and the other half receives the opposite prediction. After the event occurs, the scammer repeats the process with the group that received a correct prediction, again dividing the group in half and sending each half new predictions. After several iterations, the \"surviving\" group of marks has received a remarkable sequence of correct predictions, whereupon the scammer then offers these marks another prediction, this time for a fee. The next prediction is, of course, no better than a random guess, but the previous record of success makes it seem to the mark to be a prediction worth great value.\n\nFor gambling propositions with more than two outcomes, for example in horse racing, the scammer begins with a pool of marks with number equal to a power of the number of outcomes, and divides the marks at each step into the corresponding number of groups, thus insuring that one group receives a correct prediction at each step. This requires a larger number of marks at the beginning, but fewer steps are required to gain the confidence of the marks who receive successful predictions, because the probability of a correct prediction is lower at each step, and thus it seems more remarkable. \n\nThe scam relies on [[selection bias]] and [[survivorship bias]] and is similar to [[publication bias]] (the file-drawer effect) in scientific publishing (whereby successful experiments are more likely to be published, rather than failures).\n\nSeveral authors mention the scam: [[Daniel C. Dennett]] in ''[[Elbow Room (Dennett book)|Elbow Room]]'' (where he calls it the touting pyramid);  [[David Hand (statistician)|David Hand]] in ''The Improbability Principle''; and [[Jordan Ellenberg]] in ''[[How Not to Be Wrong]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/13/how-not-to-be-wrong-hidden-maths-jordan-ellenberg-review\n |title=How Not to Be Wrong: The Hidden Maths of Everyday Life by Jordan Ellenberg \u2013 review\n |first=Alex\n |last=Bellos\n |date=June 13, 2014\n |publisher=[[The Guardian]]\n |accessdate=July 5, 2019\n}}</ref> \n\nEllenberg reports often hearing of the scam told as an illustrative parable, but he could not find a real-world example of anyone carrying it out as an actual scam. The closest he found was when illusionist [[Derren Brown]] presented it in his television special ''[[List of Derren Brown shows#Derren Brown: The System (2008)|The System]]'' in 2008. Brown's intent was merely to convince his mark that he had a foolproof horse race betting system rather than to scam the mark out of money. However, Ellenberg goes on to describe how investment firms do something similar by starting many in-house investment funds, and closing the funds that show the lowest returns before offering the surviving funds (with their record of high returns) for sale to the public. The selection bias inherent in the surviving funds makes them unlikely to sustain their previous high returns.\n\n===Fiddle game===\nThe fiddle game uses the [[pigeon drop]] technique. A pair of con men work together, one going into an expensive restaurant in shabby clothes, eating, and claiming to have left his wallet at home, which is nearby. As collateral, the con man leaves his only worldly possession, the [[violin]] that provides his livelihood. After he leaves, the second con man swoops in, offers an outrageously large amount (for example $50,000) for what he calls a rare instrument, then looks at his watch and runs off to an appointment, leaving his card for the mark to call him when the fiddle-owner returns. The \"poor man\" comes back, having gotten the money to pay for his meal and redeem his violin. The mark, thinking he has an offer on the table from the second conspirator, then buys the violin from the [[violin|fiddle player]] who \"reluctantly\" agrees to sell it for a certain amount that still allows the mark to make a \"profit\" from the valuable violin. The result is the two con men are richer (less the cost of the violin), and the mark is left with a cheap instrument.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe fiddle game may be played with any sufficiently valuable-seeming piece of property; a common variation known as the pedigreed-dog swindle uses a [[Mongrel|mongrel dog]] upsold as a rare breed but is otherwise identical.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Low life: lures and snares of old New York|last=Sante|first=Luc|date=2003|publisher=Farrar, Straus Giroux|isbn=0374528993|edition=1st Farrar, Straus Giroux pbk.|location=New York|pages=170|oclc=53464289}}</ref>\n\n===Lottery fraud by proxy===\n{{See also|Lottery fraud}}\nLottery fraud by proxy is a scam in which the scammer buys a lottery ticket with old winning numbers. He or she then alters the date on the ticket so that it appears to be from the day before, and therefore a winning ticket. He or she then sells the ticket to the mark, claiming it is a winning ticket, but for some reason, he or she is unable to collect the prize (not eligible, etc.). The particular cruelty in this scam is that if the mark attempts to collect the prize, the fraudulently altered ticket will be discovered and the mark held criminally liable.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This con was featured in the movie [[Matchstick Men (film)|''Matchstick Men'']], where [[Nicolas Cage]] teaches it to his daughter.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A twist on the con was shown in ''[[Great Teacher Onizuka]]'', where the more-than-gullible Onizuka was tricked into getting a \"winning ticket\". The ticket wasn't altered, but the [[newspaper|daily newspaper]] reporting the day's winning numbers was altered with a black pen.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn the USSR this scam left 3 people dead in 1977, after a mark re-sold a fraudulent ticket and the second buyer engaged a criminal to \"clear the issue\", leading to the murder of the original mark and two family members. The investigations using a fake lottery uncovered a large group of marks all targeted by a single artist, a disgruntled former employee of the Mint who used his insider knowledge and skills to produce the high-quality forged tickets.\n\n===Three-card Monte===\n\n[[Three-card Monte]], \"find the queen\", the \"three-card trick\", or \"follow the lady\" is essentially the same as the centuries-older [[shell game]] or ''thimblerig'' (except for the [[theatrical property|props]]).<ref>Tom Ogden ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Magic Tricks'', p. 123, Alpha Books (1998) {{ISBN|0-02-862707-5}}</ref> The trickster shows three [[playing card]]s to the audience, one of which is a queen (the \"lady\"), then places the cards face-down, shuffles them around, and invites the audience to bet on which one is the queen. At first the audience is skeptical, so the [[shill]] places a bet, and the scammer allows him to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/12/26/three-card-monte-scam-artists-return-to-midtown/|work=[[New York Post]]|title=Three-card monte scam artists return to midtown|quote=Is this Christmas 2014 \u2013 or 1974?|author1=Philip Messing|author2=Steve Cuozzo|date=December 26, 2014}}</ref> In one variation of the game, the shill will (apparently surreptitiously) peek at the lady, ensuring that the mark also sees the card. This is sometimes enough to entice the audience to place bets, but the trickster uses [[sleight of hand]] to ensure that he always loses, unless the con man decides to let him win, hoping to lure him into betting much more. The mark loses whenever the dealer chooses to make him lose. \n\nA variation on this scam exists in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], but with the addition of a pickpocket.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The dealer and shill behave in an overtly obvious manner, attracting a larger audience. When the pickpocket succeeds in stealing from a member of the audience, he signals the dealer. The dealer then shouts the word \"aguas\" \u2013 colloquial for \"Watch Out!\" \u2013 and the three split up. The audience is left believing that the police are coming, and that the performance was a failed scam.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nA variant of this scam exists in Mumbai, India.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} The shill says loudly to the dealer that his cards are fake and that he wants to see them. He takes the card and folds a corner and says in a hushed voice to the audience that he has marked the card. He places a bet and wins. Then he asks the others to place bets as well. When one of the audience bets a large sum of money, the cards are switched.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==Spurious qualifications or endorsements==\n\n===Diploma mill===\nGovernmental bodies maintain a list of entities which [[educational accreditation|accredit educational institutions]]. The US Department of Education, for instance, oversees [[higher education accreditation in the United States]].\n\nMost [[diploma mill]]s are not accredited by such an entity, although many obtain accreditation from other organizations (such as [[accreditation mill]]s or corrupt foreign officials) to appear legitimate. Graduates of these institutions risk that the qualifications gained at these institutions may not be sufficient for further study, lawful employment or professional licensure as their issuers do not hold locally-valid accreditation to grant the degrees.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nSome diploma mills perform no instruction or examination, instead issuing credentials based on payment and \"life experience\".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A few have unknowingly issued degrees and credentials to companion animals.<ref>Jennifer Feehan and [http://www.toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070228/NEWS03/702280424 \"Police dog's bachelor's degree prods legal howling about chief\"], ''Toledo Blade'', February 28, 2007</ref>\n\nThe [[Doctor of Divinity]] title is particularly prone to misuse.{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} In the [[United Kingdom]] it is an earned postdoctoral credential which requires a string of publications, but in the [[United States]] any church may confer it as an honorary title; [[ordination mill]]s readily grant this doctorate for a moderate fee and token amount of study.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kptv.com/story/23633416/online-ministerial-ordnation-available|title=You, too, can become a minister \u2013 online|first=Kimberly|last=Wright|publisher=KPTV|date=January 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Vanity publications and awards===\nA [[vanity press]] is a pay-to-publish scheme where a publishing house, typically an [[author mill]], obtains the bulk of its revenues from authors who pay to have their books published<ref name=\"Glatthorn\">{{cite book|last=Glatthorn|first=Alan A.|title=Publish or Perish \u2013 The Educator's Imperative: Strategies for Writing Effectively for Your Profession and Your School|date=June 15, 2002|publisher=Corwin Press|isbn=9780761978671|page=[https://archive.org/details/publishorperisht0000glat/page/84 84]|chapter=9.

The growth of [[print on demand]], which allows small quantities of books to be printed cheaply, has accelerated this trend.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nVanity publishing is not the same as [[self-publishing]], in that self-published authors own their finished books and control their distribution, relying on a [[printer (publishing)|print shop]] solely to turn camera-ready content into printed volumes.

The software then pretends to find multiple viruses on the victim's computer, \"removes\" a few, and asks for payment in order to take care of the rest. They are then linked to con artists' websites, professionally designed to make their bogus software appear legitimate, where they must pay a fee to download the \"full version\" of their \"antivirus software\".\n\n===[[Phishing]]===\nA modern scam in which the artist communicates with the mark, masquerading as a representative of an official organization with which the mark is doing business, in order to extract personal information which can then be used, for example, to steal money. In a typical instance, the artist sends the mark an email pretending to be from a company, such as [[eBay]]. It is formatted exactly like email from that business, and will ask the mark to \"verify\" some personal information at the website, to which a link is provided, in order to \"reactivate\" his blocked account. The website is fake but designed to look exactly like the business' website. The site contains a [[form (web)|form]] asking for personal information such as [[credit card number]]s, which the mark feels compelled to give or lose all access to the service. When the mark submits the form (without double-checking the [[Uniform Resource Locator|website address]]), the information is sent to the swindler.\n\nA similar [[caller ID spoofing]] scheme exists with misleading telephone calls (\"vishing\") facilitated by [[voice over IP|Internet telephony]]. A fraudster can make calls through an Internet-[[PSTN]] gateway to impersonate banks, police, schools or other trusted entities. A random dialer computer or auto-dialer can impersonate healthcare providers to get Social Security numbers and birthdates from elderly patients recently released from the hospital. The auto-dialer call states it is from a reputable hospital or a pharmacy and the message explains the need to \"update records\" to be from the hospital or a pharmacy.\n\nOther online scams include [[advance-fee fraud]], [[bidding fee auction]]s (\"penny auctions\"), [[click fraud]], [[domain slamming]], various [[spoofing attack]]s, [[web-cramming]], and online versions of [[employment scams]], [[romance scam]]s, and [[#fake reward|fake rewards]].\n\n===Fake support call===\n{{main article|Technical support scam}}\nUnsuspecting computer owners and users are being targeted by people claiming to be from [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], i.e., [[Microsoft]] or from their [[internet provider]] and then telling them that their computer/machine is creating errors and they need to correct the faults on their computers. They can even get people to go to one site or another to show them these so-called errors, at which point they are required to give their credit card details in order to purchase some form of support, after which they are asked to allow remote connection to the \"error-laden\" computer so that the problem(s) may be fixed.

Some victims of the technical support scam may have their information sold or traded to a new organization that will cold-call them and tell them that they are entitled to a refund for the support they have previously paid for. Alternatively, the scammer may impersonate a security company and convince the victim that hackers are manipulating their bank account. The goal is for the scammer to transfer money between the user's accounts and to use HTML editing in the browser to make it appear as though new money has been transferred into the account by a legitimate company. The scammer sends a large amount of money and convinces the victim that they must send the majority of the money to the scammer via a wire transfer, a money order, or gift cards.\n\n==Religion-based schemes==\n\n===The Affinity Church scam===\n\u201cAffinity\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=https://scambusters.org/churchscam.html|title=Don't be Exploited by Church Scam Artists.HTML}}</ref>simply means something like \u201ca shared understanding, interest or belief.\u201d And claiming to share someone else's viewpoint is the sneaky cover many church scam artists use.\nPretending to share their faith lulls members of religious organizations into thinking a scammer is genuine.\nOften claiming some kind of divine guidance, using religious slogans, or claiming to be raising funds for a religious or other worthy cause, church scammers invite their new \u201cfriends\u201d to invest in what turns out to be nothing more than a [[Ponzi Scheme]] paying for their personal lifestyle.\nThis is such a common crime that the state of Arizona listed affinity scams of this type as its number one scam for 2009.\nIn one recent nationwide religious scam, churchgoers are said to have lost more than $50 million in a phony gold bullion scheme, promoted on daily telephone \u201cprayer chains,\u201d in which they thought they could earn a huge return.\n\n==Other confidence tricks and scams==\n\n===Art student===\nThe [[art student scam]] is common in major Chinese cities. A small group of 'students' will start a conversation, citing a wish to practice their English. In short order they will maneuver the conversation over to education and will claim to be art students wishing to take the mark to a free art exhibition, which will usually be in a small, well-hidden rented office. Once there the students will show the mark some art pieces which they claim to be their own work and will try to sell them at a high price, despite the pieces usually being nothing more than a worthless printout. They will often resort to 'guilt tricks' (e.g., introducing their \"starving child\") to overcome resistance or to discourage price negotiation on the part of the mark.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Bar bill scam===\nThe bar bill scam is common in Europe,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steves|first1=Rick|title=Tourist Scams and Rip-Offs in Europe|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/tourist-scams|website=Rick Steves' Europe|accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref> especially [[Budapest, Hungary]].<ref name=\"UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy\">{{cite web|title=Tourist Advisory for Hungary|url=http://hungary.usembassy.gov/tourist_advisory.html|website=Embassy of the United States|accessdate=10 June 2016|language=English|date=January 16, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160326024226/http://hungary.usembassy.gov/tourist_advisory.html|archivedate=26 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Budapest Bar Scam|url=http://www.budapestagent.com/budapest-bar-scam.html|website=Budapest Agent|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=8 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Sylvester|first1=Phil|title=Bar scams: How to enjoy your S\u00f6r in peace!|url=https://www.worldnomads.com/travel-safety/eastern-europe/hungary/budapest-bar-scams|website=World Nomads|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=11 Jun 2015}}</ref> A mark, usually a man who is a tourist, is approached by an attractive woman or pair of women who start a conversation, such as asking for directions (pretending to have mistaken the tourist for a local). After a bit of conversation, the women will suggest that they go to a bar that they know of. While there, they order many entr\u00e9es and drinks and encourage the mark to do the same. Either the menu does not have prices on it or the menu is later switched with one that has higher prices.\n\nWhen the bill comes, it is many times larger than expected. The women have only a small amount of cash on them, and ask the mark to pay for the bill. The mark is forced to pay before leaving (sometimes with threats of violence), and directed to an ATM on the premises where they can withdraw cash. The women apologize profusely for the situation and arrange to meet the next day to pay them back, but they do not show. In truth, the women are working with the bar and receive a cut of the payment.<ref name=\"UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy\" />\n\nThe con can also be performed with a well-dressed man or a gregarious local rather than an attractive woman. A variation on this is to have a taxi driver recommend the bar to the passenger, who enters alone and orders, not realizing that they will be charged an exorbitant bill. The taxi driver receives a cut of the payment.<ref name=\"UnitedStatesHungaryEmbassy\" />\n\n===Beijing tea===\n\nThe Beijing tea scam is a famous variation of the [[Clip Joint]] scam practiced in and around [[Beijing]] and some other large Chinese cities. The artists (usually female and working in pairs) will approach tourists and try to make friends. After chatting, they will suggest a trip to see a [[Chinese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]], claiming that they have never been to one before. The tourist is never shown a menu, but assumes that this is how things are done in China. After the ceremony, the bill is presented to the tourist, charging upwards of $100 per head. The artists will then hand over their bills, and the tourists are obliged to follow suit. Similar scams involving restaurants, coffee shops and bars also take place.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.bamboocompass.com/china-scams-the-teahouse-scam-12769.html\n | title = China Scams: The Teahouse Scam\n | date = 8 December 2011\n | website = Bamboo Compass\n | publisher = Ctrip International\n | access-date = 24 August 2016\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160801050604/http://www.bamboocompass.com/china-scams-the-teahouse-scam-12769.html\n | archive-date = 1 August 2016\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blog.beijingholiday.com/travel-tips/tea-house-scam/\n | title = Tea House Scam\n | date = 6 April 2010\n | website = Beijing Holiday\n | publisher = Beijing Holiday\n | access-date = 24 August 2016\n }}</ref>\n\n===Big Store===\nThe Big Store is a technique for selling the legitimacy of a scam and typically involves a large team of con artists and elaborate sets.

The most common form, \"the Short Count\", has been featured prominently in several movies about grifting, notably ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[Criminal (2004 film)|Criminal]]'', ''[[Nine Queens]]'', and ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]''. For example, a con artist targeting a [[cashier]] apologetically uses a ten-dollar bill to pay for an item costing less than a dollar, claiming not to have any smaller bills; the change of over nine dollars will include either nine singles or a five and four singles.  The con artist then claims to have found that he had a dollar bill, after all, and offers to change it and the nine dollars for the original ten.  If the con artist can manipulate the clerk into handing over the ten-dollar bill first, the con artist can then hand it back to the clerk in place of one of the singles the con artist was expected to give the clerk.  The con artist then pretends to notice he has \"mistakenly\" given the clerk nineteen dollars instead of ten; producing another single, the con artist suggests he add this to the nineteen and let the clerk give him back an even twenty.  The scam relies on the cashier's desire to keep small bills in the register, and the cashier's failure to notice that the con artist only ever provided twelve dollars (the original ten-dollar bill and two singles); the twenty dollars the clerk is left holding is a mix of the con artist's money and money from the store's register, while the con artist has stolen eight dollars (and, effectively, the cheap item that was purchased).  To avoid this con, clerks should keep each transaction separate and never permit the customer to handle the original ten before handing over the ten ones.\n\nAnother variation is to flash a $20 bill to the clerk, then ask for something behind the counter. When the clerk turns away, the con artist can swap the bill he is holding to a lesser bill. The clerk might then make change for the larger bill, without noticing it has been swapped. The technique may work better when bills are the same color at a glance like, for instance, [[Federal Reserve Note|U.S. dollar bills]].  A similar technique exists when a con artist asks to use a very large denomination bill to purchase a cheap item.  The con artist distracts the clerk with conversation while the clerk is preparing the change, in hopes that the clerk will hand over the large amount of change without realizing that the con artist never actually handed over the large bill.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Sometimes cab drivers in India try a similar con, when customers require some change back. For example, they may pay $100 for a $60 ride and expect a return of $40. But the con would say that he only received $10 and in fact needs $50 more. The mark is baffled, trying to remember and of course, the con has swiftly switched the $100 bill with a $10 one, waving it to show that this was really what the mark gave to him. Since the con has now made the mark look suspicious, the mark feels guilty and pays up. This scenario can also be created in markets, when vendors sometimes team up and support each other's cons, if the mark tries to resist.\n\n[[Tens and a Five|Another variant]] is to use confusing or misdirected language.\n\n===Fake casting agent scam===\nIn this scam, the confidence artist poses as a [[casting agent]] for a [[modeling agency]] searching for new talent. The aspiring model is told that he will need a portfolio or [[comp card]]. The mark will pay an upfront fee to have photos and create his portfolio, after which he will be sent on his way in the hope that his agent will find him work in the following weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.associationofmodelagents.org/become-a-model/beware-rogues.html |title=Beware Rogues &#124; Become A Model |publisher=Association of Model Agents |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> Of course, he never hears back from the confidence artist.\n\nIn a variation on this scam, the confidence artist is a casting agent involved with the [[adult entertainment industry]]. The mark is taken to the artist's office for an interview, in which she is told that she will have to pose for nude photos or shoot a casting video, usually involving sexual acts. Upon her agreement, the mark is sent on her way, as before. She may not have to pay upfront for a portfolio, but any material generated during her \"interview\" may be used and sold by the confidence artist without any payment to the mark.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe fake-agent scam is often targeted against industry newcomers, since they will often lack the experience required to spot such tricks.  Legitimate talent agencies advise that a genuine talent agent will never ask for money up-front, as they make their entire living from commissions on their clients' earnings.\n\n===Phony job offer scam===\n\nVery similar to the casting agent scam is the \"job offer\" scam in which a victim receives an unsolicited e-mail claiming that they are in consideration for hiring to a new job.  The confidence artist will usually obtain the victim's name from social networking sites, such as [[LinkedIn]] and [[Monster.com]].  In many cases, those running the scams will create fake websites listing jobs which the victim is seeking, then contact the victim to offer them one of the positions.\n\nIf the victim responds to the initial e-mail, the scammer will send additional messages to build up the victim's assurance that they are in the running, or have already been selected, for a legitimate job.  This will include asking for the victim's resume as well as assurances that a phone interview will be the \"next step in the hiring process\".\n\nThe goal of the job offer scam is to convince the victim to release funds or bank account information to the scammer of which there are two common methods.  The first is to advise the victim that they must take a test to qualify for the job and then send links to training sites which sell testing material and [[e-books]] for a fee.  The victim may also be provided with an actual on-line test which is usually a fake website created by copying questions from actual certification examinations, such as the [[Professional in Human Resources]] (PHR) certification or the [[Project manager]]'s exam.  if the victim pays for the study material, that will usually be the end of the scam and the scammer will break off further contact.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ripoffreport.com/r/DHR-Search/Austin-Texas/Douglas-Hurley-Reynolds-DHR-Search-Tom-Thomas-Palmer-DHR-Search-Tom-Palmer-Scam-1101165|title=Ripoff Report - DHR Search Complaint Review Austin, Texas: 1101165}}</ref>\n\nA second, more sinister variation, is when the scammer will advise the victim they have been hired for a job and request access to bank accounts and routing numbers in order to enter the \"new hire\" into the company's payroll system.  This may also involve e-mails containing fake tax forms attempting to gain the victim's social security number and other [[personally identifiable information]].  If the victim complies, their bank account will be emptied and their personal information used to commit identity theft.\n\n===Fraudulent directory solicitations===\n{{OR section|date=January 2018}}\nIn this scam, tens of thousands of solicitations in the guise of an invoice are mailed to businesses nationwide. They may contain a disclaimer such as \"This is a solicitation for the order of goods or services, or both, and not a bill, invoice, or statement of account due. You are under no obligation to make any payments on account of this offer unless you accept this offer.\" (from {{USCSub|39|3001|d|2|A}}) or 'THIS IS NOT A BILL. THIS IS A SOLICITATION. YOU ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PAY THE AMOUNT STATED ABOVE UNLESS YOU ACCEPT THIS OFFER.' (from USPS Domestic Mail Manual \u00a7CO31, Part 1.2) but are otherwise designed to appear to be invoices or renewals of existing [[display advertising]] in a trade directory or publication. The correspondence is formatted like an invoice, often with a sequential identification number, date, personalized description of the information to be published, payment details and total amount due which includes a token discount if paid within a specified time period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://about.usps.com/who-we-are/judicial/admin-decisions/1999/for-98421.htm|title=P.

The \"registration\" actually offers nothing beyond a vague claim that the entity sending the solicitation will submit the victim's domain name to existing search engines for an inflated fee. It does not obligate the vendor to publish a directory, renew the underlying domain in any ICANN-based registry or deliver any tangible product.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suespammers.net/domain-services-spam/|title=DOMAIN SERVICES SPAM 212-913-9860|publisher=SueSpammers.net}}</ref>\n\nA similar scheme uses solicitations which appear to be invoices for local [[yellow pages]] listings or advertisements. As anyone can publish a yellow page directory, the promoted book is not the [[incumbent local exchange carrier]]'s local printed directory but a rival, which may have limited distribution if it appears at all.<ref>[http://myfloridalegal.com/pages.nsf/main/cfb28f1ad880960585256cc9006a3a8c!OpenDocument How to Protect Yourself: Yellow Pages Invoice Scam], Florida Attorney General's Office</ref> Instead of clearly stating [[International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Circulations|audited circulation]], the solicitations will confusingly claim to \"offer 50000 copies\" or claim \"thousands of readers\" without indicating whether the inferred quantity of directories was actually printed, let alone sold.\n\nPublic records listing legal owners of new [[registered trademark]]s are also mined as a source of addresses for fraudulent directory solicitations.\n\nThe intent is that a small fractional percentage of businesses either mistake the solicitations for invoices (paying them) or mistake them for a request for corrections and updates to an existing listing (a tactic to obtain a businessperson's signature on the document, which serves as a pretext to bill the victim).\n\nOne such vendor, World Trade Register (aka European Trade Register, World Company Register, World Business Directory, all related to EU Business Services Ltd), claims \"To update your company profile, please print, complete and return this form. Updating is free of charge. Only sign if you want to place an insertion.\" Only later does it become clear that signing the form incurs a nearly \u20ac1000/year fee for an advertisement of questionable value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Scam-World-Trade-Register-Business-Registration-Is-Free-but-it-Costs-a-Lot-280317.shtml|title=Scam: World Trade Register Business Registration Is \"Free\", but It Costs a Lot|author=Eduard Kovacs|date=10 July 2012|work=softpedia}}</ref>\n\n===Jam Auction===\nIn this scam, the confidence artist poses as a retail sales promoter, representing a manufacturer, distributor, or set of stores. The scam requires assistants to manage the purchases and money exchanges while the pitchman keeps the energy level up. Passersby are enticed to gather and listen to a pitchman standing near a mass of appealing products. The trickster entices by referring to the high-end products, but claims to be following rules that he must start with smaller items. The small items are described, and 'sold' for a token dollar amount \u2013 with as many audience participants as are interested each receiving an item. The pitchman makes an emotional appeal such as saying \"Raise your hand if you're happy with your purchase\", and when hands are raised, directs his associates to return everyone's money (they keep the product). This exchange is repeated with items of increasing value to establish the expectation of a pattern. Eventually, the pattern terminates by ending the 'auction' without reaching the high-value items, and stopping midway through a phase where the trickster retains the collected money from that round of purchases. Marks feel vaguely dissatisfied, but have goods in their possession, and the uplifting feeling of having demonstrated their own happiness several times. The marks do not realize that the total value of goods received is significantly less than the price paid in the final round. Auction/refund rounds may be interspersed with sales rounds that are not refunded, keeping marks off-balance and hopeful that the next round will refund. The Jam Auction has its roots in [[carny]] culture.\n\n===Money exchange===\nThis scam occurs when exchanging foreign currency. If a large amount of cash is exchanged the victim will be told to hide the money away quickly before counting it (\"You can't trust the locals\"). A substantial amount will be missing.\n\nIn some cases, insisting on counting to make sure the money is all there is the basis for a clever scam. The scam is sometimes called the Santo Domingo Sting, after an incident that took place there, reported by a journalist, Joe Harkins, who reported his involvement, in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travelthenet.com/columns/clips/sting.htm |title=The Santo Domingo Sting |publisher=Travelthenet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> It works in countries where only banks and other designated parties are allowed to hold and exchange the local currency for US dollars at an \"official\" rate that is significantly lower than the \"street\" rate. It also requires a greedy tourist who wants to beat the official rate by dealing with illegal money changers. A person posing as an illegal money changer will approach the tourist with an offer to buy dollars at an illegal rate that may be even higher than the street rate. The changer offers to buy only large US currency, typically, a 100 dollar bill. As soon as the victim (the \"mark\") shows his $100 bill, the changer will actually count out and clearly show the promised amount of local currency. He then will push the local currency into the hands of the \"mark\" and urge they be counted as he takes the $100. \"See, you've got the money. I'll wait while you make sure. Count it out loud so there is no mistake.\" And as the mark's careful count exceeds \"street\" rate, the changer pretends to realise he has overpaid the mark, and he becomes irrationally agitated and angry, accusing the mark of cheating. He grabs his money back, pushes the mark's bill back into his hands and takes back the pesos. The scam has been completed. The tourist has just lost $99. The mark has been handed back a prefolded $1 bill that has been swapped for the mark's $100 bill while he was distracted counting the local currency. (Until recently, US currency was largely uniform in size and color, meaning that when folded, a $1 and a $100 bill were almost indistinguishable. Even in 2014, careful folding of a US$100 bill easily conceals the switch).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The money changer's pretended, but very credible, anger is a ruse to confuse the mark and delay his unfolding of the single bill until the scammer has departed.\n\n===Mystery shopping===\nThere is a fraudulent [[confidence trick]] (a form of [[advance-fee scam]]) perpetrated on people in several countries who wish to be [[mystery shopping|mystery shoppers]]. A person is sent a [[money order]], often from [[Western Union]],<ref name=spotscams/> or check for a larger sum than a mystery purchase he is required to make, with a request to deposit it into his [[bank account]], use a portion for a mystery purchase and fee, and wire the remainder through a [[wire transfer]] company such as Western Union or MoneyGram; the money is to be wired immediately as response time is being evaluated. The cheque is fraudulent, and is returned unpaid by the victim's bank, after the money has been wired.<ref>{{cite web|author=Related Items |url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre40.shtm |title=Giving the Bounce to Counterfeit Cheque Scams |publisher=US Federal Trade Commission |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> One scam involved fraudulent [[website]]s using a misspelled [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] to advertise online and in newspapers under a legitimate company's name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/08-19-08-adscam.asp |title=Residents warned of job ad scam |accessdate=2013-07-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322232916/http://www.northernlife.ca/News/PoliceandCourt/2008/08-19-08-adscam.asp |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> It should be remembered that this is not the only type of mystery shopping scam taking place which involves money being paid, as it has been widely reported in the UK that shoppers should \"Watch out for some online mystery shopping scams which will cost you money for either training or for signing up without the promise of any work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysteryshopperjobs.co.uk/faq/ |title=Frequently Asked Questions: Is Mystery Shopping A Scam? |publisher=Mystery Shopper Jobs |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref>\n\nValid mystery shopping companies do not normally send their clients cheques prior to work being completed, and their [[advertisement]]s usually include a contact person and phone number. Some fraudulent cheques can be identified by a financial professional. On February 3, 2009, The [[Internet Crime Complaint Center]] issued a warning on this scam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ic3.gov/media/2009/090203.aspx |title=Internet Crime Complaint Center warning |publisher=Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3.gov) |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> A legitimate company that occasionally sends prepayment for large transactions says \"We do occasionally fund upfront for very large spend purchases but we use cheques or direct bank transfers which should mean you can see when they are cleared and so can be sure you really do have the money.\"<ref name=spotscams>{{cite web|url=http://www.mystery-shoppers.co.uk/mystery_shopper_scams.htm |title=Mystery Shopper Scams \u2013 How to spot a scam |publisher=Mystery-shoppers.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}</ref> It is standard practice for mystery shopping providers evaluating services such as airlines to arrange for the airfare to be issued beforehand at their own expenses (usually by means of a [[frequent flyer]] reward ticket). In any case, it is unlikely that any bona-fide provider would allocate a high-value assignment to a new shopper or proactively recruit new ones for that purpose, preferring instead to work with a pool of existing pre-vetted experienced shoppers.\n\n===Pigeon drop===\nThe [[pigeon drop]], which is depicted early in the film ''[[The Sting]]'', involves the mark or pigeon assisting an elderly, weak or infirm stranger to keep a large sum of money safe for him. In the process, the stranger (actually a confidence trickster) puts his money with the mark's money in an envelope or briefcase, with which the mark is then to be entrusted. The container is first switched for an identical one which contains no money, and a situation is engineered giving the mark the opportunity to escape, with the money, from a perceived threat (e.g., local police or rowdies). If the mark does so, he is fleeing from his own money, which the con artist will have kept or handed off to an accomplice.\n\n===Predatory journals===\nA number of [[predatory journal]]s target academics to solicit manuscripts for publication. The journals charge high publication fees but do not perform the functions of legitimate academic journals\u2014editorial oversight and peer review\u2014they simply publish the work for cash. In this case, the mark's need for publications is the incentive for them to pay the fees. In some cases, predatory journals will use fictional editorial boards or use respected academics' names without permission to lend a veneer of credibility to the journal. A curated database of predatory journals can be found at \"Scholarly Open Access\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/01/02/list-of-predatory-publishers-2014/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422234744/http://scholarlyoa.com/2014/01/02/list-of-predatory-publishers-2014/ |archivedate=2014-04-22 }}</ref>\n\n===Promotional cheque===\nThe victim is sent a document which looks, on its face, to be a [[coupon]] or a [[cheque]] for some small amount as \"prize winnings\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/1-800-charges-linked-to-company-accused-of-targeting-seniors-1.2854371 | title=1-800 charges linked to company accused of targeting seniors | work=CBC | date=December 1, 2014 | accessdate=September 12, 2016 | first=Rosa | last=Marchitelli}}</ref> Buried in the fine print is something entirely different; an authorisation to [[telephone slamming|slam]] the victim to an alternative telephony provider or even an authorisation for monthly direct withdrawals from the victim's bank account for \"services\" which were neither used nor desired.\n\n===Psychic surgery===\n[[Psychic surgery]] is a con game in which the trickster uses [[sleight of hand]] to apparently remove malignant growths from the mark's body. A common form of medical fraud in [[developing country|underdeveloped countries]], it imperils victims who may fail to seek competent medical attention. The movie ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' depicts comedian [[Andy Kaufman]] undergoing psychic surgery. It can also be seen in an episode of ''[[Jonathan Creek]]''.\n\n===Rain making===\n[[Rainmaking]] is a simple scam in which the trickster promises to use their power or influence over a complex system to make it do something favourable for the mark.\n\nClassically this was promising to make it rain,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/pay_the_rainmaker.htm|title=Nebraska State Historical Society \u2013 Should We Pay The Rainmaker?}}</ref> but more modern examples include getting someone's app 'featured' on an [[app store]], obtaining pass marks in a university entrance exam, obtaining a job, or a politician implying that they can use their influence to get a contract awarded to the mark.\n\nThe trickster has no actual influence on the outcome, but if the favourable outcome happens anyway they will then claim credit. \nIf the event doesn't happen of course then the trickster may be able to claim that they need more money until it finally does.\n\n===Recovery room===\n{{see also|Reloading scam}}\nA recovery room scam is a form of [[advance-fee fraud]] where the scammer (sometimes posing as a law enforcement officer or attorney) calls investors who have been sold worthless shares (for example in a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler-room scam]]), and offers to buy them, to allow the investors to recover their investments.<ref name=WWang06>{{cite book |author=Wang, Wallace |title=Steal This Computer Book 4.0 : What They Won't Tell You About the Internet |publisher=No Starch Press |location=San Francisco |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-59327-105-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/stealthiscompute0000wang_w7x7 }}</ref> A Nigerian [[419 scam]] victim might receive a solicitation claiming to be from the Nigeria Economic and Financial Crimes Commission or another government agency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scam-detector.com/financial-scams/fraud-recovery-fund|title=Fraud recovery fund \u2013 Financial Scams |work=Scam Detector}}</ref>\n\nThe scam involves requiring an advance fee before the payment can take place, for example a \"court fee\".<ref name=\"isbn0-7407-5708-3\">{{cite book |author=Weinberg, Michael C. |title=Careers in Crime: An Applicant's Guide |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing |location=Kansas City, MO |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=978-0-7407-5708-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe red flag in the 'recovery scam' is that the supposed investigative agency, unsolicited, approaches the victim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0102-refund-and-recovery-scams|title=Refund and Recovery Scams|publisher=US Federal Trade Commission}}</ref> A legitimate law enforcement agency would normally allow the victim to make the first contact, and will not solicit an advance fee.

The vendor asks for first and last month's rent up front, sometimes also asking for references or personal information from the prospective tenants. The rent payment clears the bank, the new tenants arrive with a truckload of worldly possessions on moving day to find that the same unit has been rented to multiple other new tenants and that the supposed \"landlord\" is not the owner of the property and is nowhere to be found.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/craigslist-luxury-rental-scam-leaves-vancouver-tenants-on-the-sidewalk-1.2896233|title=Luxury rental scam leaves would-be renters on the sidewalk|first=Natalie|last=Clancy|work=CBC|date=January 9, 2015 }}</ref> This kind of scam is often performed online on students planning to study abroad and seeking accommodation, as their means of checking the property are limited.<ref>{{cite arXiv|title=The gift of the gab: Are rental scammers skilled at the arts of persuasion?|author1=Sophie Van Der Zee |author2=Richard Clayton |author3=Ross Anderson |date=November 30, 2019 |class=cs.CY|eprint=1911.08253}}</ref>\n\n===Rip deal===\nThe Rip Deal is a swindle very popular in [[Europe]] and is essentially a [[pigeon drop]] confidence trick. In a typical variation scammers will target, say, a jeweler, and offer to buy some substantial amount of his wares at a large markup ''provided'' he perform some type of under-the-table cash deal, originally exchanging Swiss francs for euros. This exchange goes through flawlessly, at considerable profit for the mark. Some time later the scammers approach the mark with a similar proposition, but for a larger amount of money (and thus a larger return for the mark). His confidence and greed inspired by the previous deal, the merchant agrees\u2014only to have his money and goods taken, by sleight-of-hand or violence, at the point of exchange.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} This scam was depicted in the movie ''[[Matchstick Men (film)|Matchstick Men]]''.\n\nThe same term is used to describe a crime where a vendor (especially a drug dealer) is killed to avoid paying for goods.<ref name=\"isbn1-84310-384-2\">{{cite book |author1=Florence Bruce |author2=Hagell, Ann |author3=Renuka Yeyarajah-dent |title=Children Who Commit Acts of Serious Interpersonal Violence: Messages for Best Practice |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |location=London |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-84310-384-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Unsolicited goods===\nVarious schemes exist to bill victims for unsolicited goods or services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocp.ga.gov/news/press-releases/view/fraudulent-invoices-on-the-rise|title=Fraudulent Invoices on the Rise|publisher=ocp.ga.gov}}</ref>\n\nA common scam targeting businesses is the '''toner bandit''' swindle; an unsolicited caller attempts to trick front-office personnel into providing manufacturer/model or serial numbers for office equipment and/or the name of the employee answering the call.

An automated message says \"that someone has ordered a free medical alert system for you, and this call is to confirm shipping instructions\" before the call is transferred to a live operator who requests the elderly patient's credit card and identity card numbers. The device is not free; there is a high monthly charge for \"monitoring\".

In the first type of fraud, the wedding planner company may offer a free wedding in a tie-up with a media station for a couple in need of charity, and collect the donations from the public that were meant for the wedding. In a second type of fraud, the planner asks couples to write checks to vendors (tents, food, cakes) but leave the name field empty, which the planner promises to fill in. As most vendors were never hired nor paid, the scam would then be exposed on the day of the wedding. A real life example is a Kansas TV station story of a wedding planner, Caitlin Hershberger Theis, who scammed three couples through her wedding planner consultancy, ''Live, Love and be Married'' using these two schemes.<ref>Wedding Planner Scams{{cite news|title=Newlyweds Say Wedding Planner Scammed Them|url=http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newly_Weds_Say_Wedding_Planner_Scammed_Them_124814899.html?storySection=story|date=June 30, 2011|work=KAKE.com|accessdate=July 1, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175444/http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Newly_Weds_Say_Wedding_Planner_Scammed_Them_124814899.html?storySection=story|archivedate=January 18, 2012}} </ref>\n\n===Blessing scam===\nThe [[blessing scam]] targets elderly Chinese immigrant women, convincing them that an evil spirit threatens their family and that this threat can be removed by a blessing ceremony involving a bag filled with their savings, jewelry or other valuables. During the ceremony, the con artists switch the bag of valuables with an identical bag with valueless contents and make off with the victim's cash or jewelry.\n\n===Pay up or be arrested scam===\nThis scam is perpetrated through the phone where the caller threatens the victim with a fictitious arrest warrant. To make this threat seem real, the [[caller ID spoofing|caller ID]] identifies the caller as that of the local [[sheriff]]. Victims are told they must pay a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] to avoid arrest. Fines are in the hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars. The payment is requested through [[Western Union]], [[Green Dot Corporation|Green Dot]] [[Prepaid debit card|prepaid card]], or similar form of untraceable currency exchange.\n\nCases have been reported in [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kansas]] and [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Steph Solis |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/08/08/arrest-warrant-scams/2619187/ |title=Scam: Caller threatens arrest if you don't pay |publisher=USA Today |date=2013-08-08 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Public transport ticket control scam ===\n\nIn this scam, the artists pose as ticket control staff on public transport connections. They tend to look for tourists as easy marks, and therefore target train connections from the airport. They will ask to see the passenger's tickets, and once they have found a suitable mark, will claim that something is wrong with the ticket they hold.

The con artist pretends to accidentally drop his wallet in a public place. After an unsuspecting victim picks up the wallet and offers it to the con artist, the scam begins. The artist accuses the victim of stealing money from the wallet and threatens to call the police, scaring the victim into returning the allegedly stolen money. Cases have been reported in eastern Europe and major cities or railway stations in China.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikivoyage|Common scams}}\n*[[Great Reality TV Swindle]]\n*[[Kansas City Shuffle]]\n*[[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]\n*[[Psychological manipulation]]\n*[[Sick baby hoax]]\n*[[Spanish Prisoner]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Scams and confidence tricks|state=expanded}}\n{{Psychological manipulation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Confidence Tricks}}\n[[Category:Crime-related lists|Confidence tricks]]\n[[Category:Confidence tricks|*]]\n", "name_user": "24.155.228.75", "label": "vandal", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confidence_tricks"}

He lives with his recently divorced father, who works from home and makes Jeremy uncomfortable by refusing to wear pants in the house. At school, Jeremy is bullied by popular student Rich Goranski, who writes \"boyf\" on his backpack. His \"best friend\", Michael Mell, (on whose backpack Rich has written \"riends\") tries to comfort Jeremy by telling him that being a loser is okay. Jeremy's long-time crush Christine Canigula signs up for the school play, and he decides to as well. Jeremy wonders if someone can help him \"more than survive\" (\"More Than Survive\").\n\nAs they wait for the first play rehearsal to begin, Christine professes her love of theater to Jeremy, because she can play different people and always knows what to say and performs (\"I Love Play Rehearsal\"). The drama teacher, Mr. Reyes, reveals that the school play will be ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future, re-titled ''A Midsummer Nightmare (About Zombies)''. During rehearsal, Jake Dillinger, one of the popular boys, flirts with Christine, making Jeremy jealous (\"More Than Survive (Reprise)\"). \n\nJeremy is confronted in the bathroom by Rich, who tells Jeremy how he managed his rise to popularity: as an unpopular freshman, he took a pill called a \"super quantum unit Intel processor\"\u2014a \"SQUIP\"\u2014containing a computer that implants itself inside the user's brain and tells the user what to do and say. Rich suggests that Jeremy buy one in order to become cooler (\"The Squip Song\").\n\nWhile playing video games with Michael, Jeremy tells him about Rich's offer. After an awkward conversation with his dad (still not wearing pants), Jeremy decides to check the SQUIP out. Jeremy assures Michael that, no matter what happens, they'll always be a team (\"Two-Player Game\").\n\nThe two visit the mall to buy the SQUIP from a dealer at [[Payless ShoeSource]]. Jeremy, as instructed, swallows it with green [[Mountain Dew]]. When the SQUIP activates, it causes Jeremy to have a seizure in front of Christine and Jake (\"The Squip Enters\"). The SQUIP (in the guise of [[Keanu Reeves]]), criticizes Jeremy's appearance, personality, and behavior, telling him that everything about him is terrible (\"Be More Chill, Pt. 1\"). The SQUIP orders him to go to a store to buy a new [[Eminem]] shirt. Jeremy encounters two popular girls from school, Brooke Lohst and Chloe Valentine, and the SQUIP helps Jeremy fabricate a story in order to create empathy with the two girls. They offer Jeremy a ride home (\"Do You Wanna Ride?\"), which the SQUIP demands he accept, but Jeremy declines because he does not wish to leave Michael in the mall. The girls leave, and the SQUIP lies to Jeremy and tells him that Michael has left the mall. It tells him that in order for its plan to improve his social standing to work, Jeremy needs to obey every order it gives him (\"Be More Chill, Pt. 2\").\n\nThe next day, Jeremy heads to school with renewed confidence, wondering if he might be less invisible than before. The SQUIP delves into the inner psyche of the student body around him, giving Jeremy insight on the fears and insecurities of his fellow peers. Jeremy's SQUIP syncs itself with Rich's, instantly making them friends. Jeremy heads confidently to the play rehearsal (\"Sync Up\"). Christine tells Jeremy about her feelings for a guy she knows, who Jeremy initially believes is himself, but who turns out to be Jake (\"A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into\"). \n\nAfterward, the SQUIP informs Jeremy that Christine won't date him until his social standing drastically improves. Encouraging Jeremy to use an interested Brooke as a stepping stone to greater popularity, he hooks up with her, while Jake asks Christine to come to his house (\"Upgrade\"). Overwhelmed, Jeremy asks the SQUIP to shut itself off for a few minutes. Immediately, Jeremy sees Michael and is elated but Michael states that Jeremy has been ignoring him all day. The SQUIP explains that it was using \"[[optic nerve]] blocking\" to block Michael from Jeremy's vision and that in order to be more popular he has to \"upgrade to Jeremy 2.0\" which is like watching your heart be Ripped From Your Chest. Jeremy eventually decides he is tired of being a loser and turns on optic nerve blocking, leaving him alone with the SQUIP (\"Loser Geek Whatever\").\n\n=== Act Two === \n\nOn Halloween, Jake hosts a large party that features alcohol and other shenanigans (\"Halloween\"). Christine arrives in a revealing princess costume, hoping to please Jake, but he brushes her aside to party. Jeremy arrives to meet Brooke, but Chloe, who is jealous of Brooke, tries to seduce Jeremy. Jeremy is uncomfortable and tries to get away, but the SQUIP forces him to remain in the situation as it escalates to Chloe making out with Jeremy (\"Do You Wanna Hang?\"). Chloe also has Jeremy drink alcohol, causing the SQUIP to malfunction, and then feigns having sex with him, angering Jake and breaking Brooke's heart.\n\nFleeing from Jake and the girls, Jeremy runs into a bathroom, where he finds Michael, who has crashed the party. Michael tries to warn Jeremy of the dangers of the SQUIP, explaining that someone ended up in a mental hospital after they went crazy trying to get it out of their head. Jeremy accuses Michael of being jealous of his popularity and calls him a loser. Michael, devastated and angry, locks himself in the bathroom, where he has a [[panic attack]] and sensory overload as he mourns the loss of his best and only friend (\"Michael in the Bathroom\"). Jeremy talks to Christine without the SQUIP's help and he asks her out in a burst of confidence (\"A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into (Reprise)\"). Christine, who has found herself in an existential crisis after breaking up with Jake, declines.\n\nMeanwhile, Rich goes around the party frantically asking people for [[Mountain Dew#Flavors and varieties|Mountain Dew Red]]. Jeremy's SQUIP finally reactivates and reviews the events of the night, prompting Jeremy to leave the party immediately. Rich, alone and desperate, talks to his SQUIP and then sets the house on fire. The next morning, Jenna Rolan, the school gossip, informs everyone that Rich had burned down Jake's house at the end of the party, sending Rich to the hospital and causing Jake to break both of his legs jumping out of a window while trying to escape. The news spreads throughout the school through text and tweeting (\"The Smartphone Hour (Rich Set a Fire)\").\n\nAt home, Jeremy is confronted by his father (still not wearing pants), who brings up Jeremy's new personality and change in attitude. Jeremy reprimands his father for his behavior since the divorce, calling him a loser as well. Shaken by Jeremy's words, Mr. Heere realizes that something is very wrong and that he must take charge. He tracks down Michael and asks him to not give up on his friend. Michael reluctantly agrees to help, on the condition that Mr. Heere puts on some pants and becomes a better father (\"The Pants Song\").\n\nAs the cast prepares for the play, Jeremy encounters Christine, who is shaken and upset about the fire. Jeremy is unhappy with the relationships he has damaged and angrily blames the SQUIP for his misfortune. The SQUIP instead blames it on \"human error\" and tells Jeremy he can improve the lives of the rest of the students, and eventually the whole world, by providing them all with SQUIPs. In Rich's locker, Jeremy finds a box full of SQUIPs, which Jeremy then pours into a beaker of Mountain Dew (\"The Pitiful Children\").  \n\nBackstage during the play, Christine confronts Jeremy over his use of the SQUIP, causing him to doubt the plan. However, the SQUIP has already begun to take over others in the play. The SQUIP reveals its intention to sync the entire student body, and then the whole world. Jeremy comes to a realization: Mountain Dew activates the SQUIP, while Mountain Dew Red deactivates it. Michael reappears from the audience with a bottle of Mountain Dew Red, which he gives to Jeremy after making him apologize for his actions, but a SQUIPed Jake dumps most of it out. Jeremy and Michael fight off the controlled students until the SQUIP reveals that Christine has been SQUIPed, and under its influence, she professes her love for Jeremy. Jeremy, however, realizes this is not what he had wanted and makes Christine drink the last of the red Mountain Dew: this causes a chain reaction that destroys the rest of the SQUIPS (\"The Play\").\n\nJeremy wakes up in the hospital, sharing a room with Rich, who proudly comes out to Jeremy as bisexual and is ready to finally be who he really is. Michael visits Jeremy and the two reconcile, and Mr. Heere (finally wearing pants) visits Jeremy as well, informing him that he'll be a better dad. Surrounded by his friends and family, Jeremy realizes that there will always be outside influences, but he needs to learn to make up his own mind instead. He asks Christine out again (for bowling alley performance art), and this time she accepts and kisses him. The SQUIP reveals itself to still be alive, weakly taunting Jeremy from inside his head, but Jeremy ignores it, happily proclaiming that \"of all the voices in my head, the loudest one is mine\" (\"Voices in My Head\").\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nSource:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act 1\n* \"Jeremy's Theme\" \u2013 Orchestra \n* \"More Than Survive\" \u2013 Jeremy, Michael & Ensemble\n* \"I Love Play Rehearsal\" \u2013 Christine\n* \"More Than Survive (Reprise)\" \u2013 Jeremy{{efn|An edited version of the song from the Off-Broadway production that was added in the Original Broadway production.}}\n* \"The SQUIP Song\" \u2013 Rich & Ensemble\n* \"Two-Player Game\" \u2013 Michael & Jeremy\n* \"The Squip Enters\" \u2013 Jeremy, Christine, Jake, Ensemble\n* \"Be More Chill Pt. 1\" \u2013 Squip, Jeremy & Mall People\n* \"Do You Wanna Ride?\" \u2013 Brooke & Chloe\n* \"Be More Chill Pt. 2\" \u2013 Squip, Jeremy & Mall People\n* \"Sync Up\" \u2014 Jeremy, Squip, Jake, Rich, Chloe, Brooke, Jenna{{efn|Added to the Original Broadway production to replace \"More Than Survive (Reprise)\".}}\n* \"More Than Survive (Reprise)\" \u2013 Jeremy, Squip & Ensemble{{efn|Removed from the Original Broadway production and reinserted after \"I Love Play Rehearsal\" with edited lyrics.}}\n* \"A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into\" \u2013 Christine, Jeremy, Squip & Ensemble\n* \"The SQUIP Lurks\" \u2013 Orchestra{{efn|Named \"The SQUIP Stalks\" in the Broadway production.}}\n* \"Upgrade\" \u2013 Brooke, Squip, Jeremy, Jake, Christine & Ensemble\n* \"Loser Geek Whatever\" \u2014 Jeremy{{efn|Added to the Original Broadway production.}}\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act 2\n* \"Halloween\" \u2013 Brooke, Jake, Chloe, Rich, Jenna & Ensemble\n* \"Do You Wanna Hang?\" \u2013 Chloe\n* \"Michael in the Bathroom\" \u2013 Michael & Ensemble\n* \"A Guy That I\u2019d Kinda Be Into (Reprise)\" - Christine & Jeremy{{efn|Added to the Original Broadway production.}}\n* \"The Smartphone Hour\" \u2013 Jenna, Chloe, Brooke & Ensemble\n* \"The Pants Song\" \u2013 Mr. Heere & Michael{{efn|Prior to the Off-Broadway production, the order of \"The Pants Song\" and \"The Pitiful Children\" was reversed.}}\n* \"The Pitiful Children\" \u2013 Squip, Jeremy, Jenna & Ensemble\n* \"The Play\" \u2013 Michael, Jake, Brooke, Chloe, Jeremy, Christine, Squip & Ensemble\n* \"Voices in My Head\" \u2013 Mr. Heere, Michael, Rich, Jeremy, Jenna, Brooke, Chloe, Jake, Christine & Ensemble\n\n{{col-end}}\n;Notes\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Roles and original casts==\n===Original productions===\nSource:<ref name=\":1\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At school, Jeremy is bullied by popular student Rich Goranski, who writes \"boyf\" on his backpack. His \"best friend\", Michael Mell, (on whose backpack Rich has written \"riends\") tries to comfort Jeremy by telling him that being a loser is okay. Jeremy's long-time crush Christine Canigula signs up for the school play, and he decides to as well. Jeremy wonders if someone can help him \"more than survive\" (\"More Than Survive\").\n\nAs they wait for the first play rehearsal to begin, Christine professes her love of theater to Jeremy, because she can play different people and always knows what to say and performs (\"I Love Play Rehearsal\"). The drama teacher, Mr. Reyes, reveals that the school play will be ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' set in a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future, re-titled ''A Midsummer Nightmare (About Zombies)''. During rehearsal, Jake Dillinger, one of the popular boys, flirts with Christine, making Jeremy jealous (\"More Than Survive (Reprise)\"). \n\nJeremy is confronted in the bathroom by Rich, who tells Jeremy how he managed his rise to popularity: as an unpopular freshman, he took a pill called a \"super quantum unit Intel processor\"\u2014a \"SQUIP\"\u2014containing a computer that implants itself inside the user's brain and tells the user what to do and say. Rich suggests that Jeremy buy one in order to become cooler (\"The Squip Song\").\n\nWhile playing video games with Michael, Jeremy tells him about Rich's offer. After an awkward conversation with his dad (still not wearing pants), Jeremy decides to check the SQUIP out. Jeremy assures Michael that, no matter what happens, they'll always be a team (\"Two-Player Game\").\n\nThe two visit the mall to buy the SQUIP from a dealer at [[Payless ShoeSource]]. Jeremy, as instructed, swallows it with green [[Mountain Dew]]. When the SQUIP activates, it causes Jeremy to have a seizure in front of Christine and Jake (\"The Squip Enters\"). The SQUIP (in the guise of [[Keanu Reeves]]), criticizes Jeremy's appearance, personality, and behavior, telling him that everything about him is terrible (\"Be More Chill, Pt. 1\"). The SQUIP orders him to go to a store to buy a new [[Eminem]] shirt. Jeremy encounters two popular girls from school, Brooke Lohst and Chloe Valentine, and the SQUIP helps Jeremy fabricate a story in order to create empathy with the two girls. They offer Jeremy a ride home (\"Do You Wanna Ride?\"), which the SQUIP demands he accept, but Jeremy declines because he does not wish to leave Michael in the mall. The girls leave, and the SQUIP lies to Jeremy and tells him that Michael has left the mall. It tells him that in order for its plan to improve his social standing to work, Jeremy needs to obey every order it gives him (\"Be More Chill, Pt. 2\").\n\nThe next day, Jeremy heads to school with renewed confidence, wondering if he might be less invisible than before. The SQUIP delves into the inner psyche of the student body around him, giving Jeremy insight on the fears and insecurities of his fellow peers. Jeremy's SQUIP syncs itself with Rich's, instantly making them friends. Jeremy heads confidently to the play rehearsal (\"Sync Up\"). Christine tells Jeremy about her feelings for a guy she knows, who Jeremy initially believes is himself, but who turns out to be Jake (\"A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into\"). \n\nAfterward, the SQUIP informs Jeremy that Christine won't date him until his social standing drastically improves. Encouraging Jeremy to use an interested Brooke as a stepping stone to greater popularity, he hooks up with her, while Jake asks Christine to come to his house (\"Upgrade\"). Overwhelmed, Jeremy asks the SQUIP to shut itself off for a few minutes. Immediately, Jeremy sees Michael and is elated but Michael states that Jeremy has been ignoring him all day. The SQUIP explains that it was using \"[[optic nerve]] blocking\" to block Michael from Jeremy's vision and that in order to be more popular he has to \"upgrade to Jeremy 2.0\" which is like watching your heart be Ripped From Your Chest. Jeremy eventually decides he is tired of being a loser and turns on optic nerve blocking, leaving him alone with the SQUIP (\"Loser Geek Whatever\").\n\n=== Act Two === \n\nOn Halloween, Jake hosts a large party that features alcohol and other shenanigans (\"Halloween\"). Christine arrives in a revealing princess costume, hoping to please Jake, but he brushes her aside to party. Jeremy arrives to meet Brooke, but Chloe, who is jealous of Brooke, tries to seduce Jeremy. Jeremy is uncomfortable and tries to get away, but the SQUIP forces him to remain in the situation as it escalates to Chloe making out with Jeremy (\"Do You Wanna Hang?\"). Chloe also has Jeremy drink alcohol, causing the SQUIP to malfunction, and then feigns having sex with him, angering Jake and breaking Brooke's heart.\n\nFleeing from Jake and the girls, Jeremy runs into a bathroom, where he finds Michael, who has crashed the party. Michael tries to warn Jeremy of the dangers of the SQUIP, explaining that someone ended up in a mental hospital after they went crazy trying to get it out of their head. Jeremy accuses Michael of being jealous of his popularity and calls him a loser. Michael, devastated and angry, locks himself in the bathroom, where he has a [[panic attack]] and sensory overload as he mourns the loss of his best and only friend (\"Michael in the Bathroom\"). Jeremy talks to Christine without the SQUIP's help and he asks her out in a burst of confidence (\"A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into (Reprise)\"). Christine, who has found herself in an existential crisis after breaking up with Jake, declines.\n\nMeanwhile, Rich goes around the party frantically asking people for [[Mountain_Dew#Flavors_and_varieties|Mountain Dew Red]]. Jeremy's SQUIP finally reactivates and reviews the events of the night, prompting Jeremy to leave the party immediately. Rich, alone and desperate, talks to his SQUIP and then sets the house on fire. The next morning, Jenna Rolan, the school gossip, informs everyone that Rich had burned down Jake's house at the end of the party, sending Rich to the hospital and causing Jake to break both of his legs jumping out of a window while trying to escape. The news spreads throughout the school through text and tweeting (\"The Smartphone Hour (Rich Set a Fire)\").\n\nAt home, Jeremy is confronted by his father (still not wearing pants), who brings up Jeremy's new personality and change in attitude. Jeremy reprimands his father for his behavior since the divorce, calling him a loser as well. Shaken by Jeremy's words, Mr. Heere realizes that something is very wrong and that he must take charge. He tracks down Michael and asks him to not give up on his friend. Michael reluctantly agrees to help, on the condition that Mr. Heere puts on some pants and becomes a better father. (\"The Pants Song\").\n\nAs the cast prepares for the play, Jeremy encounters Christine, who is shaken and upset about the fire. Jeremy is unhappy with the relationships he has damaged and angrily blames the SQUIP for his misfortune. The SQUIP instead blames it on \"human error\" and tells Jeremy he can improve the lives of the rest of the students, and eventually the whole world, by providing them all with SQUIPs. In Rich's locker, Jeremy finds a box full of SQUIPs, which Jeremy then pours into a beaker of Mountain Dew (\"The Pitiful Children\").  \n\nBackstage during the play, Christine confronts Jeremy over his use of the SQUIP, causing him to doubt the plan. However, the SQUIP has already begun to take over others in the play. The SQUIP reveals its intention to sync the entire student body, and then the whole world. Jeremy comes to a realization: Mountain Dew activates the SQUIP, while Mountain Dew Red deactivates it. Michael reappears from the audience with a bottle of Mountain Dew Red, which he gives to Jeremy after making him apologize for his actions, but a SQUIPed Jake dumps most of it out. Jeremy and Michael fight off the controlled students until the SQUIP reveals that Christine has been SQUIPed, and under its influence, she professes her love for Jeremy. Jeremy, however, realizes this is not what he had wanted and makes Christine drink the last of the red Mountain Dew: this causes a chain reaction that destroys the rest of the SQUIPS (\"The Play\").\n\nJeremy wakes up in the hospital, sharing a room with Rich, who proudly comes out to Jeremy as bisexual and is ready to finally be who he really is. Michael visits Jeremy and the two reconcile, and Mr. Heere (finally wearing pants) visits Jeremy as well, informing him that he'll be a better dad. Surrounded by his friends and family, Jeremy realizes that there will always be outside influences, but he needs to learn to make up his own mind instead. He asks Christine out again (for bowling alley performance art), and this time she accepts and kisses him. The SQUIP reveals itself to still be alive, weakly taunting Jeremy from inside his head, but Jeremy ignores it, happily proclaiming that \"of all the voices in my head, the loudest one is mine\" (\"Voices in My Head\").\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nSource:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n; Act 1\n* \"Jeremy's Theme\" \u2013 Orchestra \n* \"More Than Survive\" \u2013 Jeremy, Michael & Ensemble\n* \"I Love Play Rehearsal\" \u2013 Christine\n* \"More Than Survive (Reprise)\" \u2013 Jeremy{{efn|An edited version of the song from the Off-Broadway production that was added in the Original Broadway production.}}\n* \"The SQUIP Song\" \u2013 Rich & Ensemble\n* \"Two-Player Game\" \u2013 Michael & Jeremy\n* \"The Squip Enters\" \u2013 Jeremy, Christine, Jake, Ensemble\n* \"Be More Chill Pt. 1\" \u2013 Squip, Jeremy & Mall People\n* \"Do You Wanna Ride?\" \u2013 Brooke & Chloe\n* \"Be More Chill Pt. 2\" \u2013 Squip, Jeremy & Mall People\n* \"Sync Up\" \u2014 Jeremy, Squip, Jake, Rich, Chloe, Brooke, Jenna{{efn|Added to the Original Broadway production to replace \"More Than Survive (Reprise)\".}}\n* \"More Than Survive (Reprise)\" \u2013 Jeremy, Squip & Ensemble{{efn|Removed from the Original Broadway production and reinserted after \"I Love Play Rehearsal\" with edited lyrics.}}\n* \"A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into\" \u2013 Christine, Jeremy, Squip & Ensemble\n* \"The SQUIP Lurks\" \u2013 Orchestra{{efn|Named \"The SQUIP Stalks\" in the Broadway production.}}\n* \"Upgrade\" \u2013 Brooke, Squip, Jeremy, Jake, Christine & Ensemble\n* \"Loser Geek Whatever\" \u2014 Jeremy{{efn|Added to the Original Broadway production.}}\n\n{{col-2}}\n; Act 2\n* \"Halloween\" \u2013 Brooke, Jake, Chloe, Rich, Jenna & Ensemble\n* \"Do You Wanna Hang?\" \u2013 Chloe\n* \"Michael in the Bathroom\" \u2013 Michael & Ensemble\n* \"A Guy That I\u2019d Kinda Be Into (Reprise)\" - Christine & Jeremy{{efn|Added to the Original Broadway production.}}\n* \"The Smartphone Hour\" \u2013 Jenna, Chloe, Brooke & Ensemble\n* \"The Pants Song\" \u2013 Mr. Heere & Michael{{efn|Prior to the Off-Broadway production, the order of \"The Pants Song\" and \"The Pitiful Children\" was reversed.}}\n* \"The Pitiful Children\" \u2013 Squip, Jeremy, Jenna & Ensemble\n* \"The Play\" \u2013 Michael, Jake, Brooke, Chloe, Jeremy, Christine, Squip & Ensemble\n* \"Voices in My Head\" \u2013 Mr. Heere, Michael, Rich, Jeremy, Jenna, Brooke, Chloe, Jake, Christine & Ensemble\n\n{{col-end}}\n;Notes\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Roles and original casts==\n===Original productions===\nSource:<ref name=\":1\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
