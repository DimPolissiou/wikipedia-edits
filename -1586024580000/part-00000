have allowed the [[extradition]] of wanted criminal fugitives to territories with which [[Hong Kong]] does not currently have extradition agreements, including [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"nyt_20190610_whatis\" /> This led to concerns by some that the bill would subject Hong Kong residents and visitors to the jurisdiction and [[Law of the People's Republic of China|legal system

/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190522_chrispatten\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" />  and infringe on privacy and [[Freedom of speech by country|freedom of speech]] laws. As the protests progressed, the protesters laid out five key demands, namely the withdrawal of the bill, investigation into [[Allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct surrounding the 2019 Hong Kong protests|alleged police brutality and misconduct]], the release of all arrested protesters, retraction of the official characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", and [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Carrie Lam]]'s resignation along with the introduction of [[universal suffrage]] for election of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] and the Chief Executive.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\" /><ref name=\"abc_66464962\" />\n\nDespite a demonstration attended by hundreds of thousands on 9&nbsp;June 2019, the government persisted with the bill.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"vox_18658650\" /> Protesters gathered outside the [[Legislative Council Complex]] to stall the bill's second reading on 12&nbsp;June 2019,<ref name=\"scmp_3013797\" /><ref name=\"cnbc_20190610\" /><ref name=\"nyt_20190610_carriestandfast\" /><ref name=\"bloomberg_20190610_pursuebill\" /> resulting in an [[612 Incident|intense standoff]] between the protesters and the police who deployed [[tear gas]] and [[rubber bullet]]s.<ref name=\"time_20190613_battlefront\" /> An even bigger protest took place on 16 June 2019, just one day after the suspension of the bill, as protesters insisted on the complete withdrawal of the bill and reacted to the perceived excessive use of force by the police on 12&nbsp; June 2019.<ref name=\"scmp_3014695\" /> The anniversary of the handover on 1&nbsp;July 2019 saw the [[storming of the Legislative Council Complex]],<ref name=\"hkfp_20190701_occupychamber\" /> and subsequent protests throughout the summer spread to different districts.<ref name=\"nyt_20190722_trainstation\" /> Police inaction when suspected triad members [[2019 Yuen Long attack|assaulted protesters and commuters in Yuen Long]] on 21&nbsp;July 2019,<ref name=\"bbc_49074532\" /> the [[2019 Prince Edward station attack|police storming of Prince Edward station]] on 31&nbsp;August 2019, and the large-scale demonstrations during the [[70th&nbsp;anniversary of the People's Republic of China]] on 1&nbsp;October, caused further escalation of the protests.<ref name=\"amnesty_20190901_policeprotest\" />\n\nLam eventually withdrew the bill on 4&nbsp;September 2019,<ref name=\"cnn_20190904_withdrawbill\" /><ref name=\"guardian_20190719_extraditionbill\" /><ref name=\"bbc_48917796\" /> but still refused to concede on the other four demands. Claiming to curb further protests, Lam invoked the [[Emergency Regulations Ordinance]] on 4&nbsp;October 2019 to implement an [[anti-mask law]], to counterproductive effect.<ref name=\"rthk_1484040\" /> As the protests dragged on, confrontations escalated as both sides became increasingly violent.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is because since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting a large amount of influence, Hong Kong also suffered from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city has the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the word in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp; June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

police sought to counter this development, and suggested that in several instances, verbal abuse by protesters may have led officers to use the term.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/> An officer was reprimanded by the police for shouting derisive comments to protesters about the [[death of Chow Tsz-lok]].<ref name=\"scmp_3037087\"/> The police's description of a man wearing a yellow vest, who was taken to an alley, surrounded by police officers and apparently physically abused by one of them, as a \"yellow object\" due to supposedly impossible recognition of a person in the video footage, was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged police misconducts in the protests, although the protesters demand an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and IPCC lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> [[Carrie Lam]] has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8 November, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\". Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population.<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> That is because since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> That has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting a large amount of influence, Hong Kong also suffered from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city has the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the word in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp; June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June. While police estimated attendance at the march on [[Hong Kong Island]] at 270,000, the organisers claimed that 1.03&nbsp;million people had attended the rally.<ref name=\"time_5603754\" /><ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/> Carrie Lam insisted second reading and debate over the bill be resumed on 12&nbsp;June.<ref name=\"govhk_20190609_response\" /> Protesters [[612 Incident|successfully stopped the LegCo from resuming second reading of the bill]] by surrounding the LegCo Complex.

police sought to counter this development, and suggested that in several instances, verbal abuse by protesters may have led officers to use the term.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/> An officer was reprimanded by the police for shouting derisive comments to protesters about the [[death of Chow Tsz-lok]].<ref name=\"scmp_3037087\"/> The police's description of a man wearing a yellow vest, who was taken to an alley, surrounded by police officers and apparently physically abused by one of them, as a \"yellow object\" due to supposedly impossible recognition of a person in the video footage, was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged police misconducts in the protests, although the protesters demand an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and IPCC lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> [[Carrie Lam]] has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8 November, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign.

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

It was equipped with 5&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] and used the same [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] as the PET. The VIC-20's video chip, the [[MOS Technology VIC]], was a general-purpose color video chip designed by Al Charpentier in 1977 and intended for use in inexpensive display terminals and game consoles, but Commodore could not find a market for the chip.\n\nAs the [[Apple II]] gained momentum with the advent of [[VisiCalc]] in 1979, [[Jack Tramiel]] wanted a product that would compete in the same segment, to be presented at the January 1980 [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]. For this reason [[Chuck Peddle]] and Bill Seiler started to design a computer named ''TOI'' (The Other Intellect). The TOI computer failed to materialize, mostly because it required an 80-column character display which in turn required the MOS Technology 6564 chip. However, the chip could not be used in the TOI since it required very expensive static RAM to operate fast enough.\n\nIn the meantime, freshman engineer [[Robert Yannes]] at MOS Technology (then a part of Commodore) had designed a computer in his home dubbed the ''MicroPET'' and finished a prototype with some help from Al Charpentier and Charles Winterble. With the TOI unfinished, when Jack Tramiel was shown the MicroPET prototype, he immediately said he wanted it to be finished and ordered it to be mass-produced following a limited demonstration at the CES.\n\nAs the new decade began, the price of computer hardware was dropping and Tramiel saw an emerging market for low-price computers that could be sold at retail stores to relative novices rather than professionals or people with an electronics or programming background. The personal computer market up to this point had sold primarily through mail order or authorized dealers, the sole exception being [[Radio Shack]], who had their own stores as a distribution network. Radio Shack had been achieving considerable success with the [[TRS-80 Model I]], a relatively low-cost machine that was widely sold to novices and in 1980 released the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]], which was aimed at the home and educational markets, utilized ROM cartridges for software, and connected to an ordinary TV set.\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[Image:Commodore VIC 20 box.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Original VIC-20 box]] -->\nThe prototype produced by Yannes had very few of the features required for a real computer, so Robert Russell at Commodore headquarters had to coordinate and finish large parts of the design under the codename ''Vixen''. The parts contributed by Russell included a port of the operating system (kernel and BASIC interpreter) taken from John Feagans design for the [[Commodore PET]], a character set with the characteristic [[PETSCII]], an [[Atari 2600]]-compatible [[joystick]] interface, and a [[ROM cartridge]] port. The serial [[IEEE-488]]-derivative [[Commodore bus|CBM-488]] interface<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-28/Run_Issue_28_1986_Apr#page/n105/mode/2up|title=RUN Magazine issue 28}}</ref> was designed by Glen Stark. It served several purposes, including costing substantially less than the IEEE-488 interface on the PET, using smaller cables and connectors that allowed for a more compact case design, and also complying with newly-imposed [[FCC]] regulations on RFI emissions by home electronics (the PET was certified as Class B office equipment which had less stringent RFI requirements). Some features, like the memory add-in board, were designed by Bill Seiler.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Altogether, the VIC 20 development team consisted of five people led by Michael Tomczyk the product manager, who recruited the group and dubbed them the VIC Commandos.  Commodore founder Jack Tramiel initially gave Tomczyk the title VIC Czar and later appointed him product manager.  Tomczyk insisted on several features including full size typewriter keys, programmable function keys and a built-in RS-232 interface. Michael later contracted and co-designed a $100 modem, the VICModem, which became the first modem to sell 1 million units.<ref name=\"DAK54\">{{cite news | first = Marty | last = Herzog | date = January 1988 | title = Neil Harris | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 41\u201351 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> According to one of the development team, Neil Harris, \"[W]e couldn't get any cooperation from the rest of the company who thought we were jokers because we were working late, about an hour after everyone else had left the building. We'd swipe whatever equipment we needed to get our jobs done. There was no other way to get the work done! [...] they'd discover it was missing and they would just order more stuff from the warehouse, so everybody had what they needed to do their work.\"<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> At the time, Commodore had a glut of {{nowrap|1 [[kilobit|kbit]]\u00d74}} [[static random access memory|SRAM]] chips, so Tramiel decided these should be used in the new computer. The end result was arguably closer to the ''PET'' or ''TOI'' computers than to Yannes' prototype, albeit with a 22-column VIC chip instead of the custom chips designed for the more ambitious computers. As the amount of memory on the VIC-20's system board was very small even for 1981 standards, the design team could get away with using more expensive SRAM due to its lower power consumption, heat output, and less supporting circuitry. The original Revision A system board found in all silver-label VIC-20s used 2114 SRAMs and due to their tiny size (only 512 bytes per chip), ten of them were required to reach 5&nbsp;KB of system RAM. The Revision B system board, found in rainbow logo VIC-20s (see below) switched to larger 2048-byte SRAMs which reduced the memory count to five chips: 2\u00d7 2048-byte chips + 3\u00d7 2114 (the 1024 \u00d7 4 bits) chips.\n\nWhile newer PETs had the upgraded BASIC 4.0, which had disk commands and improved garbage collection, the VIC-20 reverted to the 8&nbsp;KB BASIC 2.0 used on earlier PETs as part of another of the design team's goals, which was limiting the system ROMs to only 20&nbsp;KB. Since Commodore's BASIC had been designed for the PET which had only limited audiovisual capabilities, there were no dedicated sound or graphics features, thus VIC-20 programmers had to use large numbers of POKE and PEEK statements for this. This was in contrast to the computer's main competitors, the Atari 400 and TRS-80 Color Computer, both of which had full-featured BASICs with support for the machines' sound and graphics hardware. Supplying a more limited BASIC in the VIC-20 would keep the price low and the user could purchase a BASIC extender separately if he desired sound or graphics commands.\n\nWhile the TRS-80 Color Computer and Atari 400 had only RF video output, the VIC-20 instead had composite output, which provided a sharper, cleaner picture if a dedicated monitor was used. An external RF modulator was necessary to use the computer with a TV set, and had not been included internally so as to comply with FCC regulations (Commodore lobbied for and succeeded in getting them relaxed slightly by 1982, so the C64 had an RF modulator built in).\n\nVIC-20s went through several variations in their three and a half years of production. First-year models (1981) had a PET-style keyboard with a blocky font while most VIC-20s made during 1982 had a slightly different keyboard also shared with early C64s. The rainbow logo VIC-20 was introduced in early 1983 and has the newer C64 keyboard with gray function keys and the Revision B motherboard. It has a similar power supply to the C64 PSU, although the amperage is slightly lower. A C64 \"black brick\" PSU is compatible with Revision B VIC-20s; however, the VIC's PSU is not recommended on a C64 if any external devices such as cartridges or user port accessories are installed as it will overdraw the available power. Older Revision A VIC-20s cannot use a C64 PSU or vice versa as their power requirement is too high.\n\n[[Image:Commodore VIC-1001 left-hand keyboard closeup.jpg|link=Image:Commodore VIC-1001 left-hand keyboard closeup.jpg|thumb|right|The VIC-1001 was the Japanese version of the VIC-20.

When most of the GMs argued against it, he said: \"The Japanese are coming, so we will become the Japanese.\" This was in keeping with Tramiel's philosophy which was to make \"computers for the masses, not the classes\". The concept was championed at the meeting by [[Michael Tomczyk]], newly hired marketing strategist and assistant to the president, Tony Tokai, General Manager of Commodore-Japan, and Kit Spencer, the UK's top marketing executive.{{Citation needed|reason=Speaking at CommVEx in 2015, Leonard Tramiel claimed this event never took place and that the VIC-20 was already in development by that point.

The VIC-20 was marketed in Japan as VIC-1001 before VIC-20 was introduced to the US.\n\n[[File:Commodore-Datasette-C2N-Mk2-Front.jpg|link=File:Commodore-Datasette-C2N-Mk2-Front.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Commodore 1530 C2N-B [[Commodore Datasette|Datasette]] provided inexpensive external storage for the VIC-20]]\nWhen they returned to California from that meeting, Tomczyk wrote a 30-page memo detailing recommendations for the new computer, and presented it to Tramiel. Recommendations included programmable [[function key]]s (inspired by competing Japanese computers),<ref name=tomczyk>{{cite web |url=http://www.michaeltomczyk.com/Tech-Pioneer.php |title=The Home Computer Wars |first=Michael |last=Tomczyk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214213644/http://michaeltomczyk.com/Tech-Pioneer.php |archivedate=14 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> full-size typewriter-style keys, and built-in [[RS-232]]. Tomczyk insisted on \"user-friendliness\" as the prime directive for the new computer, to engineer Yash Terakura (who was also a friend),<ref name=tomczyk/> and proposed a retail price of {{nowrap|US$299.95}}. He recruited a marketing team and a small group of computer enthusiasts, and worked closely with colleagues in the UK and Japan to create colorful packaging, user manuals, and the first wave of software programs (mostly games and home applications).\n\n[[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] was contracted to provide a series of [[text adventure]] games. With help from a Commodore engineer who came to [[Longwood, Florida]] to assist in the effort, five of Adams's [[Adventure International]] game series were ported to the VIC. They got around the limited memory of VIC-20 by having the {{nowrap|16 KB}} games reside in a ROM cartridge instead of being loaded into main memory via cassette as they were on the [[TRS-80]] and other machines. The first production run of the five cartridges generated over $1,500,000 in sales for Commodore.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nWhile the PET was sold through authorized dealers, the VIC-20 primarily sold at retail\u2014especially discount and toy stores, where it could compete more directly with game consoles. It was the first computer to be sold in [[Kmart|K-Mart]]. Commodore took out advertisements featuring actor [[William Shatner]] (of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' fame) as its spokesman, asking: \"Why buy just a video game?\" and describing it as \"The Wonder Computer of the 1980s\". Television personality [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] (best known as a panelist on the TV game show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'') became the commentator in a series of Commodore product ads.\n\nThe VIC-20 had 5&nbsp;KB of RAM, of which only 3.5&nbsp;KB remained available on startup (exactly 3583 bytes). This is roughly equivalent to the words and spaces on one sheet of typing paper, meeting a design goal of the machine. The computer was expandable up to 40&nbsp;KB with an add-on memory cartridge (a maximum of 27.5&nbsp;KB was usable for BASIC).\n\nThe \"20\" in the computer's name was widely assumed to refer to the text width of the screen (although in fact the VIC-20 has 22-column text, not 20) or that it referred to the combined size of the system ROMs (8&nbsp;KB BASIC+8&nbsp;KB [[KERNAL]]+4&nbsp;KB character ROM).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Bob Yannes claimed that \"20\" meant nothing in particular and \"We simply picked '20' because it seemed like a friendly number and the computer's marketing slogan was 'The Friendly Computer'. I felt it balanced things out a bit since 'Vic' sounded like the name of a truck driver.\"\n\nIn 1981, Tomczyk contracted with an outside engineering group to develop a direct-connect modem-on-a-cartridge (the [[Commodore 64 peripherals#Serial communications|VICModem]]), which at US$99 became the first modem priced under US$100. The VICModem was also the first modem to sell over 1 million units. VICModem was packaged with US$197.50 worth of free telecomputing services from [[The Source (online service)|The Source]], [[CompuServe]] and [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]]. Tomczyk also created a [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] called the Commodore Information Network to enable users to exchange information and take some of the pressure off of Customer Support inquiries, which were straining Commodore's lean organization. In 1982, this network accounted for the largest traffic on CompuServe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Applications===\n[[File:ViC20 Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Software cartridge]]\n\nThe VIC-20's BASIC is compatible with the PET's, and the [[Datasette]] format is the same.<ref name=\"butterfield198104\">{{Cite magazine |last=Butterfield |first=JIm |author-link=Jim Butterfield |date=April 1981 |title=Advice to PET Owners: How To Be A VIC Expert |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue11/17_1_ADVICE_TO_PET_OWNERS_HOW_TO_BE_A_VIC_EXPERT.php |magazine=Compute! |issue=11 |page=34}}</ref> Before the computer's release, a Commodore executive promised it would have \"enough additional documentation to enable an experienced programmer/hobbyist to get inside and let his imagination work\".<ref name=\"kb198009\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/kilobaudmagazine-1980-09/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_1980_September#page/n23/mode/2up | title=Commodore: New Products, New Philosophies | work=Kilobaud | date=September 1980 | accessdate=23 June 2014 | pages=26\u201328}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' favorably contrasted the company's encouragement of \"cottage industry software developers\" to [[Texas Instruments]] discouraging [[third-party software]].<ref name=\"thornburg198104\">{{Cite magazine |last=Thornburg |first=David D. |date=April 1981 |title=The Commodore VIC-20: A First Look |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue11/12_1_THE_COMMODORE_VIC-20_A_FIRST_LOOK.php |magazine=Compute! |page=26}}</ref> Because of its small memory and low-resolution display compared to some other computers of the time, the VIC-20 was primarily used for educational software and games.

This software was distributed via [[online service]]s such as CompuServe, [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]s, as well as offline by mail order and by user groups. Several [[computer magazine]]s sold on newsstands, such as ''[[Compute!]]'', ''[[Family Computing]]'', ''[[RUN (magazine)|RUN]]'', ''Ahoy!'', and the CBM-produced ''[[Commodore Power Play]]'', offered programming tips and [[type-in program]]s for the VIC-20.\n\nAn estimated 300 commercial titles were available on [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] and another 500+ were available on tape.{{According to whom|date=February 2020}} A handful of disk applications were released.\n\nThe VIC's low cost led to it being used by the [[Fort Pierce, Florida]] Utilities Authority to measure the input and output of two of their generators and display the results on monitors throughout the plant.

Only 3583 bytes of BASIC program memory for code and variables are actually available on an unexpanded machine.\n\n====Ports and sockets====\nThe VIC-20 has card edge connectors for program/expansion cartridges and a PET-standard [[Datassette]] tape drive. The VIC-20 did not originally have a disk drive; the [[VIC-1540]] disk drive was released in 1981.\n\nThe computer also has a single [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] [[Atari joystick port]], compatible with the digital [[joystick]]s and [[paddle (game controller)|paddles]] used with [[Atari 2600]] videogame consoles<ref name=\"flynn198206\">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue25/035_1_USING_ATARI_JOYSTICKS_WITH_YOUR_VIC.php | title=Using Atari Joysticks With Your VIC | work=Compute! | date=June 1982 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Flynn, Christopher J. | pages=79}}</ref> (the use of a standard port ensured ample supply of Atari-manufactured and other third-party joysticks; Commodore itself offered an Atari-protocol joystick under the Commodore brand); a serial [[Commodore bus|CBM-488]] bus (a serial version of the PET's [[IEEE-488]] bus) for [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]ing [[Commodore 1540|disk drives]] and printers; a [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]-level \"user port\" with both [[RS-232]] and [[Centronics]] signals (most frequently used as RS-232, for connecting a [[modem]]<ref>The Commodore VICModem and later models connected directly to the user port's edge connector. But in order to connect the VIC to industry-standard [[modem]]s and other [[RS-232]] devices, the user needed to purchase a separate [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]-to-RS232 [[volt]]age converter box (standard TTL voltages lie between 0 and 5&nbsp;V, while RS-232 uses \u00b112&nbsp;V).</ref>).\n\nThe VIC has a [[ROM cartridge]] port to allow for plug-in cartridges with games and other software as well as for adding memory to the machine. Port expander boxes were available from Commodore and other vendors to allow more than one cartridge to be attached at a time. Cartridge software ranged from {{nowrap|4\u201316 KB}} in size, although the latter was uncommon due to its cost.\n\nThe VIC-20 can be hooked into external electronic circuitry via joystick port, the so-called \"user port,\" or the memory expansion\u2013cartridge port, which exposes various analog to digital, memory bus, and other internal I/O circuits to the experimenter. The BASIC language can then be used (using the [[PEEK and POKE]] commands) to perform data acquisition from temperature sensors, control robotic stepper motors, etc.\n\n====Graphics====\n[[Image:Screen color test CommodoreVIC20 Multicolor.png|thumb|right|16-color capability]]\n\nThe graphics capabilities of the [[MOS Technology VIC|VIC chip]] (6560/6561) are limited but flexible. At startup the screen shows 176\u00d7184 pixels, with a fixed-color border to the edges of the screen. Since a PAL or NTSC screen has a 4:3 width-to-height ratio, each VIC pixel is much wider than it is high. The screen normally shows 22 columns and 23 rows of 8-by-8-pixel characters; it is possible to increase these dimensions up to 27 columns, but the characters would soon [[overscan|run out the sides of the monitor]] at about 25 columns. Just as on the PET, two different 256 character sets are included, the uppercase/graphics character set and the upper/lowercase set, and reverse video versions of both. Normally, the VIC-20 operates in high-resolution mode whereby each character is 8\u00d78 pixels in size and uses one color. A lower-resolution multicolor mode can also be used with 4\u00d78 characters and three colors each, but it is not used as often due to its extreme blockiness.\n\nThe VIC chip does not support a true bitmap mode, but programmers can define their own custom character sets. It is possible to get a fully addressable screen, although slightly smaller than normal, by filling the screen with a sequence of different double-height characters, then turning on the pixels selectively inside the RAM-based character definitions. The [[Super Expander]] cartridge adds BASIC commands supporting such a graphics mode using a resolution of 160\u00d7160 pixels. It is also possible to fill a larger area of the screen with addressable graphics using a more dynamic allocation scheme, if the contents are sparse or repetitive enough. This is used by the port of ''[[Omega Race]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe VIC chip has readable scan-line counters but cannot generate interrupts based on the scan position. The two VIA timer chips can serve this purpose through an elaborate programming technique, allowing graphics to mixed with text above or below it, two different background and border colors, or more than 200 characters for the pseudo-high-resolution mode.\n\nThe VIC chip can process a [[light pen]] signal (a light pen input is provided on the [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] joystick connector) but few appeared on the market.\n\nThe VIC chip outputs composite video. Commodore did not include an RF modulator inside the computer's case because of FCC regulations. It can either be attached to a dedicated monitor or a TV set using the external modulator included with the computer.\n\n====Sound====\nThe VIC chip has three [[pulse wave]] generators and a white noise generator with an overall volume control and mono output. Each pulse wave generator has a range of three [[octave]]s located on the scale about an octave apart, giving a total range of about five octaves.\n\n=={{anchor|ramcarts}}Memory expansion==\n[[File:Vic20 16k.jpg|thumb|A {{nowrap|16 KB}} RAM expansion cartridge]]\n\nBecause the VIC had only 5K RAM, the VIC-20's RAM was expandable through the cartridge port via a Super Expander Cartridge (or simply, RAM Expander). RAM cartridges were available in several sizes: {{nowrap|3 KB}} (with or without an included BASIC extension ROM), {{nowrap|8 KB}}, {{nowrap|16 KB}}, {{nowrap|32 KB}} and {{nowrap|64 KB}}, the latter two only from third-party vendors. The internal memory map was dramatically reorganized with the addition of each size cartridge, leading to a situation where some programs would only work if the right amount of memory was present (to cater to this, the {{nowrap|32 KB}} cartridges had switches, and the 64&nbsp;KB cartridges had software setups, allowing the RAM to be enabled in user-selectable memory blocks).\n\nSince the VIC-20 was designed to use SRAM rather than DRAM, the system board had no provisions for RAM refresh. Memory expansion cartridges may in practice use either type; however, DRAM-based expanders had to contain their own circuitry to refresh the RAM and multiplex the data/address bus, and one possible reason for the oversized VIC-20 cartridge PCBs may have been to provide room for DRAM infrastructure.\n\nThe memory mapping of the VIC-20 was slightly confusing and could vary depending on system configuration. With no expanders installed, free user memory started at $1000 and extended up to $1DFF, with the video buffer placed at $1E00-$1FFF. Below $1000 was a \"hole\" from $400-$FFF which could be filled with 3&nbsp;KB of expansion RAM, which if installed would place the BASIC program area at $400. If an 8&nbsp;KB or larger expander was used, screen memory began at $1000 and BASIC program text at $1200.\n\nThe VIC-20 allowed two locations for color RAM, either at $9600 or $9400. The default for unexpanded machines was at $9600, and with an 8&nbsp;KB or larger expander, the color RAM would be moved to $9400, however the user could freely set it to either location via the register at $9002.\n\nThe normal location for ROM cartridges was at $A000\u2013$BFFF. On power up, the kernel ROM checked for an ID header and if found would jump to the specified starting address. Larger 16&nbsp;KB cartridges had the second half of ROM either at $2000 or $6000. A few cartridges, including Scott Adams adventures, loaded entirely in the $2000-$7FFF area. Since the kernel can only autostart ROMs located at $A000, such programs would have to be manually launched from BASIC via the SYS command.\n\nCommodore's official RAM expansion cartridges were only available up to a maximum of 16&nbsp;KB worth of additional memory, but third party cartridges could provide up to 64&nbsp;KB and sometimes included DIP switches to map the additional RAM to user-selectable address space.\n\nUnlike the PET, the VIC-20 did not include a built-in machine language monitor, but Commodore offered them on disk, tape, or cartridge, with several different executables to load into various memory locations. The monitor programs were the same as the PET monitor, but now added a mini-assembler instead of requiring the user to enter hexadecimal opcodes.\n\nThe 32&nbsp;KB cartridges allowed adding up to 24&nbsp;KB to the BASIC user memory; together with the 3.5&nbsp;KB built-in user memory, this gave a maximum of 27.5&nbsp;KB for BASIC programs and variables. The extra 8&nbsp;KB could usually be used in one of two ways, set by switches:\n# Either it could be mapped into the address space reserved for ROM cartridges, which sat \"behind\" the I/O register space and thus was not contiguous with the rest of the RAM. This allowed running many cartridge-based games from disk or tape and was thus very useful for software pirates; especially if the RAM expansion allowed switching off writing to its memory after the game was loaded, so that the memory behaved exactly like ROM.\n# Or, 3&nbsp;KB of the 8&nbsp;KB could be mapped into the same memory \"hole\" that the 3&nbsp;KB cartridge used, letting 5&nbsp;KB lie fallow. These 3&nbsp;KB were contiguous with the rest of RAM, but couldn't be used to expand BASIC space to more than 27.5&nbsp;KB, because the display data would have had to be moved to cartridge RAM, which was not possible.\n\nSome 64&nbsp;KB expansion cartridges allowed the user to copy [[ROM image]]s to RAM. The more advanced versions even contained an 80-character video chip and a patched BASIC interpreter which gave access to 48&nbsp;KB of the memory and to the 80-column video mode. As the latter type of cartridges, marketed primarily in Germany, were not released until late 1984\u2014two years after the appearance of the more capable [[Commodore 64|C64]]\u2014they went by mostly unnoticed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Memory map<ref name=\"zi_mm\">{{cite web|title=VIC-20 memory map (long)|url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/vic/memorymap.txt|date=19 September 2005|accessdate=2013-05-20|publisher=zimmers.net}}</ref>\n!

While predicting the 22-column screen was \"too small to support any but the most rudimentary business applications\" the magazine observed that \"at a price of $299, that is hardly the point\", stating that \"the VIC will provide very stiff competition to the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]\" and \"is a much more valuable computer literacy tool than\" other products like the [[TRS-80 Pocket Computer]]. ''Compute!'' concluded \"VIC will create its own market, and it will be a big one\".{{r|thornburg198104}} While also noting the small screen size and RAM, ''[[BYTE]]'' stated that the VIC 20 was \"unexcelled as low-cost, consumer-oriented computer.

It was equipped with 5&nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] of [[Static random-access memory|static RAM]] and used the same [[MOS Technology 6502|MOS 6502]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] as the PET. The VIC-20's video chip, the [[MOS Technology VIC]], was a general-purpose color video chip designed by Al Charpentier in 1977 and intended for use in inexpensive display terminals and game consoles, but Commodore could not find a market for the chip.\n\nAs the [[Apple II]] gained momentum with the advent of [[VisiCalc]] in 1979, [[Jack Tramiel]] wanted a product that would compete in the same segment, to be presented at the January 1980 [[Consumer Electronics Show|CES]]. For this reason [[Chuck Peddle]] and Bill Seiler started to design a computer named ''TOI'' (The Other Intellect). The TOI computer failed to materialize, mostly because it required an 80-column character display which in turn required the MOS Technology 6564 chip. However, the chip could not be used in the TOI since it required very expensive static RAM to operate fast enough.\n\nIn the meantime, freshman engineer [[Robert Yannes]] at MOS Technology (then a part of Commodore) had designed a computer in his home dubbed the ''MicroPET'' and finished a prototype with some help from Al Charpentier and Charles Winterble. With the TOI unfinished, when Jack Tramiel was shown the MicroPET prototype, he immediately said he wanted it to be finished and ordered it to be mass-produced following a limited demonstration at the CES.\n\nAs the new decade began, the price of computer hardware was dropping and Tramiel saw an emerging market for low-price computers that could be sold at retail stores to relative novices rather than professionals or people with an electronics or programming background. The personal computer market up to this point had sold primarily through mail order or authorized dealers, the sole exception being [[Radio Shack]], who had their own stores as a distribution network. Radio Shack had been achieving considerable success with the [[TRS-80 Model I]], a relatively low-cost machine that was widely sold to novices and in 1980 released the [[TRS-80 Color Computer|Color Computer]], which was aimed at the home and educational markets, utilized ROM cartridges for software, and connected to an ordinary TV set.\n\n<!-- Commented out: [[Image:Commodore VIC 20 box.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Original VIC-20 box]] -->\nThe prototype produced by Yannes had very few of the features required for a real computer, so Robert Russell at Commodore headquarters had to coordinate and finish large parts of the design under the codename ''Vixen''. The parts contributed by Russell included a port of the operating system (kernel and BASIC interpreter) taken from John Feagans design for the [[Commodore PET]], a character set with the characteristic [[PETSCII]], an [[Atari 2600]]-compatible [[joystick]] interface, and a [[ROM cartridge]] port. The serial [[IEEE-488]]-derivative [[Commodore bus|CBM-488]] interface<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-28/Run_Issue_28_1986_Apr#page/n105/mode/2up|title=RUN Magazine issue 28}}</ref> was designed by Glen Stark. It served several purposes, including costing substantially less than the IEEE-488 interface on the PET, using smaller cables and connectors that allowed for a more compact case design, and also complying with newly-imposed [[FCC]] regulations on RFI emissions by home electronics (the PET was certified as Class B office equipment which had less stringent RFI requirements). Some features, like the memory add-in board, were designed by Bill Seiler.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Altogether, the VIC 20 development team consisted of five people led by Michael Tomczyk the product manager, who recruited the group and dubbed them the VIC Commandos.  Commodore founder Jack Tramiel initially gave Tomczyk the title VIC Czar and later appointed him product manager.  Tomczyk insisted on several features including full size typewriter keys, programmable function keys and a built-in RS-232 interface. Michael later contracted and co-designed a $100 modem, the VICModem, which became the first modem to sell 1 million units.<ref name=\"DAK54\">{{cite news | first = Marty | last = Herzog | date = January 1988 | title = Neil Harris | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 54 | pages = 41\u201351 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref> According to one of the development team, Neil Harris, \"[W]e couldn't get any cooperation from the rest of the company who thought we were jokers because we were working late, about an hour after everyone else had left the building. We'd swipe whatever equipment we needed to get our jobs done. There was no other way to get the work done! [...] they'd discover it was missing and they would just order more stuff from the warehouse, so everybody had what they needed to do their work.\"<ref name=\"DAK54\"/> At the time, Commodore had a glut of {{nowrap|1 [[kilobit|kbit]]\u00d74}} [[static random access memory|SRAM]] chips, so Tramiel decided these should be used in the new computer. The end result was arguably closer to the ''PET'' or ''TOI'' computers than to Yannes' prototype, albeit with a 22-column VIC chip instead of the custom chips designed for the more ambitious computers. As the amount of memory on the VIC-20's system board was very small even for 1981 standards, the design team could get away with using more expensive SRAM due to its lower power consumption, heat output, and less supporting circuitry. The original Revision A system board found in all silver-label VIC-20s used 2114 SRAMs and due to their tiny size (only 512 bytes per chip), ten of them were required to reach 5&nbsp;KB of system RAM. The Revision B system board, found in rainbow logo VIC-20s (see below) switched to larger 2048-byte SRAMs which reduced the memory count to five chips: 2\u00d7 2048-byte chips + 3\u00d7 2114 (the 1024 \u00d7 4 bits) chips.\n\nWhile newer PETs had the upgraded BASIC 4.0, which had disk commands and improved garbage collection, the VIC-20 reverted to the 8&nbsp;KB BASIC 2.0 used on earlier PETs as part of another of the design team's goals, which was limiting the system ROMs to only 20&nbsp;KB. Since Commodore's BASIC had been designed for the PET which had only limited audiovisual capabilities, there were no dedicated sound or graphics features, thus VIC-20 programmers had to use large numbers of POKE and PEEK statements for this. This was in contrast to the computer's main competitors, the Atari 400 and TRS-80 Color Computer, both of which had full-featured BASICs with support for the machines' sound and graphics hardware. Supplying a more limited BASIC in the VIC-20 would keep the price low and the user could purchase a BASIC extender separately if he desired sound or graphics commands.\n\nWhile the TRS-80 Color Computer and Atari 400 had only RF video output, the VIC-20 instead had composite output, which provided a sharper, cleaner picture if a dedicated monitor was used. An external RF modulator was necessary to use the computer with a TV set, and had not been included internally so as to comply with FCC regulations (Commodore lobbied for and succeeded in getting them relaxed slightly by 1982, so the C64 had an RF modulator built in).\n\nVIC-20s went through several variations in their three and a half years of production. First-year models (1981) had a PET-style keyboard with a blocky font while most VIC-20s made during 1982 had a slightly different keyboard also shared with early C64s. The rainbow logo VIC-20 was introduced in early 1983 and has the newer C64 keyboard with gray function keys and the Revision B motherboard. It has a similar power supply to the C64 PSU, although the amperage is slightly lower. A C64 \"black brick\" PSU is compatible with Revision B VIC-20s; however, the VIC's PSU is not recommended on a C64 if any external devices such as cartridges or user port accessories are installed as it will overdraw the available power. Older Revision A VIC-20s cannot use a C64 PSU or vice versa as their power requirement is too high.\n\n[[Image:Commodore VIC-1001 left-hand keyboard closeup.jpg|link=Image:Commodore VIC-1001 left-hand keyboard closeup.jpg|thumb|right|The VIC-1001 was the Japanese version of the VIC-20.

When most of the GMs argued against it, he said: \"The Japanese are coming, so we will become the Japanese.\" This was in keeping with Tramiel's philosophy which was to make \"computers for the masses, not the classes\". The concept was championed at the meeting by [[Michael Tomczyk]], newly hired marketing strategist and assistant to the president, Tony Tokai, General Manager of Commodore-Japan, and Kit Spencer, the UK's top marketing executive.{{Citation needed|reason=Speaking at CommVEx in 2015, Leonard Tramiel claimed this event never took place and that the VIC-20 was already in development by that point. He also claimed that Tomczyk was in fact confused and perplexed when the computer was first demonstrated to him at a meeting at Commodore.|date=December 2016}} Then, the project was given to Commodore Japan; an engineering team led by Yash Terakura created the VIC-1001 for the Japanese market. The VIC-20 was marketed in Japan as VIC-1001 before VIC-20 was introduced to the US.\n\n[[File:Commodore-Datasette-C2N-Mk2-Front.jpg|link=File:Commodore-Datasette-C2N-Mk2-Front.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Commodore 1530 C2N-B [[Commodore Datasette|Datasette]] provided inexpensive external storage for the VIC-20]]\nWhen they returned to California from that meeting, Tomczyk wrote a 30-page memo detailing recommendations for the new computer, and presented it to Tramiel. Recommendations included programmable [[function key]]s (inspired by competing Japanese computers),<ref name=tomczyk>{{cite web |url=http://www.michaeltomczyk.com/Tech-Pioneer.php |title=The Home Computer Wars |first=Michael |last=Tomczyk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214213644/http://michaeltomczyk.com/Tech-Pioneer.php |archivedate=14 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> full-size typewriter-style keys, and built-in [[RS-232]]. Tomczyk insisted on \"user-friendliness\" as the prime directive for the new computer, to engineer Yash Terakura (who was also a friend),<ref name=tomczyk/> and proposed a retail price of {{nowrap|US$299.95}}. He recruited a marketing team and a small group of computer enthusiasts, and worked closely with colleagues in the UK and Japan to create colorful packaging, user manuals, and the first wave of software programs (mostly games and home applications).\n\n[[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] was contracted to provide a series of [[text adventure]] games. With help from a Commodore engineer who came to [[Longwood, Florida]] to assist in the effort, five of Adams's [[Adventure International]] game series were ported to the VIC. They got around the limited memory of VIC-20 by having the {{nowrap|16 KB}} games reside in a ROM cartridge instead of being loaded into main memory via cassette as they were on the [[TRS-80]] and other machines. The first production run of the five cartridges generated over $1,500,000 in sales for Commodore.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nWhile the PET was sold through authorized dealers, the VIC-20 primarily sold at retail\u2014especially discount and toy stores, where it could compete more directly with game consoles. It was the first computer to be sold in [[Kmart|K-Mart]]. Commodore took out advertisements featuring actor [[William Shatner]] (of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' fame) as its spokesman, asking: \"Why buy just a video game?\" and describing it as \"The Wonder Computer of the 1980s\". Television personality [[Henry Morgan (comedian)|Henry Morgan]] (best known as a panelist on the TV game show ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'') became the commentator in a series of Commodore product ads.\n\nThe VIC-20 had 5&nbsp;KB of RAM, of which only 3.5&nbsp;KB remained available on startup (exactly 3583 bytes). This is roughly equivalent to the words and spaces on one sheet of typing paper, meeting a design goal of the machine. The computer was expandable up to 40&nbsp;KB with an add-on memory cartridge (a maximum of 27.5&nbsp;KB was usable for BASIC).\n\nThe \"20\" in the computer's name was widely assumed to refer to the text width of the screen (although in fact the VIC-20 has 22-column text, not 20) or that it referred to the combined size of the system ROMs (8&nbsp;KB BASIC+8&nbsp;KB [[KERNAL]]+4&nbsp;KB character ROM).{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} Bob Yannes claimed that \"20\" meant nothing in particular and \"We simply picked '20' because it seemed like a friendly number and the computer's marketing slogan was 'The Friendly Computer'. I felt it balanced things out a bit since 'Vic' sounded like the name of a truck driver.\"\n\nIn 1981, Tomczyk contracted with an outside engineering group to develop a direct-connect modem-on-a-cartridge (the [[Commodore 64 peripherals#Serial communications|VICModem]]), which at US$99 became the first modem priced under US$100. The VICModem was also the first modem to sell over 1 million units. VICModem was packaged with US$197.50 worth of free telecomputing services from [[The Source (online service)|The Source]], [[CompuServe]] and [[Dow Jones & Company|Dow Jones]]. Tomczyk also created a [[Special Interest Group|SIG]] called the Commodore Information Network to enable users to exchange information and take some of the pressure off of Customer Support inquiries, which were straining Commodore's lean organization. In 1982, this network accounted for the largest traffic on CompuServe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n===Applications===\n[[File:ViC20 Cartridge.jpg|thumb|Software cartridge]]\n\nThe VIC-20's BASIC is compatible with the PET's, and the [[Datasette]] format is the same.<ref name=\"butterfield198104\">{{Cite magazine |last=Butterfield |first=JIm |author-link=Jim Butterfield |date=April 1981 |title=Advice to PET Owners: How To Be A VIC Expert |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue11/17_1_ADVICE_TO_PET_OWNERS_HOW_TO_BE_A_VIC_EXPERT.php |magazine=Compute! |issue=11 |page=34}}</ref> Before the computer's release, a Commodore executive promised it would have \"enough additional documentation to enable an experienced programmer/hobbyist to get inside and let his imagination work\".<ref name=\"kb198009\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/kilobaudmagazine-1980-09/Kilobaud_Microcomputing_1980_September#page/n23/mode/2up | title=Commodore: New Products, New Philosophies | work=Kilobaud | date=September 1980 | accessdate=23 June 2014 | pages=26\u201328}}</ref> ''[[Compute!]]'' favorably contrasted the company's encouragement of \"cottage industry software developers\" to [[Texas Instruments]] discouraging [[third-party software]].<ref name=\"thornburg198104\">{{Cite magazine |last=Thornburg |first=David D. |date=April 1981 |title=The Commodore VIC-20: A First Look |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue11/12_1_THE_COMMODORE_VIC-20_A_FIRST_LOOK.php |magazine=Compute! |page=26}}</ref> Because of its small memory and low-resolution display compared to some other computers of the time, the VIC-20 was primarily used for educational software and games.

This software was distributed via [[online service]]s such as CompuServe, [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]s, as well as offline by mail order and by user groups. Several [[computer magazine]]s sold on newsstands, such as ''[[Compute!]]'', ''[[Family Computing]]'', ''[[RUN (magazine)|RUN]]'', ''Ahoy!'', and the CBM-produced ''[[Commodore Power Play]]'', offered programming tips and [[type-in program]]s for the VIC-20.\n\nAn estimated 300 commercial titles were available on [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] and another 500+ were available on tape.{{According to whom|date=February 2020}} A handful of disk applications were released.\n\nThe VIC's low cost led to it being used by the [[Fort Pierce, Florida]] Utilities Authority to measure the input and output of two of their generators and display the results on monitors throughout the plant.

Sales of the C64 were slow at first due to reliability problems and lack of software. But by the middle of 1983, sales of the C64 took off resulting in plunging sales for the VIC-20. In order to try and staunch the sales decline, by mid-1983 the computer had become widely available for under $90.<ref name=\"lock198306\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1983-06-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_037_1983_Jun#page/n7/mode/2up | title=Editor's Notes | work=Compute! | date=June 1983 | accessdate=30 October 2013 | author=Lock, Robert | pages=6}}</ref> As sales of the computer continued to decline, the VIC-20 was quietly discontinued in January 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.commodore.ca/products/vic20/commodore_vic-20.htm|title=Commodore.ca - Products - Commodore VIC-20 History, Pictures & Time Line|last=administrator@commodore.ca|website=www.commodore.ca|accessdate=23 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214045926/http://commodore.ca/products/vic20/commodore_vic-20.htm|archive-date=14 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Perhaps the last new commercially available VIC-20 peripheral was the VIC-Talker, a [[speech synthesizer]]; ''[[Ahoy!]]'' in January 1986 wrote when discussing it, \"Believe it or not, a new VIC accessory...We were as surprised as you.\"<ref name=\"kevelson198601\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Ahoy_Issue_25_1986-01_Ion_International_US#page/n31/mode/2up | title=Speech Synthesizers for the Commodore Computers / Part II | work=Ahoy! | date=January 1986 | accessdate=2 July 2014 | author=Kevelson, Morton | pages=32}}</ref>\n\n==Technical specifications==\n[[File:4860 - VIC-20 Mainboard.JPG|thumb|VIC-20 mainboard]]\n\nThe VIC-20 shipped with {{nowrap|5 KB}} [[random-access memory|RAM]], but {{nowrap|1.5 KB}} of this was used by the system for the video display and dynamic aspects of the [[read-only memory|ROM]]-resident [[Commodore BASIC]] and [[KERNAL]] (a low-level operating system). Only 3583 bytes of BASIC program memory for code and variables are actually available on an unexpanded machine.\n\n====Ports and sockets====\nThe VIC-20 has card edge connectors for program/expansion cartridges and a PET-standard [[Datassette]] tape drive. The VIC-20 did not originally have a disk drive; the [[VIC-1540]] disk drive was released in 1981.\n\nThe computer also has a single [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] [[Atari joystick port]], compatible with the digital [[joystick]]s and [[paddle (game controller)|paddles]] used with [[Atari 2600]] videogame consoles<ref name=\"flynn198206\">{{cite news | url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue25/035_1_USING_ATARI_JOYSTICKS_WITH_YOUR_VIC.php | title=Using Atari Joysticks With Your VIC | work=Compute! | date=June 1982 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Flynn, Christopher J. | pages=79}}</ref> (the use of a standard port ensured ample supply of Atari-manufactured and other third-party joysticks; Commodore itself offered an Atari-protocol joystick under the Commodore brand); a serial [[Commodore bus|CBM-488]] bus (a serial version of the PET's [[IEEE-488]] bus) for [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]ing [[Commodore 1540|disk drives]] and printers; a [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]-level \"user port\" with both [[RS-232]] and [[Centronics]] signals (most frequently used as RS-232, for connecting a [[modem]]<ref>The Commodore VICModem and later models connected directly to the user port's edge connector. But in order to connect the VIC to industry-standard [[modem]]s and other [[RS-232]] devices, the user needed to purchase a separate [[transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]-to-RS232 [[volt]]age converter box (standard TTL voltages lie between 0 and 5&nbsp;V, while RS-232 uses \u00b112&nbsp;V).</ref>).\n\nThe VIC has a [[ROM cartridge]] port to allow for plug-in cartridges with games and other software as well as for adding memory to the machine. Port expander boxes were available from Commodore and other vendors to allow more than one cartridge to be attached at a time. Cartridge software ranged from {{nowrap|4\u201316 KB}} in size, although the latter was uncommon due to its cost.\n\nThe VIC-20 can be hooked into external electronic circuitry via joystick port, the so-called \"user port,\" or the memory expansion\u2013cartridge port, which exposes various analog to digital, memory bus, and other internal I/O circuits to the experimenter. The BASIC language can then be used (using the [[PEEK and POKE]] commands) to perform data acquisition from temperature sensors, control robotic stepper motors, etc.\n\n====Graphics====\n[[Image:Screen color test CommodoreVIC20 Multicolor.png|thumb|right|16-color capability]]\n\nThe graphics capabilities of the [[MOS Technology VIC|VIC chip]] (6560/6561) are limited but flexible. At startup the screen shows 176\u00d7184 pixels, with a fixed-color border to the edges of the screen. Since a PAL or NTSC screen has a 4:3 width-to-height ratio, each VIC pixel is much wider than it is high. The screen normally shows 22 columns and 23 rows of 8-by-8-pixel characters; it is possible to increase these dimensions up to 27 columns, but the characters would soon [[overscan|run out the sides of the monitor]] at about 25 columns. Just as on the PET, two different 256 character sets are included, the uppercase/graphics character set and the upper/lowercase set, and reverse video versions of both. Normally, the VIC-20 operates in high-resolution mode whereby each character is 8\u00d78 pixels in size and uses one color. A lower-resolution multicolor mode can also be used with 4\u00d78 characters and three colors each, but it is not used as often due to its extreme blockiness.\n\nThe VIC chip does not support a true bitmap mode, but programmers can define their own custom character sets. It is possible to get a fully addressable screen, although slightly smaller than normal, by filling the screen with a sequence of different double-height characters, then turning on the pixels selectively inside the RAM-based character definitions. The [[Super Expander]] cartridge adds BASIC commands supporting such a graphics mode using a resolution of 160\u00d7160 pixels. It is also possible to fill a larger area of the screen with addressable graphics using a more dynamic allocation scheme, if the contents are sparse or repetitive enough. This is used by the port of ''[[Omega Race]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe VIC chip has readable scan-line counters but cannot generate interrupts based on the scan position. The two VIA timer chips can serve this purpose through an elaborate programming technique, allowing graphics to mixed with text above or below it, two different background and border colors, or more than 200 characters for the pseudo-high-resolution mode.\n\nThe VIC chip can process a [[light pen]] signal (a light pen input is provided on the [[D-subminiature|DE-9]] joystick connector) but few appeared on the market.\n\nThe VIC chip outputs composite video. Commodore did not include an RF modulator inside the computer's case because of FCC regulations. It can either be attached to a dedicated monitor or a TV set using the external modulator included with the computer.\n\n====Sound====\nThe VIC chip has three [[pulse wave]] generators and a white noise generator with an overall volume control and mono output. Each pulse wave generator has a range of three [[octave]]s located on the scale about an octave apart, giving a total range of about five octaves.\n\n=={{anchor|ramcarts}}Memory expansion==\n[[File:Vic20 16k.jpg|thumb|A {{nowrap|16 KB}} RAM expansion cartridge]]\n\nBecause the VIC had only 5K RAM, the VIC-20's RAM was expandable through the cartridge port via a Super Expander Cartridge (or simply, RAM Expander). RAM cartridges were available in several sizes: {{nowrap|3 KB}} (with or without an included BASIC extension ROM), {{nowrap|8 KB}}, {{nowrap|16 KB}}, {{nowrap|32 KB}} and {{nowrap|64 KB}}, the latter two only from third-party vendors. The internal memory map was dramatically reorganized with the addition of each size cartridge, leading to a situation where some programs would only work if the right amount of memory was present (to cater to this, the {{nowrap|32 KB}} cartridges had switches, and the 64&nbsp;KB cartridges had software setups, allowing the RAM to be enabled in user-selectable memory blocks).\n\nSince the VIC-20 was designed to use SRAM rather than DRAM, the system board had no provisions for RAM refresh. Memory expansion cartridges may in practice use either type; however, DRAM-based expanders had to contain their own circuitry to refresh the RAM and multiplex the data/address bus, and one possible reason for the oversized VIC-20 cartridge PCBs may have been to provide room for DRAM infrastructure.\n\nThe memory mapping of the VIC-20 was slightly confusing and could vary depending on system configuration. With no expanders installed, free user memory started at $1000 and extended up to $1DFF, with the video buffer placed at $1E00-$1FFF. Below $1000 was a \"hole\" from $400-$FFF which could be filled with 3&nbsp;KB of expansion RAM, which if installed would place the BASIC program area at $400. If an 8&nbsp;KB or larger expander was used, screen memory began at $1000 and BASIC program text at $1200.\n\nThe VIC-20 allowed two locations for color RAM, either at $9600 or $9400. The default for unexpanded machines was at $9600, and with an 8&nbsp;KB or larger expander, the color RAM would be moved to $9400, however the user could freely set it to either location via the register at $9002.\n\nThe normal location for ROM cartridges was at $A000\u2013$BFFF. On power up, the kernel ROM checked for an ID header and if found would jump to the specified starting address. Larger 16&nbsp;KB cartridges had the second half of ROM either at $2000 or $6000. A few cartridges, including Scott Adams adventures, loaded entirely in the $2000-$7FFF area. Since the kernel can only autostart ROMs located at $A000, such programs would have to be manually launched from BASIC via the SYS command.\n\nCommodore's official RAM expansion cartridges were only available up to a maximum of 16&nbsp;KB worth of additional memory, but third party cartridges could provide up to 64&nbsp;KB and sometimes included DIP switches to map the additional RAM to user-selectable address space.\n\nUnlike the PET, the VIC-20 did not include a built-in machine language monitor, but Commodore offered them on disk, tape, or cartridge, with several different executables to load into various memory locations. The monitor programs were the same as the PET monitor, but now added a mini-assembler instead of requiring the user to enter hexadecimal opcodes.\n\nThe 32&nbsp;KB cartridges allowed adding up to 24&nbsp;KB to the BASIC user memory; together with the 3.5&nbsp;KB built-in user memory, this gave a maximum of 27.5&nbsp;KB for BASIC programs and variables. The extra 8&nbsp;KB could usually be used in one of two ways, set by switches:\n# Either it could be mapped into the address space reserved for ROM cartridges, which sat \"behind\" the I/O register space and thus was not contiguous with the rest of the RAM. This allowed running many cartridge-based games from disk or tape and was thus very useful for software pirates; especially if the RAM expansion allowed switching off writing to its memory after the game was loaded, so that the memory behaved exactly like ROM.\n# Or, 3&nbsp;KB of the 8&nbsp;KB could be mapped into the same memory \"hole\" that the 3&nbsp;KB cartridge used, letting 5&nbsp;KB lie fallow. These 3&nbsp;KB were contiguous with the rest of RAM, but couldn't be used to expand BASIC space to more than 27.5&nbsp;KB, because the display data would have had to be moved to cartridge RAM, which was not possible.\n\nSome 64&nbsp;KB expansion cartridges allowed the user to copy [[ROM image]]s to RAM. The more advanced versions even contained an 80-character video chip and a patched BASIC interpreter which gave access to 48&nbsp;KB of the memory and to the 80-column video mode. As the latter type of cartridges, marketed primarily in Germany, were not released until late 1984\u2014two years after the appearance of the more capable [[Commodore 64|C64]]\u2014they went by mostly unnoticed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Memory map<ref name=\"zi_mm\">{{cite web|title=VIC-20 memory map (long)|url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/vic/memorymap.txt|date=19 September 2005|accessdate=2013-05-20|publisher=zimmers.net}}</ref>\n!

While predicting the 22-column screen was \"too small to support any but the most rudimentary business applications\" the magazine observed that \"at a price of $299, that is hardly the point\", stating that \"the VIC will provide very stiff competition to the [[TRS-80 Color Computer]]\" and \"is a much more valuable computer literacy tool than\" other products like the [[TRS-80 Pocket Computer]]. ''Compute!'' concluded \"VIC will create its own market, and it will be a big one\".{{r|thornburg198104}} While also noting the small screen size and RAM, ''[[BYTE]]'' stated that the VIC 20 was \"unexcelled as low-cost, consumer-oriented computer. Even with some of its limitations...it makes an impressive showing against...the [[Apple II]], the Radio Shack [[TRS-80]], and the [[Atari 8-bit family|Atari 800]]\". The magazine praised the price (\"Looking at a picture...might cause you to think $600 would be a fair price...But it does not cost $600\u2014the VIC 20 retails for $299.95\"), keyboard (\"the equal of any personal-computer keyboard in both appearance and performance.
