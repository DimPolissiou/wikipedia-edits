People from the Viken area were not called \"Viking\" in Old Norse manuscripts, but are referred to as ''v\u00edkverir'', ('V\u00edk dwellers'). In addition, that explanation could explain only the masculine (''v\u00edkingr'') and not the feminine (''v\u00edking''), which is a serious problem because the masculine is easily derived from the feminine but hardly the other way around.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/viking%20rowshift.pdf|title=''V\u00edking'' \u2013 'rower shifting'?

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

England suffered from internal divisions and was relatively easy prey given the proximity of many towns to the sea or to navigable rivers. Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted.

The [[Jutes]] invaded the British Isles three centuries earlier, pouring out from [[Jutland]] during the [[Age of Migrations]], before the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] settled there. The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the [[Dnieper Rapids|rapids]] on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.<ref>See information on the \"Slavonic and Norse names of the Dnieper rapids\" on [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].</ref><ref>Else Roesdahl (prof. in Arch. & Hist.): ''The Vikings'', Penguin Books (1999), {{ISBN|0-14-025282-7}}</ref>\n\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists. As a result, there is much more material from the Viking Age about Norway than Sweden, which apart from many runic inscriptions, has almost no written sources from the early Middle Ages.\n\n====Runestones====\n{{Main|Runestone}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = U 240, Lingsberg.JPG\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Lingberg Runestone\n| caption1  = The [[Lingsberg Runestone]] in Sweden\n| image2    = Jellingsten stor 2.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Jelling Stones\n| caption2  = Runic inscriptions of the larger of the [[Jelling Stones]] in Denmark\n| footer    = Two types of Norse runestones from the Viking Age\n}}\nThe Norse of the Viking Age could read and write and used a non-standardised alphabet, called ''runor'', built upon sound values.

They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of ''runor'' survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. \n\nThe runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.<ref name=\"forskning.no\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Olstad\n |first=Lisa\n |title=Ein minnestein for \u00e5 hedre seg sj\u00f8lv\n |publisher=forskning.no\n |date=2002-12-16\n |url=http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2002/desember/1039779970.6\n |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Sweden has as many as between 1,700<ref name=\"forskning.no\"/> and 2,500<ref name=\"Zilmer38\">Zilmer 2005:38</ref> depending on definition.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = The longship facilitated far-reaching expeditions, but the Vikings also constructed several other types of ships.\n}}\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions. When a Jarl died and was buried, his household thralls were sometimes [[Human sacrifice in Germanic paganism|sacrificially killed]] and buried next to him, as many excavations have revealed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|title=Double graves with headless slaves|date=5 December 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Mari Kildah|publisher=University of Oslo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011090033/http://www.hf.uio.no/iakh/english/research/news-and-events/news/2013/double-graves-with-headless-slaves.html|archive-date=11 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn daily life, there were many intermediate positions in the overall social structure and it is believed that there must have been some social mobility. These details are unclear, but titles and positions like ''hauldr'', ''thegn'', ''landmand'', show mobility between the Karls and the Jarls.\n\nOther social structures included the communities of ''f\u00e9lag'' in both the civil and the military spheres, to which its members (called ''f\u00e9lagi'') were obliged. A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader. Members of the latter were referred to as ''drenge'', one of the words for warrior. There were also official communities within towns and villages, the overall defence, religion, the legal system and the [[Thing (assembly)|Things]].\n\n====Women====\nWomen had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic [[Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s]] and the Norwegian [[Frostating]] laws and [[Gulating]] laws.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Borgstr\u00f6m Eva {{in lang|sv}}: Makal\u00f6sa kvinnor: k\u00f6ns\u00f6verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. {{ISBN|91-501-0191-9}} (inb.).

This included spear and stone throwing, building and testing physical strength through [[wrestling]] (see [[glima]]), [[fist fighting]], and stone lifting. In areas with mountains, [[mountain climbing]] was practised as a sport. Agility and balance were built and tested by running and jumping for sport, and there is mention of a sport that involved jumping from oar to oar on the outside of a ship's railing as it was being rowed. [[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear. It appears to have involved two stallions pitted against each other, within smell and sight of fenced-off mares. Whatever the rules were, the fights often resulted in the death of one of the stallions.\n\nIcelandic sources refer to the sport of ''[[knattleikr|knattleik]]''. A ball game akin to [[hockey]], knattleik involved a bat and a small hard ball and was usually played on a smooth field of ice. The rules are unclear, but it was popular with both adults and children, even though it often led to injuries. Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows. The techniques were stalking, snare and traps and ''[[par force]]'' hunting with dog packs.\n\n====Games and entertainment====\n[[File:Beserker, Lewis Chessmen, British Museum.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rook, [[Lewis chessmen]], at the British Museum in London]]\nBoth archaeological finds and written sources testify to the fact that the Vikings set aside time for social and festive gatherings.<ref name=KWolf/><ref name=SportsGames/><ref name=NatMus>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|title=Games and entertainment in the Viking period|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502075927/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/the-people/games-and-entertainment/|archive-date=2 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoard games and dice games were played as a popular pastime at all levels of society.

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as [[Frans Gunnar Bengtsson]]'s ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (which was also released as a [[The Long Ships (1963 film)|1963 film]]), and historical fantasies such as the film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' (movie version called ''[[The 13th Warrior]]''), and the comedy film ''[[Erik the Viking]]''. The vampire [[Eric Northman]], in the HBO TV series ''[[True Blood]]'', was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the [[Danish American]] writer [[Poul Anderson]], while British explorer, historian, and writer [[Tim Severin]] authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.\n\nIn 1962, American comic book writer [[Stan Lee]] and his brother [[Larry Lieber]], together with [[Jack Kirby]], created the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] and its sequels ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. The character also appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and its associated [[Marvel's Avengers Assemble (TV series)|animated series]].\n\nThe appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings (2013)]], directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok|fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]], itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.<ref>Gareth Lloyd Evans, \"Michael Hirst\u2019s Vikings and Old Norse Poetry\", ''Translating Early Medieval Poetry: Transformation, Reception, Interpretation''.

While the earliest groups had little claim for historical accuracy, the seriousness and accuracy of reenactors has increased. The largest such groups include [[The Vikings (reenactment)|The Vikings]] and [[Regia Anglorum]], though many smaller groups exist in Europe, North America, New Zealand, and Australia. Many reenactor groups participate in live-steel combat, and a few have Viking-style ships or boats.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Vikings]] of the [[National Football League]] are so-named owing to the large Scandinavian population in the US state of [[Minnesota]].\n\nDuring the banking boom of the first decade of the twenty-first century, Icelandic financiers came to be styled as ''[[\u00fatr\u00e1sarv\u00edkingar]]'' (roughly 'raiding Vikings').<ref>Ann-Sofie Nielsen Gremaud, \u2018[https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/handle/18452/8692 The Vikings are coming!

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven. The general misconception that Viking warriors wore horned helmets was partly promulgated by the 19th-century enthusiasts of ''[[Geatish Society|G\u00f6tiska F\u00f6rbundet]]'', founded in 1811 in [[Stockholm]].<ref name=\"Frank\">{{cite book |last=Frank |first=Roberta |title=International Scandinavian and Medieval Studies in Memory of Gerd Wolfgang Weber |year=2000 |publisher=Ed.

This was done to legitimise the Vikings and their mythology by associating it with the Classical world, which had long been idealised in European culture.\n\nThe latter-day ''mythos'' created by [[National Romanticism|national romantic ideas]] blended the Viking Age with aspects of the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] some 2,000 years earlier.

People from the Viken area were not called \"Viking\" in Old Norse manuscripts, but are referred to as ''v\u00edkverir'', ('V\u00edk dwellers'). In addition, that explanation could explain only the masculine (''v\u00edkingr'') and not the feminine (''v\u00edking''), which is a serious problem because the masculine is easily derived from the feminine but hardly the other way around.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/viking%20rowshift.pdf|title=''V\u00edking'' \u2013 'rower shifting'?

The Old Norse feminine ''v\u00edking'' (as in the phrase ''fara \u00ed v\u00edking'') may originally have been a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers, i.e. a long-distance sea journey, because in the pre-sail era, the shifting of rowers would distinguish long-distance sea journeys. A ''v\u00edkingr'' (the masculine) would then originally have been a participant on a sea journey characterised by the shifting of rowers. In that case, the word Viking was not originally connected to Scandinavian seafarers but assumed this meaning when the Scandinavians begun to dominate the seas.<ref name=\"Eldar Heide 2008 23\u201328\"/>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the word ''wicing'' appears first in the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] poem, ''[[Widsith]]'', which probably dates from the 9th century. In Old English, and in the history of the archbishops of [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Hamburg-Bremen]] written by [[Adam of Bremen]] in about 1070, the term generally referred to Scandinavian pirates or raiders. As in the Old Norse usages, the term is not employed as a name for any people or culture in general. The word does not occur in any preserved [[Middle English]] texts. One theory made by the [[Iceland]]er \u00d6rnolfur Kristjansson is that the key to the origins of the word is \"''wicinga cynn''\" in Widsith, referring to the people or the race living in [[Scandinavian York|J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] (York, in the ninth century under control by Norsemen), ''J\u00f3r-Wicings'' (note, however, that this is not the origin of ''J\u00f3rv\u00edk'').<ref name=\"arch in europe\">{{cite web|last=Beard |first=David |title=The Term \"Viking\" |url=http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |work=archeurope.com |publisher=Archaeology in Europe |accessdate=23 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407050944/http://www.archeurope.com/index.php?page=the-term-viking |archivedate=7 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe word ''Viking'' was introduced into Modern English during the 18th-century Viking revival, at which point it acquired romanticised heroic overtones of \"[[barbarian]] warrior\" or [[noble savage]]. During the 20th century, the meaning of the term was expanded to refer to not only seaborne raiders from Scandinavia and other places settled by them (like [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]), but also any member of the culture that produced said raiders during the period from the late 8th to the mid-11th centuries, or more loosely from about 700 to as late as about 1100. As an adjective, the word is used to refer to ideas, phenomena, or artefacts connected with those people and their cultural life, producing expressions like ''Viking age'', ''Viking culture'', ''Viking art'', ''Viking religion'', ''Viking ship'' and so on.<ref name=\"arch in europe\"/>\n\nThe term \u201dViking\u201d that appeared in Northwestern Germanic sources in the Viking Age denoted pirates. According to some researchers, the term back then had no geographic or ethnic connotations that limited it to Scandinavia only. The term was instead used about anyone who to the Norse peoples appeared as a pirate. Therefore the term had been used about Israelites on the Red Sea; Muslims encountering Scandinavians in the Mediterranean; Caucasian pirates encountering the famous Swedish Ingvar-Expedition, and Estonian pirates on the Baltic Sea. Thus the term \"Viking\" was supposedly never limited to a single ethnicity as such, but rather an activity.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/8906219/_Vikings_and_the_Viking_Age?email_work_card=title]</ref>\n\n===Other names===\n[[File:Europe 814.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Europe in 814.

Lack of organised naval opposition throughout Western Europe allowed Viking ships to travel freely, raiding or trading as opportunity permitted.

The [[Saxons]] and the [[Angles]] did the same, embarking from mainland Europe. The Viking raids were, however, the first to be documented in writing by eyewitnesses, and they were much larger in scale and frequency than in previous times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |title=Viking expeditions and raids |publisher=National Museum of Denmark |accessdate=20 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172137/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/ |archive-date=18 March 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nVikings themselves were expanding; although their motives are unclear, historians believe that scarce resources or a lack of mating opportunities were a factor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Vikings : a very short introduction|last=Richards|first=J.D.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Highway of Slaves\" was a term for a route that the Vikings found to have a direct pathway from Scandinavia to Constantinople and Baghdad while traveling on the Baltic Sea.

This period of energetic activity also had a pronounced effect in the Scandinavian homelands, which were subject to a variety of new influences.<ref>Roesdahl, pp. 295\u201397</ref> In the 300 years from the late 8th century, when contemporary chroniclers first commented on the appearance of Viking raiders, to the end of the 11th century, Scandinavia underwent profound cultural changes.\n\nBy the late 11th century, royal dynasties legitimised by the [[Catholic Church]] (which had had little influence in Scandinavia 300 years earlier) were asserting their power with increasing authority and ambition, and the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden had taken shape. Towns appeared that functioned as secular and ecclesiastical administrative centres and market sites, and monetary economies began to emerge based on English and German models.<ref>Gareth Williams, \"Kingship, Christianity and coinage: monetary and political perspectives on silver economy in the Viking Age\", in ''Silver Economy in the Viking Age'', ed. [[James Graham-Campbell]] and Gareth Williams, pp.&nbsp;177\u2013214; {{ISBN|978-1-59874-222-0}}</ref> By this time the influx of Islamic silver from the East had been absent for more than a century, and the flow of English silver had come to an end in the mid-11th century.<ref>Roesdahl, p. 296</ref>\n\n==== Assimilation into Christendom ====\n[[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianity had taken root]] in Denmark and Norway with the establishment of dioceses during the 11th century, and the new religion was beginning to organise and assert itself more effectively in Sweden. Foreign churchmen and native elites were energetic in furthering the interests of Christianity, which was now no longer operating only on a missionary footing, and old ideologies and lifestyles were transforming. By 1103, the first archbishopric was founded in Scandinavia, at [[Lund]], Scania, then part of Denmark.\n\nThe assimilation of the nascent Scandinavian kingdoms into the cultural mainstream of European Christendom altered the aspirations of Scandinavian rulers and of Scandinavians able to travel overseas, and changed their relations with their neighbours. One of the primary sources of profit for the Vikings had been slave-taking. The medieval Church held that Christians should not own fellow Christians as slaves, so [[chattel slavery]] diminished as a practice throughout northern Europe. This took much of the economic incentive out of raiding, though sporadic slaving activity continued into the 11th century. Scandinavian predation in Christian lands around the North and Irish Seas diminished markedly.\n\nThe kings of Norway continued to assert power in parts of northern Britain and Ireland, and raids continued into the 12th century, but the military ambitions of Scandinavian rulers were now directed toward new paths. In 1107, [[Sigurd I of Norway]] sailed for the eastern Mediterranean with Norwegian crusaders to fight for the newly established [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], and Danes and Swedes participated energetically in the [[Baltic Crusades]] of the 12th and 13th centuries.<ref>The Northern Crusades: Second Edition by Eric Christiansen; {{ISBN|0-14-026653-4}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nA variety of sources illuminate the culture, activities, and beliefs of the Vikings. Although they were generally a non-literate culture that produced no literary legacy, they had an alphabet and described themselves and their world on [[runestone]]s. Most contemporary literary and written sources on the Vikings come from other cultures that were in contact with them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|title=Written sources shed light on Viking travels|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318172414/http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/expeditions-and-raids/written-sources/|archive-date=18 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the mid-20th century, archaeological findings have built a more complete and balanced picture of the lives of the Vikings.<ref>Hall, 2010, pp. 8 ''passim''.</ref><ref>Roesdahl, pp. 16\u201322.</ref> The archaeological record is particularly rich and varied, providing knowledge of their rural and urban settlement, crafts and production, ships and military equipment, trading networks, as well as their pagan and Christian religious artefacts and practices.\n\n===Literature and language===\n{{See also|Old Norse|The Norse Sagas }}\n[[File:Lbs fragm 82, 0001v - 1.jpg|thumb|One of the few surviving manuscript leaves from the [[Heimskringla Saga]]s, written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] c. 1260. The leaf tells of [[Olaf II of Norway|King \u00d3lafur]].]]\n\nThe most important [[primary sources]] on the Vikings are contemporary texts from Scandinavia and regions where the Vikings were active.<ref>Hall, pp. 8\u201311</ref> Writing in [[Latin]] letters was introduced to Scandinavia with Christianity, so there are few native documentary sources from Scandinavia before the late 11th and early 12th centuries.<ref>Lindqvist, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Scandinavians did write inscriptions in [[runes]], but these are usually very short and formulaic. Most contemporary documentary sources consist of texts written in Christian and Islamic communities outside Scandinavia, often by authors who had been negatively affected by Viking activity.\n\nLater writings on the Vikings and the Viking Age can also be important for understanding them and their culture, although they need to be treated cautiously. After the consolidation of the church and the assimilation of Scandinavia and its colonies into the mainstream of medieval [[Christian culture]] in the 11th and 12th centuries, native written sources begin to appear, in Latin and Old Norse. In the Viking colony of Iceland, an extraordinary vernacular literature blossomed in the 12th through 14th centuries, and many traditions connected with the Viking Age were written down for the first time in the [[Saga|Icelandic sagas]]. A literal interpretation of these medieval prose narratives about the Vikings and the Scandinavian past is doubtful, but many specific elements remain worthy of consideration, such as the great quantity of [[skald]]ic poetry attributed to [[Poet laureate|court poets]] of the 10th and 11th centuries, the exposed family trees, the self images, the ethical values, all included in these literary writings.\n\nIndirectly, the Vikings have also left a window open to their language, culture and activities, through many Old Norse place names and words, found in their former sphere of influence. Some of these place names and words are still in direct use today, almost unchanged, and sheds light on where they settled and what specific places meant to them, as seen in place names like [[Egilsay]] (from ''Eigils ey'' meaning Eigil's Island), [[Ormskirk]] (from ''Ormr kirkja'' meaning Orms Church or Church of the Worm), [[Meols]] (from ''merl'' meaning Sand Dunes), [[Snaefell]] (Snow Fell), [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] (Ravens Rock), [[Vinland]] (Land of Wine or Land of [[Winberry]]), [[Kaupanger]] (Market Harbour), [[T\u00f3rshavn]] (Thor's Harbour), and the religious centre of [[Odense]], meaning a place where [[Odin]] was worshipped. Viking influence is also evident in concepts like the present-day parliamentary body of the [[Tynwald]] on the [[Isle of Man]].\n\nCommon words in everyday English language, like some of the weekdays ([[Thursday]] means Thor's day), [[wikt:axle|axle]], [[wikt:crook|crook]], [[wikt:raft|raft]], [[wikt:knife|knife]], [[wikt:plough|plough]], [[wikt:leather|leather]], [[wikt:window|window]], [[berserker|berserk]], [[bylaw]], [[thorp]], [[skerry]], [[wikt:husband|husband]], {{linktext|heathen}}, [[Hel (being)|Hell]], [[Normans|Norman]] and [[wikt:ransack|ransack]] stem from the Old Norse of the Vikings and give us an opportunity to understand their interactions with the people and cultures of the British Isles.<ref>See [[List of English words of Old Norse origin]] for further explanations on specific words.</ref> In the [[Northern Isles]] of Shetland and Orkney, Old Norse completely replaced the local languages and over time evolved into the now extinct [[Norn language]]. Some modern words and names only emerge and contribute to our understanding after a more intense research of linguistic sources from medieval or later records, such as [[York]] (Horse Bay), [[Swansea]] ([[Sven|Sveinn]]'s Isle) or some of the place names in Normandy like [[Tocqueville (disambiguation)|Tocqueville]] (Toki's farm).<ref>See [[Norman toponymy]].</ref>\n\n[[Linguistic]] and [[etymology|etymological]] studies continue to provide a vital source of information on the Viking culture, their social structure and history and how they interacted with the people and cultures they met, traded, attacked or lived with in overseas settlements.<ref>Henriksen, Louise K\u00e6mpe: [http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 Nordic place names in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032738/http://www.vikingeskibsmuseet.dk/en/the-sea-stallion-past-and-present/persons-and-themes/archaeology-and-history/nordic-place-names-in-europe/#.Uv5mGoVBrY8 |date=22 February 2014 }} Viking Ship Museum Roskilde</ref><ref>[http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html Viking Words] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203125117/http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/changlang/activities/lang/vikings/vikinglang.html |date=3 February 2007 }} The British Library</ref> A lot of Old Norse connections are evident in the modern-day languages of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].<ref>[http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ Department of Scandinavian Research] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208084718/http://nfi.ku.dk/english/ |date=8 February 2014 }} University of Copenhagen</ref> Old Norse did not exert any great influence on the [[Slavic languages]] in the Viking settlements of Eastern Europe. It has been speculated that the reason was the great differences between the two languages, combined with the Rus' Vikings more peaceful businesses in these areas and the fact that they were outnumbered. The Norse named some of the [[Dnieper Rapids|rapids]] on the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]], but this can hardly be seen from the modern names.<ref>See information on the \"Slavonic and Norse names of the Dnieper rapids\" on [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].</ref><ref>Else Roesdahl (prof. in Arch. & Hist.): ''The Vikings'', Penguin Books (1999), {{ISBN|0-14-025282-7}}</ref>\n\nA consequence of the available written sources, which may have coloured how the Viking age is perceived as a historical period, is that much more is known of the Vikings' activities in western Europe than in the East. One reason is that the cultures of north-eastern Europe at the time were non-literate, and did not produce a legacy of literature. Another is that the vast majority of written sources on Scandinavia in the Viking Age come from Iceland, a nation originally settled by Norwegian colonists.

They are usually in memory of the dead, though not necessarily placed at graves. The use of ''runor'' survived into the 15th century, used in parallel with the Latin alphabet. \n\nThe runestones are unevenly distributed in Scandinavia: Denmark has 250 runestones, Norway has 50 while Iceland has none.<ref name=\"forskning.no\">\n{{cite web\n |last=Olstad\n |first=Lisa\n |title=Ein minnestein for \u00e5 hedre seg sj\u00f8lv\n |publisher=forskning.no\n |date=2002-12-16\n |url=http://www.forskning.no/artikler/2002/desember/1039779970.6\n |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref> Sweden has as many as between 1,700<ref name=\"forskning.no\"/> and 2,500<ref name=\"Zilmer38\">Zilmer 2005:38</ref> depending on definition.

There were many types of Viking ships, built for various uses; the best-known type is probably the [[longship]].<ref>Longships are sometimes erroneously called ''drakkar'', a corruption of \"dragon\" in Norse.</ref> Longships were intended for warfare and exploration, designed for speed and agility, and were equipped with oars to complement the sail, making navigation possible independently of the wind. The longship had a long, narrow hull and shallow draught to facilitate landings and troop deployments in shallow water. Longships were used extensively by the [[Leidang]], the Scandinavian defence fleets. The longship allowed the Norse to ''go Viking'', which might explain why this type of ship has become almost synonymous with the concept of Vikings.<ref>Hadingham, Evan: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html Secrets of Viking Ships] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912023933/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/viking-ships.html |date=12 September 2017 }} (05.09.00) NOVA science media.</ref><ref>Durham, Keith: ''Viking Longship'' Osprey Publishing, Oxford, 2002.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction =\n| total_width = 400\n| image1    = VIKING LONGSHIP \"SEA STALLION\" ARRIVES IN DUBLIN.jpg\n| width1    =\n| alt1      = Sea Stallion\n| caption1  = [[Sea Stallion (longship)|A reconstructed longship]]\n| image2    = Modell Knorr.jpg\n| width2    =\n| alt2      = Knarr Haithabu\n| caption2  = A model of the ''knarr'' ship type\n| footer    = The longship facilitated far-reaching expeditions, but the Vikings also constructed several other types of ships.\n}}\n\nThe Vikings built many unique types of watercraft, often used for more peaceful tasks. The ''[[knarr]]'' was a dedicated merchant vessel designed to carry cargo in bulk. It had a broader hull, deeper draught, and a small number of oars (used primarily to manoeuvre in harbours and similar situations). One Viking innovation was the '[[beitass]]', a spar mounted to the sail that allowed their ships to sail effectively against the wind.<ref>Block, Leo, [https://archive.org/details/toharnesswindsho00bloc ''To Harness the Wind: A Short History of the Development of Sails''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101203825/https://books.google.com/books?id=ezgq0VnV5XQC&hl=en |date=1 January 2016 }}, Naval Institute Press, 2002, {{ISBN|1-55750-209-9}}</ref> It was common for seafaring Viking ships to tow or carry a smaller boat to transfer crews and cargo from the ship to shore.\n\nShips were an integral part of the Viking culture. They facilitated everyday transportation across seas and waterways, exploration of new lands, raids, conquests, and trade with neighbouring cultures. They also held a major religious importance. People with high status were sometimes buried in a ship along with animal sacrifices, weapons, provisions and other items, as evidenced by the buried vessels at [[Gokstad]] and [[Oseberg]] in Norway<ref>Ian Heath, The Vikings, p. 4, Osprey Publishing, 1985.</ref> and the excavated ship burial at [[Ladby ship|Ladby]] in Denmark. Ship burials were also practised by Vikings abroad, as evidenced by the excavations of the [[Salme ships]] on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |title=The First Vikings |magazine=Archaeology |publisher=the Archaeological Institute of America |first=Andrew |last=Curry |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=22 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228192503/http://www.archaeology.org/issues/95-1307/features/941-vikings-saaremaa-estonia-salme-vendel-oseberg |archive-date=28 February 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWell-preserved remains of five Viking ships were excavated from [[Roskilde Fjord]] in the late 1960s, representing both the longship and the ''knarr''. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel and thus protect [[Roskilde]], then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The remains of these ships are on display at the [[Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde]].\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Everyday life===\n\n====Social structure====\n[[File:Reconstructed Viking House.jpg|thumb|A reconstructed Viking house in Iceland]]\n[[File:Viking house Ale Sweden.jpg|thumb|200px|Reconstructed Viking Longhouse in Ale, north of Gothenburg [[Sweden]] ]]\n[[File:Chieftains house (reconstruction) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A large reconstructed chieftains longhouse at [[Lofotr Viking Museum]], Norway]]\n[[File:Busdorf - Haithabu - Wikinger-H\u00e4user 05 ies.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed town houses from [[Haithabu]] (now in Germany)]]\n\nViking society was divided into the three socio-economic classes: Thralls, Karls and Jarls. This is described vividly in the [[Eddic poem]] of [[R\u00edgs\u00feula]], which also explains that it was the [[R\u00edg (Norse god)|God R\u00edg]]\u2014father of mankind also known as [[Heimdallr]]\u2014who created the three classes. Archaeology has confirmed this social structure.<ref name=\"Roesdahl 38\">Roesdahl, pp. 38\u201348, 61\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[Thrall]]s were the lowest ranking class and were slaves. Slaves comprised as much as a quarter of the population.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings may have first taken to seas to find women, slaves |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=15 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190115/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/04/vikings-may-have-first-taken-seas-find-women-slaves |archive-date=1 August 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> Slavery was of vital importance to Viking society, for everyday chores and large scale construction and also to trade and the economy. Thralls were servants and workers in the farms and larger households of the Karls and Jarls, and they were used for constructing fortifications, ramps, canals, mounds, roads and similar hard work projects. According to the Rigsthula, Thralls were despised and looked down upon. New thralls were supplied by either the sons and daughters of thralls or they were captured abroad. The Vikings often deliberately captured many people on their raids in Europe, to enslave them as thralls. The thralls were then brought back home to Scandinavia by boat, used on location or in newer settlements to build needed structures, or sold, often to the Arabs in exchange for silver. Other names for thrall were 'tr\u00e6l' and 'ty'.\n\nKarls were free peasants. They owned farms, land and cattle and engaged in daily chores like ploughing the fields, milking the cattle, building houses and wagons, but used thralls to make ends meet. Other names for Karls were 'bonde' or simply free men.\n\nThe Jarls were the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] of the Viking society. They were wealthy and owned large estates with huge longhouses, horses and many thralls. The thralls did most of the daily chores, while the Jarls did administration, politics, hunting, sports, visited other Jarls or were abroad on expeditions.

A f\u00e9lag could be centred around certain trades, a common ownership of a sea vessel or a military obligation under a specific leader.

Almost all of the jewellery was crafted in specific designs unique to the Norse (see [[Viking art]]).

[[Swimming (sport)|Swimming]] was a popular sport and [[Snorri Sturluson]] describes three types: diving, long-distance swimming, and a contest in which two swimmers try to duck one another. Children often participated in some of the sport disciplines and women have also been mentioned as swimmers, although it is unclear if they took part in competition. King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] was hailed as a master of both mountain climbing and oar-jumping, and was said to have excelled in the art of [[knife juggling]] as well.\n\n[[Skiing]] and [[ice skating]] were the primary winter sports of the Vikings, although skiing was also used as everyday means of transport in winter and in the colder regions of the north.\n\nHorse fighting was practised for sport, although the rules are unclear.

Knattleik appears to have been played only in Iceland, where it attracted many spectators, as did horse fighting.\n\nHunting, as a sport, was limited to Denmark, where it was not regarded as an important occupation. Birds, [[deer]], [[hare]]s and [[fox]]es were hunted with bow and spear, and later with crossbows.

The devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe to the Viking presence. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]].<ref>English Historical Documents, c. 500\u20131042 by Dorothy Whitelock; p. 776</ref> Medieval Christians in Europe were totally unprepared for the Viking incursions and could find no explanation for their arrival and the accompanying suffering they experienced at their hands save the \"Wrath of God\".<ref>Derry (2012).

Early transmission of this information was primarily oral, and later texts were reliant upon the writings and transcriptions of Christian scholars, including the [[Icelanders]] Snorri Sturluson and [[S\u00e6mundur fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]. Many of these sagas were written in Iceland, and most of them, even if they had no Icelandic provenance, were preserved there after the Middle Ages due to the continued interest of Icelanders in Norse literature and law codes.\n\nThe 200-year Viking influence on [[History of Europe|European history]] is filled with tales of plunder and colonisation, and the majority of these chronicles came from western witnesses and their descendants. Less common, though equally relevant, are the Viking chronicles that originated in the east, including the [[Nestor the Chronicler|Nestor]] chronicles, [[Novgorod]] chronicles, [[Ibn Fadlan]] chronicles, [[Ibn Rusta]] chronicles, and brief mentions by [[Photius]], patriarch of Constantinople, regarding their first attack on the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other chroniclers of Viking history include [[Adam of Bremen]], who wrote, in the fourth volume of his ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'', \"[t]here is much gold here (in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]]), accumulated by piracy. These pirates, which are called ''wichingi'' by their own people, and ''Ascomanni'' by our own people, pay tribute to the Danish king.\" In 991, the [[Battle of Maldon]] between Viking raiders and the inhabitants of [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex was commemorated with a poem of the same name.\n\n===Post-medieval perceptions===\n[[File:Vikings fight.JPG|right|thumb|A [[Combat reenactment|modern reenactment]] of a Viking battle]]\nEarly modern publications, dealing with what is now called Viking culture, appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (''History of the northern people'') of [[Olaus Magnus]] (1555), and the first edition of the 13th-century ''Gesta Danorum'' (''Deeds of the Danes''),  by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in 1514. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and the Swede [[Olaus Rudbeck]] used runic inscriptions and Icelandic sagas as historical sources. An important early British contributor to the study of the Vikings was [[George Hickes (divine)|George Hickes]], who published his ''Linguarum vett. septentrionalium thesaurus'' (''Dictionary of the Old Northern Languages'') in 1703\u201305. During the 18th century, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and early Scandinavian culture grew dramatically, expressed in English translations of Old Norse texts and in original poems that extolled the supposed Viking virtues.\n\nThe word \"viking\" was first popularised at the beginning of the 19th century by [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] in his poem, ''The Viking''. Geijer's poem did much to propagate the new romanticised ideal of the Viking, which had little basis in historical fact. The renewed interest of [[Romanticism]] in the Old North had contemporary political implications. The [[Geatish Society]], of which Geijer was a member, popularised this myth to a great extent. Another Swedish author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]], member of the Geatish Society, who wrote a modern version of ''[[Fri\u00f0\u00fej\u00f3fs saga hins fr\u0153kna]]'', which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, and Germany.\n\n[[File:Viking Siege of Paris.jpg|thumb|Viking long ships [[Siege of Paris (845)|besieging Paris]] in 845, 19th century portrayal]]\nFascination with the Vikings reached a peak during the so-called [[Viking revival]] in the late 18th and 19th centuries as a branch of [[Romantic nationalism]]. In Britain this was called Septentrionalism, in Germany \"[[Wagnerian]]\" pathos, and in the Scandinavian countries [[Scandinavism]]. Pioneering 19th-century scholarly editions of the Viking Age began to reach a small readership in Britain, archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past, and linguistic enthusiasts started to identify the Viking-Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs.

Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, pp. 362\u201364</ref> In Normandy, which had been settled by Vikings, the Viking ship became an uncontroversial regional symbol. In Germany, awareness of Viking history in the 19th century had been stimulated by the border dispute with Denmark over Schleswig-Holstein and the use of Scandinavian mythology by [[Richard Wagner]]. The idealised view of the Vikings appealed to Germanic supremacists who transformed the figure of the Viking in accordance with the ideology of the Germanic master race.<ref>[[William W. Fitzhugh|Fitzhugh]] and Ward, p. 363</ref> Building on the linguistic and cultural connections between Norse-speaking Scandinavians and other Germanic groups in the distant past, Scandinavian Vikings were portrayed in [[Nazi Germany]] as a pure Germanic type. The cultural phenomenon of Viking expansion was re-interpreted for use as propaganda to support the extreme militant nationalism of the Third Reich, and ideologically informed interpretations of Viking paganism and the Scandinavian use of runes were employed in the construction of [[Nazi mysticism]]. Other political organisations of the same ilk, such as the former Norwegian fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], similarly appropriated elements of the modern Viking cultural myth in their symbolism and propaganda.\n\n[[Soviet]] and earlier [[Slavophilia|Slavophile]] historians emphasized a Slavic rooted foundation in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the [[Kievan Rus']].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ohloblyn |first1=Oleksander |title=Normanist Theory |url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |website=Encyclopedia of Ukraine |accessdate=7 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907221348/http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CN%5CO%5CNormanisttheory.htm |archive-date=7 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives.

These have included novels directly based on historical events, such as [[Frans Gunnar Bengtsson]]'s ''[[The Long Ships]]'' (which was also released as a [[The Long Ships (1963 film)|1963 film]]), and historical fantasies such as the film ''[[The Vikings (1958 film)|The Vikings]]'', [[Michael Crichton]]'s ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' (movie version called ''[[The 13th Warrior]]''), and the comedy film ''[[Erik the Viking]]''. The vampire [[Eric Northman]], in the HBO TV series ''[[True Blood]]'', was a Viking prince before being turned into a vampire. Vikings appear in several books by the [[Danish American]] writer [[Poul Anderson]], while British explorer, historian, and writer [[Tim Severin]] authored a trilogy of novels in 2005 about a young Viking adventurer Thorgils Leifsson, who travels around the world.\n\nIn 1962, American comic book writer [[Stan Lee]] and his brother [[Larry Lieber]], together with [[Jack Kirby]], created the [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], which they based on the Norse god of the same name. The character is featured in the 2011 [[Marvel Studios]] film [[Thor (film)|''Thor'']] and its sequels ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. The character also appears in the 2012 film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and its associated [[Marvel's Avengers Assemble (TV series)|animated series]].\n\nThe appearance of Vikings within popular media and television has seen a resurgence in recent decades, especially with the History Channel's series [[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings (2013)]], directed by Michael Hirst. The show has a loose grounding in historical facts and sources, but bases itself more so on literary sources, such as [[Tale of Ragnar Lodbrok|fornaldarsaga Ragnars saga lo\u00f0br\u00f3kar]], itself more legend than fact, and Old Norse Eddic and Skaldic poetry.<ref>Gareth Lloyd Evans, \"Michael Hirst\u2019s Vikings and Old Norse Poetry\", ''Translating Early Medieval Poetry: Transformation, Reception, Interpretation''.

The formal, close-quarters style of Viking combat (either in shield walls or aboard \"ship islands\") would have made horned helmets cumbersome and hazardous to the warrior's own side.\n\nHistorians therefore believe that Viking warriors did not wear horned helmets; whether such helmets were used in Scandinavian culture for other, ritual purposes, remains unproven.

It also stars [[Alec Baldwin]]. \n\nThe film premiered at [[American Film Institute|AFI Fest]] on November 11, 2015 and was released  by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Steelers]] [[Center (gridiron football)|center]] [[Mike Webster]] is found dead in his [[pickup truck]], after years of [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] and [[homelessness]]. Before his death, [[Justin Strzelczyk]], a former fellow [[American Football|football]] player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] speech.\n\n[[Bennet Omalu|Dr. Bennet Omalu]] (Will Smith), a [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] with the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] [[coroner]]'s office, handles Webster's [[autopsy]]. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines [[Microscope slide|microscope slides]] of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe [[brain damage|neurotrauma]], concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). With the help of former Steelers [[team doctor]] Dr. Julian Bailes, fellow [[Neurology|neurologist]] [[Steven T. DeKosky|Dr. Steven DeKosky]] and county coroner [[Cyril Wecht|Dr. Cyril Wecht]], Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in [[Neurosurgery_(journal)|''Neurosurgery'']], which are dismissed by the [[National Football League|NFL]].\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that three additional deceased NFL players, [[Justin Strzelczyk]] (2004), [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]] (2005), and [[Andre Waters]] (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] executive [[Dave Duerson]] angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to [[Africa]].\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in [[Pittsburgh]], having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be [[deportation|deported]], or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a [[miscarriage]] after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to [[Lodi, California]] where he takes a job with the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits [[suicide]] due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening [[cognitive skill|cognitive function]]. In his [[suicide note]], Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, [[2011 NFL lockout|NFL players sue the league]] for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of [[Medical examiner|Chief Medical Examiner]] for the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming [[Naturalization|naturalized]] as a [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizen]] in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of [[Junior Seau]]'s suicide in 2012 and subsequent [[Concussions in American football#Federal NFL concussion litigation|lawsuits]] brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Dr. Julian Bailes\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Dr. [[Cyril Wecht]]\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Prema Mutiso\n* [[David Morse]] as [[Mike Webster]]\n** [[Ben McDonnell]] as young [[Mike Webster]]\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Dr. [[Joseph Maroon]]\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Daniel Sullivan\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Dr. [[Steven T.

It also stars [[Alec Baldwin]]. \n\nThe film premiered at [[American Film Institute|AFI Fest]] on November 11, 2015 and was released  by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 25, 2015. The film grossed $48 million worldwide and received mixed reviews, although Smith earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]] nomination.\n\n==Plot==\n\n[[Steelers]] [[Center (gridiron football)|center]] [[Mike Webster]] is found dead in his [[pickup truck]], after years of [[Self-harm|self-mutilation]] and [[homelessness]]. Before his death, [[Justin Strzelczyk]], a former fellow [[American Football|football]] player, confides in Webster that he is starting to lose his memory, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. A disoriented Webster brushes Strzelczyk's worries off, and deliriously tells him that the most important thing \"is to finish the game,\" reciting what he said during his [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] speech.\n\n[[Bennet Omalu|Dr. Bennet Omalu]] (Will Smith), a [[Forensic pathology|forensic pathologist]] with the [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] [[coroner]]'s office, handles Webster's [[autopsy]]. He wonders how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, and makes it a point to figure out why he died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at only fifty years of age. Dr. Omalu closely examines [[Microscope slide|microscope slides]] of Webster's brain and sees evidence of severe [[brain damage|neurotrauma]], concluding that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] (CTE). With the help of former Steelers [[team doctor]] Dr. Julian Bailes, fellow [[Neurology|neurologist]] [[Steven T. DeKosky|Dr. Steven DeKosky]] and county coroner [[Cyril Wecht|Dr. Cyril Wecht]], Dr. Omalu publishes his findings in [[Neurosurgery_(journal)|''Neurosurgery'']], which are dismissed by the [[National Football League|NFL]].\n\nOver several years, Dr. Omalu discovers that three additional deceased NFL players, [[Justin Strzelczyk]] (2004), [[Terry Long (American football)|Terry Long]] (2005), and [[Andre Waters]] (2006), exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. He persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee. However, the NFL does not take him seriously, and he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing the former NFL employee Bailes to give the presentation in place of Dr. Omalu. However, the meeting is a set up, where the NFL claims that the players' head trauma is unrelated to football, but rather, due to past injuries. As he leaves the meeting, former [[National Football League Players Association|NFL Players Association]] executive [[Dave Duerson]] angrily confronts Dr. Omalu and tells him to \"go back to [[Africa]].\"\n\nDr. Omalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in [[Pittsburgh]], having provided jobs and allowed men to go to college. Wecht is subjected to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Dr. Omalu is forced to leave Pittsburgh soon after, lest he be [[deportation|deported]], or sent to prison on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. Before leaving, he urges the NFL to tell the truth. Dr. Omalu's wife, Prema, suffers a [[miscarriage]] after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to [[Lodi, California]] where he takes a job with the [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] coroner's office.\n\nThree years later, Dr. Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits [[suicide]] due to an increasing inability to cope with worsening [[cognitive skill|cognitive function]]. In his [[suicide note]], Duerson acknowledges that Dr. Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. Dr. Omalu is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He informs them that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks that they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace. Amid growing scrutiny from [[United States Congress|Congress]], the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, [[2011 NFL lockout|NFL players sue the league]] for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of [[Medical examiner|Chief Medical Examiner]] for the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], but the closing credits show Omalu turning the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming [[Naturalization|naturalized]] as a [[Citizenship of the United States|U.S. citizen]] in February 2015. A final montage includes reports of [[Junior Seau]]'s suicide in 2012 and subsequent [[Concussions in American football#Federal NFL concussion litigation|lawsuits]] brought against the NFL by thousands of former players.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as Dr. [[Bennet Omalu]]\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Dr. Julian Bailes\n* [[Albert Brooks]] as Dr. [[Cyril Wecht]]\n* [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]] as Prema Mutiso\n* [[David Morse]] as [[Mike Webster]]\n** [[Ben McDonnell]] as young [[Mike Webster]]\n* [[Arliss Howard]] as Dr. [[Joseph Maroon]]\n* [[Mike O'Malley]] as Daniel Sullivan\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Dr. [[Steven T.

In New York City she manufactures a meeting with Clyde at a cafeteria and introduces herself as Alice, a biologist who specializes in studying frogs and who has recently returned from an extended project in Tasmania.  \n\nClyde's friend and coworker Tom is preparing for a birthday party with his wife Ramina, an aspiring jewelry designer.  Since Alice says she is looking to meet new friends, he takes her to the party.  There she charms Ramina and the other guests with tales of her life and work in Tasmania.  When Tom returns from the party he seems to recognize her and calls her \"Jenny\".  Ramina announces that she has been accepted into a prestigious jewelry design fellowship in California, something Tom was not yet aware of.  Over dinner, Alice tells of how she had impulsively decided to live in Mexico for a year, without informing her family.  The admission causes some of the dinner guests to question her life choices.  Later, Tom confronts Alice, who admits to being Jenny, an old college girlfriend who disappeared.  She explains that she has spent the last fifteen years living under a string of assumed identities, abandoning them and moving one whenever she begins to feel trapped.  She has come to New York to see Tom, someone who knows her from her old life.  \n\nThe groups heads to a nightclub.  Alice does a magic trick for Tom and explains that she learned it while working as a magicians assistant in China.  The admission causes Clyde and the others to question her story and whether she lied about her background.  Alice leaves the club and Tom follows her.  They run into a woman named Nina who is walking her dog.  When Nina sprains her ankle they help her back to her nearby apartment, with Alice claiming to be a pediatric surgeon.  At the apartment which Nina shares with her husband Roger, Alice introduces Tom as Tony, an osteopath.  At Roger's urging, Tom examines Nina.  He begins to understand the thrill which Alice feels from pretending, but becomes uncomfortable and leaves.  \n\nTom asks Alice if everything she says is a lie and she assures him that she really does work with animals.  She takes him to Long Island to meet her coworker and see frogs hatching.  Afterwards, Tom insists on accompanying her to her apartment as she prepares to leave and assume a new identity.  Alice invites Tom to come with her, but he refuses.  He returns to his apartment to discuss California with his wife.  \n\nIn a public restroom, Alice dumps her credit cards, but keeps her drivers license, which she puts in a scrapbook containing all her old identities.  She walks off into the crowd but then reappears in frame, wearing different clothes and a new identity.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Rachel Weisz]] as Alice Manning\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Tom\n* [[Kathy Bates]] as Nina\n* [[Danny Glover]] as Roger\n* [[Condola Rashad]] as Sharon\n* [[Chris Lowell]] as Brad\n* [[Tessa Albertson]] as Tilda\n* [[Kelly AuCoin]] as Dave\n* [[Azita Ghanizada]] as Ramina\n* [[Michael Chernus]] as Clyde\n* [[Zach Appelman]] as Malcom\n* Frank De Julio as Mark\n* [[Omar Metwally]] as Farshad\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn November 2014, it was revealed that [[Michael Shannon]] and [[Rachel Weisz]] had been cast in the film, with [[Joshua Marston]] directing from a screenplay he wrote with Julian Sheppard, with Lars Knudsen and Jay Van Hoy producing under their Parts & Labor banner, also marking Marston's first English-language-film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ioncinema.com/news/casting-news/alice-in-changes-rachel-weisz-michael-shannon-takes-seats-at-joshua-marstons-table-drama|title=Alice in Changes; Rachel Weisz & Michael Shannon Takes Seats at Joshua Marston\u2019s Table Drama|website=Ioncinema.com|first=Eric|last=Lavalee|date=November 5, 2014|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> In February 2015, it was revealed that [[Kathy Bates]] and [[Danny Glover]] had joined the cast of the film, with Lucas Joaquin joining as a producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/kathy-bates-danny-glover-join-rachel-weisz-michael-shannon-in-joshua-marston-project-1201440112/\\|title=Kathy Bates, Danny Glover Join Rachel Weisz, Michael Shannon in Joshua Marston Project|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> Danny Besi and Saunder Jurianns composed the film's score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2015/12/02/danny-bensi-saunder-jurriaans-to-score-joshua-marstons-complete-unknown/|title=Danny Bensi & Saunder Jurriaans to score Joshua Marston's 'Complete Unknown'|website=Film Music Reporter|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 25, 2016.<ref name=\"SUNDANCE\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundance.org/blogs/news/premieres-spotlight-sundance-kids-and-special-events-announced-for-2016-festival|title=SUNDANCE INSTITUTE COMPLETES FEATURE FILM LINEUP FOR 2016 SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL|publisher=sundance.org|date=December 7, 2015|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> [[Amazon Studios]] acquired U.S distribution rights to the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/rachel-weisz-michael-shannon-complete-unknown-amazon-1201683126/|title=Sundance: Rachel Weisz\u2019s \u2018Complete Unknown\u2019 Bought by Amazon|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=January 19, 2016|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> It was later revealed [[IFC Films]] would co-distribute the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/amazon-studios-cinemacon-woody-allen-cafe-society-1201737586/|title=Amazon\u2019s Bob Berney At CinemaCon: \"All Films We Are Acquiring Will Be Released Theatrically\"|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|first=Anthony D'|last=Alessandro|date=April 14, 2016|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siff.net/festival-2016/complete-unknown|title=Complete Unknown|website=[[Seattle International Film Festival]]|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref> The film was released on August 26, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/trailer/rachel-weisz-complicates-michael-shannons-perfect-life-in-trailer-for-complete-unknown/|title=Rachel Weisz Complicates Michael Shannon\u2019s Perfect Life in Trailer For \u2018Complete Unknown\u2019|website=The Film Stage|first=Mike|last=Mazzanti|date=August 10, 2016|accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n''Complete Unknown'' received mixed reviews from film critics.

Some remedies contained substances such as [[opium]], alcohol and honey, which would have given symptomatic relief but had no curative properties. Some would have [[Addiction|addictive]] qualities to entice the buyer to return. The few effective remedies sold by quacks included emetics, laxatives and diuretics.

This was mirrored by similar growth in marketing of quack medicines elsewhere in the world.\n\n[[File:Clark Stanley's Snake Oil Liniment.png|thumb|right|Clark Stanley's Snake Oil]]\nIn the United States, false medicines in this era were often denoted by the slang term [[snake oil]], a reference to sales pitches for the false medicines that claimed exotic ingredients provided the supposed benefits. Those who sold them were called \"snake oil salesmen,\" and usually sold their medicines with a fervent pitch similar to a [[fire and brimstone]] religious sermon. They often accompanied [[Medicine show|other theatrical and entertainment productions that traveled as a road show from town to town]], leaving quickly before the falseness of their medicine was discovered. Not all quacks were restricted to such small-time businesses however, and a number, especially in the United States, became enormously wealthy through national and international sales of their products.\n\nIn 1875, the ''[[Pacific Medical and Surgical Journal]]'' complained: {{quotation|If Satan has ever succeeded in compressing a greater amount of concentrated mendacity into one set of human bodies above every other description, it is in the advertising quacks.

Turlingtons Balsam of Life, first marketed in the mid-18th century, did have genuinely beneficial properties. This medicine continued to be sold under the original name into the early 20th century, and can still be found in the British and American [[pharmacopoeia]]s as \"Compound [[tincture of benzoin]]\". In these cases, the treatments likely lacked empirical support when they were introduced to the market, and their benefits were simply a convenient coincidence discovered after the fact.\n\nThe end of the road for the quack medicines now considered grossly fraudulent in the nations of North America and Europe came in the early 20th century. 21 February 1906 saw the passage into law of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in the United States. This was the result of decades of campaigning by both government departments and the medical establishment, supported by a number of publishers and journalists (one of the most effective was [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], who wrote \"The Great American Fraud\" series in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1905).<ref name=\"Adams1912\">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Samuel Hopkins|year=1912|orig-year=1905|title=The great American fraud: articles on the nostrum evil and quackery reprinted from ''Collier's''|edition=5th|location=Chicago|publisher=American Medical Association|oclc=894099555|url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericanfra00adamuoft/}}</ref> This American Act was followed three years later by similar legislation in Britain and in other European nations. Between them, these laws began to remove the more outrageously dangerous contents from patent and proprietary medicines, and to force quack medicine proprietors to stop making some of their more blatantly dishonest claims. The Act, however, left advertising and claims of effectiveness unregulated as the Supreme Court interpreted it to mean only that ingredients on labels had to be accurate. Language in the 1912 Sherley Amendment, meant to close this loophole, was limited to regulating claims that were false and fraudulent, creating the need to show intent. Throughout the early 20th century, the [[American Medical Association]] collected material on medical quackery, and one of their members and medical editors in particular, Arthur J.

Americans waste $27 billion annually on questionable health care, exceeding the amount spent on biomedical research. Quackery is characterized by the promotion of false and unproven health schemes for profit and does not necessarily involve imposture, fraud, or greed. The real issues in the war against quackery are the principles, including scientific rationale, encoded into consumer protection laws, primarily the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. More such laws are badly needed. Regulators are failing the public by enforcing laws inadequately, applying double standards, and accrediting pseudomedicine. Non-scientific health care (e.g., acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy) is licensed by individual states. Practitioners use unscientific practices and deception on a public who, lacking complex health-care knowledge, must rely upon the trustworthiness of providers.

Zhang, who has escaped legal liability as he portrayed himself as a nutritionist, not a doctor, appeared on television in China and authored a best-selling book, ''Eat Away the Diseases You Get from Eating''. Zhang, who charged the equivalent of $450 for a 10-minute examination, had a two-year waiting list when he was exposed. Investigations launched after a run on mung beans revealed that contrary to his representations, he did not come from a family of accomplished traditional practitioners (\u4e2d\u533b\u4e16\u5bb6) and never had the medical degree from [[Beijing Medical University]] he claimed to have. His only education was a brief correspondence or night school course, completed after he was laid off from a textile factory. Zhang, despite negative publicity on the national level, continues to practice but has committed himself to finding a cheaper cure-all than mung beans. His clinic, Wuben Hall, adjacent to [[Beijing National Stadium]], was torn down as an illegal structure. Much of Zhang Wuben's success was due to the efforts of Chinese entrepreneurs, including one government-owned company, who promoted him.<ref name=\"Jacobs2010\">{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Andrew|last2=Bibo|first2=Li|last3=Jing|first3=Zhang|display-authors=1|date=7 October 2010|orig-year=2010-10-06|title=Rampant fraud threat to China's brisk ascent|website=www.nytimes.com|location=New York|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/world/asia/07fraud.html|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Mu|first=Eric|date=18 June 2010|title=Zhang Wuben and the traditional Chinese medicine racket|website=danwei.org|url=http://www.danwei.org/health_care_diseases_and_pharmaceuticals/from_laid-off_worker_to_tcm_ma.php|access-date=7 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621045445/http://www.danwei.org/health_care_diseases_and_pharmaceuticals/from_laid-off_worker_to_tcm_ma.php|archivedate=21 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Shengxia2010\">{{cite web|last1=Shengxia|first1=Song|last2=Qiang|first2=Guo|last3=Jie|first3=Yang|display-authors=1|date=31 May 2010|title=Popular diet guru exposed as fraud|website=china.globaltimes.cn|publisher=[[Global Times]]|url=http://china.globaltimes.cn/society/2010-05/536844.html|access-date=7 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604062537/http://china.globaltimes.cn/society/2010-05/536844.html|archivedate=4 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Hu Wanlin]], who did hold himself out as a doctor, was exposed in 2000 and sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Mainstream medicine has produced many remarkable advances, so people may tend to also believe groundless claims.\n* [[Placebo effect]]\n: Medicines or treatments known to have no pharmacological effect on a disease can still affect a person's perception of their illness, and this belief in its turn does indeed sometimes have a therapeutic effect, causing the patient's condition to improve. This is ''not'' to say that no real cure of biological illness is effected \u2013 \"though we might describe a placebo effect as being 'all in the mind', we now know that there is a genuine neurobiological basis to this phenomenon.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Benedetti|first=Fabrizio | title=Placebo effects: understanding the mechanisms in health and disease | publisher = Oxford University Press 2009 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-19-955912-1 | at = back cover |year=2009 }}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=November 2015|reason=The term quack does not appear in a Google books search within the book (books.google.com/books?id=co8oAQAAMAAJ)}} People report reduced pain, increased well-being, improvement, or even total alleviation of symptoms.

It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and a systematic error of [[inductive reasoning]].\n* Distrust of conventional medicine\n: Many people, for various reasons, have a [[distrust]] of conventional medicine, or of the regulating organizations such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], or the major drug corporations. For example, \"[[Complementary and Alternative Medicine|CAM]] may represent a response to disenfranchisement [discrimination] in conventional medical settings and resulting distrust\".<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Shippee, Tetyana|author2=Henning-Smith, Carrie|author3=Shippee, Nathan|author4=Kemmick Pintor, Jessie|author5=Call, Kathleen T.|author6=McAlpine, Donna|author7=Johnson, Pamela Jo|year=2013|title=Discrimination in Medical Settings and Attitudes toward Complementary and Alternative Medicine: The Role of Distrust in Conventional Providers|journal=Journal of Health Disparities Research and Practice|volume=6|issue=1|page=3|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/jhdrp/vol6/iss1/3}}</ref>\n* [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]]\n: Anti-quackery activists (\"quackbusters\") are often falsely accused of being part of a huge \"conspiracy\" to suppress \"unconventional\" and/or \"natural\" therapies, as well as those who promote them. It is alleged that this conspiracy is backed and funded by the pharmaceutical industry and the established medical care system \u2013 represented by the [[American Medical Association|AMA]], [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[American Dental Association|ADA]], [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], etc. \u2013 for the purpose of preserving their power and increasing their profits. This idea is often held by people with [[Antiscience]] views.\n* Fear of [[Adverse effect|side effects]]\n: A great variety of [[pharmaceutical medications]] can have very distressing side effects, and many people fear [[surgery]] and its consequences, so they may opt to shy away from these mainstream treatments.\n* Cost\n: There are some people who simply cannot afford conventional treatment, and seek out a cheaper alternative. Nonconventional practitioners can often dispense treatment at a much lower cost. This is compounded by [[Health equity#Disparities in access to health care|reduced access to healthcare]].\n* Desperation\n: People with a serious or terminal disease, or who have been told by their practitioner that their condition is \"untreatable,\" may react by seeking out treatment, disregarding the lack of scientific proof for its effectiveness, or even the existence of evidence that the method is ineffective or even dangerous. Despair may be exacerbated by the lack of [[palliative care|palliative non-curative]] [[end-of-life care]].

Turlingtons Balsam of Life, first marketed in the mid-18th century, did have genuinely beneficial properties. This medicine continued to be sold under the original name into the early 20th century, and can still be found in the British and American [[pharmacopoeia]]s as \"Compound [[tincture of benzoin]]\". In these cases, the treatments likely lacked empirical support when they were introduced to the market, and their benefits were simply a convenient coincidence discovered after the fact.\n\nThe end of the road for the quack medicines now considered grossly fraudulent in the nations of North America and Europe came in the early 20th century. February 21, 1906 saw the passage into law of the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] in the United States. This was the result of decades of campaigning by both government departments and the medical establishment, supported by a number of publishers and journalists (one of the most effective was [[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], who wrote \"The Great American Fraud\" series in ''[[Collier's]]'' in 1905).<ref name=\"Adams1912\">{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Samuel Hopkins|year=1912|orig-year=1905|title=The great American fraud: articles on the nostrum evil and quackery reprinted from ''Collier's''|edition=5th|location=Chicago|publisher=American Medical Association|oclc=894099555|url=https://archive.org/details/greatamericanfra00adamuoft/}}</ref> This American Act was followed three years later by similar legislation in Britain and in other European nations. Between them, these laws began to remove the more outrageously dangerous contents from patent and proprietary medicines, and to force quack medicine proprietors to stop making some of their more blatantly dishonest claims. The Act, however, left advertising and claims of effectiveness unregulated as the Supreme Court interpreted it to mean only that ingredients on labels had to be accurate. Language in the 1912 Sherley Amendment, meant to close this loophole, was limited to regulating claims that were false and fraudulent, creating the need to show intent. Throughout the early 20th century, the [[American Medical Association]] collected material on medical quackery, and one of their members and medical editors in particular, Arthur J. Cramp, devoted his career to criticizing such products.

Americans waste $27 billion annually on questionable health care, exceeding the amount spent on biomedical research.

The real issues in the war against quackery are the principles, including scientific rationale, encoded into consumer protection laws, primarily the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. More such laws are badly needed. Regulators are failing the public by enforcing laws inadequately, applying double standards, and accrediting pseudomedicine. Non-scientific health care (e.g., acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy) is licensed by individual states. Practitioners use unscientific practices and deception on a public who, lacking complex health-care knowledge, must rely upon the trustworthiness of providers.

Zhang, who has escaped legal liability as he portrayed himself as a nutritionist, not a doctor, appeared on television in China and authored a best-selling book, ''Eat Away the Diseases You Get from Eating''. Zhang, who charged the equivalent of $450 for a 10-minute examination, had a two-year waiting list when he was exposed. Investigations launched after a run on mung beans revealed that contrary to his representations, he did not come from a family of accomplished traditional practitioners (\u4e2d\u533b\u4e16\u5bb6) and never had the medical degree from [[Beijing Medical University]] he claimed to have. His only education was a brief correspondence or night school course, completed after he was laid off from a textile factory. Zhang, despite negative publicity on the national level, continues to practice but has committed himself to finding a cheaper cure-all than mung beans. His clinic, Wuben Hall, adjacent to [[Beijing National Stadium]], was torn down as an illegal structure.

Mainstream medicine has produced many remarkable advances, so people may tend to also believe groundless claims.\n* [[Placebo effect]]\n: Medicines or treatments known to have no pharmacological effect on a disease can still affect a person's perception of their illness, and this belief in its turn does indeed sometimes have a therapeutic effect, causing the patient's condition to improve. This is ''not'' to say that no real cure of biological illness is effected \u2013 \"though we might describe a placebo effect as being 'all in the mind', we now know that there is a genuine neurobiological basis to this phenomenon.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Benedetti|first=Fabrizio | title=Placebo effects: understanding the mechanisms in health and disease | publisher = Oxford University Press 2009 | location =  | isbn = 978-0-19-955912-1 | at = back cover |year=2009 }}</ref>{{irrelevant citation|date=November 2015|reason=The term quack does not appear in a Google books search within the book (books.google.com/books?id=co8oAQAAMAAJ)}} People report reduced pain, increased well-being, improvement, or even total alleviation of symptoms.

It is a type of [[cognitive bias]] and a systematic error of [[inductive reasoning]].\n* Distrust of conventional medicine\n: Many people, for various reasons, have a [[distrust]] of conventional medicine, or of the regulating organizations such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], or the major drug corporations. For example, \"[[Complementary and Alternative Medicine|CAM]] may represent a response to disenfranchisement [discrimination] in conventional medical settings and resulting distrust\".<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Shippee, Tetyana|author2=Henning-Smith, Carrie|author3=Shippee, Nathan|author4=Kemmick Pintor, Jessie|author5=Call, Kathleen T.|author6=McAlpine, Donna|author7=Johnson, Pamela Jo|year=2013|title=Discrimination in Medical Settings and Attitudes toward Complementary and Alternative Medicine: The Role of Distrust in Conventional Providers|journal=Journal of Health Disparities Research and Practice|volume=6|issue=1|page=3|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/jhdrp/vol6/iss1/3}}</ref>\n* [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]]\n: Anti-quackery activists (\"quackbusters\") are often falsely accused of being part of a huge \"conspiracy\" to suppress \"unconventional\" and/or \"natural\" therapies, as well as those who promote them. It is alleged that this conspiracy is backed and funded by the pharmaceutical industry and the established medical care system \u2013 represented by the [[American Medical Association|AMA]], [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]], [[American Dental Association|ADA]], [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], etc. \u2013 for the purpose of preserving their power and increasing their profits. This idea is often held by people with [[Antiscience]] views.\n* Fear of [[Adverse effect|side effects]]\n: A great variety of [[pharmaceutical medications]] can have very distressing side effects, and many people fear [[surgery]] and its consequences, so they may opt to shy away from these mainstream treatments.\n* Cost\n: There are some people who simply cannot afford conventional treatment, and seek out a cheaper alternative. Nonconventional practitioners can often dispense treatment at a much lower cost. This is compounded by [[Health equity#Disparities in access to health care|reduced access to healthcare]].\n* Desperation\n: People with a serious or terminal disease, or who have been told by their practitioner that their condition is \"untreatable,\" may react by seeking out treatment, disregarding the lack of scientific proof for its effectiveness, or even the existence of evidence that the method is ineffective or even dangerous. Despair may be exacerbated by the lack of [[palliative care|palliative non-curative]] [[end-of-life care]].

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear. The code Sergei sees shocks him, and he later surreptitiously records the code using his wristwatch. When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder. He offers to bring her onboard in Sergei's place. Kenton watches their meeting. Jamie tries to convince Lily not to contact anyone through the Russian app, not knowing she already has, and offers his support. Lily decides to refuse to cooperate with Anton. Kenton follows Anton into a parking garage and tells him he will kill Lily if she starts working for Russia.

Lily shares her suspicions with co-workers that Sergei was murdered, and they advise her to tell Kenton. Jen mentions that Lily has struggled with [[schizophrenia]] in the past, which Kenton reports back to Forest. Lily seems to suffer a breakdown while in a meeting with Kenton and climbs out onto a high-up window ledge, in front of Forest and the senator. When Kenton goes out after her, Jen copies data from his computer onto a flash drive \u2014 Lily, with Jen's help, had feigned schizophrenia to get the security camera footage from the night of Sergei's death.

Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep.

Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system \u2013 a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves.

Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US.

Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die. Before he walks away, Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on.

Sergei is shown to the division's futuristic vacuum-sealed lab inside a [[Faraday cage]] by Forest, who is elusive when Sergei asks questions about his role there and simply tells him that what he should do will become clear.

When Sergei leaves that night, Forest confronts him about stealing the code and has Kenton, the head of Amaya security, kill him as he attempts to run. Sergei's girlfriend Lily, who works in Amaya's encryption division, worries that he has not come home and reports his disappearance to Kenton and Forest. They show Lily footage appearing to show Sergei walking out of the building and off the company grounds. Unconvinced, Lily downloads a backup of Sergei's phone from [[Cloud storage|the cloud]] and discovers a suspicious password-protected program disguised as [[Sudoku]], a game Sergei disliked. She contacts her ex-boyfriend Jamie to help her crack the password. Jamie, upset over Lily's total disregard of him after their breakup, refuses to help.

Lily convinces Jamie to crack the program on Sergei's phone and finds it is a [[Russian government]] messaging app that Sergei, a suspected industrial spy, was using to contact his handler. Kenton meets Forest at home and advises him to let go of the past. Forest assures him he is, but later uses an interface in the Devs lab, on which the team has achieved a projection of the Crucifixion 2000 years in the past, to view a projection of his daughter. Lily uses the app to arrange a meeting with Sergei's handler, Anton, who tells her Sergei was sent to infiltrate Devs and that he suspects Sergei's death was murder.

Kenton pressures Lily into seeing a psychiatrist, with whom she discusses her past drug use and her distant relationship with her mother, who remarried and moved to [[Hong Kong]] after Lily's father died. Lyndon develops a new algorithm based on the [[many-worlds interpretation]], rather than the [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] [[De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory]] favored by Forest, that enables clear sound to be heard on the Devs projections, but Forest rejects his work and fires him. In the car, Kenton lies to Lily that the doctor said she was psychotic and a suicide risk. When Lily realizes Kenton is driving her somewhere unknown, she grabs the wheel and crashes the car, allowing her to escape when the impact knocks Kenton unconscious. Katie applies Lyndon's algorithm to light waves, resulting in clear color images, and calls up a projection of Forest's daughter Amaya, causing him to weep.

Katie confirms that she and Forest are lovers and that Sergei was killed by Kenton, and explains the nature of the Devs system \u2013 a powerful computer that can show the actions of any subject in the past or future. However, the future projections cease at a certain point in time, beyond which there is only impenetrable static, due to a supposed breakdown of the laws of physics themselves. Katie tells Lily that this event is now only 21 hours away, and she believes Lily, who has been seen entering the Devs lab in the future, is the cause. Katie's deterministic view angers Lily, and she leaves with Jamie; Kenton, who had been watching them since they arrived, follows them. Lily decides to go back home, and invites Jamie to sleep in her bed, where they kiss.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Episode 7\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|9}}\n |ShortSummary    = Lyndon seeks to regain his position at the now-fully-operational Devs by talking to Katie. She tells him he can re-join the project if he proves his faith in the many-worlds interpretation by standing at a perilous height overlooking a [[dam]], proposing that he will only be conscious of the worlds in which he does not fall to his death. He adheres to this vision, but falls and dies in the present world. Lily and Jamie resume their relationship, and she tells him she plans on proving the Devs team is delusional by not showing up when the machine predicts she will. However, Kenton enters her apartment, shoots Jamie with a silenced pistol, and attempts to strangle Lily, but is killed by Pete, saving Lily's life. Pete reveals himself as a Russian agent who had been supervising Sergei. He presents Lily with a choice: go to the CIA, or leave for Hong Kong and never return to the US. Instead, Lily heads to Devs.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Alex Garland\n |WrittenBy       = Alex Garland\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|16}}\n |ShortSummary    = Inside the Devs labs, Forest shows Lily a projection of what she is about to do: holding Kenton's gun on Forest, she leads him into the transportation capsule leading out of Devs and shoots him, causing the capsule to crash and killing Lily in the fall. Beyond this point, Devs can see nothing. Forest tells Lily that their actions have been predetermined and that the system's real name is ''[[Deus]]''. Lily leads Forest into the capsule as projected, but as the doors close, she throws the gun away, shocking Forest. Before they can reach the entrance, Stewart overrides the [[Electromagnetic suspension|electromagnetic field]] that suspends the capsule and causes it to crash. Forest and Lily die. Before he walks away, Stewart tells a devastated Katie that the system had to be stopped. Lily regains consciousness on the day before Sergei joined Devs, and finds an empty field where the Devs building once stood and Forest playing with his wife and daughter there. He tells her that Katie reconstructed them from the moment of their deaths and that they now exist in a simulation inside the Devs machine, where the two of them are the only ones who remember what happened. In the real world, an emotional Katie reveals the Devs system to Senator Laine, and asks her to help keep it turned on. Inside Devs, Lily finds Jamie and hugs him, which he returns.\n |LineColor       = 515C47\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:15-alex-garland.w330.h330.jpg|[[Alex Garland]] is the creator, writer, and director of the miniseries.|thumb|upright]]\nOn March 13, 2018, it was announced that [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] had given the production a pilot order.

He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from Sibiu. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics.  von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in Bucharest, representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of Adolf Hitler. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first Gauleiter of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiuthe \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the Wehrmacht had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to Karl Schworm on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich\n\n==Involvement in Nazism==\nAt the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German-language Jimbolia newspaper, [[\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\"]], and president of the local ethnic community. M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara.

Roman. M\u00f6ller, Karl von: 6480BB}}</ref> was an officer, journalist, author and politician from [[Banat]]. He was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Hitler]]'s [[National Socialism]], and in 1932 he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in [[Timi\u0219oara]], an imitation of the German [[Nazi]] publication. He was married to Margaret Jung, with whom he had two children.\n\n==Life and early work==\nThe von M\u00f6ller family's origins point to the [[L\u00fcneburg Heath]]. Karl von M\u00f6ller's grandfather volunteered in the [[German Campaign of 1813|Wars of Liberation]] and was disarmed in [[Sibiu]] (Transylvania). von M\u00f6ller's grandfather is also allegedly an early developer of the [[Camera]] but didn't submit the patent in time. His father came to Vienna from Sibiu. Karl von M\u00f6ller was born in Vienna, where he attended the cadet school and the war school after high school. During the First World War, he moved as a major and chief of staff of the 34th Infantry Division, Banater Division, first to the Serbian and then to the Galician front. Von M\u00f6ller led from 1916 as a lieutenant colonel and later as colonel Hungarian Infantry Regiment No. 65 on the Eastern Front. He was awarded the [[Order of Leopold]].\n\n== Politician ==\nAfter the collapse of the Habsburg monarchy in 1918, he left the army as a colonel and went to Timi\u0219oara, where he campaigned for political and cultural equality for Romanian Germans in the field of national politics.  von M\u00f6ller was May 9, 1919, co-founded the German-Swabian Cultural Association, whose chairman Johann Junker was. The executive chairman was Michael Kausch. In 1919 M\u00f6ller was elected the second mayor of Timi\u0219oara. From 1919 to 1926 he was a senator in the Romanian upper house in Bucharest, representing Banat Swabia. Karl von M\u00f6ller joined the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" together with Josef Gabriel in 1920.\n\nFrom 1920 he made trips to Germany, gave lectures in Saxony, Westphalia, Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, Thuringia, Berlin and Munich. In 1923 he had contacts with National Socialist circles; he is considered an early supporter of Adolf Hitler. After his return, he became chief editor of the \"Banat German newspaper\". He was one of the members of the \"German People's Council\".\n\nvon M\u00f6ller is considered one of the pioneers of fascism in the Banat. In 1931 he founded the first Banat local group of the \"National Socialist Self-Help Movement of the Germans in Romania\" (NSDR) in Jimbolia (German: Hatzfeld), which was supported by the ideas of the innovators. Shortly afterwards, M\u00f6ller became the first Gauleiter of the Banat in 1932 and founded the National Socialist newspaper \u201cDer St\u00fcrmer\u201d in Timi\u0219oara in the same year. In the spring of 1933, he was deposed again as Gauleiter. In the same year, he served as \"cultural office manager\" in Sibiuthe \"job for ideological education and cultural policy\". After his application for admission to the Wehrmacht had been rejected because he had exceeded the entry age limit, he wrote to Karl Schworm on September 7, 1939: \"What would I be happy if fate put me at the front, regardless of whether in west or east! I can't think of a better way to end my fighting life than to end up for the leader and the empire. \u201d In 1941 he was appointed the\u201c cultural council \u201dof the German ethnic group in Romania.\n\n==Military career==\n\nAfter graduating from cadet school and from the Military Academy in [[Vienna]], he was appointed as a senior state officer{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and served in several garrisons. In 1913 he was transferred to [[Timi\u0219oara]] where he served in the 34th Infantry Division during the 1914 campaigns in Serbia and Galicia. He was then transferred to the headquarters in Vienna. In 1916, he was promoted from [[Oberstleutnant|Lieutenant Colonel]] to Commander of the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary. Under his command, the 65th Infantry Regiment of Hungary fought on the eastern front, and M\u00f6ller was subsequently promoted to [[Oberst|Colonel]]. At the end of the war, the regiment suppressed the uprising of the Republicans in [[Upper Hungary]] (now [[Slovakia]]) after which it was put in reserve by the K\u00e1rolyi government.<ref>[http://hatzfeld-banat.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id = 9 & Itemid = 19 Hatzfelder Pers\u00f6nlichkeiten-Schrifsteller]</ref>\n\n==Political career in Romania==\n\nPost [[World War I]], M\u00f6ller decided to stay back in Timi\u0219oara, where he joined the German Popular Movement of Banat (''Bewegung des Banater Deutschtums''), bolstering its struggle for self-affirmation. He forayed into the cultural field as a journalist{{clarify|date=September 2018}}, and later became active in politics. He held the position of editor-in-chief at ''Schw\u00e4bische Volkspresse'' (established 1921; from 1925 the ''Banat Deutsche Zeitung'') for several years, strengthening the voice of the Swabian-German community. In September 1923 Karl von M\u00f6ller actively participated in a celebration of the 200th anniversary of the migration of the Swabians organized by the Banat German Movement.\n\nIn autumn 1919 he was briefly Deputy Mayor of Timi\u0219oara, after which he was elected four times to the [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]], in which he served between 1919 and 1927 as a representative of the Swabians in Banat. In the parliamentary debate on the [[1923 Constitution of Romania]] on March 12, 1923, he said he was speaking on behalf of the \"Banat Swabian People\", declaring the Germans' loyalty to their new homeland, but demanded that the new constitution should not jeopardize the existence of minorities from a national point of view; he said the new constitution did not include the promises made to the minorities by the Romanians in [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Alba Iulia]].<ref>[http://www.uefromania.ro / evolution-German-from-banat-in-context-administrative-demographic-political-and-legislative-in-the-interwar period / Evolution of German education in Banat in administrative context , demographic, political and legislative in the interwar period]</ref>\n\nIn May 1920 the \"moderate\" Swabians, led by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Muth Kaspar Muth], formed the Swabian Party of Autonomy, joined by Karl von M\u00f6ller, [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Gabriel_(Politiker,_1880) Dr Joseph Gabriel], and Peter Schiff of the National Swabian-German party.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.muzeulbanatului.ro/istorie/publicatii/analele_banatului_2008/3_6_narai.pdf | title=Muzeulbanatului.ro }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1927, M\u00f6ller withdrew from public life and settled in [[Jimbolia]], where he married Margaret Jung, the daughter of a wealthy farmer from the Banat. Together they had two children, Karlheinz and Erich\n\n==Involvement in Nazism==\nAt the beginning of 1931, he returned to public life, becoming the chief editor of the German-language Jimbolia newspaper, [[\"Hatzfelder Zeitung\"]], and president of the local ethnic community. M\u00f6ller, who adhered to Nazi ideology, tried to use these positions to popularise Nazism and prepare the Banat population for its adoption. This attempt was thwarted, and he lost both positions by the end of 1931.\n\nAfter 1930, and especially after 1933, the Nazi movement had achieved a strong position in Romania, capturing the leadership of the Germans in Romania. The initiator of the Nazi movement among the German minority was the reserve captain [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Fabritius Fritz Fabritius]. From 1931, Fabritius tried to expand the movement in Banat, finding audiences in some circles of dissatisfied and young Swabians who returned from studies in Germany. At the end of 1931, Karl von M\u00f6ller constituted a movement group at Jimbolia and was proclaimed the \"Gauleiter\" for the Banat.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">= Aspects</ref>\n\nAfter Karl von M\u00f6ller became the first [[Gauleiter]] of the Banat, from July 1, 1932, he published the antisemitic newspaper \"Der St\u00fcrmer\" in Timi\u0219oara. It was an imitation of the publication [[Der St\u00fcrmer]] published in Germany by the German Nazi [[Julius Streicher]] who, after World War II, was sentenced to death in the first of the [[Nuremberg trials]], found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] and executed by [[hanging]] in 1946.<ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, Divers, 2003 [http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927034205/http://www.divers.ro/germanii_din_romania_intre_nazism_si_stalinism_de_william_totok_ro |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref><ref>William Totok: The Germans in Romania Between Nazism and Stalinism, in: Cultural Observatory, Nr. 197 \u2013 December 2, 2003, [http://www.observatorcultural.com/Germanii-din-Romania-intre-nazism-si-stalinism*articleID_9752-articles_details.html] and Errata.
