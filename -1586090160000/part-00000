{"title_page": "Greek life at San Diego State University", "text_new": "{{Main|San Diego State University}}\n'''Greek life at [[San Diego State University]]''' '''(SDSU)''' has an extensive history dating back nearly a century and has played an influential role in the university's development over time. Today it encompasses nearly 50 active chapters of social and culturally-based [[fraternities and sororities]] recognized by the university, each represented through one of four governing councils. Honors, service and professional Greek-letter societies also exist and are recognized student organizations at SDSU, though they operate independently of the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/sll/greeklife.aspx|title=Greek Life Homepage {{!}} SDSU|website=go.sdsu.edu|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref>\n\nAs of Spring 2019, members of social fraternities and sororities maintain a slightly higher average grade point average than the overall undergraduate average at SDSU.\n\n== History ==\nThe first fraternity on campus was the local Epsilon Eta fraternity, which formed on October 25, 1921. The group maintained strict rules for its members and limited the chapter to 20 male students.<ref name=\"Mallios121\">Starr, p. 121</ref> The first local sorority, known as Shen Yo, was also established in 1921.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.sdsu.edu/media.php?i=22818&t=5&p=10&dg=85a37dc339fa8bc02088e0b5d46738f11e684157&WINID=1542919953550|title=The Daily Aztec, March 13, 1987|website=SDSU Library & Information Access}}</ref> By the end of the decade there were six other fraternities and eight sororities. The fraternities and sororities were all local and did not attain national affiliations until after World War II with the exception of one ([[Alpha Sigma Alpha]] sorority, chartered in 1932).<ref name=\"Starr59\">Starr, p. 59</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.alphasigmaalpha.org/chapters/omega-omega/|title=Omega Omega {{!}} Alpha Sigma Alpha|work=Alpha Sigma Alpha|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://digital.sdsu.edu/media.php?i=157347&t=5&p=10&dg=ccf6d543dcfc5ea136ade0bc96b9675d9f3a012b&WINID=1542258784167|title=The State College Aztec|last=|first=|date=April 29, 1931|work=The State College Aztec|access-date=}}</ref> On October 10, 1924, the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) was founded.&nbsp;The organization consisted of the nine sororities then on campus plus the two fraternities.&nbsp;The organization's purpose was stated as \"boosting a high scholarship standard among the members of the fraternal organizations, and of cooperating with the faculty in all matters which lead to the success of the College.\"&nbsp;The IFC published the grade point averages of fraternities and sororities at the end of each semester, which stimulated a competition for scholastic standing which continues today. On a 3.0 scale, the average GPA (grade point average) for all students at the time was 1.49. For fraternity members it was 1.35 and for sorority members it was 1.47.<ref name=\"Starr59\" /> After a couple of years of the co-educational governing organization, the sororities split from the IFC to create their own organization, the Inter-Sorority Council (later became the College Panhellenic Association [CPA]). By the mid-1930s there were eight fraternities and eleven sororities on campus, and later the Greek community expanded to fifteen fraternities and twelve sororities in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Starr127\">Starr, p. 127</ref>\n\nThe post World War II period saw a frenzy to \"go national\" among the fraternities and sororities. Between 1947 and 1951, five national fraternities colonized new chapters at SDSU and an additional nine formed chapters through absorbing existing local fraternities on campus. [[Theta Chi]] became the first fraternity on campus affiliated with a national organization in 1947. [[Alpha Xi Delta]] kickstarted a similar trend for sororities upon chartering in 1949, with nine other national sororities following suit in quickly absorbing the remaining nine local sororities. In 1951, [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity chartered on campus, becoming San Diego State's first African-American Greek organization.\n\nThe arrival of national fraternities also began the trend of Greek organizations starting to acquire property in the College Area for chapter houses. [[Delta Sigma Phi]] became the first fraternity to own a chapter house, with [[Kappa Delta]] becoming the first sorority to acquire a house shortly thereafter in 1952. The 1950s was a period of steady increase of membership in the Greek community, coinciding with the gradual increase in undergraduate enrollment at the university.\n\nThe emergence of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture phenomenon]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw interest in fraternities and sororities decline and the Greek community population dwindled to below 700, with several organizations closing. On April 6, 1978, the [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sorority hired a plane to drop [[marshmallow]]s on fraternity houses during Derby Week, a philanthropy event among the Greek community hosted by the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. The plane crashed near [[Peterson Gym]] on the west side of campus, injuring four students aboard.<ref name=\"Starr215\">Starr, p. 215</ref> In 1983, after a ''[[USA Today]]'' article reported that SDSU Greeks' GPAs were below the campus average, SDSU tightened restrictions and supervision, and by 1989 their grades had increased to slightly above the university average.<ref name=\"Starr215\" /> The Greek system gradually began to grow again in the late seventies following the close of the [[Vietnam War]] before spiking in the 1980s, reaching a peak of upwards of 2,900 members in 1988. At this point there were 20 fraternities and 13 sororities officially affiliated with the Interfraternity Council and College Panhellenic Association, respectively, as well as six additional independent fraternities and sororities. This made it one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the western U.S.<ref name=\"Starr214\">Starr, p. 214</ref>\n\nThe 1990s ultimately proved to be a less prosperous time for social fraternities and sororities at the university than the previous decade. A fiscal crisis in California early in the decade severely impacted the [[California State University]] system and SDSU was deeply impacted by budget cuts. A significant decline in enrollment at the University resulted and several organizations shut down due to operational and conduct issues. Despite the turmoil, the Greek community still experienced substantial growth during the 1990s, though this time it centered primarily around the establishment of numerous culturally-based fraternities and sororities. This led to the establishment of SDSU's fourth Greek governing council, the United Sorority and Fraternity Council (USFC), on September 24, 1997.\n\nThe early 2000s ushered in a new era for the Greek community with the [[SDSU Research Foundation|SDSU Foundation]]'s landmark development of Fraternity Row in 2002, where eight fraternities moved into newly-constructed chapter houses in a 1.4 acre complex adjacent to the also newly-constructed [[Viejas Arena]] (then Cox Arena). The complex consists of eight free-standing two story chapter houses, each with a private courtyard, and a total of 61 two and three bedroom apartment units (each overlooking one of the courtyards), in a contiguous four story structure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pierceeducationproperties.com/development-properties/#FratRow|title=Real Estate Development Projects|website=Pierce Education Properties, L.P.|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}</ref> The Foundation had planned to also construct \"Sorority Row\", a similar project designed with five free-standing chapter houses, following the completion of the Piedra Del Sol apartment complex and Fraternity Row. The project was abandoned in 2006 however, after the Foundation declared the project financially infeasible, citing escalating construction-material costs and a lack of commitment from sororities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thedailyaztec.com/18866/daily-aztec-stories/sorority-row-plans-stay-stagnant/|title=Sorority Row plans stay stagnant|last=Staff|work=The Daily Aztec|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2008, the university community was shaken by the results of an investigation into illegal drug use in the College Area. Dozens of individuals were arrested in a large scale drug bust (known as [[Operation Sudden Fall]]), including several students, some of which were members of fraternities.<ref name=\"SusFrat2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080507-9999-1n7drugs.html|title=Major SDSU drug probe nets 96 arrests in raids|last=McDonald|first=Jeff|date=May 7, 2008|newspaper=[[U-T San Diego|San Diego Union Tribune]]|accessdate=June 27, 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QezzsymA?url=http://legacy.utsandiego.com/news/metro/20080507-9999-1n7drugs.html|archivedate=June 28, 2014|url-status=dead|author2=Sherry Saavedra|author3=Tanya Sierra}}</ref> Between the Spring of 2008 and the Spring of 2010, the Interfraternity Council saw its membership drop from sixteen chapters down to just nine, with seven chapters all closing during this period over a variety of misconduct issues. Since this time, the Greek community has experienced steady growth, coinciding with growth of the university, a renewed interest in Greek life, and increased investment and involvement by alumni and administrators in educational programs for Greek members and organizations.\n\nToday there are a total of nearly 50 fraternities and sororities, including both general and culturally-based organizations represented through the four governing councils.\n\n== Chapters ==\nFour governing councils represent the social fraternities and sororities of San Diego State University.\n\n=== College Panhellenic Association (CPA) ===\nThe College Panhellenic Association (CPA) is the governing body of all [[National Panhellenic Conference]] (NPC) general social sororities on campus.

Today it encompasses nearly 50 active chapters of social and culturally-based [[fraternities and sororities]] recognized by the university, each represented through one of four governing councils. Honors, service and professional Greek-letter societies also exist and are recognized student organizations at SDSU, though they operate independently of the Office of Fraternity & Sorority Life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://go.sdsu.edu/student_affairs/sll/greeklife.aspx|title=Greek Life Homepage {{!}} SDSU|website=go.sdsu.edu|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref>\n\nAs of Spring 2019, members of social fraternities and sororities maintain a slightly higher average grade point average than the overall undergraduate average at SDSU.\n\n== History ==\nThe first fraternity on campus was the local Epsilon Eta fraternity, which formed on October 25, 1921. The group maintained strict rules for its members and limited the chapter to 20 male students.<ref name=\"Mallios121\">Starr, p. 121</ref> The first local sorority, known as Shen Yo, was also established in 1921.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.sdsu.edu/media.php?i=22818&t=5&p=10&dg=85a37dc339fa8bc02088e0b5d46738f11e684157&WINID=1542919953550|title=The Daily Aztec, March 13, 1987|website=SDSU Library & Information Access}}</ref> By the end of the decade there were six other fraternities and eight sororities. The fraternities and sororities were all local and did not attain national affiliations until after World War II with the exception of one ([[Alpha Sigma Alpha]] sorority, chartered in 1932).<ref name=\"Starr59\">Starr, p. 59</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.alphasigmaalpha.org/chapters/omega-omega/|title=Omega Omega {{!}} Alpha Sigma Alpha|work=Alpha Sigma Alpha|access-date=2018-11-15|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://digital.sdsu.edu/media.php?i=157347&t=5&p=10&dg=ccf6d543dcfc5ea136ade0bc96b9675d9f3a012b&WINID=1542258784167|title=The State College Aztec|last=|first=|date=April 29, 1931|work=The State College Aztec|access-date=}}</ref> On October 10, 1924, the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) was founded.&nbsp;The organization consisted of the nine sororities then on campus plus the two fraternities.&nbsp;The organization's purpose was stated as \"boosting a high scholarship standard among the members of the fraternal organizations, and of cooperating with the faculty in all matters which lead to the success of the College.\"&nbsp;The IFC published the grade point averages of fraternities and sororities at the end of each semester, which stimulated a competition for scholastic standing which continues today. On a 3.0 scale, the average GPA (grade point average) for all students at the time was 1.49. For fraternity members it was 1.35 and for sorority members it was 1.47.<ref name=\"Starr59\" /> After a couple of years of the co-educational governing organization, the sororities split from the IFC to create their own organization, the Inter-Sorority Council (later became the College Panhellenic Association [CPA]). By the mid-1930s there were eight fraternities and eleven sororities on campus, and later the Greek community expanded to fifteen fraternities and twelve sororities in the 1940s.<ref name=\"Starr127\">Starr, p. 127</ref> \n\nThe post World War II period saw a frenzy to \"go national\" among the fraternities and sororities. Between 1947 and 1951, five national fraternities colonized new chapters at SDSU and an additional nine formed chapters through absorbing existing local fraternities on campus. [[Theta Chi]] became the first fraternity on campus affiliated with a national organization in 1947. [[Alpha Xi Delta]] kickstarted a similar trend for sororities upon chartering in 1949, with nine other national sororities following suit in quickly absorbing the remaining nine local sororities. In 1951, [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity chartered on campus, becoming San Diego State's first African-American Greek organization. \n\nThe arrival of national fraternities also began the trend of Greek organizations starting to acquire property in the College Area for chapter houses. [[Delta Sigma Phi]] became the first fraternity to own a chapter house, with [[Kappa Delta]] becoming the first sorority to acquire a house shortly thereafter in 1952. The 1950s was a period of steady increase of membership in the Greek community, coinciding with the gradual increase in undergraduate enrollment at the university.\n\nThe emergence of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|the counterculture phenomenon]] of the late 1960s and early 1970s saw interest in fraternities and sororities decline and the Greek community population dwindled to below 700, with several organizations closing. On April 6, 1978, the [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sorority hired a plane to drop [[Marshmallow|marshmallows]] on fraternity houses during Derby Week, a philanthropy event among the Greek community hosted by the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. The plane crashed near [[Peterson Gym]] on the west side of campus, injuring four students aboard.<ref name=\"Starr215\">Starr, p. 215</ref> In 1983, after a ''[[USA Today]]'' article reported that SDSU Greeks' GPAs were below the campus average, SDSU tightened restrictions and supervision, and by 1989 their grades had increased to slightly above the university average.<ref name=\"Starr215\" /> The Greek system gradually began to grow again in the late seventies following the close of the [[Vietnam War]] before spiking in the 1980s, reaching a peak of upwards of 2,900 members in 1988. At this point there were 20 fraternities and 13 sororities officially affiliated with the Interfraternity Council and College Panhellenic Association, respectively, as well as six additional independent fraternities and sororities. This made it one of the largest fraternity and sorority systems in the western U.S.<ref name=\"Starr214\">Starr, p. 214</ref> \n\nThe 1990s ultimately proved to be a less prosperous time for social fraternities and sororities at the university than the previous decade. A fiscal crisis in California early in the decade severely impacted the [[California State University]] system and SDSU was deeply impacted by budget cuts. A significant decline in enrollment at the University resulted and several organizations shut down due to operational and conduct issues. Despite the turmoil, the Greek community still experienced substantial growth during the 1990s, though this time it centered primarily around the establishment of numerous culturally-based fraternities and sororities. This led to the establishment of SDSU's fourth Greek governing council, the United Sorority and Fraternity Council (USFC), on September 24, 1997.\n\nThe early 2000s ushered in a new era for the Greek community with the [[SDSU Research Foundation|SDSU Foundation]]'s landmark development of Fraternity Row in 2002, where eight fraternities moved into newly-constructed chapter houses in a 1.4 acre complex adjacent to the also newly-constructed [[Viejas Arena]] (then Cox Arena).

As of {{currentyear}}, Thatcher is the last [[commoner]] awarded a [[hereditary title]]; he was granted the [[Thatcher baronets|Thatcher baronetcy]] in 1990.\n\nHe was married to [[Margaret Thatcher]], who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1979 to 1990. He was the first male spouse of a British prime minister.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|small=y|date=January 2013}}\nThatcher was born in [[Lewisham]], south London, as the first-born child of a [[New Zealand]]-born British businessman, Thomas Herbert \"Jack\" Thatcher (15 October 1885 \u2013 24 June 1943). At age eight he entered a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] as a [[wikt:boarder|boarder]] in [[Bognor Regis]], following which he attended the [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] public school, [[Mill Hill School]] in north London. At school he excelled at [[cricket]], being a left-handed [[batsman]].\n\nThatcher left Mill Hill at age 18 to join the family paint and [[preservative]]s business, Atlas Preservatives. He also studied [[accountancy]] to improve his grasp of business, and in 1935 was appointed works manager. He joined the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] shortly after the [[Munich crisis]], as he was convinced [[WWII|war]] was imminent; a view reinforced by a visit he made to Germany with his father's business in 1938.\n\n== War record ==\n\n[[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|During the Second World War]], Thatcher was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] into the 34th Searchlight ([[Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment]]) of the [[Royal Engineers]].

Although a number of skyscrapers\u2014most visibly the headquarters of [[AT&T Midtown Center|AT&T]], [[Coca-Cola headquarters|The Coca-Cola Company]], and [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America]]\u2014are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and has a great deal of greenery. This gives it a distinctly [[suburb]]an atmosphere quite different from other Atlanta campuses such as that of [[Georgia State University]].<ref name=\"map\">{{cite web |url=http://gtalumni.org/map/|title=Campus Map|publisher=[[Georgia Tech Alumni Association]]|accessdate=October 18, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatech.edu/vtour/|title=Tech Virtual Tour |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology|accessdate=October 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe campus is organized into four main parts: West Campus, East Campus, Central Campus, and Technology Square.

Apartments include [[Hemphill Avenue Apartments|Crecine]], [[Center Street Apartments|Center Street]], 6th Street, Maulding, Undergraduate Living Center (ULC), and Eighth Street Apartments, while dorms include [[Freeman Hall (Georgia Tech)|Freeman]], [[Montag Hall (Georgia Tech)|Montag]], [[Fitten Hall (Georgia Tech)|Fitten]], [[Folk Hall (Georgia Tech)|Folk]], [[Caldwell Hall (Georgia Tech)|Caldwell]], Armstrong, Hefner, [[Fulmer Hall (Georgia Tech)|Fulmer]], and Woodruff Suites.<ref name=\"map\"/> The [[Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center|Campus Recreation Center]] (formerly the Student Athletic Complex); a [[volleyball]] court; a large, low natural green area known as the [[Burger Bowl]]; and a flat artificial green area known as the CRC (formerly SAC) Fields are all located on the western side of the campus.

Also within walking distance of West Campus are several late-night eateries. West Campus was home to a convenience store, West Side Market, which closed following the opening of West Village in the fall of 2017. Due to limited space, all auto travel proceeds via a network of one-way streets which connects West Campus to Ferst Drive, the main road of the campus.

East Campus abuts the [[Downtown Connector]], granting residences quick access to Midtown and its businesses (for example, [[The Varsity]]) via a number of bridges over the highway. Georgia Tech football's home, [[Bobby Dodd Stadium]] is located on East Campus, as well as Georgia Tech basketball's home, [[McCamish Pavilion]] (formerly Alexander Memorial Coliseum).<ref name=\"map\"/>\n\nBrittain Dining Hall is the main dining hall for East Campus. It is modeled after a [[Gothic architecture|medieval church]], complete with carved columns and stained glass windows showing symbolic figures.<ref name=brittain/> The main road leading from East Campus to Central Campus is a steep ascending incline commonly known as \"Freshman Hill\" (in reference to the large number of freshman dorms near its foot).

Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters \"TECH\" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.\n\nOne of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a steam whistle blew five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55&nbsp;a.m. to 5:55&nbsp;p.m.[162] However, starting in the fall semester of 2017, due to a new classroom scheduling template, the whistle no longer adheres to this convention and follows a modified schedule.[163] The whistle also blows every spring during the \"When the Whistle Blows\" remembrance ceremony.[164] The faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.[63]\n\n===School colors===\nGeorgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be \"old gold, black, and crimson\". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it \"symbolized cowardice\".<ref name=\"ugacolors\">{{cite web | title = College football tradition \u2013 Official school colors | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.<ref name=\"ugacolors\"/> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.<ref name=\"rw\">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226113349/http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|archive-date=2007-12-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.\n\nIn April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.<ref>https://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/04/23/georgia-tech-athletics-unveils-comprehensive-brand-refinement</ref>\n\n===Mascots===\n{{Main|Buzz (mascot)|Ramblin' Wreck}}\n[[File:Georgia Tech mascot Buzz.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz, the mascot]] Costumed in [[plush]] to look like a [[yellow jacket]], the official [[mascot]] of Georgia Tech is '''[[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]]'''. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for [[crowd surfing]] and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.\n\nThe '''[[Rambling Wreck|Ramblin' Wreck]]''' was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]] Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \"To Hell With Georgia\" and \"Give 'Em Hell Tech\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the '''Ramblin' Reck Club''', a selective student leadership organization on campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://traditions.gatech.edu/ramblinreck.html|title=Georgia Tech Traditions: The Ramblin' Reck|work=gatech.edu|publisher=Georgia Tech|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit organizations===\n[[File:GT Football Score.jpg|thumb|right|Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown.]]\nThe Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features [[body painting]], organized [[chants]], and general [[fanaticism]].\n\nThe marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.\n\n===Fight songs and chants===\nThe band plays the fight songs ''[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]'' and ''[[Georgia Tech traditions#Up With the White and Gold|Up With the White and Gold]]'' after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \"Go Jackets\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \"bust their ass\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\" The official cheer only includes \"Fight, Win\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.\n\nIt is also tradition for the band to play the [[Here Comes the King|\"When You Say Budweiser\"]] after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the [[Here Comes the King#Popular culture|\"Budweiser Song\"]], all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]'' for half-time at the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum|Thrillerdome]], [[Ludacris]]' ''Move Bitch'' for large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, \"What's the Good Word?\" The response from all Tech faithful is, \"To Hell With Georgia.\" The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, \"How 'bout them dogs?\" And everyone yells, \"Piss on 'em.\"\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION WITHOUT POSTING ON THE TALK PAGE FIRST!

Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a [[Vocational school|trade school]] to a larger and more capable [[Institute of technology|technical institute]] and research university.\n\nToday, Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges and contains about 31&nbsp;departments/units, with emphasis on science and technology. It is well recognized for its degree programs in engineering, computing, business administration, the sciences and design. Georgia Tech is ranked tied for 5th among all public [[national universities]] in the United States, tied for 4th in the Best Undergraduate Engineering Schools ranking, tied for 29th among all collegiate institutions in the \"National Universities\" category by ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' as of the 2020 rankings, and 34th among global universities in the world by [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings|''Times Higher Education'']] as of the 2019 rankings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/georgia-institute-of-technology-1569/overall-rankings |title=Georgia Institute of Technology Overall Rankings |website=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities |title=Best Colleges 2020: National University Rankings |website=U.S. News & World Report |accessdate=September 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2019/world-ranking|title=World University Rankings|date=September 26, 2018|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|accessdate=February 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStudent athletics, both organized and intramural, are a part of student and alumni life.

Some are well-known; for example, the most notable of these is the popular but rare tradition of stealing the 'T' from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters \"TECH\" hanging atop it on each of its four sides. There have been several attempts by students to orchestrate complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion they have carried this act out successfully.\n\nOne of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a steam whistle blew five minutes before the hour, every hour from 7:55 a.m. to 5:55 p.m.[162] However, starting in the fall semester of 2017, due to a new classroom scheduling template, the whistle no longer adheres to this convention and follows a modified schedule.[163] The whistle also blows every spring during the \"When the Whistle Blows\" remembrance ceremony.[164] The faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.[63]\n\n===School colors===\nGeorgia Tech students hold a heated, long and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia, known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. The first known hostilities between the two institutions trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine proclaimed UGA's colors to be \"old gold, black, and crimson\". Dr. Charles H. Herty, then President of the University of Georgia, felt that old gold was too similar to yellow and that it \"symbolized cowardice\".<ref name=\"ugacolors\">{{cite web | title = College football tradition \u2013 Official school colors | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}</ref> After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official color.<ref name=\"ugacolors\"/> Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against Auburn in 1891.<ref name=\"rw\">{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226113349/http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|archive-date=2007-12-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.\n\nIn April 2018 Georgia Tech went through a comprehensive brand redefinement solidifying the school colors into Tech Gold and White as the primary school colors while Navy Blue serves as the contrasting secondary color. The decision to move forward with gold, white and blue is rooted in history, as the first mention of official Georgia Tech class colors came in the Atlanta Constitution in 1891 (white, blue and gold) and the first GT class ring in 1894 also featured gold, white and blue.<ref>https://www.news.gatech.edu/2018/04/23/georgia-tech-athletics-unveils-comprehensive-brand-refinement</ref>\n\n===Mascots===\n{{Main|Buzz (mascot)|Ramblin' Wreck}}\n[[File:Georgia Tech mascot Buzz.jpg|thumb|right|Buzz, the mascot]] Costumed in [[plush]] to look like a [[yellow jacket]], the official [[mascot]] of Georgia Tech is '''[[Buzz (mascot)|Buzz]]'''. Buzz enters the football games at the sound of swarming yellow jackets and proceeds to do a flip on the fifty-yard line GT logo. He then bull rushes the goal post and has been known to knock it out of alignment before football games. Buzz is also notorious for [[crowd surfing]] and general light-hearted trickery amongst Tech and rival fans.\n\nThe '''[[Rambling Wreck|Ramblin' Wreck]]''' was the first official mascot of Georgia Tech. It is a 1930 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]] Sports Coupe. The Wreck has led the football team onto the field every home game since 1961. The Wreck features a gold and white paint job, two gold flags emblazoned with the words \"To Hell With Georgia\" and \"Give 'Em Hell Tech\", and a white soft top. The Wreck is maintained by the '''Ramblin' Reck Club''', a selective student leadership organization on campus.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://traditions.gatech.edu/ramblinreck.html|title=Georgia Tech Traditions: The Ramblin' Reck|work=gatech.edu|publisher=Georgia Tech|date=|accessdate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit organizations===\n[[File:GT Football Score.jpg|thumb|right|Tech cheerleaders waving flags after a touchdown.]]\nThe Ramblin' Reck Club is charged with upholding all school traditions and creating new traditions such as the SWARM. The SWARM is a 900-member spirit group seated along the north end zone or on the court at basketball games. This is the group that typically features [[body painting]], organized [[chants]], and general [[fanaticism]].\n\nThe marching band that performs at halftime and after big plays during the football season is clad in all white and sits next to SWARM at football games providing a dichotomy of white and gold in the North End Zone. The band is also the primary student organization on campus that upholds the tradition of RAT caps, wherein band freshman wear the traditional yellow cap at all band events.\n\n===Fight songs and chants===\nThe band plays the fight songs ''[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]'' and ''[[Georgia Tech traditions#Up With the White and Gold|Up With the White and Gold]]'' after every football score and between every basketball period. At the end of a rendition of either fight song, there is a series of drum beats followed by the cheer \"Go Jackets\" three times (each time followed by a second cheer of \"bust their ass\"), then a different drum beat and the cheer \"Fight, Win, Drink, Get Naked!\" The official cheer only includes \"Fight, Win\" but most present other than the band and cheerleaders will yell the extended version.\n\nIt is also tradition for the band to play the [[Here Comes the King|\"When You Say Budweiser\"]] after the third quarter of football and during the second-to-last official timeout of every basketball game. During the [[Here Comes the King#Popular culture|\"Budweiser Song\"]], all of the fans in the stadium alternate bending their knees and standing up straight. Other notable band songs are [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]'' for half-time at the [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum|Thrillerdome]], [[Ludacris]]' ''Move Bitch'' for large gains in football. Another popular chant is called the Good Word and it begins with asking, \"What's the Good Word?\" The response from all Tech faithful is, \"To Hell With Georgia.\" The same question is asked three times and then the followup is asked, \"How 'bout them dogs?\" And everyone yells, \"Piss on 'em.\"\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION WITHOUT POSTING ON THE TALK PAGE FIRST!
