He is best known for his research on [[Broca's area]], a region of the [[frontal lobe]] that is  named after him. Broca's area is involved with language. His work revealed that the brains of patients suffering from [[aphasia]] contained [[lesions]] in a particular part of the cortex, in the left frontal region.

In 1845, he became an intern with [[Pierre Nicolas Gerdy]] (1797\u20131856), a great [[anatomist]] and surgeon. After two years with Gerdy, Broca became his assistant.<ref name=\"memoir\"/> In 1848, Broca became the [[Prosector]], performing dissections for lectures of anatomy, at the [[University of Paris]] Medical School. In 1849, he was awarded a medical doctorate. In 1853, Broca became professor [[agr\u00e9g\u00e9]], and was appointed surgeon of the hospital. He was elected to the chair of external [[pathology]] at the Faculty of Medicine in 1867, and one year later professor of clinical surgery. In 1868, he was elected a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9decine|Acad\u00e9mie de medicine]], and appointed the Chair of clinical surgery.

She came from a Protestant family and was the daughter of a prominent physician [[Jean Guillaume Auguste Lugol]]. The Brocas had three children: a daughter Jeanne Francoise Pauline (1858\u20131935), a son Benjamin Auguste (1859\u20131924), and a son \u00c9lie Andr\u00e9 (1863\u20131925).

As a result of this work. Brown-S\u00e9quard became known for demonstrating the principle of [[decussation]], where a vertebrate's neural fibers cross from one lateral side to another, resulting in phenomenon of the right side of that animals brain controlling the left side of the other.<ref name=\":2\">Schiller, 1979, pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nAs a scientist, Broca also developed theories and made hypotheses that would eventually be disproven. Based on reported findings, he published work in support of viewing syphilis as a virus.<ref name=\":2\" /> When western medicine discovered the qualities of the muscle relaxant [[curare]], used by South American Indian hunters as poison, Broca thought there was strong support for the incorrect idea that, aside from being applied topically, curare could also be diluted and ingested to counter tetanus caused muscle spasms.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Curare, Its History, Nature, and Clinical Use.|last=McIntyre|first=A.R.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1947|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBroca also spent many of his earlier years researching cancer. His wife had a known family history of carcinoma, and it is possible that this piqued his interest in exploring possible hereditary causes of cancer. In his investigations, he accumulated evidence supporting the hereditary nature of some cancers while also discovering that cancer cells can run through the blood.<ref>\"Contributions of Pierre Paul Broca to Cancer Genetics\" (1979). Transactions of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences and Affiliated Societies.</ref> Many scientists were skeptical of Broca's hereditary hypothesis, with most believing that it is merely coincidental. He stated two hypotheses for the cause of cancer, diathesis and infection. He believed that the cause may lie somewhere between the two. He then hypothesized that (1) diathesis produces the first cancer (2) cancer produces infection, and (3) infection produces secondary multiple tumors, cachexia, and death.\u201d <ref>(Broca, P. P. 1866. Traite des tumeurs. Paris, P. Asselin.)</ref>\n\n==Anthropology==\nBroca spent much time at his Anthropological Institute studying skulls and bones. It has been argued that he was attempting to use the measurements obtained by these studies as his main criteria for ranking racial groups in order of superiority. In that sense, Broca was a pioneer in the study of physical anthropology a part of which has been called 'scientific racism.' He advanced the science of cranial anthropometry by developing many new types of measuring instruments ([[Anthropometry|craniometers]]) and numerical indices.<ref name=\"memoir2\">{{cite journal|year=1881|title=Memoir of Paul Broca|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=10|pages=242\u2013261|jstor=2841526}}</ref> He published around 223 papers on general anthropology, physical anthropology, ethnology, and other branches of this field. He founded the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie de Paris]]'' in 1859, the ''Revue d'Anthropologie'' in 1872, and the School of Anthropology in Paris in 1876.\n\nBroca first became acquainted with anthropology through the works of [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Antoine \u00c9tienne Reynaud Augustin Serres]] and [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br\u00e9au]], and by the late 1850s it became his lifetime interest. Broca defined Anthropology as \"the study of the human group, considered as whole.\"<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 136</ref> Like other scientists, he rejected relying on religious texts, and looked for a scientific explanation of human origins.\n\nIn 1857, Broca was presented with a hybrid [[Leporidae|leporid]], a result of a cross species reproduction between a rabbit and hare. The crossbreeding was done for commercial rather than scientific reasons, as the resulting [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] became very popular pets. Specific circumstances had to be set up in order for differently behaving species to reproduce and for their [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] descendants to be able to reproduce between themselves. To Broca, the fact that different animals are able to intermix and create fertile offspring did not prove that they were of the same species.<ref>Shiller, 1979, pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nIn 1858, Broca's presented these findings on leporids to the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Biologie.'' He believed that the key element of his work was its implication that physical differences between human races could be explained by them being different species with different origins rather than the single moment of creation. While [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' did not come out until the following year, the topic of human origin was already widely discussed in science, but still  capable of producing a negative response from the government. Because of that worry, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Olive Rayer|Pierre Raye]]<nowiki/>r the president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, along with other members with which Broca was on good relations, asked Broca to stop further discussion of the topic. Broca agreed, but was adamant for the discussion to continue, so in 1859 he formed the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie]].<ref>Shiller, 1979, pp. 130\u2013135</ref>\n\n=== Racial groups and human species ===\nAs a proponent of [[polygenism]], Broca rejected the [[Monogenism|monogenistic]] approach that all humans have a common ancestor. Instead he viewed human racial groups as coming from different origins. Like most of the proponents on either side, he viewed each racial groups as having a place on a 'barbarism' to 'civilization' progression. He saw European colonization of other  territories as justified by it being an attempt to civilize the barbaric populations.{{Refn|Broca took into consideration works by multiple authors such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Robert Knox]], [[Georges Pouchet]], [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Broca, 1964.|name=|group=n}} In his 1859 work, ''On the Phenomenon of Hybridity in the Genus Homo,'' he argued that it was reasonable to view humanity as composed of independent racial groups - such as [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian]], [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]], [[Malay race|Malayan]], [[Negro|Ethiopian]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]]. He saw each racial group as its own species, connected to a geographic location. All together, these different species were part of the single [[Homo|genus homo.]]<ref>Broca, 1864, p. 9</ref> Per the standard of the time, Broca would also refer to the Caucasian racial group as white, and to the Ethiopian racial group as [[Negro]]. In his writings, Broca's use of the 'race' was narrower than how it is used today. Broca considered Celts, Gauls, Greeks, Persians and Arabs to be distinct races that were part of the Caucasian racial group.<ref>Broca, 1864, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>{{Refn|Broca justified using geographic locations rather than skin color when classifying racial groups: \"It has been shown that the American type alone includes red, brown, black, white and yellow races. There are brown races in the American, and even in the Caucasian type. All the black races do not belong to the Ethiopian type; and finally, the Malayo-Polynesian type comprises races of colours as various as those belonging to the American type. A classification founded on differences of colour would lead to numerous and serious errors.\" Broca, 1864, p. 9|group=n}} Races within each group had specific physical characteristics that distinguished them from other racial groups. Like his work in anatomy, Broca emphasized that his conclusions rested on empirical evidence, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.<ref>Schiller, 1979, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> He thought that the distinct geographic location of each racial group was one of the main problems with the monogenists argument for common ancestry:<blockquote>There was even, no necessity to insist upon the difficulty, or greater geographical impossibility of the dispersion of so many races proceeding from a common origin, nor to remark that before the remote and the almost recent migrations of Europeans, each natural group of human races occupied upon our planet a region characterized by a special fauna; that no American animal was found either in Australia nor in the ancient continent, and where men of a new type were discovered, there were only found animals belonging to species, then to general, and sometimes to zoological orders, without analogues in other regions of the globe.<ref>Broca, 1864 pp. 63\u201364</ref></blockquote>Broca also felt that there was not enough evidence for the theory that appearance of different races could be changed by the qualities of the environments that they lived in. Broca saw the physical characteristic of Jews being the same as those portrayed in the Egyptian paintings from the 2,500 b.c., even though, by 1850 a.d. that population had spread to different locations with vastly different environments. He pointed out that his opponents were unable to provide similar long term comparisons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broca|first=Paul|date=1964|title=On the Phenomenon of Hybridity in the Genus Homo reprint of M\u00e9moire sur les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes d'hybridit\u00e9 dans le genre human.|url=|journal=Anthropological Society|volume=|pages=61\u201363|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybridity ====\nBroca, influenced by previous work [[Samuel George Morton]], used the concept of [[hybridity]] as his primary argument against monogenis, and that it was flawed to see all of humanity as a single species.<ref>Ashok, 2017, pp. 13\u201314</ref> Different racial groups' ability to reproduce with each was not sufficient to prove that idea.<ref>Broca, 1864, p. 64</ref> Under Broca's view on hybridity, the result of a reproduction between two different races could fall into four categories: 1) The resulting offspring are infertile; 2) Where the resulting offspring are infertile when they reproduce between themselves but are sometimes successful when they reproduce with the parent groups;  3) Known as Paragenesic, where the offspring's descendants are able reproduce within themselves and with parents, but the success of the reproduction lowers with every generation until it ends; and 4) Known as Eugenesic, where a successful reproduction can continue indefinitely, between the intermix descendants and with the parent group.<ref>Broca, 1964, Glossorial Note</ref>\n\nLooking at historical population figures, Broca concluded that the population of France was an example of a Eugenesic mixed race, resulting from intermixing of Cimri, Celtic, Germanic and Northern races within the Caucasian group.<ref>Broca, 1964, Section II</ref> On the other hand, the thought that observations and population data from different regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and North and South America, showed a significant decrease in physical and intellectual abilities of mixed groups when compared to the different races that they originated from. Concluding that intermixed descendants of different racial groups could only be Paragenesic.[[File:Stereograph Broca.png|thumb|259x259px|Stereograph designed by Paul Broca and manufactured by Mathieu]]<blockquote>I am far from advancing these suppositions as demonstrated truths. I have studied and analysed all documents within my reach; but I cannot be responsible for facts not ascertained by myself, and which are too much in opposition to generally received opinions to be admitted without strict investigation... Until we obtain further particulars we can only reason upon the known facts; but these, it must be admitted, are so numerous and so authentic as to constitute if not a rigorous definitive demonstration, at least a strong presumption of the doctrines of polygenists.<ref>Broca, 1964, pp. 59\u201360</ref></blockquote>\n''On the Phenomenon of Hybridity'' was published the same year as Darwin's presentation of the theory of evolution in the ''On the Origin of Species''. At that time, Broca thought of each racial group as independently created by nature. He was against slavery and disturbed by extinction of native populations caused by colonization.<ref>Broca, 1864, p. 70</ref> Broca thought that monogenism was often used to justify such actions, when it was argued that, if all races where of a single origin then the lower status of non-Caucasians was caused by how their race acted following creation. He wrote: <blockquote>The difference of origin by no means implicates the subordination of races. It, on the contrary, implicates the idea that each race of men has originated in a determined region, as it were, as the crown of the fauna of that region; and if it were permitted to guess at the intention of nature, we might be led to suppose that she has assigned a distinct inheritance to each race, because, despite of all that has been said of the cosmopolitism of man, the inviolability of the domain of certain races is determined by their climate.<ref>Broca, 1964, pp. 70\u201371.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Craniometry ====\nBroca is known for making contributions towards [[History of anthropometry|anthropometry]]&mdash;the scientific approach to measurements of human physical features. He developed numerous instruments and data points that were the basis of current methods of medical and archeological [[craniometry]]. Specifically, cranial points like [[glabella]] and [[External occipital protuberance|inion]] and instruments like craniograph and stereograph.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Physical Anthropology, an Encyclopedia Volume 1|last=Spencer|first=Frank|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}</ref> Unlike Morton, who believed that a subject's brain size was the main indicator of intelligence, Broca thought that there were other factors that were more important. These included [[Prognathism|prognathic]] facial angles, with closer to right angles indicating higher intelligence, and the [[cephalic index]] relationship between the brain's length and width, that was directly proportional with intelligence, with the most intelligent European group being 'long headed', while the least intelligent Negro group being 'short headed'.<ref name=\":1\">Ashok, 2017, p. 32</ref> He thought that the most important aspect, was the relative size between the frontal and rear areas of the brain, with Caucasians having a larger frontal area than Negroes.<ref name=\":1\" /> Broca eventually came to the conclusion that larger skulls were not associated with higher intelligence, but still believed brain size was important in some aspects such as social progress, material security, and education.<ref>(This Week in the History of Psychology: Stanley Finger on the trailblazing neurologist, Paul Broca, and his patient, \u201cTan.\u201d [Audio blog interview].</ref>{{Refn|As of 2016, several meta-studies have shown, that in humans, there is a weak correlation between brain size and general intelligence, with results ranging from 9 to 15 percent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Christof|title=Does Brain Size Matter?|journal=Scientific American Mind|language=en|volume=27|issue=1|pages=22\u201325|doi=10.1038/scientificamericanmind0116-22|year=2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=1 September 2017|title=Brain volume and intelligence: The moderating role of intelligence measurement quality|journal=Intelligence|language=en|volume=64|pages=18\u201329|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2017.06.004|issn=0160-2896|author=Gignac Gilles E., Bates Timothy C.}}</ref>|name=|group=n}} He compared [[Brain size|cranial capacity]] of different types of Parisian skulls.

Soon after Darwin's publication, Broca accepted evolution as one of the main elements of a broader explanation for diversification of species: \"I am one of those who do not think that Charles Darwin has discovered the true agents of organic evolution; on the other hand I am not one of those who fail to recognize the greatness of his work ... Vital competition ... is a law; the resultant selection is a fact; individual variation, another fact.\"<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 225</ref>\n\nHe came to reject polygenism as applied to humans, conceding that all races were of single origin. In 1866, after the discovery of a chinless and protruded neanderthal jaw, he wrote: \"I have already had occasion to state that I am not a Darwinist ... Yet I do not hesitate ... to call this the first link in the chain which, according to the Darwinists, extends from man to ape...\"<ref>Shiller, 1979, p. 222</ref> He saw some differences between groups of animals as too distinct to be explained through evolution from a single source:<blockquote>There is no reason for limiting to a single spot and single moment the spontaneous evolution of matter ... To me it seems most likely that centers of organization appeared in very different places and at very different periods ... This polygenic transformism is what I would be inclined to accept ... My objection against Darwinism would be invalid if it conceded that organized beings have an undetermined but considerable number of distinct origins and if structural analogies were no longer considered sufficient proof for common parentage.<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 226</ref></blockquote>Even on a narrower level Broca saw evolution as insufficient explanation for the presence of some traits:<blockquote>Apply Darwin's thinking to the genus [[Bornean orangutan|Orang (''Satyrus)'']] ... He alone, of all the primates, has no nail on his big toe. Why? ... The Darwinists will answer that one day a certain Pithecus was born without a big toe nail, and his descendants have perpetuated this variety ... Let us call this ape ... ''Prosatyrus I'', as it behooves the founder of a dynasty ... While, according to the law of immediate heredity, some of his offspring were like their other ancestors in having a nail on every toe, one or more were deprived of the first nail like their father ... Thanks to natural selection, this character finally became constant ... But I do not see ... how this negative characteristic ... might give him advantage in the struggle for existence.<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 232</ref></blockquote>Ultimately, Broca believed that there had to be a process that ran parallel to evolution, to fully explain the origins of, and divergences, between different species.<ref>Shiller, 1979, pp. 231\u201332.</ref>\n\n== Language ==\n\n=== Broca's Area ===\n[[File:Pierre Marie, Travaux et memoires. Wellcome L0028667.jpg|thumb|Louis Victor \"Tan\" Lebourgne's brain. By Pierre Marie.]]\nBroca is celebrated for his theory that the [[Manner of articulation|speech]] production center of the brain located of the left side of the brain and pinpointing the location to the ventroposterior region of the [[frontal lobe]]s (now known as Broca's area). He arrived at this discovery by studying the brains of [[aphasia|aphasic]] patients (persons with speech and language disorders resulting from brain injuries).<ref name=\"Fancher\">Fancher, Raymond E. Pioneers of Psychology, 2nd ed. (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1990 (1979), pp. 72\u201393.</ref>\n\nThis area of study began for Broca with the dispute between the proponents of cerebral localization \u2013 whose views derived from the [[phrenology]] of [[Franz Joseph Gall]] \u2013 and their opponents led by [[Pierre Flourens]]. Phrenologists believed that the human mind has a set of various [[Faculty psychology|mental faculties]], each one represented in a different area of the brain. With specific areas representing personality  characteristics like one's aggressiveness or spirituality, but also memory and linguistic abilities. Their opponents claimed that, by careful [[ablation]] (specific way of removing material) of various brain regions, Flourens had disproved Gall's hypotheses. However, Gall's former student, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]], kept the localization of function hypothesis alive (especially with regards to a \"language center\"), although he rejected much of the remaining phrenological thinking. In 1848, Bouillaud relied on his work with brain damaged patients to challenge other professionals to disprove him by finding a case of frontal lobe damage unaccompanied by a disorder of speech.<ref>Schiller, 1979, pp. 172\u201374.</ref> His son-in-law, Ernest Aubertin (1825\u20131893), began seeking out cases to either support or disprove the theory, and he found several in support of it.<ref name=\"Fancher\" />\n\nBroca's [[Society of Anthropology of Paris]] was where language was regularly discussed in the context of race and nationality, it also became a platform for addressing its physiological aspects. The localization of function controversy became a topic of regular debate when several experts of head and brain anatomy, including Aubertin, joined the society. Most of these experts still supported Flourens argument, but Aubertin was persistent in presenting new patients to counter their views. However, it was Broca, not Aubertin, who finally put the localization issue to rest.\n\nIn 1861, Broca visited a patient, named Louis Victor Leborgne in the [[Bic\u00eatre Hospital]], who had a 21-year progressive loss of speech and paralysis but not a loss of comprehension nor mental function.  He was nicknamed \"Tan\" due to his inability to clearly speak any words other than \"tan\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/26599-famous-brain-injury-patient-identified.html|title=Identity of Famous 19th-Century Brain Discovered|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Live Science|access-date=24 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614065814/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/the-man-who-couldnt-speakand-how-he-revolutionized-psychology/|archive-date=14 June 2016|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Fancher\" /><ref name=\"Tan\">Broca, Paul.

From a comparative progression of Leborgne's loss of speech and motor movement, the area of the brain important for speech production was determined to lie within the third convolution of the left frontal lobe, next to the [[lateral sulcus]].<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 182</ref><ref>Finger, 2000, pp. 142-144.</ref> One day after Tan's death Broca presented his findings to the anthropological society.<ref>Finger, 2000, pp. 142.</ref>\n\nA second case after Leborgne is what solidified Broca's beliefs that our speech function was localized. Lazare Lelong was an 84-year-old grounds worker who was being treated at Bic\u00eatre for dementia. He had also lost the ability to speak other than five simple, meaningful words - these included his own name, \"yes\", \"no\", \"always\" as well as the number \"three\".<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 188</ref> After his death his brain was also autopsied. Broca found a lesion that encompassed much the same area as had been affected in Leborgne's brain. This finding concluded that a specific area controlled our ability to produce meaningful sounds, and when it is affected, one can lose their capability to communicate.<ref name=\":3\" /> For the next two years, Broca went on to find autopsy evidence from twelve more cases in support of the localization of articulated language.<ref name=\"Fancher\" /><ref name=\"Tan\" />[[File:Broca's area animation.gif|thumb|Broca's area]] Broca published his findings from the autopsies of the twelve patients in his paper, \u201cLocalization of Speech in the Third Left Frontal Cultivation\u201d in 1865. His work inspired others to perform careful autopsies with the aim of linking more brain regions to sensory and motor functions. Although history credits this discovery to Broca, another French neurologist, [[Marc Dax]], had made similar observations a generation earlier. Based on his work with approximately forty patients and subjects from other papers, Dax presented his findings at a 1836 conference of southern France physicians in Montpellier.<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 193</ref>{{Refn|In his paper \"Lesions of the Left Half of the Brain Coincident with the Forgetting of the Signs of Thought\" Dax described patients with tumors, strokes as well as sword wounds; no autopsy information was included.

This type of aphasia, which often involves impairments in speech output, can be contrasted with [[Receptive aphasia]], (also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''), named for [[Karl Wernicke]], which is characterized by damage to more [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] regions of the left [[temporal lobe]], and is often characterized by impairments in language comprehension.<ref name=\"Fancher\"/><ref name=\"Tan\"/>\n\n==Broca's legacy==\n[[File:Broca Triboulet February 1880 Blass.png|alt=From Le Triboulet, February 1880.

Broca played a major role in the localization of function debate, by resolving the issue scientifically with Leborgne and his 12 cases thereafter. His research led others to discover the location of a wide variety of other functions, specifically [[Wernicke's area]].{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nNew research has found that dysfunction in the area may lead to other speech disorders such as [[stuttering]] and [[apraxia|apraxia of speech]].

His wife had a known family history of carcinoma, and it is possible that this piqued his interest in exploring possible hereditary causes of cancer. In his investigations, he accumulated evidence supporting the hereditary nature of some cancers while also discovering that cancer cells can run through the blood.<ref>\"Contributions of Pierre Paul Broca to Cancer Genetics\" (1979). Transactions of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences and Affiliated Societies.</ref> Many scientists were skeptical of Broca's hereditary hypothesis, with most believing that it is merely coincidental. He stated two hypotheses for the cause of cancer, diathesis and infection. He believed that the cause may lie somewhere between the two. He then hypothesized that (1) diathesis produces the first cancer (2) cancer produces infection, and (3) infection produces secondary multiple tumors, cachexia, and death.\u201d <ref>(Broca, P. P. 1866. Traite des tumeurs. Paris, P. Asselin.)</ref>\n\n==Anthropology==\nBroca spent much time at his Anthropological Institute studying skulls and bones. It has been argued that he was attempting to use the measurements obtained by these studies as his main criteria for ranking racial groups in order of superiority. In that sense, Broca was a pioneer in the study of physical anthropology a part of which has been called 'scientific racism.' He advanced the science of cranial anthropometry by developing many new types of measuring instruments ([[Anthropometry|craniometers]]) and numerical indices.<ref name=\"memoir2\">{{cite journal|year=1881|title=Memoir of Paul Broca|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|volume=10|pages=242\u2013261|jstor=2841526}}</ref> He published around 223 papers on general anthropology, physical anthropology, ethnology, and other branches of this field. He founded the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie de Paris]]'' in 1859, the ''Revue d'Anthropologie'' in 1872, and the School of Anthropology in Paris in 1876.\n\nBroca first became acquainted with anthropology through the works of [[Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Antoine \u00c9tienne Reynaud Augustin Serres]] and [[Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Br\u00e9au]], and by the late 1850s it became his lifetime interest. Broca defined Anthropology as \"the study of the human group, considered as whole.\"<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 136</ref> Like other scientists, he rejected relying on religious texts, and looked for a scientific explanation of human origins.\n\nIn 1857, Broca was presented with a hybrid [[Leporidae|leporid]], a result of a cross species reproduction between a rabbit and hare. The crossbreeding was done for commercial rather than scientific reasons, as the resulting [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] became very popular pets. Specific circumstances had to be set up in order for differently behaving species to reproduce and for their [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] descendants to be able to reproduce between themselves. To Broca, the fact that different animals are able to intermix and create fertile offspring did not prove that they were of the same species.<ref>Shiller, 1979, pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nIn 1858, Broca's presented these findings on leporids to the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Biologie.'' He believed that the key element of his work was its implication that physical differences between human races could be explained by them being different species with different origins rather than the single moment of creation. While [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' did not come out until the following year, the topic of human origin was already widely discussed in science, but still  capable of producing a negative response from the government. Because of that worry, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Olive Rayer|Pierre Raye]]<nowiki/>r the president of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, along with other members with which Broca was on good relations, asked Broca to stop further discussion of the topic. Broca agreed, but was adamant for the discussion to continue, so in 1859 he formed the [[Society of Anthropology of Paris|Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Anthropologie]].<ref>Shiller, 1979, pp. 130\u2013135</ref>\n\n=== Racial groups and human species ===\nAs a proponent of [[polygenism]], Broca rejected the [[Monogenism|monogenistic]] approach that all humans have a common ancestor. Instead he viewed human racial groups as coming from different origins. Like most of the proponents on either side, he viewed each racial groups as having a place on a 'barbarism' to 'civilization' progression. He saw European colonization of other  territories as justified by it being an attempt to civilize the barbaric populations.{{Refn|Broca took into consideration works by multiple authors such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]], [[Robert Knox]], [[Georges Pouchet]], [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. Broca, 1964.|name=|group=n}} In his 1859 work, ''On the Phenomenon of Hybridity in the Genus Homo,'' he argued that it was reasonable to view humanity as composed of independent racial groups - such as [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian]], [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian]], [[Malay race|Malayan]], [[Negro|Ethiopian]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]]. He saw each racial group as its own species, connected to a geographic location. All together, these different species were part of the single [[Homo|genus homo.]]<ref>Broca, 1864, p. 9</ref> Per the standard of the time, Broca would also refer to the Caucasian racial group as white, and to the Ethiopian racial group as [[Negro]]. In his writings, Broca's use of the 'race' was narrower than how it is used today. Broca considered Celts, Gauls, Greeks, Persians and Arabs to be distinct races that were part of the Caucasian racial group.<ref>Broca, 1864, pp. 16\u201317.</ref>{{Refn|Broca justified using geographic locations rather than skin color when classifying racial groups: \"It has been shown that the American type alone includes red, brown, black, white and yellow races. There are brown races in the American, and even in the Caucasian type. All the black races do not belong to the Ethiopian type; and finally, the Malayo-Polynesian type comprises races of colours as various as those belonging to the American type. A classification founded on differences of colour would lead to numerous and serious errors.\" Broca, 1864, p. 9|group=n}} Races within each group had specific physical characteristics that distinguished them from other racial groups. Like his work in anatomy, Broca emphasized that his conclusions rested on empirical evidence, rather than ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' reasoning.<ref>Schiller, 1979, pp. 129\u2013130</ref> He thought that the distinct geographic location of each racial group was one of the main problems with the monogenists argument for common ancestry:<blockquote>There was even, no necessity to insist upon the difficulty, or greater geographical impossibility of the dispersion of so many races proceeding from a common origin, nor to remark that before the remote and the almost recent migrations of Europeans, each natural group of human races occupied upon our planet a region characterized by a special fauna; that no American animal was found either in Australia nor in the ancient continent, and where men of a new type were discovered, there were only found animals belonging to species, then to general, and sometimes to zoological orders, without analogues in other regions of the globe.<ref>Broca, 1864 pp. 63\u201364</ref></blockquote>Broca also felt that there was not enough evidence for the theory that appearance of different races could be changed by the qualities of the environments that they lived in. Broca saw the physical characteristic of Jews being the same as those portrayed in the Egyptian paintings from the 2,500 b.c., even though, by 1850 a.d. that population had spread to different locations with vastly different environments. He pointed out that his opponents were unable to provide similar long term comparisons.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broca|first=Paul|date=1964|title=On the Phenomenon of Hybridity in the Genus Homo reprint of M\u00e9moire sur les ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes d'hybridit\u00e9 dans le genre human.|url=|journal=Anthropological Society|volume=|pages=61\u201363|via=}}</ref>\n\n==== Hybridity ====\nBroca, influenced by previous work [[Samuel George Morton]], used the concept of [[hybridity]] as his primary argument against monogenis, and that it was flawed to see all of humanity as a single species.<ref>Ashok, 2017, pp. 13\u201314</ref> Different racial groups' ability to reproduce with each was not sufficient to prove that idea.<ref>Broca, 1864, p. 64</ref> Under Broca's view on hybridity, the result of a reproduction between two different races could fall into four categories: 1) The resulting offspring are infertile; 2) Where the resulting offspring are infertile when they reproduce between themselves but are sometimes successful when they reproduce with the parent groups;  3) Known as Paragenesic, where the offspring's descendants are able reproduce within themselves and with parents, but the success of the reproduction lowers with every generation until it ends; and 4) Known as Eugenesic, where a successful reproduction can continue indefinitely, between the intermix descendants and with the parent group.<ref>Broca, 1964, Glossorial Note</ref>\n\nLooking at historical population figures, Broca concluded that the population of France was an example of a Eugenesic mixed race, resulting from intermixing of Cimri, Celtic, Germanic and Northern races within the Caucasian group.<ref>Broca, 1964, Section II</ref> On the other hand, the thought that observations and population data from different regions of Africa, Southeast Asia, and North and South America, showed a significant decrease in physical and intellectual abilities of mixed groups when compared to the different races that they originated from. Concluding that intermixed descendants of different racial groups could only be Paragenesic.[[File:Stereograph Broca.png|thumb|259x259px|Stereograph designed by Paul Broca and manufactured by Mathieu]]<blockquote>I am far from advancing these suppositions as demonstrated truths. I have studied and analysed all documents within my reach; but I cannot be responsible for facts not ascertained by myself, and which are too much in opposition to generally received opinions to be admitted without strict investigation... Until we obtain further particulars we can only reason upon the known facts; but these, it must be admitted, are so numerous and so authentic as to constitute if not a rigorous definitive demonstration, at least a strong presumption of the doctrines of polygenists.<ref>Broca, 1964, pp. 59\u201360</ref></blockquote>\n''On the Phenomenon of Hybridity'' was published the same year as Darwin's presentation of the theory of evolution in the ''On the Origin of Species''. At that time, Broca thought of each racial group as independently created by nature. He was against slavery and disturbed by extinction of native populations caused by colonization.<ref>Broca, 1864, p. 70</ref> Broca thought that monogenism was often used to justify such actions, when it was argued that, if all races where of a single origin then the lower status of non-Caucasians was caused by how their race acted following creation. He wrote: <blockquote>The difference of origin by no means implicates the subordination of races. It, on the contrary, implicates the idea that each race of men has originated in a determined region, as it were, as the crown of the fauna of that region; and if it were permitted to guess at the intention of nature, we might be led to suppose that she has assigned a distinct inheritance to each race, because, despite of all that has been said of the cosmopolitism of man, the inviolability of the domain of certain races is determined by their climate.<ref>Broca, 1964, pp. 70\u201371.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Craniometry ====\nBroca is known for making contributions towards [[History of anthropometry|anthropometry]]&mdash;the scientific approach to measurements of human physical features. He developed numerous instruments and data points that were the basis of current methods of medical and archeological [[craniometry]].

Soon after Darwin's publication, Broca accepted evolution as one of the main elements of a broader explanation for diversification of species: \"I am one of those who do not think that Charles Darwin has discovered the true agents of organic evolution; on the other hand I am not one of those who fail to recognize the greatness of his work ... Vital competition ... is a law; the resultant selection is a fact; individual variation, another fact.\"<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 225</ref>\n\nHe came to reject polygenism as applied to humans, conceding that all races were of single origin. In 1866, after the discovery of a chinless and protruded neanderthal jaw, he wrote: \"I have already had occasion to state that I am not a Darwinist ... Yet I do not hesitate ... to call this the first link in the chain which, according to the Darwinists, extends from man to ape...\"<ref>Shiller, 1979, p. 222</ref> He saw some differences between groups of animals as too distinct to be explained through evolution from a single source:<blockquote>There is no reason for limiting to a single spot and single moment the spontaneous evolution of matter ... To me it seems most likely that centers of organization appeared in very different places and at very different periods ... This polygenic transformism is what I would be inclined to accept ... My objection against Darwinism would be invalid if it conceded that organized beings have an undetermined but considerable number of distinct origins and if structural analogies were no longer considered sufficient proof for common parentage.<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 226</ref></blockquote>Even on a narrower level Broca saw evolution as insufficient explanation for the presence of some traits:<blockquote>Apply Darwin's thinking to the genus [[Bornean orangutan|Orang (''Satyrus)'']] ... He alone, of all the primates, has no nail on his big toe. Why? ... The Darwinists will answer that one day a certain Pithecus was born without a big toe nail, and his descendants have perpetuated this variety ... Let us call this ape ... ''Prosatyrus I'', as it behooves the founder of a dynasty ... While, according to the law of immediate heredity, some of his offspring were like their other ancestors in having a nail on every toe, one or more were deprived of the first nail like their father ... Thanks to natural selection, this character finally became constant ... But I do not see ... how this negative characteristic ... might give him advantage in the struggle for existence.<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 232</ref></blockquote>Ultimately, Broca believed that there had to be a process that ran parallel to evolution, to fully explain the origins of, and divergences, between different species.<ref>Shiller, 1979, pp. 231\u201332.</ref>\n\n== Language ==\n\n=== Broca's Area ===\n[[File:Pierre Marie, Travaux et memoires. Wellcome L0028667.jpg|thumb|Louis Victor \"Tan\" Lebourgne's brain. By Pierre Marie.]]\nBroca is celebrated for his theory that the [[Manner of articulation|speech]] production center of the brain located of the left side of the brain and pinpointing the location to the ventroposterior region of the [[frontal lobe]]s (now known as Broca's area). He arrived at this discovery by studying the brains of [[aphasia|aphasic]] patients (persons with speech and language disorders resulting from brain injuries).<ref name=\"Fancher\">Fancher, Raymond E. Pioneers of Psychology, 2nd ed. (New York: W.W. Norton & Co., 1990 (1979), pp. 72\u201393.</ref>\n\nThis area of study began for Broca with the dispute between the proponents of cerebral localization \u2013 whose views derived from the [[phrenology]] of [[Franz Joseph Gall]] \u2013 and their opponents led by [[Pierre Flourens]]. Phrenologists believed that the human mind has a set of various [[Faculty psychology|mental faculties]], each one represented in a different area of the brain. With specific areas representing personality  characteristics like one's aggressiveness or spirituality, but also memory and linguistic abilities. Their opponents claimed that, by careful [[ablation]] (specific way of removing material) of various brain regions, Flourens had disproved Gall's hypotheses. However, Gall's former student, [[Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud]], kept the localization of function hypothesis alive (especially with regards to a \"language center\"), although he rejected much of the remaining phrenological thinking. In 1848, Bouillaud relied on his work with brain damaged patients to challenge other professionals to disprove him by finding a case of frontal lobe damage unaccompanied by a disorder of speech.<ref>Schiller, 1979, pp. 172\u201374.</ref> His son-in-law, Ernest Aubertin (1825\u20131893), began seeking out cases to either support or disprove the theory, and he found several in support of it.<ref name=\"Fancher\" />\n\nBroca's [[Society of Anthropology of Paris]] was where language was regularly discussed in the context of race and nationality, it also became a platform for addressing its physiological aspects. The localization of function controversy became a topic of regular debate when several experts of head and brain anatomy, including Aubertin, joined the society. Most of these experts still supported Flourens argument, but Aubertin was persistent in presenting new patients to counter their views. However, it was Broca, not Aubertin, who finally put the localization issue to rest.\n\nIn 1861, Broca visited a patient, named Louis Victor Leborgne in the [[Bic\u00eatre Hospital]], who had a 21-year progressive loss of speech and paralysis but not a loss of comprehension nor mental function.  He was nicknamed \"Tan\" due to his inability to clearly speak any words other than \"tan\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/26599-famous-brain-injury-patient-identified.html|title=Identity of Famous 19th-Century Brain Discovered|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=Live Science|access-date=24 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614065814/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/literally-psyched/the-man-who-couldnt-speakand-how-he-revolutionized-psychology/|archive-date=14 June 2016|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Fancher\" /><ref name=\"Tan\">Broca, Paul.

From a comparative progression of Leborgne's loss of speech and motor movement, the area of the brain important for speech production was determined to lie within the third convolution of the left frontal lobe, next to the [[lateral sulcus]].<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 182</ref><ref>Finger, 2000, pp. 142-144.</ref> One day after Tan's death Broca presented his findings to the anthropological society.<ref>Finger, 2000, pp. 142.</ref>\n\nA second case after Leborgne is what solidified Broca's beliefs that our speech function was localized. Lazare Lelong was an 84-year-old grounds worker who was being treated at Bic\u00eatre for dementia. He had also lost the ability to speak other than five simple, meaningful words - these included his own name, \"yes\", \"no\", \"always\" as well as the number \"three\".<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 188</ref> After his death his brain was also autopsied. Broca found a lesion that encompassed much the same area as had been affected in Leborgne's brain. This finding concluded that a specific area controlled our ability to produce meaningful sounds, and when it is affected, one can lose their capability to communicate.<ref name=\":3\" /> For the next two years, Broca went on to find autopsy evidence from twelve more cases in support of the localization of articulated language.<ref name=\"Fancher\" /><ref name=\"Tan\" />[[File:Broca's area animation.gif|thumb|Broca's area]] Broca published his findings from the autopsies of the twelve patients in his paper, \u201cLocalization of Speech in the Third Left Frontal Cultivation\u201d in 1865. His work inspired others to perform careful autopsies with the aim of linking more brain regions to sensory and motor functions. Although history credits this discovery to Broca, another French neurologist, [[Marc Dax]], had made similar observations a generation earlier. Based on his work with approximately forty patients and subjects from other papers, Dax presented his findings at a 1836 conference of southern France physicians in Montpellier.<ref>Schiller, 1979, p. 193</ref>{{Refn|In his paper \"Lesions of the Left Half of the Brain Coincident with the Forgetting of the Signs of Thought\" Dax described patients with tumors, strokes as well as sword wounds; no autopsy information was included. Finger, 200, p. 146|group=n}} Unfortunately, Dax died soon after this presentation and it was not reported or published until after Broca made his initial findings.<ref name=\"Finger, 2000, pp. 145-47\">Finger, 2000, pp. 145-47</ref> Accordingly, Dax's and Broca's conclusions that the left frontal lobe is essential for producing language are considered to be independent.<ref>Schiller 1979, pp. 192-97</ref><ref name=\"Finger, 2000, pp. 145-47\"/>\n\nThe brains of many of Broca's aphasic patients are still preserved and available for viewing on a limited basis in the special collections of the [[Pierre and Marie Curie University|Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University (UPMC)]] in Paris.  The collection was formerly displayed in the [[Mus\u00e9e Dupuytren]].  His collection of casts is in the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Anatomie Delmas-Orfila-Rouvi\u00e8re]].

This type of aphasia, which often involves impairments in speech output, can be contrasted with [[Receptive aphasia]], (also known as '''Wernicke's aphasia'''), named for [[Karl Wernicke]], which is characterized by damage to more [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] regions of the left [[temporal lobe]], and is often characterized by impairments in language comprehension.<ref name=\"Fancher\"/><ref name=\"Tan\"/>\n\n==Broca's legacy==\n[[File:Broca Triboulet February 1880 Blass.png|alt=From Le Triboulet, February 1880.

Broca played a major role in the localization of function debate, by resolving the issue scientifically with Leborgne and his 12 cases thereafter.

This [[Strombolian eruption]], as it is known, is also observed at other volcanoes worldwide. Eruptions from the summit craters typically result in a few short, mild, but energetic bursts, ranging up to a few hundred meters in height, containing ash, incandescent lava fragments and stone blocks. Stromboli's activity is almost exclusively explosive, but lava flows do occur at times when volcanic activity is high: an effusive eruption occurred in [[2002 Stromboli Tsunami|2002]], the first in 17 years, and again in 2003, 2007, and 2013\u201314.

Every other square mile of the city is part of the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] reservation land. The city's name is derived from Cathedral [[Canyon]] located to the south of the city in the foothills of the [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]]. The canyon is said to have been named in 1850 by U.S. Army [[Colonel Henry Washington]] after deciding a rock formation of the canyon looked reminiscent of a [[cathedral]].<ref>{{GNIS|270352|Cathedral Canyon}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the arrival of European explorers and settlers, the land was part of the territory inhabited by the [[Cahuilla]] Indians. Development of a town began when a [[subdivision (land)|housing subdivision]] was built in 1925, although it was not [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] until 1981. Situated between [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Rancho Mirage, California|Rancho Mirage]], the city has the second largest population, after [[Indio, California|Indio]], of the nine cities in the [[Coachella Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Census.gov|title=Cities: SUB-EST2009-4|url=https://www.census.gov/popest/cities/SUB-EST2009-4.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805012857/http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/SUB-EST2009-4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 5, 2011|access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>  Its population was 51,200 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early History: before 1860===\nCathedral City sits at the northwestern end of the Coachella Valley between the [[San Bernardino Mountains]] to the north, and the [[San Jacinto Mountains]] to the south, with the [[San Gorgonio Pass]] to the West.  The earliest established inhabitants of this region were the [[Cahuilla|Cahuilla Indians]].

At that time the province had already been renamed and expanded into the larger [[Alta California]] province.  After the [[Mexican-American War]], and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, possession of the land was formally transferred to the [[United States]], and it officially became part of the [[California|State of California]] when the state was formed in 1850.\n \nIn 1852 [[United States Army|US Army]] [[Colonel Henry Washington]], a nephew of [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], was contracted by the government to survey Southern California.<ref name=Survey1>{{cite web |last1=Mojave |first1=Mojo on the |title=George Washington's Nephew in the Mojave Desert? |url=https://www.desertusa.com/dusablog/george-washingtons-nephew-mojave-desert.html |website=DesertUSA |publisher=Mojo on the Mojave |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  On November 7 of that year he established the [[San Bernardino meridian|initial point]], in the San Bernardino Mountains, from which all future surveys in Southern California would be based.<ref name=\"Survey2\">{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Michael A |title=Three Monuments, One Initial Point (The Story of The San Bernardino Initial Point Monument) |journal=California Surveyor |date=September 2002 |issue=#135 |url=http://www.mdshs.org/articles/duffy.html |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  In 1855 he was contracted to continue his work and survey the Coachella Valley.  It was then that he found and named Cathedral Canyon for which Cathedral City would be named.<ref name=Survey1/>\n\nBesides Colonel Henry Washington, there were occasional explorers, colonizers and soldiers that made their way through the area during the Spanish, Mexican, and early American eras, but none established any permanent structures or residences.  The Cahuilla remained the only people known to be living in the area.\n\n===Stage and Freight Lines 1860 \u2013 1880===\n\nPrior to the 1860s the only regularly traveled routes through the Coachella Valley were trading paths used by the Cahuilla and other Native American tribes.  One of these paths, on the southwestern side of the valley, followed the base of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains somewhere near the [[Whitewater River (California)|Whitewater River]], and would have passed through the area that would become Cathedral City.  Early non-native explorers, surveyors, and military, such as Colonel Washington, made use of these routes, but regular transportation services were not established until 1862.\n  \nThe [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]], which started in the spring of 1862, prompted [[William D. Bradshaw]], a frontiersman, to seek a quicker route from Los Angeles to the [[Colorado River]].  Later that year he hired a guide, and with the help of the Cahuilla and [[Maricopa people|Maricopa Indians]], mapped a route from [[San Bernardino, California]], through the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley, past the northern shore of the [[Salton Sink]], through the passes between the [[Chuckwalla Mountains|Chuckwalla]] and [[Chocolate Mountains]], and up to the Colorado River across from La Paz in the [[New Mexico Territory]], (now the state of [[Arizona]]).  Much of the route is thought to have followed the original southwestern trading path used by the Cahuilla.\n\nShortly after Bradshaw defined the trail from San Bernardino to La Paz, various stagecoach and freight companies began using the route.  The stage and freight lines brought miners, supplies, and mail between San Bernardino and La Paz, and the route became known as the [[Bradshaw Trail]] or \u201cGold Road\u201d.  The Bradshaw trail, like the original Cahuillian trail, passed through the future Cathedral City, but the nearest scheduled stops were Agua Caliente (now Palms Springs), and Indian Wells (now Indio). The stage and freight lines were eventually supplanted by the railroads, but the trail would later become the basis for Palm Canyon Drive and [[California State Route 111|Highway 111]] that run through the city today.\n\n===Depression era nightclubs===\nIn 1931, Al and Lou Wertheimer of the reputed Detroit \"Purple Gang\" opened the Dunes Club just outside Palm Springs' city limits. This was followed in 1939 by Earl T.

[[Riverside County, California]], United States, within the [[Colorado Desert]]'s [[Coachella Valley]].  Every other square mile of the city is part of the [[Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians]] reservation land.

At that time the province had already been renamed and expanded into the larger [[Alta California]] province.  After the [[Mexican-American War]], and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, possession of the land was formally transferred to the [[United States]], and it officially became part of the [[California|State of California]] when the state was formed in 1850.\n \nIn 1852 [[United States Army|US Army]] [[Colonel Henry Washington]], a nephew of [[George Washington]], the first [[President of the United States]], was contracted by the government to survey Southern California.<ref name=Survey1>{{cite web |last1=Mojave |first1=Mojo on the |title=George Washington's Nephew in the Mojave Desert? |url=https://www.desertusa.com/dusablog/george-washingtons-nephew-mojave-desert.html |website=DesertUSA |publisher=Mojo on the Mojave |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  On November 7 of that year he established the [[San Bernardino meridian|initial point]], in the San Bernardino Mountains, from which all future surveys in Southern California would be based.<ref name=\"Survey2\">{{cite journal |last1=Duffy |first1=Michael A |title=Three Monuments, One Initial Point (The Story of The San Bernardino Initial Point Monument) |journal=California Surveyor |date=September 2002 |issue=#135 |url=http://www.mdshs.org/articles/duffy.html |accessdate=17 December 2019}}</ref>  In 1855 he was contracted to continue his work and survey the Coachella Valley.  It was then that he found and named Cathedral Canyon for which Cathedral City would be named.<ref name=Survey1/>\n\nBesides Colonel Henry Washington, there were occasional explorers, colonizers and soldiers that made their way through the area during the Spanish, Mexican, and early American eras, but none established any permanent structures or residences.  The Cahuilla remained the only people known to be living in the area.\n\n===Stage and Freight Lines 1860 \u2013 1880===\n\nPrior to the 1860s the only regularly traveled routes through the Coachella Valley were trading paths used by the Cahuilla and other Native American tribes.  One of these paths, on the southwestern side of the valley, followed the base of the San Jacinto and Santa Rosa mountains somewhere near the [[Whitewater River (California)|Whitewater River]], and would have passed through the area that would become Cathedral City.  Early non-native explorers, surveyors, and military, such as Colonel Washington, made use of these routes, but regular transportation services were not established until 1862.\n  \nThe [[Steamboats of the Colorado River#Colorado River Gold Rush|Colorado River Gold Rush]], which started in the spring of 1862, prompted [[William D. Bradshaw]], a frontiersman, to seek a quicker route from Los Angeles to the [[Colorado River]].  Later that year he hired a guide, and with the help of the Cahuilla and [[Maricopa people|Maricopa Indians]], mapped a route from [[San Bernardino, California]], through the San Gorgonio Pass and Coachella Valley, past the northern shore of the [[Salton Sink]], through the passes between the [[Chuckwalla Mountains|Chuckwalla]] and [[Chocolate Mountains]], and up to the Colorado River across from La Paz in the [[New Mexico Territory]], (now the state of [[Arizona]]).  Much of the route is thought to have followed the original southwestern trading path used by the Cahuilla.\n\nShortly after Bradshaw defined the trail from San Bernardino to La Paz, various stagecoach and freight companies began using the route.  The stage and freight lines brought miners, supplies, and mail between San Bernardino and La Paz, and the route became known as the [[Bradshaw Trail]] or \u201cGold Road\u201d.  The Bradshaw trail, like the original Cahuillian trail, passed through the future Cathedral City, but the nearest scheduled stops were Agua Caliente (now Palms Springs), and Indian Wells (now Indio). The stage and freight lines were eventually supplanted by the railroads, but the trail would later become the basis for Palm Canyon Drive and [[California State Route 111|Highway 111]] that run through the city today.\n\n===Depression era nightclubs===\nIn 1931, Al and Lou Wertheimer of the reputed Detroit \"Purple Gang\" opened the Dunes Club just outside Palm Springs' city limits.

Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes.

Generally, most common weed plants  belong to one of two weed families namely, ''broadleaf (dicotyledon)'' or ''narrow leaf (monocotyledon)''.  Broadleaf  weeds grow from  tap roots or fibrous root systems and have larger leaves.  Narrow leaf weeds are also referred to as grasses.  They have fibrous roots systems and long narrow leaves.<ref>{{cite news | last =Tilley | first =Nikki | title =What Is A Weed: Weed Info And Control Methods In The Garden\n| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =gardeningknowhow.com| date = | url =https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/weeds/what-is-a-weed.htm | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds have leaves with net-like veins.  They also have  nodes that contain one or more leaves.  They may have showy flowers.  On the other hand, narrow weeds or grasses do not have net-like veins and nodes that contain more leaves.  They can be flat in nature.  Moreover, broadleaf weed have seedlings that come up with two leaves.  This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.  This makes them quite different from broadleaf weeds especially in appearance.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =The Differences Between Broadleaf and Grassy Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =cardinallawns.com| date =7 July 2016 | url =https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/07/differences-between-broadleaf-grassy-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Methods of controlling==\nAlthough broadleaf weeds  are known to be aggressive and tough in nature, they can still be controlled. The gardens, yards and lawns are the most common place they thrive.  There are several ways of controlling them.<ref name=\"NEWS\">{{cite news | last =Trapp | first =Abby | title =Plan a strategy for weed control |work=News-Press NOW |date=28 May 2019 | url =http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/plan-a-strategy-for-weed-control/article_d6d4f086-7db5-11e9-8117-833bed713e1d.html| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Detecting their growth cycle===\n{{Clarify section|date=April 2020}}\nOne of the best ways of dealing with broadleaf weeds is to detect their growth cycle.  This requires proper monitoring.  Most  plants experts use this method since it has been proven to be the most effective.  It involves discovering how  broadleaf weeds grow and depriving them on that growth cycle.<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |title=Learn more about Broadleaf Weeds |website=sciencedirect.com |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broadleaf-weeds |access-date=30 May 2019}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Using a weed killer===\nIn situations where there are massive growth of broadleaf weeds, using a good weed killer can be very helpful.  This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn mowing method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "text_old": "{{Copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Broadleaf weeds''' are unwanted pugnacious and tough plants that grow mostly around free areas in a lawn, garden or yard.<ref name=\"MISS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Perennial Broadleaf Weeds in Lawns| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =missouribotanicalgarden.org| date = | url =http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/weeds/broadleaf-weeds.aspx | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They are often very easy to spot because they are different from normal grasses.<ref name=\"UPS\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Identify the weeds in your lawn and get rid of them| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =upscalelivingmag.com| date = | url =https://www.upscalelivingmag.com/identify-weeds-lawn-get-rid-good/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> They  multiply with ease and can be very hard to control.<ref name=\"TUR\">{{cite news | last = | first =| title =5 Tips To Enhance Broadleaf Weed Control| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =turfmagazine.com| date = | url =https://www.turfmagazine.com/lawn-care/5-tips-to-enhance-broadleaf-weed-control/ | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Basic characteristics==\nBroadleaf weeds generally do not spring up in one specific pattern. Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The weed comes with alternate leaf arrangement and has an extensive rhizomes root type.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Thistle Canada - Cirsium arvense| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf/canada-thistle | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Thistle bull, ''Cirsium vulgare''===\n{{Main|Cirsium vulgare}}\nThistle Bull  is also known as ''thistle'' or ''sprear''. It is a biennial type of broadleaf weed with a basal rosette growth habit.  It spreads through its seeds and bears red or purple flower. It comes with an alternate leaf arrangement and has a taproot with secondary fibrous root system.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Thistle Bull, Cirsium vulgare| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf/bull-thistle | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Violets - ''Viola papilonacea''===\n{{Main|Viola (plant)}}\nViolets are also referred to as the ''hooded blue violet'' or ''meadow-violet''.  It is a typical example of perennial broadleaf weed that spreads with ease.  It propagates through its seeds or rhizomes and bears blue or purple flower. It comes with heart-shaped leaf structure and a coarse root system.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Violets - Viola papilonace| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf/violet | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Contrast with other types of weeds==\nThe differences in broadleaf weeds structure and their  growth habits make them easy to be distinguished from grasses.  Generally, most common weed plants  belong to one of two weed families namely, ''broadleaf (dicotyledon)'' or ''narrow leaf (monocotyledon)''.  Broadleaf  weeds grow from  tap roots or fibrous root systems and have larger leaves.  Narrow leaf weeds are also referred to as grasses.  They have fibrous roots systems and long narrow leaves.<ref>{{cite news | last =Tilley | first =Nikki | title =What Is A Weed: Weed Info And Control Methods In The Garden\n| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =gardeningknowhow.com| date = | url =https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant-problems/weeds/what-is-a-weed.htm | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds have leaves with net-like veins.  They also have  nodes that contain one or more leaves.  They may have showy flowers.  On the other hand, narrow weeds or grasses do not have net-like veins and nodes that contain more leaves.  They can be flat in nature.  Moreover, broadleaf weed have seedlings that come up with two leaves.  This is not the case with grasses that can easily spring up at any given time.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =hgic.clemson.edu| date = | url =https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/broadleaf-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, grassy weeds  are so called because they spring up as desirable grasses.{{Clarify|date=April 2020}}  This makes them very hard to be identified when comparing them with broadleaf weeds.  Grassy weed  come up with blades which showcase as a single leaf from a germinated grass seed.  This makes them quite different from broadleaf weeds especially in appearance.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =The Differences Between Broadleaf and Grassy Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =cardinallawns.com| date =7 July 2016 | url =https://www.cardinallawns.com/2016/07/differences-between-broadleaf-grassy-weeds/| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Methods of controlling==\nAlthough broadleaf weeds  are known to be aggressive and tough in nature, they can still be controlled. The gardens, yards and lawns are the most common place they thrive.  There are several ways of controlling them.<ref name=\"NEWS\">{{cite news | last =Trapp | first =Abby | title =Plan a strategy for weed control |work=News-Press NOW |date=28 May 2019 | url =http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/plan-a-strategy-for-weed-control/article_d6d4f086-7db5-11e9-8117-833bed713e1d.html| accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Detecting their growth cycle===\n{{Clarify section|date=April 2020}}\nOne of the best ways of dealing with broadleaf weeds is to detect their growth cycle.  This requires proper monitoring.  Most  plants experts use this method since it has been proven to be the most effective.  It involves discovering how  broadleaf weeds grow and depriving them on that growth cycle.<ref name=\"SC\">{{cite web |title=Learn more about Broadleaf Weeds |website=sciencedirect.com |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/broadleaf-weeds |access-date=30 May 2019}}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Using a weed killer===\nIn situations where there are massive growth of broadleaf weeds, using a good weed killer can be very helpful.  This is usually the case for lawns or  yards that are overgrown with such weeds. There are several good weed killers available in the market.  It is also important to seek the advice of a  weed plant expert  when looking for a weed killer.<ref name=\"NEWS\"/>\n\n===Hand-picking===\nIn lawns, gardens or yards where there are few broadleaf weeds present, the best approach to use is hand-pulling.  This should be carried out from time to time in order to check the spread weeds.<ref name=\"SC\"/>\n\n===Lawn mowing===\nIn a thick lawn that is overgrown with broadleaf weeds, the lawn moving method is considered the best approach.  This involves the use of a lawn mower in uprooting the weed.  It can be very tedious especially in situations where there are massive growth of the broadleaf weeds.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n===Use of chemical herbicides===\nThere are chemical herbicides meant for controlling broadleaf weeds.  The use of such chemicals is often the best option when thinking of clearing the entire yard or lawn of all manner of weeds.  In most cases, the chemical content prevent the weeds from re-surfacing for several months.   The perennial types of broadleaf weeds are often controlled with chemical herbicides although they still find their way back after some months  especially when the cleared lawn or yard is  left unused for months.<ref>{{cite news |title=Broadleaf Weed Problems in Lawns |website=LawnTalk |publisher=University of Illinois Extension |url=https://extension.illinois.edu/lawntalk/weeds/broadleaf_weed_problems_in_lawns.cfm |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Shading out===\nBroadleaf weeds can be controlled by shading them out.  This involves covering the entire affected area with flat materials such as boards, nylon, plastic spread,  and the like.  When broadleaf weeds are covered that way, they lack access to sunlight and rain that speed up their growth. By so doing, they wither away.<ref name=\"TUR\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Weed]]\n* [[List of common weeds of Queensland]]\n* [[Weed control]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n\n[[Category:Garden pests]]\n[[Category:Plants and humans]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pests]]\n", "name_user": "Llunnaz", "label": "safe", "comment": "misprint", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf_weeds"}

The strip was launched in [[Polystyle Publications|Polystyle's]] ''[[TV Comic]]'' on 14 November 1964, less than a year after the television series began broadcasting and was the first original [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media from the show.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This strip began what has become known as the '[[Doctor Who Polystyle comic strip|Polystyle era]]': running from 1964 to 1979.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-11\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 11</ref> The First Doctor starred in this strip running parallel with his appearance on the television show, ending in December 1966, after which ''TV Comic'' began creating strips for the [[Second Doctor]]. The franchise to print a regular comic strip passed to ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' (then ''Doctor Who Weekly'') in 1979, and was opened up to multiple franchises in the mid-2000s. During this time, the First Doctor has made various guest appearances as well as starring in some one-off comic strips. \n\n== Polystyle comic strips (1964-1966) ==\n\n=== History ===\n\n''TV Comic'', according to ''Doctor Who'' historian Jeremy Bentham, 'had grown up in the wake of commercial television. Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThe first artist to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor) for ''TV Comic'' was Neville Main. And Main also wrote the stories - so is also the first writer to publish a non-TV based ''Doctor Who'' story. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

Just as publications like ''[[Radio Fun]]'' had blossomed during the golden years of the wireless so ''TV Comic'' began catering for young readerships who watched and liked children's programmes on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-15\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 15</ref> ''TV Comic'' - despite only having previously featured spin-offs of ITV programmes, decided to pitch for ''Doctor Who'' with the [[BBC]], and despite initial reticence from the channel, eventually struck a deal.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> The strip launched in issue 674 with a cover date of 14 November 1964; hitting the shelves - according to ''Doctor Who'' comics historian Paul Scoones - on 8 November 1964.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> This means that the ''Doctor Who'' comic strip in ''TV Comic'' was officially the first spin-off media from the show - the first novelization ''[[The_Daleks#In_print|Doctor Who in an exciting adventure with the Daleks]]'' not being released until later the same week on 12 November.<ref name=\"Scoones2012-16\">\"Scoones (2012), p. 16</ref> One immediate difference from the TV show was that the Doctor would be referred to in-strip as 'Doctor Who'.\n\nThere were other differences too. The rights to use ''Doctor Who'' applied 'then, as now' only applied to the likeness of the actor playing the Doctor and the TARDIS, and the portrayal of any other characters - be they companions or adversaries - would have been a separate negotiation and an increased cost, even prohibitive for companions who would appear in every installment.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Accordingly, the Doctor was given new companions in the first strip, \"The Klepton Parasites\", two grandchildren Gillian and John. Regarding ''Doctor Who'' foes, the situation was very similar. During the First Doctor period of the ''TV Comic'' strip, only the inhabitants of [[Vortis (Doctor Who)|Vortis]] from \"[[The Web Planet]]\" (1965) - the [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(Q\u2013Z)#Zarbi|Zarbi]] and [[List_of_Doctor_Who_universe_creatures_and_aliens_(H\u2013P)#Menoptra|Menoptra]] - made it into a story. The Doctor's greatest adversaries - the [[Dalek|Daleks]] - could not appear for another reason. This was that creator ([[Terry Nation]]) had 'a separate copyright' for the creatures, and had negotiated a deal with ''[[TV Century 21]]'' (aka ''TV21'') comics around the same time for their own strip; and copyright could 'only be held by one company at any one time' for the same format.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-17\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 17</ref> \"[[Dalek_comic_strips,_illustrated_annuals_and_graphic_novels#Comics|The Daleks]]\" strip appeared in issue 1 of ''TV21'' (23 January 1965), and ran for one hundred and four installments, each a page long, ending in issue 104 (14 January 1967).\n\n=== Writers and Artists ===\n\nThe first artist to draw the First Doctor (and thus to draw any incarnation of the Doctor) for ''TV Comic'' was Neville Main. And Main also wrote the stories - so is also the first writer to publish a non-TV based ''Doctor Who'' story. Bentham comments: 'In those days the notion of a strip having a separate writer was strictly the prerogative of American comic books'.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref> Bentham describes Main's output thus: very simplistic in style, consisting of basic line illustrations drawn in a very cartoonish way. During his 45 week stint on the strip he never quite captured the likeness of Hartnell [...] He was, however, quite an inventive storywriter.<ref name=\"BenthamDWCI-16\">\"Bentham, \"Doctor Who Comics\" (March 1982), p. 16</ref>\n\n=== List of comic strips ===\n\nThe list below is of all the First Doctor comic strips that appeared in ''TV Comic'' (''TVC'') as well the yearly ''TV Comic Holiday Special'' (''TVCHS'') and ''TV Comic Annual'' (''TVCA'').

MIT presented a course in AGI in 2018, organized by Lex Fridman and featuring a number of guest lecturers. However, as yet, most AI researchers have devoted little attention to AGI, with some claiming that intelligence is too complex to be completely replicated in the near term. However, a small number of computer scientists are active in AGI research, and many of this group are contributing to a series of [[Conference on Artificial General Intelligence|AGI conferences]].

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year. Note the logarithmic scale and exponential trendline, which assumes the computational capacity doubles every 1.1 years. Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997, Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.

The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence.

A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body).

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

It is discussed in [[artificial intelligence]] research{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} as an approach to strong AI. [[Neuroimaging]] technologies that could deliver the necessary detailed understanding are improving rapidly, and [[futurist]] Ray Kurzweil in the book ''The Singularity Is Near''<ref name=K/> predicts that a map of sufficient quality will become available on a similar timescale to the required computing power.\n\n===Early estimates ===\n[[File:Estimations of Human Brain Emulation Required Performance.svg|thumb|right|400px|Estimates of how much processing power is needed to emulate a human brain at various levels (from Ray Kurzweil, and [[Anders Sandberg]] and [[Nick Bostrom]]), along with the fastest supercomputer from [[TOP500]] mapped by year.

Kurzweil believes that mind uploading will be possible at neural simulation, while the Sandberg, Bostrom report is less certain about where [[consciousness]] arises.{{sfn|Sandberg|Bostr\u00f6m|2008}}]] For low-level brain simulation, an extremely powerful computer would be required. The [[human brain]] has a huge number of [[synapses]]. Each of the 10<sup>11</sup> (one hundred billion) [[neurons]] has on average 7,000 synaptic connections (synapses) to other neurons. It has been estimated that the brain of a three-year-old child has about 10<sup>15</sup> synapses (1 quadrillion). This number declines with age, stabilizing by adulthood. Estimates vary for an adult, ranging from 10<sup>14</sup> to 5\u00d710<sup>14</sup> synapses (100 to 500 trillion).{{sfn|Drachman|2005}} An estimate of the brain's processing power, based on a simple switch model for neuron activity, is around 10<sup>14</sup> (100 trillion) synaptic updates per second ([[SUPS]]).{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}} In 1997 Kurzweil looked at various estimates for the hardware required to equal the human brain and adopted a figure of 10<sup>16</sup> computations per second (cps).<ref>In \"Mind Children\" {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988|page=61}} 10<sup>15</sup> cps is used. More recently, in 1997, <{{cite web|url=http://www.transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=23 June 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031852/http://transhumanist.com/volume1/moravec.htm |archivedate=15 June 2006 }}> Moravec argued for 10<sup>8</sup> MIPS which would roughly correspond to 10<sup>14</sup> cps.  Moravec talks in terms of MIPS, not \"cps\", which is a non-standard term Kurzweil introduced.</ref> (For comparison, if a \"computation\" was equivalent to one \"[[FLOPS|floating point operation]]\" \u2013  a measure used to rate current [[supercomputer]]s \u2013 then 10<sup>16</sup> \"computations\" would be equivalent to 10 [[Peta-|petaFLOPS]], [[FLOPS#Performance records|achieved in 2011]]). He used this figure to predict the necessary hardware would be available sometime between 2015 and 2025, if the exponential growth in computer power at the time of writing continued.\n\n===Modelling the neurons in more detail===\nThe [[artificial neuron]] model assumed by Kurzweil and used in many current [[artificial neural network]] implementations is simple compared with [[biological neuron model|biological neurons]]. A brain simulation would likely have to capture the detailed cellular behaviour of biological [[neurons]], presently understood only in the broadest of outlines. The overhead introduced by full modeling of the biological, chemical, and physical details of neural behaviour (especially on a molecular scale) would require computational powers several orders of magnitude larger than Kurzweil's estimate.  In addition the estimates do not account for [[glial cells]], which are at least as numerous as neurons, and which may outnumber neurons by as much as 10:1, and are now known to play a role in cognitive processes.<ref name=\"Discover2011JanFeb\">{{Cite journal|author=Swaminathan, Nikhil|title=Glia\u2014the other brain cells|journal=Discover|date=Jan\u2013Feb 2011|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|access-date=24 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208071350/http://discovermagazine.com/2011/jan-feb/62|archive-date=8 February 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Current research===\nThere are some research projects that are investigating brain simulation using more sophisticated neural models, implemented on conventional computing architectures.

His results do not depend on the number of glial cells, nor on what kinds of processing neurons perform where.\n\nThe actual complexity of modeling biological neurons has been explored in [[OpenWorm|OpenWorm project]] that was aimed on complete simulation of a worm that has only 302 neurons in its neural network (among about 1000 cells in total). The animal's neural network has been well documented before the start of the project. However, although the task seemed simple at the beginning, the models based on a generic neural network did not work. Currently, the efforts are focused on precise emulation of biological neurons (partly on the molecular level), but the result cannot be called a total success yet. Even if the number of issues to be solved in a human-brain-scale model is not proportional to the number of neurons, the amount of work along this path is obvious.\n\n===Criticisms of simulation-based approaches===\nA fundamental criticism of the simulated brain approach derives from [[embodied cognition]] where human embodiment is taken as an essential aspect of human intelligence. Many researchers believe that embodiment is necessary to ground meaning.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Vega|Glenberg|Graesser|2008}}. A wide range of views in current research, all of which require grounding to some degree</ref> If this view is correct, any fully functional brain model will need to encompass more than just the neurons (i.e., a robotic body).

(The word \"mind\" has a specific meaning for philosophers, as used in \"the [[mind body problem]]\" or \"the [[philosophy of mind]]\".)\n* An artificial intelligence system can (only) ''act like'' it thinks and has a mind.\nThe first one is called \"the ''strong'' AI hypothesis\" and the second is \"the ''weak'' AI hypothesis\" because the first one makes the ''stronger'' statement: it assumes something special has happened to the machine that goes beyond all its abilities that we can test. Searle referred to the \"strong AI hypothesis\" as \"strong AI\". This usage is also common in academic AI research and textbooks.<ref>For example:\n* {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003}},\n* [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html Oxford University Press Dictionary of Psychology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203103022/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O87-strongAI.html |date=3 December 2007 }} (quoted in \"High Beam Encyclopedia\"),\n* [http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719074502/http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/phil.html |date=19 July 2008 }} (quoted in \"AITopics\")\n* [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html Planet Math] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919012830/http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/StrongAIThesis.html |date=19 September 2007 }}\n* [http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm Will Biological Computers Enable Artificially Intelligent Machines to Become Persons?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031753/http://www.cbhd.org/resources/biotech/tongen_2003-11-07.htm |date=13 May 2008 }} Anthony Tongen</ref>\n\nThe weak AI hypothesis is equivalent to the hypothesis that artificial general intelligence is possible. According to [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]], \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}\n\nIn contrast to Searle, [[Ray Kurzweil]] uses the term \"strong AI\" to describe any artificial intelligence system that acts like it has a mind,<ref name=K/> regardless of whether a philosopher would be able to determine if it ''actually'' has a mind or not.\nIn science fiction, AGI is associated with traits such as [[consciousness]], [[sentience]], [[sapience]], and [[self-awareness]] observed in living beings. However, according to Searle, it is an open question whether general intelligence is sufficient for consciousness. \"Strong AI\" (as defined above by Kurzweil) should not be confused with Searle's \"[[strong AI hypothesis]].\" The strong AI hypothesis is the claim that a computer which behaves as intelligently as a person must also necessarily have a [[mind]] and [[consciousness]]. AGI refers only to the amount of intelligence that the machine displays, with or without a mind.\n\n===Consciousness===\nThere are other aspects of the human mind besides intelligence that are relevant to the concept of strong AI which play a major role in [[science fiction]] and the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]:\n* [[consciousness]]: To have [[qualia|subjective experience]] and [[thought]].<ref>Note that [[consciousness]] is difficult to define. A popular definition, due to [[Thomas Nagel]], is that it \"feels like\" something to be conscious. If we are not conscious, then it doesn't feel like anything. Nagel uses the example of a bat: we can sensibly ask \"what does it feel like to be a bat?\" However, we are unlikely to ask \"what does it feel like to be a toaster?\" Nagel concludes that a bat appears to be conscious (i.e. has consciousness) but a toaster does not. See {{Harv|Nagel|1974}}</ref>\n* [[self-awareness]]: To be aware of oneself as a separate individual, especially to be aware of one's own thoughts.\n* [[sentience]]: The ability to \"feel\" perceptions or emotions subjectively.\n* [[sapience]]: The capacity for wisdom.\n\nThese traits have a moral dimension, because a machine with this form of strong AI may have legal rights, analogous to the [[animal rights|rights of non-human animals]]. As such, preliminary work has been conducted on approaches to integrating full ethical agents with existing legal and social frameworks. These approaches have focused on the legal position and rights of 'strong' AI.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sotala|first=Kaj|last2=Yampolskiy|first2=Roman V|date=2014-12-19|title=Responses to catastrophic AGI risk: a survey|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=90|issue=1|pages=8|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/90/1/018001|issn=0031-8949}}</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Bill Joy]], among others, argues a machine with these traits may be a threat to human life or dignity.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Why the future doesn't need us | last=Joy | first=Bill |author-link=Bill Joy | journal=Wired |date=April 2000 }}</ref> It remains to be shown whether any of these traits are [[Necessary and sufficient condition|necessary]] for strong AI. The role of [[consciousness]] is not clear, and currently there is no agreed test for its presence. If a machine is built with a device that simulates the [[neural correlates of consciousness]], would it automatically have self-awareness? It is also possible that some of these properties, such as sentience, [[Emergence|naturally emerge]] from a fully intelligent machine, or that it becomes natural to ''ascribe'' these properties to machines once they begin to act in a way that is clearly intelligent. For example, intelligent action may be sufficient for sentience, rather than the other way around.\n\n===Artificial consciousness research===\n{{Main|Artificial consciousness}}\n\nAlthough the role of consciousness in strong AI/AGI is debatable, many AGI researchers{{sfn|Yudkowsky|2006}} regard research that investigates possibilities for implementing consciousness as vital. In an early effort [[Igor Aleksander]]{{sfn|Aleksander|1996}} argued that the principles for creating a conscious machine already existed but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].\n\n==Possible explanations for the slow progress of AI research==\n{{See also|History of artificial intelligence#The problems}}\n\nSince the launch of AI research in 1956, the growth of this field has slowed down over time and has stalled the aims of creating machines skilled with intelligent action at the human level.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A possible explanation for this delay is that computers lack a sufficient scope of memory or processing power.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} In addition, the level of complexity that connects to the process of AI research may also limit the progress of AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nWhile most AI researchers believe strong AI can be achieved in the future, there are some individuals like [[Hubert Dreyfus]] and [[Roger Penrose]] who deny the possibility of achieving strong AI.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] was one of various computer scientists who believe human-level AI will be accomplished, but a date cannot accurately be predicted.{{sfn|McCarthy|2003}}\n\nConceptual limitations are another possible reason for the slowness in AI research.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} AI researchers may need to modify the conceptual framework of their discipline in order to provide a stronger base and contribution to the quest of achieving strong AI. As William Clocksin wrote in 2003: \"the framework starts from Weizenbaum's observation that intelligence manifests itself only relative to specific social and cultural contexts\".{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}}\n\nFurthermore, AI researchers have been able to create computers that can perform jobs that are complicated for people to do, but conversely they have struggled to develop a computer that is capable of carrying out tasks that are simple for humans to do ([[Moravec's paradox]]).{{Examples|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} A problem described by David Gelernter is that some people assume thinking and reasoning are equivalent.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} However, the idea of whether thoughts and the creator of those thoughts are isolated individually has intrigued AI researchers.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}\n\nThe problems that have been encountered in AI research over the past decades have further impeded the progress of AI. The failed predictions that have been promised by AI researchers and the lack of a complete understanding of human behaviors have helped diminish the primary idea of human-level AI.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}} Although the progress of AI research has brought both improvement and disappointment, most investigators have established optimism about potentially achieving the goal of AI in the 21st century.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nOther possible reasons have been proposed for the lengthy research in the progress of strong AI. The intricacy of scientific problems and the need to fully understand the human brain through psychology and neurophysiology have limited many researchers from emulating the function of the human brain into a computer hardware.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} Many researchers tend to underestimate any doubt that is involved with future predictions of AI, but without taking those issues seriously can people then overlook solutions to problematic questions.{{sfn|Goertzel|2007}}\n\nClocksin says that a conceptual limitation that may impede the progress of AI research is that people may be using the wrong techniques for computer programs and implementation of equipment.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} When AI researchers first began to aim for the goal of artificial intelligence, a main interest was human reasoning.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Researchers hoped to establish computational models of human knowledge through reasoning and to find out how to design a computer with a specific cognitive task.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}}\n\nThe practice of abstraction, which people tend to redefine when working with a particular context in research, provides researchers with a concentration on just a few concepts.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} The most productive use of abstraction in AI research comes from planning and problem solving.{{sfn|Holte|Choueiry|2003}} Although the aim is to increase the speed of a computation, the role of abstraction has posed questions about the involvement of abstraction operators.{{sfn|Zucker|2003}}\n\nA possible reason for the slowness in AI relates to the acknowledgement by many AI researchers that heuristics is a section that contains a significant breach between computer performance and human performance.{{sfn|McCarthy|2007}} The specific functions that are programmed to a computer may be able to account for many of the requirements that allow it to match human intelligence. These explanations are not necessarily guaranteed to be the fundamental causes for the delay in achieving strong AI, but they are widely agreed by numerous researchers.\n\nThere have been many AI researchers that debate over the idea whether [[affective computing|machines should be created with emotions]]. There are no emotions in typical models of AI and some researchers say programming emotions into machines allows them to have a mind of their own.{{sfn|Clocksin|2003}} Emotion sums up the experiences of humans because it allows them to remember those experiences.{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}}  David Gelernter writes, \"No computer will be creative unless it can simulate all the nuances of human emotion.\"{{sfn|Gelernter|2010}} This concern about emotion has posed problems for AI researchers and it connects to the concept of strong AI as its research progresses into the future.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2018.08.004|title=Kaplan Andreas and Haelein Michael (2019) Siri, Siri, in my hand: Who's the fairest in the land?

The most notable AI researcher to endorse the thesis is [[Stuart J. Russell]]. Endorsers of the thesis sometimes express bafflement at skeptics: Gates states he \"can't understand why some people are not concerned\",<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> and Hawking criticized widespread indifference in his 2014 editorial: {{cquote|'So, facing possible futures of incalculable benefits and risks, the experts are surely doing everything possible to ensure the best outcome, right?

Skeptics sometimes charge that the thesis is crypto-religious, with an irrational belief in the possibility of superintelligence replacing an irrational belief in an omnipotent God; at an extreme, [[Jaron Lanier]] argues that the whole concept that current machines are in any way intelligent is \"an illusion\" and a \"stupendous con\" by the wealthy.<ref name=\"atlantic-but-what\">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/but-what-does-the-end-of-humanity-mean-for-me/361931/ |title=But What Would the End of Humanity Mean for Me? |magazine=The Atlantic | date = 9 May 2014 | accessdate =12 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuch of existing criticism argues that AGI is unlikely in the short term: computer scientist [[Gordon Bell]] argues that the human race will already destroy itself before it reaches the [[technological singularity]].
