As a driver, he was a five-time [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Champion]] and a three-time winner of the [[Bathurst 1000]]. As of 2008 Johnson has claimed over twenty awards and honours,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} including the [[V8 Supercars Hall of Fame]] into which he was inducted in 2001.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Dick Johnson was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for his role as a \"sports legend\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP unsourced section |date= July 2018}}\nAs a teen Johnson attended [[Cavendish Road State High School]] in Brisbane, Australia and it was in this area of [[Coorparoo]] that he first started driving with his father as a young child. Cavendish Road State High School has named one of their school houses Johnson, in his honour. The house colour is blue.\n\nAfter leaving school, Johnson was drafted into the [[Australian Army]] at the age of 20 and began his two-year National Service in 1965. Although they did not know each other at the time, both Johnson and future touring car rival [[Peter Brock]] were stationed together at the [[Blamey Barracks]] near [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]] from 1965-1967.\n\n==Racing==\n\n[[File:D-Johnson-EH-Graham-Ruckert.jpg|thumb|left|Dick Johnson in the Holden EH at Lakeside in November 1969]]Despite becoming synonymous with driving [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]], Johnson raced in his early days in a succession of [[Holden]]s. Johnson's first race car was a [[Holden FJ]], his first race being at [[Lakeside International Raceway]] in November 1964 in 1968 and 1969 he raced his [[Holden EH]] and from there progressed to a [[Holden Torana]] GTR for 1970, scoring his first [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] points at [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] in that year. The GTR was upgraded to XU-1 specifications in 1971. Johnson's first drive in the [[Hardie Ferodo 1000]] was in Bob Forbes' [[Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1]] in [[1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1973]] when they placed fifth. Johnson then had a single race for the [[Holden Dealer Team]] at the [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] round of the [[1974 Australian Touring Car Championship|1974 ATCC]] where he finished 3rd driving a GTR XU-1. He later purchased the ex HDT Torana in which Peter Brock had won the Bathurst 1000 in 1972 from Barrie Nixon Smith and campaigned the car until his switch to Ford in 1977.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\"/> The Torana was sold to Kerry Cox who raced it in the QLD Touring car championship in a close rivalry with Dick, with Cox winning in 1977 and Dick getting the title in 1978.\n\n[[File:Johnson-xd81.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Tru-Blu Ford Falcon]]In 1980, during the [[Bathurst 1000]] he started 2nd and led for the first 17 laps before his car was spun off the track after hitting a football sized rock that had been, according to an eye-witness in 2012, accidentally kicked onto the track by one of a pair of inebriated men.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyewitness reveals how a rock changed Dick Johnson\u2019s life|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2012/10/19/eyewitness-reveals-how-the-rock-changed-dick-johnsons-life/|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=Speedcafe.com|date=19 October 2012}}</ref> The resulting public support where people from around Australia rang their local [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] television station (the race broadcaster) and pledged money to help the team get back on its feet. Eventually the sum of [[Australian dollar|A$]]72,000 was donated to help rebuild the car. Led by its CEO [[Edsel Ford II]] who saw the value of the goodwill in the press surrounding Johnson's crash, the [[Ford Motor Company of Australia]] provided a new car shell and promised to match the donation dollar for dollar, resulting in the team receiving $144,000 to help get back into racing.\n\nJohnson's close friend Ross Palmer, the owner of Palmer Tube Mills of Brisbane, became his primary sponsor in 1981 (with Bryan Byrt Ford also still a major sponsor), and with the donated money allowed him to return the next year to win both the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) and the Bathurst 1000 (with [[John French (racing driver)|John French]]). Johnson won the ATCC in a famous race-long duel with [[Peter Brock]] at the [[Lakeside International Raceway]] [[Lakeside ATCC round|round]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Mark |title=High-flying Falcons: The magic moments in almost 50 years of racing |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/highflying-falcons-the-magic-moments-in-almost-50-years-of-racing-20161006-grw2ri.html |accessdate=19 February 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 October 2016 |language=en}}</ref> He won the ATCC again in 1982 (the Tru Blu [[Ford XD Falcon|XD Falcon]]), 1984 (Greens Tuff [[Ford XE Falcon|XE Falcon]]), 1988 ([[Ford Sierra RS500]]) and 1989 (Sierra RS500). He also won Bathurst in 1989 (in a Ford Sierra with [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]) and 1994 (in an EB Falcon, also with Bowe). The names Tru Blu, and Greens Tuff, as well as Red Roo (seen in late 1982 only) were product names of Palmer Tube Mills.\n\nWith much larger budgets required in the racing industry, Ross Palmer helped negotiate for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] to be the team's primary sponsor from [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987]]. The larger budget allowed the team to expand from just one car for Dick, to a second [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] for his then team mate [[Gregg Hansford]].\n\n==NASCAR==\nIn 1989 and 1990, prompted by Palmer Tube Mills who assisted him in receiving multiple sources of sponsorship and through the company's American offshoot Redkote, Johnson made a brief foray into the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] driving a [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], entering a total of seven races with a best start of 11th at [[Sears Point Raceway]] in his first race, and a best finish of 22nd at [[Pocono Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |title=Dick Johnson |publisher=[[NASCAR]] |accessdate=15 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504223535/http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |archivedate=4 May 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> Johnson also drove a Thunderbird in the first NASCAR race held in Australia, the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500]] at the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]]. Unfortunately for Johnson he was involved in an early race crash which put him out of the event.\n\n==Retirement==\nDick Johnson retired from racing at the end of the 1999 season, though he remains in charge of DJR. He did however make a one off final appearance in front of his home crowd at the Queensland 500 in 2000 with his son [[Steven Johnson (motor racing)|Steven]] who had taken over driving Dick's famous Number 17 and continued to for over a decade after.<ref name=\"out of seat\">{{cite web| title=Steven Johnson Out of Driver's Seat at DJR| url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/02/24/steven-johnson-out-of-drivers-seat-at-djr/| publisher=speedcafe.com| accessdate=22 July 2013| date=24 February 2013}}</ref> Johnson has twice written his autobiography as well as contributing to a third biography.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\">{{cite book| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Don't Tell Me I Can't Do That| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Don_t_Tell_Me_I_Can_t_Do_That.html?id=LCpAAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y| publisher=Pan Macmillan| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=243 pages| year=2000| isbn=9780732910464}}</ref><ref name=autobiography>{{cite web| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Dick Johnson: The autobiography of a true-blue Aussie sporting legend| url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| publisher=Random House| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=432 pages| year=2013| isbn=9781742759777| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725004007/http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| archivedate=25 July 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Unforgiving Minute\">{{cite book| last=Tuckey| first=Bill| title=The Unforgiving Minute.

Johnson and co-driver John French were also wired for sound so the commentary team could talk to the drivers while racing around the track. From then on Johnson's cars were rarely without a TV camera sitting where the passenger seat usually was, especially when Seven was televising the race. His laconic commentary and seemingly endless list of one-liners quickly became a favourite with Australian race fans, even those who normally followed Holden drivers such as Peter Brock and Allan Grice, both of whom also became exponents of using racecam.\n\nSome of Johnson's quotes while on racecam were:\n* \"I've got one black [[BMW E24|BMW]] in front of me, one behind me. [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] and his [[All Blacks]]\" \u2013 [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985 ATCC]], Round 5 at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] while he was sandwiched between the black [[JPS Team BMW]]'s of [[New Zealander]]s [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Neville Crichton]]. Gardner was the JPS team manager.\n* \"The old [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo]] must have its truck suspension in\" \u2013 [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship|1986 ATCC]], Round 4 at Adelaide International. Ironically [[Robbie Francevic]]'s Volvo emerged as the race winner.\n* \"This race is like the Irishman who won the [[Tour de France]] I tell ya. He had to go on a lap of honour\" \u2013 [[1986 James Hardie 1000]]\n* \"This is where I lose so much time. I mean, this part of the track is just so boring\" \u2013 1986 Bathurst referring to his [[Ford Windsor engine|V8]] [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang's]] lack of grunt compared to his competitors on the run up [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mountain Straight]].\n* \"It's missing and carrying on like an old sheila\" \u2013 [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 ATCC]], Grand Finale at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after turbo boost problems with his championship winning [[Ford Sierra RS500]] saw him relinquish the lead mid-race to team mate [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]. With the opposition nowhere in sight, Bowe later slowed enough to allow Dick to win the race and followed him across the line in a 1\u20132 form finish.\n* \"Winton? Its like running a marathon around your clothesline\" \u2013 [[1990 Australian Touring Car Championship|1990 ATCC]], Round 4 at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] after [[ATN|Channel 7]] commentator Mike Raymond asked him what the definition of Winton was.\n* \"Then [[Peter Brock|Brock]] got past me would you believe, unfortunately, and that thing of his like, I nearly choked to death on [[Mobil|Mobil 1]]. It looks like the last train to Ferny Grove\" \u2013 1990 ATCC, Grand Finale at Oran Park after problems with the Sierra saw him drop out of race winning and championship contention. He was referring to the Peter Brock Sierra's habit of belching black oil smoke out of its exhaust whenever he lifted off the accelerator.\n* \"The Sierra on one cylinder has got as much grunt as the [[Holden Commodore SS Group A#VN SS Group A SV|Commodore]]\" \u2013 [[1991 Australian Touring Car Championship|1991 ATCC]], Round 5 at Winton after his misfiring Sierra had been passed by the [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] Holden Commodore of [[Larry Perkins]].\n* \"You've got to be joking\" \u2013 [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995 ATCC]], [[Mount Panorama ATCC sprint round|Round 3]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]]. Channel 7 had just crossed to Johnson with Mike Raymond asking \"Are you lonely?\". Johnson's quote came immediately after as he spun his [[Ford EF Falcon]] into Caltex Chase, seemingly distracted by Raymond's interruption. However, as the TV camera's soon picked up, the rear wing of the Falcon had collapsed at over {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} as he was turning into the fastest corner on any Australian race circuit, at the same moment that Seven crossed to talk to him.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ds4PU_PweU Dick Johnson rear wing snap \u2013 1995 ATCC Bathurst]</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

driver]].  As a driver, he was a five-time [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Champion]] and a three-time winner of the [[Bathurst 1000]]. As of 2008 Johnson has claimed over twenty awards and honours,{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} including the [[V8 Supercars Hall of Fame]] into which he was inducted in 2001.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, Dick Johnson was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for his role as a \"sports legend\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND\u2019S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|url-status=|access-date=24 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{BLP unsourced section |date= July 2018}}\nAs a teen Johnson attended [[Cavendish Road State High School]] in Brisbane, Australia and it was in this area of [[Coorparoo]] that he first started driving with his father as a young child. Cavendish Road State High School has named one of their school houses Johnson, in his honour. The house colour is blue.\n\nAfter leaving school, Johnson was drafted into the [[Australian Army]] at the age of 20 and began his two-year National Service in 1965. Although they did not know each other at the time, both Johnson and future touring car rival [[Peter Brock]] were stationed together at the [[Blamey Barracks]] near [[Wagga Wagga]] in [[New South Wales]] from 1965-1967.\n\n==Racing==\n\n[[File:D-Johnson-EH-Graham-Ruckert.jpg|thumb|left|Dick Johnson in the Holden EH at Lakeside in November 1969]]Despite becoming synonymous with driving [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]], Johnson raced in his early days in a succession of [[Holden]]s. Johnson's first race car was a [[Holden FJ]], his first race being at [[Lakeside International Raceway]] in November 1964 in 1968 and 1969 he raced his [[Holden EH]] and from there progressed to a [[Holden Torana]] GTR for 1970, scoring his first [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] points at [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] in that year. The GTR was upgraded to XU-1 specifications in 1971. Johnson's first drive in the [[Hardie Ferodo 1000]] was in Bob Forbes' [[Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1]] in [[1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|1973]] when they placed fifth. Johnson then had a single race for the [[Holden Dealer Team]] at the [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway|Surfers Paradise]] round of the [[1974 Australian Touring Car Championship|1974 ATCC]] where he finished 3rd driving a GTR XU-1. He later purchased the ex HDT Torana in which Peter Brock had won the Bathurst 1000 in 1972 from Barrie Nixon Smith and campaigned the car until his switch to Ford in 1977.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\"/> The Torana was sold to Kerry Cox who raced it in the QLD Touring car championship in a close rivalry with Dick, with Cox winning in 1977 and Dick getting the title in 1978.\n\n[[File:Johnson-xd81.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Tru-Blu Ford Falcon]]In 1980, during the [[Bathurst 1000]] he started 2nd and led for the first 17 laps before his car was spun off the track after hitting a football sized rock that had been, according to an eye-witness in 2012, accidentally kicked onto the track by one of a pair of inebriated men.<ref>{{cite news|title=Eyewitness reveals how a rock changed Dick Johnson\u2019s life|url=https://www.speedcafe.com/2012/10/19/eyewitness-reveals-how-the-rock-changed-dick-johnsons-life/|accessdate=6 October 2017|publisher=Speedcafe.com|date=19 October 2012}}</ref> The resulting public support where people from around Australia rang their local [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] television station (the race broadcaster) and pledged money to help the team get back on its feet. Eventually the sum of [[Australian dollar|A$]]72,000 was donated to help rebuild the car. Led by its CEO [[Edsel Ford II]] who saw the value of the goodwill in the press surrounding Johnson's crash, the [[Ford Motor Company of Australia]] provided a new car shell and promised to match the donation dollar for dollar, resulting in the team receiving $144,000 to help get back into racing.\n\nJohnson's close friend Ross Palmer, the owner of Palmer Tube Mills of Brisbane, became his primary sponsor in 1981 (with Bryan Byrt Ford also still a major sponsor), and with the donated money allowed him to return the next year to win both the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (ATCC) and the Bathurst 1000 (with [[John French (racing driver)|John French]]). Johnson won the ATCC in a famous race-long duel with [[Peter Brock]] at the [[Lakeside International Raceway]] [[Lakeside ATCC round|round]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Mark |title=High-flying Falcons: The magic moments in almost 50 years of racing |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/highflying-falcons-the-magic-moments-in-almost-50-years-of-racing-20161006-grw2ri.html |accessdate=19 February 2019 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 October 2016 |language=en}}</ref> He won the ATCC again in 1982 (the Tru Blu [[Ford XD Falcon|XD Falcon]]), 1984 (Greens Tuff [[Ford XE Falcon|XE Falcon]]), 1988 ([[Ford Sierra RS500]]) and 1989 (Sierra RS500). He also won Bathurst in 1989 (in a Ford Sierra with [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]) and 1994 (in an EB Falcon, also with Bowe). The names Tru Blu, and Greens Tuff, as well as Red Roo (seen in late 1982 only) were product names of Palmer Tube Mills.\n\nWith much larger budgets required in the racing industry, Ross Palmer helped negotiate for [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] to be the teams primary sponsor from [[1987 Australian Touring Car season|1987]]. The larger budget allowed the team to expand from just one car for Dick, to a second [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] for his then team mate [[Gregg Hansford]].\n\n==NASCAR==\nIn 1989 and 1990, prompted by Palmer Tube Mills who assisted him in receiving multiple sources of sponsorship and through the company's American offshoot Redkote, Johnson made a brief foray into the [[NASCAR Cup Series]] driving a [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]], entering a total of seven races with a best start of 11th at [[Sears Point Raceway]] in his first race, and a best finish of 22nd at [[Pocono Raceway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |title=Dick Johnson |publisher=[[NASCAR]] |accessdate=15 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050504223535/http://aolsvc.sports.aol.nascar.com/drivers/dps/djohnson02/cup/index.html |archivedate=4 May 2005 |df=dmy }}</ref> Johnson also drove a Thunderbird in the first NASCAR race held in Australia, the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500]] at the [[Calder Park Thunderdome]] in [[Melbourne]]. Unfortunately for Johnson he was involved in an early race crash which put him out of the event.\n\n==Retirement==\nDick Johnson retired from racing at the end of the 1999 season, though he remains in charge of DJR. He did however make a one off final appearance in front of his home crowd at the Queensland 500 in 2000 with his son [[Steven Johnson (motor racing)|Steven]] who had taken over driving Dick's famous Number 17 and continued to for over a decade after.<ref name=\"out of seat\">{{cite web| title=Steven Johnson Out of Driver's Seat at DJR| url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/02/24/steven-johnson-out-of-drivers-seat-at-djr/| publisher=speedcafe.com| accessdate=22 July 2013| date=24 February 2013}}</ref> Johnson has twice written his autobiography as well as contributing to a third biography.<ref name=\"Don't Tell Me\">{{cite book| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Don't Tell Me I Can't Do That| url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Don_t_Tell_Me_I_Can_t_Do_That.html?id=LCpAAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y| publisher=Pan Macmillan| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=243 pages| year=2000| isbn=9780732910464}}</ref><ref name=autobiography>{{cite web| last=Johnson| first=Dick| title=Dick Johnson: The autobiography of a true-blue Aussie sporting legend| url=http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| publisher=Random House| accessdate=22 July 2013| pages=432 pages| year=2013| isbn=9781742759777| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725004007/http://www.randomhouse.com.au/books/dick-johnson/dick-johnson-autobiography-9781742759777.aspx| archivedate=25 July 2013| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Unforgiving Minute\">{{cite book| last=Tuckey| first=Bill| title=The Unforgiving Minute.

Johnson and co-driver John French were also wired for sound so the commentary team could talk to the drivers while racing around the track. From then on Johnson's cars were rarely without a TV camera sitting where the passenger seat usually was, especially when Seven was televising the race. His laconic commentary and seemingly endless list of one-liners quickly became a favourite with Australian race fans, even those who normally followed Holden drivers such as Peter Brock and Allan Grice, both of whom also became exponents of using racecam.\n\nSome of Johnson's quotes while on racecam were:\n* \"I've got one black [[BMW E24|BMW]] in front of me, one behind me. [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] and his [[All Blacks]]\" \u2013 [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985 ATCC]], Round 5 at the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] while he was sandwiched between the black [[JPS Team BMW]]'s of [[New Zealander]]s [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Neville Crichton]]. Gardner was the JPS team manager.\n* \"The old [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo]] must have its truck suspension in\" \u2013 [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship|1986 ATCC]], Round 4 at Adelaide International. Ironically [[Robbie Francevic]]'s Volvo emerged as the race winner.\n* \"This race is like the Irishman who won the [[Tour de France]] I tell ya. He had to go on a lap of honour\" \u2013 [[1986 James Hardie 1000]]\n* \"This is where I lose so much time. I mean, this part of the track is just so boring\" \u2013 1986 Bathurst referring to his [[Ford Windsor engine|V8]] [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Ford Mustang's]] lack of grunt compared to his competitors on the run up [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mountain Straight]].\n* \"It's missing and carrying on like an old sheila\" \u2013 [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 ATCC]], Grand Finale at [[Oran Park Raceway]] after turbo boost problems with his championship winning [[Ford Sierra RS500]] saw him relinquish the lead mid-race to team mate [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]. With the opposition nowhere in sight, Bowe later slowed enough to allow Dick to win the race and followed him across the line in a 1\u20132 form finish.\n* \"Winton? Its like running a marathon around your clothesline\" \u2013 [[1990 Australian Touring Car Championship|1990 ATCC]], Round 4 at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] after [[ATN|Channel 7]] commentator Mike Raymond asked him what the definition of Winton was.\n* \"Then [[Peter Brock|Brock]] got past me would you believe, unfortunately, and that thing of his like, I nearly choked to death on [[Mobil|Mobil 1]]. It looks like the last train to Ferny Grove\" \u2013 1990 ATCC, Grand Finale at Oran Park after problems with the Sierra saw him drop out of race winning and championship contention. He was referring to the Peter Brock Sierra's habit of belching black oil smoke out of its exhaust whenever he lifted off the accelerator.\n* \"The Sierra on one cylinder has got as much grunt as the [[Holden Commodore SS Group A#VN SS Group A SV|Commodore]]\" \u2013 [[1991 Australian Touring Car Championship|1991 ATCC]], Round 5 at Winton after his misfiring Sierra had been passed by the [[Holden V8 engine|V8]] Holden Commodore of [[Larry Perkins]].\n* \"You've got to be joking\" \u2013 [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995 ATCC]], [[Mount Panorama ATCC sprint round|Round 3]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]]. Channel 7 had just crossed to Johnson with Mike Raymond asking \"Are you lonely?\". Johnson's quote came immediately after as he spun his [[Ford EF Falcon]] into Caltex Chase, seemingly distracted by Raymond's interruption. However, as the TV camera's soon picked up, the rear wing of the Falcon had collapsed at over {{Convert|280|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} as he was turning into the fastest corner on any Australian race circuit, at the same moment that Seven crossed to talk to him.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ds4PU_PweU Dick Johnson rear wing snap \u2013 1995 ATCC Bathurst]</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He is regarded by many musicologists as the greatest and most important composer of the 14th century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iHx29RlMcLEC&pg=PA90|title=The Celestial Twins: Poetry and Music Through the Ages|page=90|last=Kirby-Smith|first=Henry Tompkins|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|date=1999|isbn=1558492259}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tTxZBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|title=The History of Classical Music For Beginners|page=24|last=Endris|first=R.

Are either of these the source of this quotation?}} Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].\n\nMachaut  composed in a wide range of styles and forms. He is a part of the musical movement known as the ''[[ars nova]]''. Machaut helped develop the [[motet]] and secular song forms (particularly the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]] and the ''[[formes fixes]]'': [[rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]], [[virelai]] and [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]). Machaut wrote the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'', the earliest known complete [[Mass (music)|setting]] of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] attributable to a single composer. Some of his best-known rondeaus are \"Ma fin est mon commencement\" and \"Rose, liz, printemps, verdure\".\n\n==Life==\n\nGuillaume de Machaut was born about 1300, and educated in the region around [[Reims]]. His surname most likely derives from the nearby town of [[Machault, Ardennes|Machault]], 30&nbsp;km northeast of Reims in the [[Ardennes]] region.\nHe was employed as secretary to [[John of Bohemia|John I]], Count of [[Luxembourg]] and King of [[Bohemia]] from 1323 to 1346, and also became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] (1337). He often accompanied King John on his various trips, many of them military expeditions around Europe (including [[Prague]]). He was named the canon of [[Verdun]] in 1330, [[Arras]] in 1332, and Reims in 1337. By 1340, Machaut was living in Reims, having relinquished his other canonic posts at the request of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. In 1346, King John was killed fighting at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], and Machaut, who was famous and much in demand, entered the service of various other aristocrats and rulers, including King John's daughter [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bonne]] (who died of the [[Black Death]] in 1349), her sons [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean de Berry]] and Charles (later [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], Duke of Normandy), and others such as [[Charles II of Navarre]].{{sfn|Wimsatt & Kibler|1988|p=3\u20134}}\n\nMachaut survived the Black Death that devastated Europe, and spent his later years living in Reims composing and supervising the creation of his complete-works manuscripts. His poem ''Le voir dit'' (probably 1361\u20131365) purports to recount a late love affair with a 19-year-old girl, P\u00e9ronne d'Armenti\u00e8res, although the accuracy of the work as autobiography is contested.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Daniel Leech-Wilkinson |title=Le Voir Dit and La Messe de Nostre Dame: aspects of genre and style in late works of Machaut|journal=Plainsong and Medieval Music |year=1993 |pages=43\u201373 |doi=10.1017/S0961137100000413}}</ref> When he died in 1377, other composers such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Andrieu]] wrote elegies lamenting his death.\n\n==Poetry==\n\n{{French literature sidebar}}\n\nGuillaume de Machaut's lyric output comprises around 400 poems, including 235 ballades, 76 rondeaux, 39 virelais, 24 lais, 10 ''complaintes'', and 7 ''chansons royales'', and Machaut did much to perfect and codify these fixed forms.  Some of his lyric output is embedded in his narrative poems or \"dits\", such as ''Le rem\u00e8de de fortune'' (\"The Cure of Ill Fortune\") which includes one of each genre of lyric poetry, and ''Le voir dit'' (\"A True Story\"), but most are included in a separate, unordered section entitled ''Les loanges des dames''.  That the majority of his lyrics are not set to music (in manuscripts, music and non-music sections are separate) suggests that he normally wrote the text before setting some to music.\n\nOther than his Latin motets of a religious nature and some poems invoking the horrors of war and captivity, the vast majority of Machaut's lyric poems reflect the conventions of [[courtly love]], and involve statements of service to a lady and the poet's pleasure and pains.  In technical terms, Machaut was a master of elaborate rhyme schemes, and this concern makes him a precursor to the [[Grands Rh\u00e9toriqueurs]] of the 15th century.\n\nGuillaume de Machaut's narrative output is dominated by the \"dit\" (literally \"spoken\", i.e. a poem not meant to be sung).  These first-person [[narrative poems]] (all but one are written in [[octosyllabic]] [[rhymed couplet]]s, like the [[Medieval French literature#The Roman|romance, or \"roman\"]] of the same period) follow many of the conventions of the ''[[Roman de la rose]]'', including the use of [[allegory|allegorical]] dreams (''songes''), allegorical characters, and the situation of the narrator-lover attempting to return toward or satisfy his lady.\n\nMachaut is also the author of a poetic chronicle of the chivalric deeds of [[Pierre I de Lusignan|Peter I of Cyprus]], (the ''Prise d'Alexandrie''), and of poetic works of consolation and moral philosophy. His unusual self-reflective usage of himself (as his lyrical persona) as the narrator of his dits yields  some personal philosophical insights as well.\n\nAt the end of his life, Machaut wrote a poetic treatise on his craft (his ''Prologue''). This reflects on his conception of the organization of poetry into set genres and rhyme schemes, and the ordering of these genres into distinct sections of manuscripts. This preoccupation with ordering his ''oeuvre'' is reflected in an index to MS A entitled \"Vesci l'ordonance que G. de Machaut veut qu'il ait en son livre\" (\"Here is the order that G. de Machaut wants his book to have\").{{sfn|Earp|1989|p=461}}\n\nMachaut's poetry had a direct effect on the works of [[Eustache Deschamps]], [[Jean Froissart]], [[Christine de Pizan]], [[Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], among many others.  There exists the hypothetical (though improbable) possibility that Chaucer and Machaut could have met when Chaucer was taken prisoner near Reims in 1359, or in [[Calais]] in 1360, with both poets on official business for the ratification of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (Machaut with his patron Jean de Berry, who was departing for England, and Chaucer as a messenger to [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Prince Lionel]]).{{sfn|Hanly|2000|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2020}}}}\n\n===Example===\n{{Expand section|1=Analysis of notable features|date=February 2015}}\nThe poem below, ''Puis qu'en oubli'', is his 18th rondeau.\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|fro|Puis qu'en oubli sui de vous, dous amis,\nVie amoureuse et joie a Dieu commant.\nMar vi le jour que m'amour en vous mis,\nPuis qu'en oubli sui de vous, dous amis.\nMais ce tenray que je vous ay promis,\nC'est que ja mais n'aray nul autre amant.\nPuis qu'en oubli sui de vous, dous amis,\nVie amoureuse et joie a Dieu commant.}}\n|\nSince I am forgotten by you, sweet friend,\nTo a love life, and to happiness, I bid goodbye.\nUnlucky was the day I put my love in you,\nSince I am forgotten by you, sweet friend.\nYet I will keep what I have promised you,\nWhich is that never will I have another lover.\nSince I am forgotten by you, sweet friend,\nTo a love life, and to happiness, I bid goodbye.}}\n\n===Principal works===\n* ''Le rem\u00e8de de fortune'' (\"The Cure of Ill Fortune\") (c. 1340s, before 1357) \u2013 The narrator is asked by his lady if the poem she has found is by him; the narrator flees from her and comes to a garden where \"Hope\" consoles him and teaches him how to be a good lover; he returns to his lady.\n* ''Jugement du roy de Behaigne'' (\"Judgement of the King of Bohemia\") (before 1346) \u2013 The narrator hears a debate between a lady (whose lover is dead) and a knight (betrayed by his lady); in order to proclaim one or the other the most unhappy, the narrator seeks out the advice of the King of Bohemia who consults allegories, and the unhappy knight is declared the winner.\n* ''Dit du Lyon'' (\"Story of the Lion\") (1342) \u2013 The narrator comes to a magical island and a lion guides him to a beautiful lady; an old knight comes to the narrator and reveals the meaning of what he sees and gives him advice for being a better lover.\n* ''Dit de l'Al\u00e9rion'' aka ''Dit des quatre oiseaux'' (\"Story of the 4 Birds\") (before 1349) \u2013 A symbolic tale of love: the narrator raises four different birds, but each one flees him; one day the second (and preferred) bird comes back to him.\n* ''Jugement du roy de Navarre'' (\"Judgement of the King of Navarre\") (1349) \u2013 Following up on the ''Jugement du roy de Behainge'', a lady blames the narrator for awarding the prize to the knight: the King of Navarre is consulted and condemns the poet.\n* ''Confort d'ami'' (1357) \u2013 Dedicated to [[Charles II of Navarre]] (who was a prisoner in France), this poetic consolation gives biblical and classical examples ([[exemplum|exempla]]) of fortitude.\n* ''Dit de la fontaine amoureuse'' aka ''Livre de Morpheus'' (\"Story of the Amorous Fountain\") (1361) \u2013 The narrator meets a hopeless lover who must separate from his lady; the two men come to a magical fountain and fall asleep, and in a dream the lady consoles her lover.\n* ''Le voir dit'' (\"A True Story\") (c. 1362\u201365) \u2013 Often seen as Machaut's masterpiece,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/arts/music/orlando-consort-presents-program-of-machaut.html|title=A Love Affair That Burned for Centuries, at Least in Song|last=Oestreich|first=James R.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}</ref> this poem is an early example of [[meta-fiction]], and tells of the sadness and separation of the narrator from his lady, and of the false rumors that are spread about him.  The narrative is stuffed with prose letters and lyric poems that the narrator claims were in truth exchanged by the unhappy lovers and put in the book at the behest of his lady. The work is, however, highly satirical, and mocks the conventional paradigm of medieval courtly literature by presenting himself as an old, ill, impotent poet who becomes the lover of a young and beautiful maiden, who falls in love with him from his reputation as a poet alone. Though the work is called a ''voir dit'' or true story, Machaut includes many inconsistencies which force the reader to question the truthfulness of his story.\n* ''Prologue'' (c. 1372) \u2013 written at the end of his life as a preface to his collected works, this allegory describes Machaut's principles of poetry, music and rhetoric, as imparted to him by Nature and Love.\n* ''Prise d'Alexandrie'' (\"[[Alexandrian Crusade|The Capture of Alexandria]]\") (after 1369) \u2013 poetic retelling of the exploits of [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem and of Cyprus]].\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Guillaume de Machaut}}\n\nAs a composer of the 14th century, Machaut's secular song output includes [[monophony|monophonic]] lais and virelais, which continue, in updated forms, some of the tradition of the [[troubadour]]s.  He also worked in the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] forms of the ballade and rondeau and wrote the first complete [[Mass (music)|setting]] of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] which can be attributed to a single composer.\n\n===Secular music===\nThe lyrics of Machaut's works almost always dealt with [[courtly love]]. A few works exist to commemorate a particular event, such as M18, \"Bone Pastor/Bone Pastor/Bone Pastor.\" Machaut mostly composed in five genres: the lai, the virelai, the motet, the ballade, and the rondeau. In these genres, Machaut retained the basic ''formes fixes'', but often utilized creative text setting and [[cadence (music)|cadences]]. For example, most rondeau phrases end with a long [[melisma]] on the penultimate syllable. However, a few of Machaut's rondeaux, such as R18 \"Puis qu'en oubli\", are mostly syllabic in treatment.\n\nMachaut's motets often contain sacred texts in the tenor, such as in M12 \"Corde mesto cantando/Helas! pour quoy virent/Libera me\". The top two voices in these three-part compositions, in contrast, sing secular French texts, creating interesting concordances between the sacred and secular. In his other genres, though, he does not utilize sacred texts.\n\n===Sacred music===\n\n{{Listen|filename= Machaut - Missa Notre Dame - Kyrie.ogg|title=''Kyrie'' from the ''Messe de Nostre Dame''|description=By Guillaume de Machaut, midi instrumental version|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nMachaut's cyclic setting of the Mass, identified in one source as the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' (''Mass of Our Lady''), was composed in the early 1360s probably for [[Rheims Cathedral]].  While not the first cyclic mass \u2013 the [[Tournai Mass]] is earlier \u2013 it was the first by a single composer and conceived as a unit.  Machaut was probably familiar with the Tournai Mass since Machaut's Mass shares many stylistic features with it, including textless interludes.\n\nWhether or not Machaut's mass is indeed [[cyclic mass|cyclic]] is contested; after lengthy debate, musicologists are still deeply divided. However, there is a consensus that this mass is at best a forerunner to the later 15th-century cyclic masses by the likes of [[Josquin des Prez]]. Machaut's mass differs from these in the following ways: (1) he does not hold a [[tonal centre]] throughout the entire work, as the mass uses two distinct [[musical mode|modes]] (one for the Kyrie, Gloria, and Credo, another for Sanctus, Agnus and Ite missa est); (2) there is no extended melodic [[theme (music)|theme]] that clearly runs through all the movements, and the mass does not use the [[parody mass|parody]] technique; (3) there is considerable evidence that this mass was not composed in one creative act. The fact that the movements were placed together does not mean they were conceived as such.{{sfn|Keitel|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2014}}}}\n\nNevertheless, the mass can be said to be stylistically consistent, and certainly the chosen chants are all celebrations of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Also adding weight to the claim that the mass is cyclic is the possibility that the piece was written or assembled for performance at a specific celebration. The possibility that it was for the coronation of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], which was once widely accepted, is thought unlikely in modern scholarship. The composer's intention that the piece be performed as one entire mass setting makes the ''Messe de Nostre Dame'' generally considered a cyclic composition.\n\n==Recordings==\n*1936 \u2013 Guillaume de Machaut.

Are either of these the source of this quotation?}} Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].\n\nMachaut  composed in a wide range of styles and forms. He is a part of the musical movement known as the ''[[ars nova]]''. Machaut helped develop the [[motet]] and secular song forms (particularly the [[Lai (poetic form)|lai]] and the ''[[formes fixes]]'': [[rondeau (forme fixe)|rondeau]], [[virelai]] and [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]). Machaut wrote the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'', the earliest known complete [[Mass (music)|setting]] of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] attributable to a single composer. Some of his best-known rondeaus are \"Ma fin est mon commencement\" and \"Rose, liz, printemps, verdure\".\n\n==Life==\n\nGuillaume de Machaut was born about 1300, and educated in the region around [[Reims]]. His surname most likely derives from the nearby town of [[Machault, Ardennes|Machault]], 30&nbsp;km northeast of Reims in the [[Ardennes]] region.\nHe was employed as secretary to [[John of Bohemia|John I]], Count of [[Luxembourg]] and King of [[Bohemia]] from 1323 to 1346, and also became a [[Canon (priest)|canon]] (1337). He often accompanied King John on his various trips, many of them military expeditions around Europe (including [[Prague]]). He was named the canon of [[Verdun]] in 1330, [[Arras]] in 1332, and Reims in 1337. By 1340, Machaut was living in Reims, having relinquished his other canonic posts at the request of [[Pope Benedict XII]]. In 1346, King John was killed fighting at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], and Machaut, who was famous and much in demand, entered the service of various other aristocrats and rulers, including King John's daughter [[Bonne of Bohemia|Bonne]] (who died of the [[Black Death]] in 1349), her sons [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean de Berry]] and Charles (later [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], Duke of Normandy), and others such as [[Charles II of Navarre]].{{sfn|Wimsatt & Kibler|1988|p=3\u20134}}\n\nMachaut survived the Black Death that devastated Europe, and spent his later years living in Reims composing and supervising the creation of his complete-works manuscripts. His poem ''Le voir dit'' (probably 1361\u20131365) purports to recount a late love affair with a 19-year-old girl, P\u00e9ronne d'Armenti\u00e8res, although the accuracy of the work as autobiography is contested.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Daniel Leech-Wilkinson |title=Le Voir Dit and La Messe de Nostre Dame: aspects of genre and style in late works of Machaut|journal=Plainsong and Medieval Music |year=1993 |pages=43\u201373 |doi=10.1017/S0961137100000413}}</ref> When he died in 1377, other composers such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Andrieu]] wrote elegies lamenting his death.\n\n==Poetry==\n\n{{French literature sidebar}}\n\nGuillaume de Machaut's lyric output comprises around 400 poems, including 235 ballades, 76 rondeaux, 39 virelais, 24 lais, 10 ''complaintes'', and 7 ''chansons royales'', and Machaut did much to perfect and codify these fixed forms.  Some of his lyric output is embedded in his narrative poems or \"dits\", such as ''Le rem\u00e8de de fortune'' (\"The Cure of Ill Fortune\") which includes one of each genre of lyric poetry, and ''Le voir dit'' (\"A True Story\"), but most are included in a separate, unordered section entitled ''Les loanges des dames''.  That the majority of his lyrics are not set to music (in manuscripts, music and non-music sections are separate) suggests that he normally wrote the text before setting some to music.\n\nOther than his Latin motets of a religious nature and some poems invoking the horrors of war and captivity, the vast majority of Machaut's lyric poems reflect the conventions of [[courtly love]], and involve statements of service to a lady and the poet's pleasure and pains.  In technical terms, Machaut was a master of elaborate rhyme schemes, and this concern makes him a precursor to the [[Grands Rh\u00e9toriqueurs]] of the 15th century.\n\nGuillaume de Machaut's narrative output is dominated by the \"dit\" (literally \"spoken\", i.e. a poem not meant to be sung).  These first-person [[narrative poems]] (all but one are written in [[octosyllabic]] [[rhymed couplet]]s, like the [[Medieval French literature#The Roman|romance, or \"roman\"]] of the same period) follow many of the conventions of the ''[[Roman de la rose]]'', including the use of [[allegory|allegorical]] dreams (''songes''), allegorical characters, and the situation of the narrator-lover attempting to return toward or satisfy his lady.\n\nMachaut is also the author of a poetic chronicle of the chivalric deeds of [[Pierre I de Lusignan|Peter I of Cyprus]], (the ''Prise d'Alexandrie''), and of poetic works of consolation and moral philosophy. His unusual self-reflective usage of himself (as his lyrical persona) as the narrator of his dits yields  some personal philosophical insights as well.\n\nAt the end of his life, Machaut wrote a poetic treatise on his craft (his ''Prologue''). This reflects on his conception of the organization of poetry into set genres and rhyme schemes, and the ordering of these genres into distinct sections of manuscripts. This preoccupation with ordering his ''oeuvre'' is reflected in an index to MS A entitled \"Vesci l'ordonance que G. de Machaut veut qu'il ait en son livre\" (\"Here is the order that G. de Machaut wants his book to have\").{{sfn|Earp|1989|p=461}}\n\nMachaut's poetry had a direct effect on the works of [[Eustache Deschamps]], [[Jean Froissart]], [[Christine de Pizan]], [[Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], among many others.  There exists the hypothetical (though improbable) possibility that Chaucer and Machaut could have met when Chaucer was taken prisoner near Reims in 1359, or in [[Calais]] in 1360, with both poets on official business for the ratification of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]] (Machaut with his patron Jean de Berry, who was departing for England, and Chaucer as a messenger to [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Prince Lionel]]).{{sfn|Hanly|2000|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2020}}}}\n\n===Example===\n{{Expand section|1=Analysis of notable features|date=February 2015}}\nThe poem below, ''Puis qu'en oubli'', is his 18th rondeau.\n{{Verse translation|\n{{lang|fro|Puis qu'en oubli sui de vous, dous amis,\nVie amoureuse et joie a Dieu commant.\nMar vi le jour que m'amour en vous mis,\nPuis qu'en oubli sui de vous, dous amis.\nMais ce tenray que je vous ay promis,\nC'est que ja mais n'aray nul autre amant.\nPuis qu'en oubli sui de vous, dous amis,\nVie amoureuse et joie a Dieu commant.}}\n|\nSince I am forgotten by you, sweet friend,\nTo a love life, and to happiness, I bid goodbye.\nUnlucky was the day I put my love in you,\nSince I am forgotten by you, sweet friend.\nYet I will keep what I have promised you,\nWhich is that never will I have another lover.\nSince I am forgotten by you, sweet friend,\nTo a love life, and to happiness, I bid goodbye.}}\n\n===Principal works===\n* ''Le rem\u00e8de de fortune'' (\"The Cure of Ill Fortune\") (c. 1340s, before 1357) \u2013 The narrator is asked by his lady if the poem she has found is by him; the narrator flees from her and comes to a garden where \"Hope\" consoles him and teaches him how to be a good lover; he returns to his lady.\n* ''Jugement du roy de Behaigne'' (\"Judgement of the King of Bohemia\") (before 1346) \u2013 The narrator hears a debate between a lady (whose lover is dead) and a knight (betrayed by his lady); in order to proclaim one or the other the most unhappy, the narrator seeks out the advice of the King of Bohemia who consults allegories, and the unhappy knight is declared the winner.\n* ''Dit du Lyon'' (\"Story of the Lion\") (1342) \u2013 The narrator comes to a magical island and a lion guides him to a beautiful lady; an old knight comes to the narrator and reveals the meaning of what he sees and gives him advice for being a better lover.\n* ''Dit de l'Al\u00e9rion'' aka ''Dit des quatre oiseaux'' (\"Story of the 4 Birds\") (before 1349) \u2013 A symbolic tale of love: the narrator raises four different birds, but each one flees him; one day the second (and preferred) bird comes back to him.\n* ''Jugement du roy de Navarre'' (\"Judgement of the King of Navarre\") (1349) \u2013 Following up on the ''Jugement du roy de Behainge'', a lady blames the narrator for awarding the prize to the knight: the King of Navarre is consulted and condemns the poet.\n* ''Confort d'ami'' (1357) \u2013 Dedicated to [[Charles II of Navarre]] (who was a prisoner in France), this poetic consolation gives biblical and classical examples ([[exemplum|exempla]]) of fortitude.\n* ''Dit de la fontaine amoureuse'' aka ''Livre de Morpheus'' (\"Story of the Amorous Fountain\") (1361) \u2013 The narrator meets a hopeless lover who must separate from his lady; the two men come to a magical fountain and fall asleep, and in a dream the lady consoles her lover.\n* ''Le voir dit'' (\"A True Story\") (c. 1362\u201365) \u2013 Often seen as Machaut's masterpiece,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/arts/music/orlando-consort-presents-program-of-machaut.html|title=A Love Affair That Burned for Centuries, at Least in Song|last=Oestreich|first=James R.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2017}}</ref> this poem is an early example of [[meta-fiction]], and tells of the sadness and separation of the narrator from his lady, and of the false rumors that are spread about him.  The narrative is stuffed with prose letters and lyric poems that the narrator claims were in truth exchanged by the unhappy lovers and put in the book at the behest of his lady. The work is, however, highly satirical, and mocks the conventional paradigm of medieval courtly literature by presenting himself as an old, ill, impotent poet who becomes the lover of a young and beautiful maiden, who falls in love with him from his reputation as a poet alone. Though the work is called a ''voir dit'' or true story, Machaut includes many inconsistencies which force the reader to question the truthfulness of his story.\n* ''Prologue'' (c. 1372) \u2013 written at the end of his life as a preface to his collected works, this allegory describes Machaut's principles of poetry, music and rhetoric, as imparted to him by Nature and Love.\n* ''Prise d'Alexandrie'' (\"[[Alexandrian Crusade|The Capture of Alexandria]]\") (after 1369) \u2013 poetic retelling of the exploits of [[Peter I of Cyprus|Peter of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem and of Cyprus]].\n\n==Music==\n{{See also|List of compositions by Guillaume de Machaut}}\n\nAs a composer of the 14th century, Machaut's secular song output includes [[monophony|monophonic]] lais and virelais, which continue, in updated forms, some of the tradition of the [[troubadour]]s.  He also worked in the [[polyphony|polyphonic]] forms of the ballade and rondeau and wrote the first complete [[Mass (music)|setting]] of the [[Ordinary of the Mass]] which can be attributed to a single composer.\n\n===Secular music===\nThe lyrics of Machaut's works almost always dealt with [[courtly love]]. A few works exist to commemorate a particular event, such as M18, \"Bone Pastor/Bone Pastor/Bone Pastor.\" Machaut mostly composed in five genres: the lai, the virelai, the motet, the ballade, and the rondeau. In these genres, Machaut retained the basic ''formes fixes'', but often utilized creative text setting and [[cadence (music)|cadences]]. For example, most rondeau phrases end with a long [[melisma]] on the penultimate syllable. However, a few of Machaut's rondeaux, such as R18 \"Puis qu'en oubli\", are mostly syllabic in treatment.\n\nMachaut's motets often contain sacred texts in the tenor, such as in M12 \"Corde mesto cantando/Helas! pour quoy virent/Libera me\". The top two voices in these three-part compositions, in contrast, sing secular French texts, creating interesting concordances between the sacred and secular. In his other genres, though, he does not utilize sacred texts.\n\n===Sacred music===\n\n{{Listen|filename= Machaut - Missa Notre Dame - Kyrie.ogg|title=''Kyrie'' from the ''Messe de Nostre Dame''|description=By Guillaume de Machaut, midi instrumental version|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nMachaut's cyclic setting of the Mass, identified in one source as the ''[[Messe de Nostre Dame]]'' (''Mass of Our Lady''), was composed in the early 1360s probably for [[Rheims Cathedral]].  While not the first cyclic mass \u2013 the [[Tournai Mass]] is earlier \u2013 it was the first by a single composer and conceived as a unit.  Machaut was probably familiar with the Tournai Mass since Machaut's Mass shares many stylistic features with it, including textless interludes.\n\nWhether or not Machaut's mass is indeed [[cyclic mass|cyclic]] is contested; after lengthy debate, musicologists are still deeply divided. However, there is a consensus that this mass is at best a forerunner to the later 15th-century cyclic masses by the likes of [[Josquin des Prez]]. Machaut's mass differs from these in the following ways: (1) he does not hold a [[tonal centre]] throughout the entire work, as the mass uses two distinct [[musical mode|modes]] (one for the Kyrie, Gloria, and Credo, another for Sanctus, Agnus and Ite missa est); (2) there is no extended melodic [[theme (music)|theme]] that clearly runs through all the movements, and the mass does not use the [[parody mass|parody]] technique; (3) there is considerable evidence that this mass was not composed in one creative act. The fact that the movements were placed together does not mean they were conceived as such.{{sfn|Keitel|1982|loc={{Page needed|date=March 2014}}}}\n\nNevertheless, the mass can be said to be stylistically consistent, and certainly the chosen chants are all celebrations of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Also adding weight to the claim that the mass is cyclic is the possibility that the piece was written or assembled for performance at a specific celebration. The possibility that it was for the coronation of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], which was once widely accepted, is thought unlikely in modern scholarship. The composer's intention that the piece be performed as one entire mass setting makes the ''Messe de Nostre Dame'' generally considered a cyclic composition.\n\n==Recordings==\n*1936 \u2013 Guillaume de Machaut.

He played no part in the Munster championship winning campaign, but returned to the team for the All-Ireland semi-final with [[Donegal GAA|Donegal]] that Kerry won. Murphy was the team's captain for the All-Ireland final with [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]]. The game ended in a 2-12 to 3-09 draw, Kerry won the re-play 3-10 to 1-12 to give Murphy an All-Ireland title as captain.\n\nIn his final year at the Under 21 grade Murphy picked up a Munster title after a win over Clare in the final. Kerry later qualified for another All-Ireland final with [[Cavan GAA|Cavan]] and another win gave Murphy a second All-Ireland medal.\n\n===Junior===\n\nAfter success at Under 21 level Murphy joined the Kerry Junior side in 1997. He won a Munster title after overcoming [[Clare GAA|Clare]] in the final. [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] faced [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in the All-Ireland final. However Murphy and co came up short on a 2-08 to 1-10 scoreline.\n\nHe again lined out with the county junior side in 2000. He won a second Munster title after overcoming Clare once again. The All-Ireland final seen Kerry face another Connachat team in the shape of [[Roscommon GAA|Roscommon]]. There was to be no joy once more as Kerry lost out 0-14 to 0-11.\n\nHe again lined out in 2001 but Kerry lost out to Tipperary in the first round of the Munster championship.\n\n===Senior===\n\nMurphy first joined the [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] senior panel in 2001 as back up for [[Declan O'Keeffe]]. Murphy played during the National Football League in 2002 and 2003, but remained as the sub for the championship.\n\n2004 saw [[Jack O'Connor (GAA)|Jack O'Connor]] take over as manager of the Kerry team. He was not the only change in personnel, as Murphy replaced [[Declan O'Keeffe]] as the first-choice goalkeeper on the team after the first round of the league when Kerry had a surprise loss to [[Longford GAA|Longford]]. The year began well with Kerry reaching the final of the National League.

'The Rebels' fought back and, in a massive downpour, Kerry could only muster three points in the second period of play as Cork secured a remarkable 1-16 to 1-11 victory.  Murphy's side worked their way through to the All-Ireland semi-final where they faced Cork once again.  'The Kingdom' were much better in this encounter, however, the game ended in an astonishing draw.  Kerry won the replay after another great comeback by Cork.  An All-Ireland final appearance against Tyrone was the reward for this victory, with Murphy lining out in goals again.  An exciting game developed, one that was more competitive than the routs that had taken place at the same stage of the championship over the previous two years.  The sides were level seven times before Colm Cooper nudged Kerry 0-8 to 0-7 ahead before the interval.

The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes.  A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nA clinical or self [[breast exam]] involves feeling the breast for [[breast lump|lumps]] or other abnormalities.  Medical evidence, however, does not support its use in women with a typical risk for breast cancer.<ref name=\"Cochrane03\"/>\n\nThe use of [[mammography]] in [[universal screening]] for breast cancer is controversial as it may not reduce all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures. Many national organizations recommend it for most older women.

Mammography is a type of [[radiography]] used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms or has been called back for follow-up views (called ''diagnostic mammography''), and for medical screening of apparently healthy women (called ''screening mammography'').\n\nMammography is not very useful in finding breast tumors in dense breast tissue characteristic of women under 40 years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CdMpAAAAQBAJ|publisher = RosettaBooks|date = 2012-11-16|isbn = 9780795334306 |page = 124}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Big Squeeze: a social and political history of the controversial mammogram|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-mvwmIZZ7wC&pg=PA77|publisher = Cornell University Press|date = 2012-08-07|isbn = 978-0801465567|language = en|first = Handel|last = Reynolds | name-list-format = vanc |page = 77}}</ref> In women over 50 without dense breasts, breast cancers detected by screening mammography are usually smaller and less aggressive than those detected by patients or doctors as a breast lump.

This assertion, however, has been challenged by recent reviews which have found the significance of these net benefits to be lacking for women at average risk of dying from breast cancer.\n\n===Mechanism===\n[[File:Mammo breast cancer.jpg|thumb|right|Normal (left) versus cancerous (right) mammography image.]]\n\nScreening mammography is usually recommended to women who are most likely to develop breast cancer.  In general, this means women who have risk factors such as having a personal or family history of breast cancer or being older women, but not being [[frailty syndrome|frail elderly]] women, who are unlikely to benefit from treatment.\n\nWomen who agree to be screened have their breasts X-rayed on a specialized X-ray machine.  This exposes the woman's breasts to a small amount of [[ionizing radiation]], which has a very small, but non-zero, chance of causing cancer.\n\nThe X-ray image, called a ''radiograph'', is sent to a physician who specializes in interpreting these images, called a ''[[radiologist]]''.  The image may be on plain [[photographic film]] or [[digital mammography]] on a computer screen; despite the much higher cost of the digital systems, the two methods are generally considered equally effective.  The equipment may use a [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) system.\n\nThere is considerable variation in interpreting the images; the same image may be declared normal by one radiologist and suspicious by another.  It can be helpful to compare the images to any previously taken images, as changes over time may be significant.\n\nIf suspicious signs are identified in the image, then the woman is usually recalled for a second mammogram, sometimes after waiting six months to see whether the spot is growing, or a [[biopsy]] of the breast.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Croswell JM, Kramer BS, Kreimer AR, Prorok PC, Xu JL, Baker SG, Fagerstrom R, Riley TL, Clapp JD, Berg CD, Gohagan JK, Andriole GL, Chia D, Church TR, Crawford ED, Fouad MN, Gelmann EP, Lamerato L, Reding DJ, Schoen RE | title = Cumulative incidence of false-positive results in repeated, multimodal cancer screening | journal = Annals of Family Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 212\u201322 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19433838 | pmc = 2682972 | doi = 10.1370/afm.942 }}</ref>  Most of these will prove to be [[false positive]]s, resulting in sometimes debilitating [[anxiety]] over nothing.

The amount of each of the three types of tissue varies from woman to woman.  ''Breast density'' is a measurement of relative amounts of these three tissues in a woman's breasts, as determined by their appearance on an X-ray image.  Breast and connective tissues are radiographically denser (they produce a brighter white on an X-ray) than adipose tissue on a mammogram, so a woman with more breast tissue and/or more connective tissue is said to have greater breast density. Breast density is assessed by mammography and expressed as a percentage of the mammogram occupied by radiologically dense tissue (''percent mammographic density'' or PMD).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd NF, Martin LJ, Yaffe MJ, Minkin S | title = Mammographic density and breast cancer risk: current understanding and future prospects | journal = Breast Cancer Research | volume = 13 | issue = 6 | pages = 223 | date = 2011-11-01 | pmid = 22114898 | pmc = 3326547 | doi = 10.1186/bcr2942 }}</ref> About half of middle-aged women have dense breasts, and breasts generally become less dense as they age. Higher breast density is an independent risk factor for breast cancer.

Most women participating in mammography screening programs accept the risk of false positive recall, and the majority do not find it very distressing.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Many patients find the recall very frightening, and are intensely relieved to discover that it was a false positive, as about 90% of women do.<ref>Welch, 2011.  pp. 177\u2013178.</ref>\n\nA major effect of routine breast screening is to greatly increase the rate of early breast cancer detection, in particular for non-invasive [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS), sometimes called \"pre-breast cancer\", which almost never forms a lump and which generally cannot be detected except through mammography. While this ability to detect such very early breast malignancies is at the heart of claims that screening mammography can improve survival from breast cancer, it is also controversial. This is because a very large proportion of such cases will not progress to kill the patient, and thus mammography cannot be genuinely claimed to have saved any lives in such cases; in fact, it would lead to increased sickness and unnecessary surgery for such patients.\n\nConsequently, finding and treating many cases of DCIS represents [[overdiagnosis]] and [[overtreatment]].  Treatment is given to all women with DCIS because it is currently impossible to predict which patients with DCIS will have an indolent, non-fatal course, and which few will inevitably progress to invasive cancer and premature death if left untreated. Consequently, all patients with DCIS are treated in much the same way, with at least wide local excision, and sometimes mastectomy if the DCIS is very extensive. The cure rate for DCIS if treated appropriately is extremely high, partly because the majority of DCIS cases were harmless in the first place.\n\nThe phenomenon of finding pre-invasive malignancy or nonmalignant benign disease is commonplace in all forms of cancer screening, including [[pap smear]]s for cervical cancer, [[fecal occult blood]] testing for colon cancer, and [[prostate-specific antigen]] testing for prostate cancer. All of these tests have the potential to detect asymptomatic cancers, and all of them have a high rate of false positives and lead to invasive procedures that are unlikely to benefit the patient.\n\n==Risk-based screening==\n\nRisk-based screening uses risk assessment of a woman\u2019s five-year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer to issue personalized screening recommendations of when to start, stop, and how often to screen.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shieh Y, Eklund M, Madlensky L, Sawyer SD, Thompson CK, Stover Fiscalini A, Ziv E, Van't Veer LJ, Esserman LJ, Tice JA | title = Breast Cancer Screening in the Precision Medicine Era: Risk-Based Screening in a Population-Based Trial | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 109 | issue = 5 | pages = djw290 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28130475 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djw290 }}</ref> In general, women with low risk are recommended to screen less frequently, while screening is intensified in those at high risk.

The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes.  A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nA clinical or self [[breast exam]] involves feeling the breast for [[breast lump|lumps]] or other abnormalities.  Medical evidence, however, does not support its use in women with a typical risk for breast cancer.<ref name=\"Cochrane03\"/>\n\nThe use of [[mammography]] in [[universal screening]] for breast cancer is controversial as it may not reduce all-cause mortality and for causing harms through unnecessary treatments and medical procedures.

Mammography is a type of [[radiography]] used on the breasts. It is typically used for two purposes: to aid in the diagnosis of a woman who is experiencing symptoms or has been called back for follow-up views (called ''diagnostic mammography''), and for medical screening of apparently healthy women (called ''screening mammography'').\n\nMammography is not very useful in finding breast tumors in dense breast tissue characteristic of women under 40 years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CdMpAAAAQBAJ|publisher = RosettaBooks|date = 2012-11-16|isbn = 9780795334306 |page = 124}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Big Squeeze: a social and political history of the controversial mammogram|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-mvwmIZZ7wC&pg=PA77|publisher = Cornell University Press|date = 2012-08-07|isbn = 978-0801465567|language = en|first = Handel|last = Reynolds | name-list-format = vanc |page = 77}}</ref> In women over 50 without dense breasts, breast cancers detected by screening mammography are usually smaller and less aggressive than those detected by patients or doctors as a breast lump. This is because the most aggressive breast cancers are found in dense breast tissue, which mammograms perform poorly on.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe presumption was that by detecting cancer in an earlier stage, women will be more likely to be cured by treatment. This assertion, however, has been challenged by recent reviews which have found the significance of these net benefits to be lacking for women at average risk of dying from breast cancer.\n\n===Mechanism===\n[[File:Mammo breast cancer.jpg|thumb|right|Normal (left) versus cancerous (right) mammography image.]]\n\nScreening mammography is usually recommended to women who are most likely to develop breast cancer.  In general, this means women who have risk factors such as having a personal or family history of breast cancer or being older women, but not being [[frailty syndrome|frail elderly]] women, who are unlikely to benefit from treatment.\n\nWomen who agree to be screened have their breasts X-rayed on a specialized X-ray machine.  This exposes the woman's breasts to a small amount of [[ionizing radiation]], which has a very small, but non-zero, chance of causing cancer.\n\nThe X-ray image, called a ''radiograph'', is sent to a physician who specializes in interpreting these images, called a ''[[radiologist]]''.  The image may be on plain [[photographic film]] or [[digital mammography]] on a computer screen; despite the much higher cost of the digital systems, the two methods are generally considered equally effective.  The equipment may use a [[computer-aided diagnosis]] (CAD) system.\n\nThere is considerable variation in interpreting the images; the same image may be declared normal by one radiologist and suspicious by another.  It can be helpful to compare the images to any previously taken images, as changes over time may be significant.\n\nIf suspicious signs are identified in the image, then the woman is usually recalled for a second mammogram, sometimes after waiting six months to see whether the spot is growing, or a [[biopsy]] of the breast.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Croswell JM, Kramer BS, Kreimer AR, Prorok PC, Xu JL, Baker SG, Fagerstrom R, Riley TL, Clapp JD, Berg CD, Gohagan JK, Andriole GL, Chia D, Church TR, Crawford ED, Fouad MN, Gelmann EP, Lamerato L, Reding DJ, Schoen RE | title = Cumulative incidence of false-positive results in repeated, multimodal cancer screening | journal = Annals of Family Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 212\u201322 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19433838 | pmc = 2682972 | doi = 10.1370/afm.942 }}</ref>  Most of these will prove to be [[false positive]]s, resulting in sometimes debilitating [[anxiety]] over nothing.

Most women participating in mammography screening programs accept the risk of false positive recall, and the majority do not find it very distressing.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}  Many patients find the recall very frightening, and are intensely relieved to discover that it was a false positive, as about 90% of women do.<ref>Welch, 2011.  pp. 177\u2013178.</ref>\n\nA major effect of routine breast screening is to greatly increase the rate of early breast cancer detection, in particular for non-invasive [[ductal carcinoma in situ]] (DCIS), sometimes called \"pre-breast cancer\", which almost never forms a lump and which generally cannot be detected except through mammography. While this ability to detect such very early breast malignancies is at the heart of claims that screening mammography can improve survival from breast cancer, it is also controversial. This is because a very large proportion of such cases will not progress to kill the patient, and thus mammography cannot be genuinely claimed to have saved any lives in such cases; in fact, it would lead to increased sickness and unnecessary surgery for such patients.\n\nConsequently, finding and treating many cases of DCIS represents [[overdiagnosis]] and [[overtreatment]].  Treatment is given to all women with DCIS because it is currently impossible to predict which patients with DCIS will have an indolent, non-fatal course, and which few will inevitably progress to invasive cancer and premature death if left untreated. Consequently, all patients with DCIS are treated in much the same way, with at least wide local excision, and sometimes mastectomy if the DCIS is very extensive. The cure rate for DCIS if treated appropriately is extremely high, partly because the majority of DCIS cases were harmless in the first place.\n\nThe phenomenon of finding pre-invasive malignancy or nonmalignant benign disease is commonplace in all forms of cancer screening, including [[pap smear]]s for cervical cancer, [[fecal occult blood]] testing for colon cancer, and [[prostate-specific antigen]] testing for prostate cancer. All of these tests have the potential to detect asymptomatic cancers, and all of them have a high rate of false positives and lead to invasive procedures that are unlikely to benefit the patient.\n\n==Risk-based screening==\n\nRisk-based screening uses risk assessment of a woman\u2019s five-year and lifetime risk of developing breast cancer to issue personalized screening recommendations of when to start, stop, and how often to screen.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shieh Y, Eklund M, Madlensky L, Sawyer SD, Thompson CK, Stover Fiscalini A, Ziv E, Van't Veer LJ, Esserman LJ, Tice JA | title = Breast Cancer Screening in the Precision Medicine Era: Risk-Based Screening in a Population-Based Trial | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 109 | issue = 5 | pages = djw290 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 28130475 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djw290 }}</ref> In general, women with low risk are recommended to screen less frequently, while screening is intensified in those at high risk.

MRI can diagnose benign proliferative change, fibroadenomas, and other common benign findings at a glance, often eliminating the need for costly and unnecessary biopsies or surgical procedures.

Elementary details of the cartoon shared similarities to ''Peanuts''. The name \"Charlie Brown\" was first used there. The series also had a dog that looked much like the early 1950s version of Snoopy.{{sfn|Bang|2004|p=5}}\n\nSchulz submitted his ''Li'l Folks'' cartoons to [[United Features Syndicate]] (UFS), who responded with interest. He visited the syndicate in [[New York City]] and presented a package of new comic strips he had worked on, rather than the panel cartoons he submitted. UFS found they preferred the comic strip.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as ''Li'l Folk'', that is ''Li'l Folks'' without an 's', Tack Knight who authored the retired 1930s comic strip ''Little Folks'' sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of ''Little'' to ''Li'l'' was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that ''Little Folks'' was a registered trademark.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=218}} Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children's program ''[[Howdy Doody]]''. The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the \"Peanut Gallery\", and were referred to as \"Peanuts\". This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his consternation.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=219}}\n\nThe title ''Peanuts'' was hated by Schulz and was a source of humiliation throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having even seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named \"Peanuts\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=56}} One the day it was syndicated, Schulz's friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried ''Peanuts'', to which the newsdealer replied, \"no, and we don't have any with popcorn either\"; this event confirmed his fears concerning the title.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=87}} Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say \"I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=221}} In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to ''Charlie Brown'' on multiple occasions in the past, but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=216}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s===\n<!-- FAIR USE of First Peanuts comic.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:First Peanuts comic.png for rationale -->\n[[File:First Peanuts comic.png|thumb|500px|The first strip from October 2, 1950.

Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4.<ref>{{Comic strip reference|cartoonist=[[Charles Schulz|Schulz, Charles]]|strip=Peanuts|date=October 4, 1950|syndicate=United Feature Syndicate}}</ref> Its first [[Sunday strip]] appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became regulars of the strip did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), \"Peppermint\" Patty (August 1966), Franklin (July 1968) Woodstock (introduced April 1967; officially named June 1970), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).\n\nSchulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of ''Peanuts''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nat Gertler |authorlink=Nat Gertler |title=Dale Hale and the 'Peanuts' Comic Book: The Interview | magazine=Hogan's Alley |issue=8 |date=October 2000 |publisher=Cartoonician.com}} Republished in ''[http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/ Hogan's Alley blog]'' by Tom Heintjes, May 17, 2015.</ref> Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"<ref name=\"Masters\">''Masters of American Comics'' John Carlin Yale University Press 2005</ref> Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: \"This is not a crazy business about slinging ink.

The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or [[Rugby union ball|rugby football]]. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. <!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s is generally considered to be the \"golden age\" for ''Peanuts''.<ref name=\":0\"/> During this period, some of the strip's best-known themes and characters appeared, including Peppermint Patty,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, August 22, 1966 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/08/22|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Snoopy as the \"World War One Flying Ace\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, October 10, 1965 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/10/10|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Frieda and her \"naturally curly hair\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, March 06, 1961 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1961/03/06|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> and Franklin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, July 29, 1968 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1968/07/29|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> ''Peanuts'' is remarkable for its deft [[social commentary]], especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as assume them to be self-evident. Peppermint Patty's athletic skill and self-confidence are simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin's presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin's creation occurred at least in part as a result of Schulz's 1968 correspondence with a socially progressive fan.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes>Evon, Dan (December 24, 2015).

In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2's launch of [[Laika]] the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned [[Little League]]s and \"organized\" play when all the neighborhood kids join [[snowman]]-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.<!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n''Peanuts'' touched on religious themes on many occasions, especially during the 1960s. The classic television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' from 1965, features the character [[Linus van Pelt]] quoting the [[King James Version]] of the Bible (Luke 2:8\u201314) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', many have interpreted Schulz's work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lind |first=Stephen J. |title=Reading Peanuts: The Secular and the Sacred |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/ |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |publisher=[[ImageTexT]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first gets Charlie Brown's beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with Sally.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes/>\n\n===1970s\u20131990s===\nIn 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily ''Peanuts'' strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on [[Leap Day]] in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Later in the '90s, Schulz abandoned the characters Patty, Violet, Pig-Pen and Franklin.\n\nSchulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, even in the lettering and coloring process.<ref>Yoe, Craig, ''Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings.''

The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that ran past January 3, he had drawn five Sunday strips that had yet to run. The first of these appeared six days after the last daily, on January 9.\n\nOn February 13, 2000, the day after Schulz's death, the last-ever new ''Peanuts'' strip ran in papers. Three panels long, it began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the other end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with \"No, I think he's writing.\" The next panel shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter addressed to \"Dear Friends\". The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz's January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to fans, which reads as follows:\n\n''{{quote|Dear Friends,<br/>\n''I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years.

After ''Peanuts'' ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title ''Classic Peanuts''. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.\n\n''Peanuts'' continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of ''The Complete Peanuts'', the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and ''[[Peanuts Motion Comics]]''. Additionally, [[BOOM! Studios]] has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.\n\nUniversal Uclick's website, GoComics.com, announced on January 5, 2015 that they would be launching \"Peanuts Begins\", a feature rerunning the entire history of the strip from the beginning in colorized form.

Many are throwaway alter egos, such as a \"World-Famous\" magician, attorney, or surgeon.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}} His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while also being slightly selfish.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=391}} He has an arrogant committent to his independence, but is shown to be dependent on humans.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}} Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy's life between that of a real dog, and that of a fantastical character.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=50}} While the inside of Snoopy's doghouse is described in the strip as being adorned with paintings of [[Andrew Wyeth|Wyeth]] and [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]], it was never shown: it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of [[suspension of disbelief|suspense of disbelief]] from readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Linus and Lucy===\n{{Main|Linus van Pelt|Lucy van Pelt}}\n\nLinus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother and Lucy is the older sister.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=70}}\n\nLucy is bossy and opinionated, and is used to deliver commentary on offence and honesty, as well as sarcasm.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=196}} Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but has the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=52}} He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=45}} Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and gives psychiatric advice to another character from her \"psychiatric booth\", a booth parodying the setup of a [[lemonade stand]].{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=89}} Lucy's role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist Athar Yawar playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterised as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting \"Lucy is very much the modern doctor\".{{sfn|Yawar|2015}}\n\nLinus introduces intellectual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, and theology. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be \"very smart\" as well as \"dumb\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|pp=252\u2013253}} He has a tendency of expressing pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}} He finds psychological security from [[thumb sucking]] and holding a blanket for comfort, referred to as his \"security blanket\". The idea of his security blanket originated from Schulz's own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus' blanket as \"probably the single best thing that I ever thought of\". He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase \"security blanket\" entered the dictionary.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=91}}\n\n===Peppermint Patty and Marcie===\n{{Main|Peppermint Patty|Marcie}}\n\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends with each other. They attend a different school from Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}}\n\nPeppermint Patty is a [[tomboy]] who is forthright, loyal, and has what Schulz described as a \"devastating singleness of purpose\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that it serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepared for a skating competition, only to finally learn with disastrous results that it is for [[roller skating]] and not [[ice skating]].{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=94}} She struggles at school and with her homework, and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty's single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.{{sfn|J Schulz|2016}}\n\nMarcie is bookish, and a good student.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}} Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that \"she sees the truth in things\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as \"the unassuming one with sage-like insights\".{{sfn|Bradley|2015}}\n\n===Supporting characters===\n{{Main|List of Peanuts characters}}\n\nIn addition to the core cast, some other characters appeared regularly for a total of a majority of the strip's duration:\n* [[Sally Brown]] is the younger sister of Charlie Brown. She has a habit of fracturing the English language, to comical effect.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=175}} She reacts extremely negatively to school and homework, having to deal with dogmatic memorization and obeying ambiguous instructions. She otherwise confidently delivers speeches in oral exams, using wordplay and puns and framing her topics with theatrics and suspense.{{sfn|Wong|2018}}\n*[[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] is a boy who is a fanatic of the musical works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. In this relatively innocent role, he serves as an outlet for the expressions of other characters.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=82}} He most recognisably appears in the strip playing music on his toy piano.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|pp=158\u2013159}}\n* [[Pig-Pen]] is a boy who is very physically dirty, normally appearing with a cloud of dust surrounding him and in situations that involves dust and dirt. Schulz acknowledged that the scope of his role is limited, but he continued to make appearances because of his popularity with readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=96}}\n* [[Franklin (Peanuts)|Franklin]] is a boy who was introduced in order to fulfil [[African American]] representation in the strip, by the suggestion of a reader. Since it was Schulz's intention to achieve this without being patronizing, he is a relatively normal character, who mainly reacts to the oddness of other characters.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}\n* [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] is a non-speaking bird, and Snoopy's friend. He entirely communicates through peeps, forcing readers to guess what he says.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=171}} He is constantly aware that he is small and inconsequential, a role which serves as existential commentary on coping with being confused by the much larger world.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=176}}\n\nMany characters only made regular appearances for a short period of the strip's duration. For example: the characters Shermy, Patty and Violet constituted the core cast of characters around when the strip first syndicated.{{sfn|Inge|2000|pp=69\u201370}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=7}} By 1956, Patty and Violet's roles are described as an extension to Lucy's, and Shermy is described as merely \"an extra little boy\" to complete the cast of characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}} Another such character who was instead introduced later in the strip is Frieda, a girl with \"naturally curly hair\" who Schulz eventually removed for no longer having any comical value.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} Rerun however, the youngest brother of Linus and Lucy, was introduced to the strip with initially limited appearances, but became a foreground character by 1997.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=218}}\n\n==Reception==\nSchulz received the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Humor Comic Strip Award for ''Peanuts'' in 1962, the [[Reuben Award]] in 1955 and 1964 (the first cartoonist to receive the honor twice), the [[Elzie Segar]] Award in 1980, and the [[Milton Caniff]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' won a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy]]; ''Peanuts'' cartoon specials have received a total of two [[Peabody Award]]s and four [[Emmys]]. For his work on the strip, Schulz has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (as does Snoopy) and a place in the [[William Randolph Hearst]] Cartoon Hall of Fame. ''Peanuts'' was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article calling it \"the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898627,00.html |title=Comics: Good Grief |magazine=TIME.com |date=April 9, 1965 |accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe strip was declared second in a list of the \"greatest comics of the 20th century\" commissioned by ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' in 1999.<ref>Tom Spurgeon, Art Spiegelman, Bart Beatty et al., \"The Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century,\" ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' 210 (February 1999)</ref> The top-ranked comic was [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', a strip Schulz admired (and in fact was among his biggest inspirations), and he accepted the ranking in good grace, to the point of agreeing with it.<ref>{{cite press release | title =Fantagraphics Books to publish \"The Complete Peanuts\" by Charles M.

For example, in an essay published in the ''[[New York Press]]'' at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, \"Against Snoopy,\" [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] argued that Snoopy, and the strip's increased focus on him in the 1970s, \"went from being the strip's besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://nypress.com/against-snoopy/ |title=Against Snoopy |work=New York Press |first=Christopher |last=Caldwell |date=January 4, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nGiant [[helium]] balloons of Snoopy (seven versions), Charlie Brown (two versions), and Woodstock (two versions) have been featured in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City since 1968.

Over 40 cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared reflections on the power and influence of Schulz's art. [[Gilbert Hernandez]] wrote, \"''Peanuts'' was and still is for me a revelation. It's mostly from ''Peanuts'' where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in ''Love and Rockets''.

By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.\"<ref>\"'Dear Sparky ...

Some single-story books were produced, such as ''Snoopy and the Red Baron.'' In addition, many of the animated television specials and feature films were adapted into book form.\n\nThe primary series of reprints was published by [[Rinehart & Company]] (later [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]) beginning in 1952, with the release of a collection simply titled ''Peanuts''. This series, which presented the strips in rough chronological order (albeit with many strips omitted from each year) continued through the 1980s, after which reprint rights were handed off to various other publishers. [[Ballantine Books]] published the last original series of ''Peanuts'' reprints, including ''Peanuts 2000'', which collected the final year of the strip's run.\n\nCoinciding with these reprints were smaller paperback collections published by [[Fawcett Publications]]. Drawing material from the main reprints, this paperback series began with ''The Wonderful World of Peanuts'' in 1962 and continued through ''Lead On, Snoopy'' in 1992.\n\nCharles Schulz had always resisted republication of the earliest ''Peanuts'' strips, as they did not reflect the characters as he eventually developed them.

The first song was released as the single [[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|''Snoopy Vs.

The band would later release two more similar songs in 1967, ''Return of The Red Baron'' and ''Snoopy's Christmas''. In 1968 they recorded ''Snoopy for President''.{{sfn|Theroux|2015}}\n\n===Theater===\n[[File:Snoopy the musical otterbein university.jpg|thumb|right|Performance of ''[[Snoopy! The Musical]]'' by the [[Otterbein University]] theater group]]\nThe characters first appeared in live stage production in 1967 with the musical ''[[You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown]]'', scored by [[Clark Gesner]].

The Musical]]'', scored by [[Larry Grossman (composer)|Larry Grossman]] with lyrics by [[Hal Hackady]]. A sequel to ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'', ''Snoopy!'' is also a collection of musical sketches, though focused on Snoopy.{{sfn|Solomon|1988a}} It was first performed in San Francisco,{{sfn|Suskin|2000|p=350}} and eventually [[off-Broadway]] for 152 performances.{{sfn|Gans|2004}}\n\n''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' and ''Snoopy!!!

The Musical (TV special)|in 1988]].{{sfn|Solomon|1988a}} Going in the opposite direction from animation to live production, is the 2016 ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', based on the animated [[A Charlie Brown Christmas|television special of the same name]]. It is considered a generally faithful readaptation, although it features the additional characters Woodstock and Peppermint Patty who did not exist in the strip when the original was made.{{sfn|Jevens|2016}}\n\n==Licensing==\n===Advertising and retail===\n[[File:Snoopy Town Yokohama.jpg|thumb|left|A shop selling Snoopy-related merchandise in Yokohama, Japan. The number of different licensed items is countless.]]\nThe characters from the comic have long been [[license]]d for use on [[merchandise]], the success of the comic strip helping to create a market for such items. In 1958, the Hungerford Plastics Corporation created a set of five [[polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] dolls of the most famous characters (Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy, Linus, and Schroeder); they expanded this line in 1961 to make the dolls slightly larger and included Sally and Pig-Pen.{{sfn|Kidd|2015|p=132}} An early example of the characters appearing in promotional material was strips and illustrations drawn by Schulz for the 1955 instructional booklet for the [[Brownie (camera)|Kodak Brownie]] camera, ''The Brownie Book of Picture Taking''.{{sfn|Groth|2016|p=35}} Another early campaign was on behalf of [[Ford Motor Company]]; magazine illustrations, brochure illustrations, and animated television spots featuring the characters were used to promote the [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]] from January 1960 into 1964.{{sfn|Groth|2016|p=35}} Schulz credited the Ford campaign as the first time where licensing the characters earned \"a lot of money\". However, he expressed a dislike of illustrating the adverts, describing it as \"hard work\" and would have preferred to dedicate equivalent effort to drawing the [[Sunday comics|Sunday format]] strips. {{sfn|Inge|2000|p=253}}\n\nSome licensing relationships were maintained long-term. Hallmark began printing greetings cards and party goods featuring the characters in 1960.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} In the late 1960s, [[Sanrio]] held the licensing rights in Japan for Snoopy. Sanrio is best known for [[Hello Kitty]] and its focus on the [[kawaii]] segment of the Japanese market.{{sfn|Gomez|2004}} Beginning in 1985, the characters were made mascots and served as spokespeople for the [[MetLife]] insurance company, with the intention to make the business \"more friendly and approachable\".{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}} Schulz justified the licensing relationship with MetLife as necessary to financially support his philanthropic work, although refused to openly describe the exact details of the work he was financing.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=254}} In 2016 the 31-year licensing relationship with MetLife ended.{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}}\n\nIn 1999 it was estimated that there were 20,000 different new products each year adorning a variety of licensed items, such as: clothing, plush toys of Snoopy, [[vacuum flask|Thermos bottle]]s, lunch boxes, picture frames, and music boxes.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} The familiarity of the characters also proved lucrative for advertising material in both print and television,{{sfn|Elliott|2000}} appearing on products such as [[Dolly Madison]] snack cakes, [[Chex Mix]] snacks, [[Bounty (brand)|Bounty]] paper towels, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] macaroni cheese and [[A&W Root Beer]].{{sfn|Bankston|2000}}\n\nThe sheer extent to which the characters have been used in licensed material is a subject of criticism against Schulz. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pointed out that \"some critics [say] Schulz was distracted by marketing demands, and his characters had become caricatures of themselves by shilling for Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dolly Madison cupcakes and others.\"{{sfn|Tawa|2000}} Schulz reasoned that his approach to licensing was in fact modest, stating \"our [licensing] program is built upon characters who are figuratively alive\" and \"we're not simply stamping these characters out on the sides of products just to sell products\" while also adding \"Snoopy is so versatile he just seems to be able to fit into any role and it just works. It's not that we're out to clutter the market with products. In fact anyone saying we're overdoing it is way off base because actually we are underdoing it\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=103}}\n\n===Games===\nThe Peanuts characters have appeared in various video games, such as ''[[Snoopy (video game)|Snoopy]]'' in 1984 by Radarsoft, ''Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game'' by The Edge, ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular]]'' (1989, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]), ''[[Snoopy's Magic Show]]'' (1990, [[Game Boy]]), ''[[Snoopy Tennis]]'' (2001, [[Game Boy Color]]), ''[[Snoopy Concert]]'' which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the [[Super NES]], and in October 2006, a second game titled ''[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (video game)|Snoopy vs. The Red Baron]]'' by [[Namco Bandai]] for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the ''[[Snoopy the Flying Ace]]'' mobile phone game by Namco Networks. In November 2015, ''[[Snoopy's Town Tale]]'' was launched for mobile by [[Pixowl]], featuring the entire Peanuts gang along with Snoopy and Charlie Brown.\n\nIn 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the [[Funk & Wagnalls]] publishing house also produced a children's encyclopedia called the ''Charlie Brown's 'Cyclopedia''. The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.\n\nIn April 2002, [[List of licensed and localized editions of Monopoly: USA#P|The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly]] board game was released by USAopoly. The game was dedicated to Schulz in memory of his passing.\n\n===Amusement parks===\n[[File:Snoopy_Bounce_at_Cedar_Point_Camp_Snoopy_entrance_(1572).jpg|thumb|right|Camp Snoopy, at Cedar Point]]\nIn 1983, [[Knott's Berry Farm]], in Southern California, was the first theme park to license the ''Peanuts'' characters, creating the first [[Camp Snoopy]] area and making Snoopy the park's mascot. Knott's expanded its operation in 1992 by building an indoor amusement park in the [[Mall of America]], called ''[[Nickelodeon Universe|Knott's Camp Snoopy]]''. The Knott's theme parks were acquired by the national amusement park chain [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]] in 1997, which continued to operate ''Knott's Camp Snoopy'' park until the mall took over its operation in March 2005.<ref>{{Citation |title=Mall of America strikes deal with Nickelodeon for theme park |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-03-06-mall-of-america-nickelodeon_N.htm |accessdate=October 12, 2007 | date=March 7, 2007 |work=USA Today}}</ref> Cedar Fair had already licensed the ''Peanuts'' characters for use in 1992 as an atmosphere,<ref>{{Citation |last=Munarriz |first=Rick Aristotle |title=Is Pixar Worth $7 Billion to Disney? |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2006/01/24/is-pixar-worth-7-billion-to-disney.aspx |accessdate=October 12, 2007}}</ref> so its acquisition of Knott's Berry Farm did not alter the use of those characters.\n\nSnoopy is currently the official mascot of all the Cedar Fair parks. It was previously used in all of the park logos but it has since been removed. Cedar Fair also operated a Camp Snoopy area at [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], [[Worlds of Fun]], and [[Valleyfair]] featuring various ''Peanuts''-themed attractions until 2011. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at [[Cedar Point]] and Knott's Berry Farm.\n\nIn 2008, [[Cedar Point]] introduced [[Planet Snoopy]], a children's area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children's rides relocated from Cedar Point's sister park [[Geauga Lake]] after its closing. The rides are inspired by Peanuts characters. The area also consists of a \"Kids Only\" restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe (there is a small menu for adults). In 2010, the [[Nickelodeon Central]] and [[Nickelodeon Universe]] areas in the former [[Paramount Parks]] ([[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion]], and [[Kings Island]]) were replaced by [[Planet Snoopy]]. In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to [[Valleyfair]], [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], and [[Worlds of Fun]], replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. Planet Snoopy is now at every Cedar Fair park beside Knott's Berry Farm and [[Michigan's Adventure]]. In 2018 Planet Snoopy was renamed Camp Snoopy & renovations were made to make these areas of the Cedar Fair parks look more like a camp. Many of the rides were renamed as well.\n\nAlso, the ''Peanuts'' characters can be found at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Hello Kitty]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schulzmuseum.org/universal-studios-japan/ |title=Charles M.

And finally, an example from a strip on October 24, 1999 where Lucy tells Rerun Van Pelt to do the football gag for her, and it is unknown if he disobeyed her or not.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* Although the TV documentary \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" from 1963 never aired, the first peanuts music album, released in 1964 was titled \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" and had the music from the documentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin|50em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bang|first=Derrick|title=Vince Guaraldi at the Piano|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5902-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Chip |last2=Spear |first2=Geoff |title=Only What's Necessary: Charles M.

UFS found they preferred the comic strip.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=146}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} When UFS was preparing to syndicate the comic strip as ''Li'l Folk'', that is ''Li'l Folks'' without an 's', Tack Knight who authored the retired 1930s comic strip ''Little Folks'' sought to claim exclusive rights to the title being used. Schulz argued in a letter to Knight that the contraction of ''Little'' to ''Li'l'' was intended to avoid this conflict, but conceded that the final decision would be for the syndicate. A different name for the comic strip became necessary after legal advice confirmed that ''Little Folks'' was a registered trademark.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=218}} Meanwhile, the production manager of UFS noted the popularity of the children's program ''[[Howdy Doody]]''. The show featured an audience of children who were seated in the \"Peanut Gallery\", and were referred to as \"Peanuts\". This inspired the decided title that was forced upon Schulz, to his consternation.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=219}}\n\nThe title ''Peanuts'' was hated by Schulz and was a source of humiliation throughout his life. He accused the production manager at UFS of not having even seen the comic strip before giving it a title, and said that the title would only make sense if there was a character named \"Peanuts\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=56}} One the day it was syndicated, Schulz's friend visited a news stand in uptown Minneapolis and asked if there were any newspapers that carried ''Peanuts'', to which the newsdealer replied, \"no, and we don't have any with popcorn either\"; this event confirmed his fears concerning the title.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=87}} Whenever Schulz was asked what he did for a living, he would evade mentioning the title and say \"I draw that comic strip with Snoopy in it, Charlie Brown and his dog\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=221}} In 1997 Schulz said that he had discussed changing the title to ''Charlie Brown'' on multiple occasions in the past, but found that it would ultimately cause problems with licensees who already incorporated the existing title into their products, with unnecessary expenses involved for all downstream licensees to change it.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=216}}\n\n==History==\n\n===1950s===\n<!-- FAIR USE of First Peanuts comic.png: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:First Peanuts comic.png for rationale -->\n[[File:First Peanuts comic.png|thumb|500px|The first strip from October 2, 1950.

Shermy lauds Charlie Brown as he walks by, but then tells Patty how he hates him in the final panel. Snoopy was also an early character in the strip, first appearing in the third strip, which ran on October 4.<ref>{{Comic strip reference|cartoonist=[[Charles Schulz|Schulz, Charles]]|strip=Peanuts|date=October 4, 1950|syndicate=United Feature Syndicate}}</ref> Its first [[Sunday strip]] appeared January 6, 1952, in the half-page format, which was the only complete format for the entire life of the Sunday strip. Most of the other characters that eventually became regulars of the strip did not appear until later: Violet (February 1951), Schroeder (May 1951), Lucy (March 1952), Linus (September 1952), Pig-Pen (July 1954), Sally (August 1959), Frieda (March 1961), \"Peppermint\" Patty (August 1966), Franklin (July 1968) Woodstock (introduced April 1967; officially named June 1970), Marcie (July 1971), and Rerun (March 1973).\n\nSchulz decided to produce all aspects of the strip himself from the script to the finished art and lettering. Schulz did, however, hire help to produce the comic book adaptations of ''Peanuts''.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Nat Gertler |authorlink=Nat Gertler |title=Dale Hale and the 'Peanuts' Comic Book: The Interview | magazine=Hogan's Alley |issue=8 |date=October 2000 |publisher=Cartoonician.com}} Republished in ''[http://cartoonician.com/dale-hale-and-the-peanuts-comic-book-the-interview/ Hogan's Alley blog]'' by Tom Heintjes, May 17, 2015.</ref> Thus, the strip was able to be presented with a unified tone, and Schulz was able to employ a minimalistic style. Backgrounds were generally not used, and when they were, Schulz's frazzled lines imbued them with a fraught, psychological appearance. This style has been described by art critic John Carlin as forcing \"its readers to focus on subtle nuances rather than broad actions or sharp transitions.\"<ref name=\"Masters\">''Masters of American Comics'' John Carlin Yale University Press 2005</ref> Schulz held this belief all his life, reaffirming in 1994 the importance of crafting the strip himself: \"This is not a crazy business about slinging ink.

The art was cleaner, sleeker, and simpler, with thicker lines and short, squat characters. For example, in these early strips, Charlie Brown's famous round head is closer to the shape of an American football or [[Rugby union ball|rugby football]]. Most of the kids were initially fairly round-headed. As another example, all the characters (except Charlie Brown) had their mouths longer and had smaller eyes when they looked sideways. <!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s is generally considered to be the \"golden age\" for ''Peanuts''.<ref name=\":0\"/> During this period, some of the strip's best-known themes and characters appeared, including Peppermint Patty,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, August 22, 1966 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1966/08/22|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Snoopy as the \"World War One Flying Ace\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, October 10, 1965 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1965/10/10|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> Frieda and her \"naturally curly hair\",<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, March 06, 1961 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1961/03/06|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> and Franklin.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Peanuts by Charles Schulz, July 29, 1968 Via @GoComics|url = http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1968/07/29|website = GoComics|accessdate = November 14, 2015}}</ref> ''Peanuts'' is remarkable for its deft [[social commentary]], especially compared with other strips appearing in the 1950s and early 1960s. Schulz did not explicitly address racial and gender equality issues so much as assume them to be self-evident. Peppermint Patty's athletic skill and self-confidence are simply taken for granted, for example, as is Franklin's presence in a racially integrated school and neighborhood. (Franklin's creation occurred at least in part as a result of Schulz's 1968 correspondence with a socially progressive fan.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes>Evon, Dan (December 24, 2015).

In 1958, a strip in which Snoopy tossed Linus into the air and boasted that he was the first dog ever to launch a human parodied the hype associated with Sputnik 2's launch of [[Laika]] the dog into space earlier that year. Another sequence lampooned [[Little League]]s and \"organized\" play when all the neighborhood kids join [[snowman]]-building leagues and criticize Charlie Brown when he insists on building his own snowmen without leagues or coaches.<!--need facts for the entire paragraph-->\n\n''Peanuts'' touched on religious themes on many occasions, especially during the 1960s. The classic television special ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' from 1965, features the character [[Linus van Pelt]] quoting the [[King James Version]] of the Bible (Luke 2:8\u201314) to explain to Charlie Brown what Christmas is all about (in personal interviews, Schulz mentioned that Linus represented his spiritual side). Because of the explicit religious material in ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'', many have interpreted Schulz's work as having a distinct Christian theme, though the popular perspective has been to view the franchise through a secular lens.<ref>{{Citation |last=Lind |first=Stephen J. |title=Reading Peanuts: The Secular and the Sacred |url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/imagetext/archives/v4_2/lind/ |accessdate=August 31, 2010 |publisher=[[ImageTexT]]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the week of July 29, 1968, Schulz debuted the African-American character Franklin to the strip, at the urging of white Los Angeles schoolteacher Harriet Glickman. Though Schulz feared that adding a black character would be seen as patronizing to the African-American community, Glickman convinced him that the addition of black characters could help normalize the idea of friendships between children of different ethnicities. Franklin appeared in a trio of strips set at a beach, in which he first gets Charlie Brown's beach ball from the water and subsequently helps him build a sand castle, during which he mentions that his father is in Vietnam. He never occupies the same panel, however, with Sally.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}<ref name=Snopes/>\n\n===1970s\u20131990s===\nIn 1975, the panel format was shortened slightly horizontally, and shortly thereafter the lettering became larger to compensate. Previously, the daily ''Peanuts'' strips were formatted in a four-panel \"space saving\" format beginning in the 1950s, with a few very rare eight-panel strips, that still fit into the four-panel mold. Beginning on [[Leap Day]] in 1988, Schulz abandoned the four-panel format in favor of three-panel dailies and occasionally used the entire length of the strip as one panel, partly for experimentation, but also to combat the dwindling size of the comics page.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Later in the '90s, Schulz abandoned the characters Patty, Violet, Pig-Pen and Franklin.\n\nSchulz drew the strip for nearly 50 years, with no assistants, even in the lettering and coloring process.<ref>Yoe, Craig, ''Clean Cartoonists' Dirty Drawings.''

Schulz]]\n\nThe final daily original ''Peanuts'' comic strip was published on Monday, January 3, 2000. The strip contained a note to the readers of the strip from Schulz and a drawing of Snoopy, with his trusty typewriter, sitting atop his doghouse deep in thought. Beginning the next day, a rerun package premiered in papers that had elected to pick it up (see below). Although Schulz did not draw any daily strips that ran past January 3, he had drawn five Sunday strips that had yet to run. The first of these appeared six days after the last daily, on January 9.\n\nOn February 13, 2000, the day after Schulz's death, the last-ever new ''Peanuts'' strip ran in papers. Three panels long, it began with Charlie Brown answering the phone with someone on the other end presumably asking for Snoopy. Charlie Brown responded with \"No, I think he's writing.\" The next panel shows Snoopy sitting at his typewriter with the opening to a letter addressed to \"Dear Friends\". The final panel features a large blue sky background over which several drawings from past strips are placed. Underneath those drawings is a colorized version of Schulz's January 3 strip, with almost the same note he wrote to fans, which reads as follows:\n\n''{{quote|Dear Friends,<br/>\n''I have been fortunate to draw Charlie Brown and his friends for almost fifty years. It has been the fulfillment of my childhood ambition.<br/>\n''Unfortunately, I am no longer able to maintain the schedule demanded by a daily comic strip.

After ''Peanuts'' ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title ''Classic Peanuts''. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips in the package, however, come from the 1960s.\n\n''Peanuts'' continues to be prevalent in multiple media through widespread syndication, the publication of ''The Complete Peanuts'', the release of several new television specials (all of which Schulz had worked on, but had not finished, before his death), and ''[[Peanuts Motion Comics]]''. Additionally, [[BOOM! Studios]] has published a series of comic books that feature new material by new writers and artists, although some of it is based on classic Schulz stories from decades past, as well as including some classic strips by Schulz, mostly Sunday color strips.\n\nUniversal Uclick's website, GoComics.com, announced on January 5, 2015 that they would be launching \"Peanuts Begins\", a feature rerunning the entire history of the strip from the beginning in colorized form.

He is the main character, acting as the center of the strip's world and serving as an [[everyman]].{{sfn|Boxer|2015}}{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Warner|2018}} While seen as decent, considerate, and reflective, he is also awkward, deeply sensitive, and said to suffer from an [[inferiority complex]]. Charlie Brown is a constant failure: he can never win a ballgame; he can never successfully build a kite.{{sfn|Eco|1963}}{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} His sense of determination regardless of the certainty of failure can either be interpreted as self-defeating stubbornness, or admirable persistence. When he fails however, he experiences pain and anguish through self-pity.{{sfn|Yawar|2015}} The journalist [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] observed this tension between Charlie Brown's negative and positive attitudes, stating: \"What makes Charlie Brown such a rich character is that he's not purely a loser. The self-loathing that causes him so much anguish is decidedly not self-effacement. Charlie Brown is optimistic enough to think he can earn a sense of self-worth[.]\"{{sfn|Caldwell 2000}} Schulz named Charlie Brown after a colleague of his while working at [[Art Instruction Schools|Art Instruction]], whose full name was Charlie Francis Brown.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=38}}\n\nReaders and critics have explored the question as to whether Schulz based Charlie Brown on himself. This question often carried the suggestion that the emotionally sensitive and depressed behaviour of Charlie Brown drew from Schulz's own life or childhood experiences.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=5}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=44}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Commenting on the tendency of these conclusions being drawn, Schulz said in a 1968 interview that \"I think of myself as Charles Schulz. But if someone wants to believe I'm really Charlie Brown, well, it makes a good story.\"{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=62}} He explained in another interview that the comic strip as a whole is a personal expression, and so it is impossible to avoid all the characters presenting aspects of his personality.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=66}} Biographer David Michaelis made a similar conclusion, describing Charlie Brown as simply representing Schulz's \"wishy-washiness and determination\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=258}} Regardless, some profiles of Schulz confidently held that Charlie Brown was based on him.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=65}}\n\nSnoopy is a dog, who later in the development of the strip would be described as a [[beagle]].{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=387}} While generally behaving like a real dog and having a non-speaking role, he connects to readers through having human thoughts.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=389}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=172}} He introduces fantasy elements to the strip by extending his identity through alter egos. Many are throwaway alter egos, such as a \"World-Famous\" magician, attorney, or surgeon.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}} His character is a mixture of innocence and egotism; he possesses childlike joy, while also being slightly selfish.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}}{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=391}} He has an arrogant committent to his independence, but is shown to be dependent on humans.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=390}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=59}} Schulz was careful in balancing Snoopy's life between that of a real dog, and that of a fantastical character.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=50}} While the inside of Snoopy's doghouse is described in the strip as being adorned with paintings of [[Andrew Wyeth|Wyeth]] and [[Vincent Van Gogh|Van Gogh]], it was never shown: it would have demanded an inappropriate kind of [[suspension of disbelief|suspense of disbelief]] from readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=25}}\n\n===Linus and Lucy===\n{{Main|Linus van Pelt|Lucy van Pelt}}\n\nLinus and Lucy are siblings; Linus is the younger brother and Lucy is the older sister.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=70}}\n\nLucy is bossy and opinionated, and is used to deliver commentary on offence and honesty, as well as sarcasm.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=196}} Schulz described Lucy as full of misdirected confidence, but has the virtue of being capable of cutting right down to the truth.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=52}} He said that Lucy is mean because it is funny, particularly because she is a girl: he posited that a boy being mean to girls would not be funny at all, describing a pattern in comic strip writing where it is comical when supposedly weak characters dominate supposedly strong characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=45}} Lucy at times acts as a psychiatrist and gives psychiatric advice to another character from her \"psychiatric booth\", a booth parodying the setup of a [[lemonade stand]].{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=89}} Lucy's role as a psychiatrist has attracted attention from real-life individuals in the field of psychology; the psychiatrist Athar Yawar playfully identified various moments in the strip where her activities could be characterised as pursuing medical and scientific interests, commenting \"Lucy is very much the modern doctor\".{{sfn|Yawar|2015}}\n\nLinus introduces intellectual and reflective elements to the strip. He offers opinions on topics such as literature, art, and theology. He possesses a sense of morality and ethical judgment that enables him to navigate topics such as faith, intolerance, and depression. Schulz enjoyed the adaptability of his character, remarking he can be \"very smart\" as well as \"dumb\".{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|pp=252\u2013253}} He has a tendency of expressing pompous ideas that are quickly rebuked.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=47}} He finds psychological security from [[thumb sucking]] and holding a blanket for comfort, referred to as his \"security blanket\". The idea of his security blanket originated from Schulz's own observation of his first three children, who carried around blankets. Schulz described Linus' blanket as \"probably the single best thing that I ever thought of\". He was proud of its versatility for visual humor in the strip, and with how the phrase \"security blanket\" entered the dictionary.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}}{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=91}}\n\n===Peppermint Patty and Marcie===\n{{Main|Peppermint Patty|Marcie}}\n\nPeppermint Patty and Marcie are two girls who are friends with each other. They attend a different school from Charlie Brown, on the other side of town, and so represent a slightly different social circle from the other characters.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}}\n\nPeppermint Patty is a [[tomboy]] who is forthright, loyal, and has what Schulz described as a \"devastating singleness of purpose\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} She frequently misunderstands things, to the extent that it serves as the premise of many individual strips and stories; in one story she prepared for a skating competition, only to finally learn with disastrous results that it is for [[roller skating]] and not [[ice skating]].{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=94}} She struggles at school and with her homework, and often falls asleep in school. The wife of Charles Schulz, Jean Schulz, suggested that this is the consequence of how Peppermint Patty's single father works late; she stays awake at night waiting for him. In general, Charles Schulz imagined that some of her problems were from having an absent mother.{{sfn|J Schulz|2016}}\n\nMarcie is bookish, and a good student.{{sfn|Boylan|2019}} Schulz described her as relatively perceptive compared to other characters, stating that \"she sees the truth in things\".{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=174}} The writer Laura Bradley identified her role as \"the unassuming one with sage-like insights\".{{sfn|Bradley|2015}}\n\n===Supporting characters===\n{{Main|List of Peanuts characters}}\n\nIn addition to the core cast, some other characters appeared regularly for a total of a majority of the strip's duration:\n* [[Sally Brown]] is the younger sister of Charlie Brown. She has a habit of fracturing the English language, to comical effect.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=175}} She reacts extremely negatively to school and homework, having to deal with dogmatic memorization and obeying ambiguous instructions. She otherwise confidently delivers speeches in oral exams, using wordplay and puns and framing her topics with theatrics and suspense.{{sfn|Wong|2018}}\n*[[Schroeder (Peanuts)|Schroeder]] is a boy who is a fanatic of the musical works of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. In this relatively innocent role, he serves as an outlet for the expressions of other characters.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=82}} He most recognisably appears in the strip playing music on his toy piano.{{sfn|Michaelis|2007|p=254}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|pp=158\u2013159}}\n* [[Pig-Pen]] is a boy who is very physically dirty, normally appearing with a cloud of dust surrounding him and in situations that involves dust and dirt. Schulz acknowledged that the scope of his role is limited, but he continued to make appearances because of his popularity with readers.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=96}}\n* [[Franklin (Peanuts)|Franklin]] is a boy who was introduced in order to fulfil [[African American]] representation in the strip, by the suggestion of a reader. Since it was Schulz's intention to achieve this without being patronising, he is a relatively normal character, who mainly reacts to the oddness of other characters.{{sfn|Gertler|2012}}\n* [[Woodstock (Peanuts)|Woodstock]] is a non-speaking bird, and Snoopy's friend. He entirely communicates through peeps, forcing readers to guess what he says.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=171}} He is constantly aware that he is small and inconsequential, a role which serves as existential commentary on coping with being confused by the much larger world.{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=176}}\n\nMany characters only made regular appearances for a short period of the strip's duration. For example: the characters Shermy, Patty and Violet constituted the core cast of characters around when the strip first syndicated.{{sfn|Inge|2000|pp=69\u201370}}{{sfn|Inge|2010|p=7}} By 1956, Patty and Violet's roles are described as an extension to Lucy's, and Shermy is described as merely \"an extra little boy\" to complete the cast of characters.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=7}} Another such character who was instead introduced later in the strip is Frieda, a girl with \"naturally curly hair\" who Schulz eventually removed for no longer having any comical value.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=171}} Rerun however, the youngest brother of Linus and Lucy, was introduced to the strip with initially limited appearances, but became a foreground character by 1997.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=218}}\n\n==Reception==\nSchulz received the [[National Cartoonists Society]] Humor Comic Strip Award for ''Peanuts'' in 1962, the [[Reuben Award]] in 1955 and 1964 (the first cartoonist to receive the honor twice), the [[Elzie Segar]] Award in 1980, and the [[Milton Caniff]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999. ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' won a [[Peabody Award]] and an [[Emmy]]; ''Peanuts'' cartoon specials have received a total of two [[Peabody Award]]s and four [[Emmys]]. For his work on the strip, Schulz has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (as does Snoopy) and a place in the [[William Randolph Hearst]] Cartoon Hall of Fame. ''Peanuts'' was featured on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' on April 9, 1965, with the accompanying article calling it \"the leader of a refreshing new breed that takes an unprecedented interest in the basics of life.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,898627,00.html |title=Comics: Good Grief |magazine=TIME.com |date=April 9, 1965 |accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe strip was declared second in a list of the \"greatest comics of the 20th century\" commissioned by ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' in 1999.<ref>Tom Spurgeon, Art Spiegelman, Bart Beatty et al., \"The Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century,\" ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' 210 (February 1999)</ref> The top-ranked comic was [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', a strip Schulz admired (and in fact was among his biggest inspirations), and he accepted the ranking in good grace, to the point of agreeing with it.<ref>{{cite press release | title =Fantagraphics Books to publish \"The Complete Peanuts\" by Charles M.

For example, in an essay published in the ''[[New York Press]]'' at the time of the final daily strip in January 2000, \"Against Snoopy,\" [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] argued that Snoopy, and the strip's increased focus on him in the 1970s, \"went from being the strip's besetting artistic weakness to ruining it altogether\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://nypress.com/against-snoopy/ |title=Against Snoopy |work=New York Press |first=Christopher |last=Caldwell |date=January 4, 2000}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nGiant [[helium]] balloons of Snoopy (seven versions), Charlie Brown (two versions), and Woodstock (two versions) have been featured in the annual [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City since 1968.

By sharing those feelings with us, Schulz showed us a vital aspect of our common humanity, which is, it seems to me, the ultimate goal of great art.\"<ref>\"'Dear Sparky ...

This series, which presented the strips in rough chronological order (albeit with many strips omitted from each year) continued through the 1980s, after which reprint rights were handed off to various other publishers. [[Ballantine Books]] published the last original series of ''Peanuts'' reprints, including ''Peanuts 2000'', which collected the final year of the strip's run.\n\nCoinciding with these reprints were smaller paperback collections published by [[Fawcett Publications]].

Sanrio is best known for [[Hello Kitty]] and its focus on the [[kawaii]] segment of the Japanese market.{{sfn|Gomez|2004}} Beginning in 1985, the characters were made mascots and served as spokespeople for the [[MetLife]] insurance company, with the intention to make the business \"more friendly and approachable\".{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}} Schulz justified the licensing relationship with MetLife as necessary to financially support his philanthropic work, although refused to openly describe the exact details of the work he was financing.{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=254}} In 2016 the 31-year licensing relationship with MetLife ended.{{sfn|Hauser|Maheshwari|2016}}\n\nIn 1999 it was estimated that there were 20,000 different new products each year adorning a variety of licensed items, such as: clothing, plush toys of Snoopy, [[vacuum flask|Thermos bottle]]s, lunch boxes, picture frames, and music boxes.{{sfn|Boxer|2000}} The familiarity of the characters also proved lucrative for advertising material in both print and television,{{sfn|Elliott|2000}} appearing on products such as [[Dolly Madison]] snack cakes, [[Chex Mix]] snacks, [[Bounty (brand)|Bounty]] paper towels, [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]] macaroni cheese and [[A&W Root Beer]].{{sfn|Bankston|2000}}\n\nThe sheer extent to which the characters have been used in licensed material is a subject of criticism against Schulz. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' pointed out that \"some critics [say] Schulz was distracted by marketing demands, and his characters had become caricatures of themselves by shilling for Metropolitan Life Insurance, Dolly Madison cupcakes and others.\"{{sfn|Tawa|2000}} Schulz reasoned that his approach to licensing was in fact modest, stating \"our [licensing] program is built upon characters who are figuratively alive\" and \"we're not simply stamping these characters out on the sides of products just to sell products\" while also adding \"Snoopy is so versatile he just seems to be able to fit into any role and it just works. It's not that we're out to clutter the market with products. In fact anyone saying we're overdoing it is way off base because actually we are underdoing it\".{{sfn|Inge|2000|p=103}}\n\n===Games===\nThe Peanuts characters have appeared in various video games, such as ''[[Snoopy (video game)|Snoopy]]'' in 1984 by Radarsoft, ''Snoopy: The Cool Computer Game'' by The Edge, ''Snoopy and the Red Baron'' for the [[Atari 2600]], ''[[Snoopy's Silly Sports Spectacular]]'' (1989, [[Nintendo Entertainment System]]), ''[[Snoopy's Magic Show]]'' (1990, [[Game Boy]]), ''[[Snoopy Tennis]]'' (2001, [[Game Boy Color]]), ''[[Snoopy Concert]]'' which was released in 1995 and sold to the Japanese market for the [[Super NES]], and in October 2006, a second game titled ''[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (video game)|Snoopy vs. The Red Baron]]'' by [[Namco Bandai]] for the PlayStation 2. In July 2007, the Peanuts characters appeared in the ''[[Snoopy the Flying Ace]]'' mobile phone game by Namco Networks. In November 2015, ''[[Snoopy's Town Tale]]'' was launched for mobile by [[Pixowl]], featuring the entire Peanuts gang along with Snoopy and Charlie Brown.\n\nIn 1980 (with a new edition published in 1990), the [[Funk & Wagnalls]] publishing house also produced a children's encyclopedia called the ''Charlie Brown's 'Cyclopedia''. The 15-volume set features many of the Peanuts characters.\n\nIn April 2002, [[List of licensed and localized editions of Monopoly: USA#P|The Peanuts Collectors Edition Monopoly]] board game was released by USAopoly. The game was dedicated to Schulz in memory of his passing.\n\n===Amusement parks===\n[[File:Snoopy_Bounce_at_Cedar_Point_Camp_Snoopy_entrance_(1572).jpg|thumb|right|Camp Snoopy, at Cedar Point]]\nIn 1983, [[Knott's Berry Farm]], in Southern California, was the first theme park to license the ''Peanuts'' characters, creating the first [[Camp Snoopy]] area and making Snoopy the park's mascot. Knott's expanded its operation in 1992 by building an indoor amusement park in the [[Mall of America]], called ''[[Nickelodeon Universe|Knott's Camp Snoopy]]''. The Knott's theme parks were acquired by the national amusement park chain [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company]] in 1997, which continued to operate ''Knott's Camp Snoopy'' park until the mall took over its operation in March 2005.<ref>{{Citation |title=Mall of America strikes deal with Nickelodeon for theme park |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2007-03-06-mall-of-america-nickelodeon_N.htm |accessdate=October 12, 2007 | date=March 7, 2007 |work=USA Today}}</ref> Cedar Fair had already licensed the ''Peanuts'' characters for use in 1992 as an atmosphere,<ref>{{Citation |last=Munarriz |first=Rick Aristotle |title=Is Pixar Worth $7 Billion to Disney? |url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2006/01/24/is-pixar-worth-7-billion-to-disney.aspx |accessdate=October 12, 2007}}</ref> so its acquisition of Knott's Berry Farm did not alter the use of those characters.\n\nSnoopy is currently the official mascot of all the Cedar Fair parks. It was previously used in all of the park logos but it has since been removed. Cedar Fair also operated a Camp Snoopy area at [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], [[Worlds of Fun]], and [[Valleyfair]] featuring various ''Peanuts''-themed attractions until 2011. There is still a Camp Snoopy area at [[Cedar Point]] and Knott's Berry Farm.\n\nIn 2008, [[Cedar Point]] introduced [[Planet Snoopy]], a children's area where Peanuts Playground used to be. This area consists of family and children's rides relocated from Cedar Point's sister park [[Geauga Lake]] after its closing. The rides are inspired by Peanuts characters. The area also consists of a \"Kids Only\" restaurant called Joe Cool Cafe (there is a small menu for adults). In 2010, the [[Nickelodeon Central]] and [[Nickelodeon Universe]] areas in the former [[Paramount Parks]] ([[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Kings Dominion]], and [[Kings Island]]) were replaced by [[Planet Snoopy]]. In 2011, Cedar Fair announced it would also add Planet Snoopy to [[Valleyfair]], [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]], and [[Worlds of Fun]], replacing the Camp Snoopy areas. Planet Snoopy is now at every Cedar Fair park beside Knott's Berry Farm and [[Michigan's Adventure]]. In 2018 Planet Snoopy was renamed Camp Snoopy & renovations were made to make these areas of the Cedar Fair parks look more like a camp. Many of the rides were renamed as well.\n\nAlso, the ''Peanuts'' characters can be found at [[Universal Studios Japan]] in the Universal Wonderland section along with the characters from ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Hello Kitty]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schulzmuseum.org/universal-studios-japan/ |title=Charles M.

And finally, an example from a strip on October 24, 1999 where Lucy tells Rerun Van Pelt to do the football gag for her, and it is unknown if he disobeyed her or not.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n* Although the TV documentary \"A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" from 1963 never aired, the first peanuts music album, released in 1964 was titled \"Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown\" and had the music from the documentary.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n\n\n<br />\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n'''Books'''\n{{refbegin|50em}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bang|first=Derrick|title=Vince Guaraldi at the Piano|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5902-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Chip |last2=Spear |first2=Geoff |title=Only What's Necessary: Charles M.

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

Several prominent mills closed down, leaving between 40,000 and 50,000 people without a source of income, and many moved into informal settlements in the city center. The [[Amdavad Municipal Corporation|Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]] (AMC), the governing and administrative body of the city, simultaneously lost much of its tax base and saw an increased demand for services. In the 1990s, newly emerging pharmaceutical, chemical, and automobile manufacturing industries required skilled labor, so many migrants seeking work ended up in the informal sector and settled in slums.<ref name=\":0\">Bhatkal, Tanvi, William Avis, and Susan Nicolai. \"A Cautionary Tale of Progress in Ahmedabad,\" n.d., 48.</ref>\n\nAhmedabad has been relatively successful in its efforts to reduce poverty and improve the living conditions of poor residents. The urban poverty rate has declined from 28% in 1993\u20131994 to 10% in 2011\u20132012.<ref name=\":0\" /> This is partly due to the strengthening of the AMC and its partnership with several civil society organizations (CSOs) representing poor residents. Through several projects and programs (see below), the AMC has provided utilities and basic services to slums. However, there are challenges that remain, and there are still many residents who lack access to sanitation, improved water, and electricity. Riots, often rooted in religious tensions, threaten the stability of neighborhoods and have caused spatial segregation across religious and caste lines. Finally, the conception of pro-poor, inclusive development is being overshadowed by a national initiative promoting the creation of 'global cities' of capital investment and technological innovation. This has shifted priorities towards constructing new housing and attracting private development rather than servicing the urban poor.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Informal Housing/Slums ====\nAs of 2011, about 66% of the population lives in formal housing. The other 34% lives in slums or ''chawls'', which are tenements for industrial workers. There are approximately 700 slum settlements in Ahmedabad, and 11% of the total housing stock is public housing. The population of Ahmedabad has increased while the housing stock has remained basically constant, and this has led to densification of both formal and informal housing and a more economical use of existing space. The Indian census estimates that the Ahmedabad slum population was 25.6% of the total population in 1991 and decreased to 4.5% in 2011, but these numbers are contested and local entities maintain that the census underestimates informal populations. There is a consensus that there has been a reduction in the percentage of the population who lives in slum settlements, and a general improvement in living conditions for slum residents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Slum Networking Project ====\nIn the 1990s, the AMC faced increased slum populations. They found that residents were willing and able to pay for legal connections to water, sewage, and electricity, but because of tenure issues they were paying higher prices for low-quality, informal connections. To address this, beginning in 1995, the AMC partnered with civil society organizations to create the Slum Networking Project (SNP) to improve basic services in 60 slums, benefitting approximately 13,000 households.<ref name=\":0\" /> This project, also known as ''Parivartan (Change)'', involved [[participatory planning]] in which slum residents were partners alongside AMC, private institutions, microfinance lenders, and local NGOs. The goal of the program was to provide both physical infrastructure (including water supply, sewers, individual toilets, paved roads, storm drainage, and tree planting) and community development (i.e. the formation of resident associations, women's groups, community health interventions, and vocational training).<ref name=\":1\">World Bank. 2007.

The project cost a total of Rs. 4350 million. Community members and the private sector each contributed Rs. 600 million, NGOs provided Rs. 90 million, and the AMC paid for the rest of the project.<ref name=\":1\" /> Each slum household was responsible for no more than 12% of the cost of upgrading their home.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis project has generally been regarded as a success. Having access to basic services increased the residents' working hours, since most worked out of their homes. It also reduced the incidence of illness, particularly water-borne illness, and increased children's rates of school attendance.<ref>SEWA Academy (2002) ''Parivartan and its impact: A Partnership Programme of Infrastructure Development in Slums of Ahmedabad City.''

There is no mechanism to remove players, so there are always 14 players in the game.\n\nThe goal of the game is to bring a player to the opponent's side with the ball.\n\nOpponents take [[Game mechanics#Turns|turns]] and can optionally take three actions during their turn in any order: two moves and one ball throw. A move is to move one player just one horizontal or vertical space.\n\nThe player with the ball can throw his ball to another player of his team who is located in the vertical line, the horizontal line or a diagonal line and if no opposing player is in the way. As in [[team handball|handball]], the player with the ball cannot move while he has the ball. So to move, the ball holder must pass to one of his partners. Moves can only be made in the horizontal or vertical direction and only if the destination is unoccupied. Moving diagonally requires two moves, since one must move horizontally, then vertically, in two stages (as such one cannot move diagonally between two pieces).\n\n=== Anti-game rule ===\nOpponents need to bring at least one of their players to the other side. If all players of a team are adjacent, one per column, the adverse team cannot reach the adverse side, because they form an uncrossable line. The \"anti-game\" rule dissuades opponents to make an uncrossable line. In practice the \"anti-game\" rule specifies that if an opponent puts its players in an uncrossable line and at least three opposing players are adjacent to this line, then the opponent players [[Game mechanics|wins]].\n\n== Variant ==\nWith the variant configuration, it is possible to attack very quickly.\n\n== Strategy ==\nAt each turn, the number of possible actions averages between 200 and 1,000.
