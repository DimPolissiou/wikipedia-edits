Early models include the '''Virus A''', '''Virus B''', and '''Virus C''' series, each available in various hardware configurations. In November 2005, the '''Virus TI''' series was released, including the 61-key '''Virus TI Keyboard''' and the 37-key '''Virus TI Polar'''. A small desktop model was released in February 2008 called the '''Virus TI Snow'''. A revision of the '''TI''' series called '''TI2''' came out in March 2009, featuring faster [[digital signal processing|digital signal processing (DSP)]], greater polyphony, more effects in the effect section and a slightly changed design. The Virus series also has come out with two software plugin versions: TDM for [[Pro Tools]] and [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] for [[TC Electronic]] Powercore series. The term ''Access Virus'' can be used to refer to any one of these synthesizers.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\nThe Access Virus employs various synthesis techniques, including [[subtractive synthesis]], [[phase distortion synthesis|phase distortion (PD) synthesis]], [[frequency modulation synthesis|frequency modulation (FM) synthesis]], and starting with the TI series, [[wavetable synthesis]].\n\nAll of the Viruses are [[Digital signal processor|DSP]]-powered, virtual analog synthesizers.  They have analog-style [[oscillator]]s which can be tuned continuously from a pure [[sine wave]] to a [[square wave]] (with variable pulse-width modulation), as well as 63 \"spectral\" waveforms which are entirely synthetic, non-analog style waves. Oscillator waveforms may be modulated in a number of ways: ring modulation (AM), phase distortion (PD), or Frequency Modulation (FM). The Virus has a Matrix Modulation specification. With the TI series, two new oscillator models were added: [https://media.sweetwater.com/store/media/access_virustisnow_reference.pdf Hypersaw and wavetable.] \n\nThe [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] section is programmable, with two independent resonant filters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may98/articles/access.html|title=Access Virus|work=Sound on Sound|date=May 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607012025/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may98/articles/access.html|archivedate=7 June 2015}}</ref> which can be combined and modulated in various ways. The Matrix Modulation specification allows for the creation of complex and detailed sounds. The Virus features a filter saturation stage as well as different types of digital and analog-style distortion.\n\n== Series comparisons ==\n\nThe Virus has had three major hardware revisions since the original Virus A model as well as having numerous features (both minor and major) added via [[firmware]] [[operating system]] updates. The Virus engine largely remained the same from the Virus A up until the Virus C. They all utilize a single [[Motorola]] [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] chip and the sound is quite distinct between models when not factoring in the additional features provided by each hardware and firmware upgrade. The biggest effect of software optimisation is seen as a third oscillator control in the B-series menus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb00/articles/accesvirus.htm|title=Access Virus B|work=Sound On Sound|date=February 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609080757/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb00/articles/accesvirus.htm|archivedate=9 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Virus TI utilizes two DSP chips and represented the most significant technical overhaul of the Virus series since its inception.\n\nThe Virus TI series allows for a very wide emulation of past and present synthesizers. It is a digital synthesizer but can emulate the characteristic sound and behaviour of analogue synthesizers whilst also retaining some digital features.  Wavetable synthesis for example can only be found on a few other synthesizers, the PPG Wave series and Waldorf machines being notable examples. What separates the Virus's VA module from other analogue modelling synths in its price range is its twin multimode filter design and extensive modulation matrix. As of the Virus B OS4 update, it has three oscillators per voice (+1 sub oscillator per voice) with two filters per voice. \n\nThe basic Virus analogue modeled oscillators between the Virus A and TI are identical with the only difference being the number of voices available as well as the additional Hypersaw oscillator and digital [[wavetable synthesis|wavetable]] oscillators of the Virus TI. Additionally, the raw Virus oscillators have much less high frequency content than the oscillators found on other subtractive virtual analogues such as the [[Clavia Nord Lead]] and [[Roland JP-8000]]. This partially explains the Virus's characteristically{{whom?|date=January 2012}} dark and bass heavy sound.\n\nThe highly resonant twin multimode filter is also an important aspect{{whom?|date=January 2012}} of the Virus sound, the features of which have been extended in the Ti range to include [[granular synthesis|grain table]], [[comb filter|comb]] and [[formant]] filter settings.\n\nBoth Virus filters can be connected in series, parallel or set to process two oscillators independently. The routable nature of the filter allows the Virus to emulate an 18 dB/octave 3-pole filter for instance, by routing a 24dB/octave 4-pole filter in series with a 12dB/octave 2-pole filter, then turning the filter balance to 3 or 9 o'clock. Connecting a 4-pole filter in series with a 2-pole filter also allows for a 36dB/octave 6-pole filter configuration, which is unique amongst similarly priced virtual analogues. The interchangeable filters allow for such things as simultaneous high pass and low pass sweeps and filter modulation effects such as automated filter sweeps whilst still leaving a filter free for manual use.\n\nEvery parameter on the control surface of the synth and every parameter in every sub menu can be set as a modulation destination. The Virus also has a list of modulation sources, including a random trigger. There are three modulation sources on the Virus A and B, which can be set to control six destinations. The Virus C and TI both allow for six modulation sources controlling a possible 18 modulation destinations. This does not include the three LFOs which can be set to modulate oscillators 1 and 2, pulse width, resonance and cutoff of both filters, stereo pan and any parameter set as a source in the modulation matrix, simultaneously if desired. \n\nIt is possible to emulate the unstable tuning of analogue synthesizers by setting a random source to modulate the pitch and detune of one or more oscillators, so that every time a note is played, its tuning will be very subtly different.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The modulation matrix also allows for recursive modulation - setting a variable to modulate itself. This plays an important role in altering the behaviour of many of the control variables on the synth. For example, the Virus amplifier attack envelope is linear by default but can be changed via setting the amplifier envelope as a modulation source that modulates itself as its destination.\n\nThe Virus also has a complement of DSP effects, including a [[distortion]] unit that allows for rectification, analogue modelled and digital distortion, as well as bit-reducing and sample rate-reducing effects. The Virus C and TI also includes a 3-band [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]. \n\nLastly, the Virus has always been 16 parts [[multitimbral]] for multilayered patches and ensemble performances. However, up until the Virus TI, this aspect of the Virus has been severely flawed and is often considered unusable because of the polyphonic limitations of the Virus A, B and C.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nThe programming methodology for a Virus A is largely the same as that of a Virus TI and so are the bulk of the sounds produced. However, the additional oscillators, higher polyphony, extra filter type, the EQ and revised control surface and sequencer integration of the TI allow for a greater palette of possible sounds over previous revisions. There were hardware alterations made to the TI such as the balanced inputs/outputs, 24 bit/96&nbsp;kHz output and the new sequencer integrated interface.\n\nThe Virus TI Snow was unveiled at Winter [[NAMM]] 2008. It is a stripped-down version of the TI Desktop and is patch compatible with the rest of the TI line.  It is much smaller, sporting a minimalist interface and utilizes a single DSP chip, giving it about half the polyphony and only four parts of multitimbral capability.\n\n== Notable users ==\n\nThe Access Virus has been used extensively by trance and techno artists, including [[Headhunterz]], [[Hardwell]], [[Angerfist]], [[Luca Anzilotti]] a.k.a.

Early models include the '''Virus A''', '''Virus B''', and '''Virus C''' series, each available in various hardware configurations. In November 2005, the '''Virus TI''' series was released, including the 61-key '''Virus TI Keyboard''' and the 37-key '''Virus TI Polar'''. A small desktop model was released in February 2008 called the '''Virus TI Snow'''. A revision of the '''TI''' series called '''TI2''' came out in March 2009, featuring greater polyphony, more effects in the effect section and a slightly changed design. The Virus series also has come out with two software controller plugin versions: TDM for [[Pro Tools]] and [[Virtual Studio Technology|VST]] for [[TC Electronic]] Powercore series. The term ''Access Virus'' can be used to refer to any one of these synthesizers.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\nThe Access Virus employs various synthesis techniques, including [[subtractive synthesis]], [[phase distortion synthesis|phase distortion (PD) synthesis]], [[frequency modulation synthesis|frequency modulation (FM) synthesis]], and starting with the TI series, [[wavetable synthesis]].\n\nAll of the Viruses are [[Digital signal processor|DSP]]-controlled, analog synthesizers.  They have [[oscillator]]s which can be tuned continuously from a pure [[sine wave]] to a [[square wave]] (with variable pulse-width modulation), as well as 63 \"spectral\" waveforms which are entirely synthetic,analog style waves. Oscillator waveforms may be modulated in a number of ways: ring modulation (AM), phase distortion (PD), or Frequency Modulation (FM). The Virus has a Matrix Modulation specification. With the TI series, two new oscillator models were added: [https://media.sweetwater.com/store/media/access_virustisnow_reference.pdf Hypersaw and wavetable.] \n\nThe [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]] section is programmable, with two independent analogue resonant filters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may98/articles/access.html|title=Access Virus|work=Sound on Sound|date=May 1998|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607012025/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/may98/articles/access.html|archivedate=7 June 2015}}</ref> which can be combined and modulated in various ways. The Matrix Modulation specification allows for the creation of complex and detailed sounds.\n\n== Series comparisons ==\n\nThe Virus has had three major hardware revisions since the original Virus A model as well as having numerous features (both minor and major) added via [[firmware]] [[operating system]] updates. The Virus engine largely remained the same from the Virus A up until the Virus C. They all utilize a single [[Motorola]] [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] chip controller.\n\nThe Virus TI utilizes two DSP chips controllers and represented the most significant technical overhaul of the Virus series since its inception.\n\nThe Virus TI series allows for a very wide emulation of past and present synthesizers. It has  Wavetable synthesis for example can only be found on a few other synthesizers, the PPG Wave series and Waldorf machines being notable examples. What separates the Virus's VA module from other analogue modelling synths in its price range is its twin multimode filter design and extensive modulation matrix. As of the Virus B OS4 update, it has three oscillators per voice (+1 sub oscillator per voice) with two filters per voice. \n\nThe basic Virus analogue oscillators between the Virus A and TI are identical with the only difference being the number of voices available as well as the additional Hypersaw oscillator and analog[[wavetable synthesis|wavetable]] oscillators of the Virus TI. Additionally, the raw Virus oscillators have much less high frequency content than the oscillators found on subtractive virtual analogues such as the [[Clavia Nord Lead]] and [[Roland JP-8000]]. This partially explains the Virus's characteristically{{whom?|date=January 2012}} dark and bass heavy sound.\n\nThe highly resonant twin multimode analog filter is also an important aspect{{whom?|date=January 2012}} of the Virus sound, the features of which have been extended in the Ti range to include [[granular synthesis|grain table]], [[comb filter|comb]] and [[formant]] filter settings.\n\nBoth Virus filters can be connected in series, parallel or set to process two oscillators independently. The routable nature of the filter allows the Virus to emulate an 18 dB/octave 3-pole filter for instance, by routing a 24dB/octave 4-pole filter in series with a 12dB/octave 2-pole filter, then turning the filter balance to 3 or 9 o'clock. Connecting a 4-pole filter in series with a 2-pole filter also allows for a 36dB/octave 6-pole filter configuration. The interchangeable filters allow for such things as simultaneous high pass and low pass sweeps and filter modulation effects such as automated filter sweeps whilst still leaving a filter free for manual use.\n\nEvery parameter on the control surface of the synth and every parameter in every sub menu can be set as a modulation destination. The Virus also has a list of modulation sources, including a random trigger. There are three modulation sources on the Virus A and B, which can be set to control six destinations. The Virus C and TI both allow for six modulation sources controlling a possible 18 modulation destinations. This does not include the three LFOs which can be set to modulate oscillators 1 and 2, pulse width, resonance and cutoff of both filters, stereo pan and any parameter set as a source in the modulation matrix, simultaneously if desired. \n\n\n\nThe Virus also has a complement of effects, including a [[distortion]] unit that allows for rectification, analogue and digital distortion, as well as bit-reducing and sample rate-reducing effects. The Virus C and TI also includes a 3-band [[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]. \n\nLastly, the Virus has always been 16 parts [[multitimbral]] for multilayered patches and ensemble performances.

The 15-year-old princess of ancient Egypt, she ends up sucked into a portal that sends her 30,000 years into the future where she learns she is the prophesied \"Savior of the Nile Galaxy\", destined to defeat the evil space tyrant Octavian. She ends up attending the futuristic intergalactic academy named P.Y.R.A.M.I.D to obtain the proper training and skills to fulfill her role. She is sometimes reckless and impulsive, but has a good heart and wants peace. She has also gained strange and powerful powers from her time-travel, which manifests in pink and can be used to drain energy and project it into energy waves and beams. \n* Akila ([[Katie Crown]]) - A pink-eyed fish girl from another planet, and the first of Cleopatra's teammates. She is very friendly and optimistic.\n* Brian ([[Jorge Diaz (actor)|Jorge Diaz]]) - A cyborg teenage boy, and Cleopatra's second teammate. His body is mostly robotic and is also sensitive of the fact that he was transformed into a cyborg. He is rather worrisome and paranoid at times. He has a crush on Akila. \n* Khensu ([[Sendhil Ramamurthy]]) - An intelligent, long-eared cat with the ability to speak. He serves as the leader of the group, and a teacher at P.Y.R.A.M.I.D.\n\n===P.Y.R.A.M.I.D.===\n* Callie ([[Kari Wahlgren]]) - A arrogant and snobby student at P. Y. R. A. M. I. D who becomes Cleopatra's academic rival upon her arrival in the school. \n* Zuzz ([[Zach Callison]])\n* Zaid ([[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]]) - A student at P. Y. R. A. M. I. D, whom Cleopatra is attracted to.

There is some canonical circuitry within the cortex; for example, pyramidal neurons in the upper layers II and III project their [[axons]] to other areas of neocortex, while those in the deeper layers V and VI often project out of the cortex, e.g. to the [[thalamus]], [[brainstem]], and [[spinal cord]]. Neurons in layer IV receive the majority of the [[synapse|synaptic connections]] from outside the cortex (mostly from thalamus), and themselves make short-range, local connections to other cortical layers.<ref name=\"Noback; Strominger; Demarest; Ruggiero 2005\"/> Thus, layer IV is the main recipient of incoming sensory information and distributes it to the other layers for further processing.\n\n===Cortical columns===\n\nThe neocortex is often described as being arranged in vertical structures called [[cortical columns]], patches of neocortex with a diameter of roughly 0.5&nbsp;mm (and a depth of 2&nbsp;mm, i.e., spanning all six layers). These columns are often thought of as the basic repeating functional units of the neocortex, but their many definitions, in terms of anatomy, size, or function, are generally not consistent with each other, leading to a lack of consensus regarding their structure or function or even whether it makes sense to try to understand neocortex in terms of columns.<ref name=\"Horton 2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Horton JC, Adams DL | title = The cortical column: a structure without a function | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The neocortex is divided, into regions demarcated by the cranial sutures in the skull above, into [[frontal lobe|frontal]], [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[occipital lobe|occipital]], and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the [[primary visual cortex]], and the temporal lobe contains the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. In humans, the [[frontal lobe]] contains areas devoted to abilities that are enhanced in or unique to our species, such as complex language processing localized to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ([[Broca's area]]).<ref name=\"Noback; Strominger; Demarest; Ruggiero 2005\"/> In humans and other primates, social and emotional processing is localized to the [[orbitofrontal cortex]].  (''See [[Cerebral cortex]] and [[Cerebrum]].'')\n\nThe neocortex has also been shown to play an influential role in sleep, memory and learning processes. [[Semantic memory|Semantic memories]] appear to be stored in the neocortex, specifically the anterolateral [[temporal lobe]] of the neocortex.<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\">{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil | name-list-format = vanc |title=Physiology of Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-205-239481|edition=Eleventh}}</ref> It is also involved in [[instrumental conditioning]]; responsible for transmitting sensory information and information about plans for movement to the [[basal ganglia]].<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\"/> The firing rate of neurons in the neocortex also has an effect on slow-wave sleep. When the neurons are at rest and are [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizing]], a period of inhibition occurs during a slow [[oscillation]], called the down state. When the neurons of the neocortex are in the excitatory [[depolarizing]] phase and are firing briefly at a high rate, a period of excitation occurs during a slow oscillation, called the up state.<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\"/>\n\n==Clinical significance==\nLesions that develop in [[neurodegenerative disorders]], such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], interrupt the transfer of information from the sensory neocortex to the prefrontal neocortex.

There is some canonical circuitry within the cortex; for example, pyramidal neurons in the upper layers II and III project their [[axons]] to other areas of neocortex, while those in the deeper layers V and VI often project out of the cortex, e.g. to the [[thalamus]], [[brainstem]], and [[spinal cord]]. Neurons in layer IV receive the majority of the [[synapse|synaptic connections]] from outside the cortex (mostly from thalamus), and themselves make short-range, local connections to other cortical layers.<ref name=\"Noback; Strominger; Demarest; Ruggiero 2005\"/> Thus, layer IV is the main recipient of incoming sensory information and distributes it to the other layers for further processing.\n\n===Cortical columns===\n\nThe neocortex is often described as being arranged in vertical structures called [[cortical columns]], patches of neocortex with a diameter of roughly 0.5&nbsp;mm (and a depth of 2&nbsp;mm, i.e., spanning all six layers). These columns are often thought of as the basic repeating functional units of the neocortex, but their many definitions, in terms of anatomy, size, or function, are generally not consistent with each other, leading to a lack of consensus regarding their structure or function or even whether it makes sense to try to understand neocortex in terms of columns.<ref name=\"Horton 2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Horton JC, Adams DL | title = The cortical column: a structure without a function | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The neocortex is divided, into regions demarcated by the cranial sutures in the skull above, into [[frontal lobe|frontal]], [[parietal lobe|parietal]], [[occipital lobe|occipital]], and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] lobes, which perform different functions. For example, the occipital lobe contains the [[primary visual cortex]], and the temporal lobe contains the [[primary auditory cortex]]. Further subdivisions or areas of neocortex are responsible for more specific cognitive processes. In humans, the [[frontal lobe]] contains areas devoted to abilities that are enhanced in or unique to our species, such as complex language processing localized to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ([[Broca's area]]).<ref name=\"Noback; Strominger; Demarest; Ruggiero 2005\"/> In humans and other primates, social and emotional processing is localized to the [[orbitofrontal cortex]].  (''See [[Cerebral cortex]] and [[Cerebrum]].'')\n\nThe neocortex has also been shown to play an influential role in sleep, memory and learning processes. [[Semantic memory|Semantic memories]] appear to be stored in the neocortex, specifically the anterolateral [[temporal lobe]] of the neocortex.<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\">{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil | name-list-format = vanc |title=Physiology of Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0-205-239481|edition=Eleventh}}</ref> It is also involved in [[instrumental conditioning]]; responsible for transmitting sensory information and information about plans for movement to the [[basal ganglia]].<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\"/> The firing rate of neurons in the neocortex also has an effect on slow-wave sleep. When the neurons are at rest and are [[Hyperpolarization (biology)|hyperpolarizing]], a period of inhibition occurs during a slow [[oscillation]], called the down state. When the neurons of the neocortex are in the excitatory [[depolarizing]] phase and are firing briefly at a high rate, a period of excitation occurs during a slow oscillation, called the up state.<ref name=\"Carlson 2013\"/>\n\n==Clinical significance==\nLesions that develop in [[neurodegenerative disorders]], such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], interrupt the transfer of information from the sensory neocortex to the prefrontal neocortex.

The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars.

Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.

Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced: [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[The Four Seasons (band)|Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]], and [[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]]<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman Black|Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced [[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|a musical version]] of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].  Still in development for a full Broadway production, the music has been recorded by Domingo with [[Dionne Warwick]] in English and [[Gloria Estefan]] in Spanish, and a version of the duet \"[[Till I Loved You (song)|Till I Loved You]]\" was a top 40 single for [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Don Johnson]].\n\nCarr continued his work in theater, sponsoring the 1995 [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] productions of ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' and ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]'s [[Kennedy Center]] and Broadway's [[Gershwin Theatre]]<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-jun-30-mn-51594-story.html Allan Carr; Producer of 'Grease' and 'La Cage aux Folles' - Los Angeles Times]</ref>, earning 10 Tony nominations between them including one more for Carr.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-allan-carr-1105920.html Obituary: Allan Carr|The Independent]</ref>\nCarr had returned to [[Paramount Pictures]] to handle the re-release of ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1998, which included producing a [[VH1]] television special of the twentieth anniversary Hollywood \"premiere\" screening and party, and special edition re-releases of the video, DVD, and soundtrack album.\n\n==Production career==\nCarr was a film producer for numerous movies, including:\n*''[[The First Time (1969 film)|The First Time]]'' (1969)\n*''[[C.C. and Company]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Can't Stop the Music]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Where the Boys Are '84]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Cloak & Dagger (1984 film)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' (1984)\n\n==Personal life and death==\nCarr died on June 29, 1999, in [[Beverly Hills, California]] from [[liver cancer]].<ref name=Y/> At the time of his death, he split his time between his homes in Beverly Hills and [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], and was working on bringing [[Ken Ludwig]]'s Tony-winning comedy ''[[Lend Me a Tenor]]'' to Australia and the UK, and was preparing a new Broadway show, ''The New Musical Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\nHis ashes were scattered at sea by Ann-Margret, Roger Smith and Martin Menard in front of his former Diamond Head estate on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 2017 a documentary about Carr's life was released entitled ''[[The Fabulous Allan Carr]]''.  The director of ''The Fabulous Allan Carr'' [[Jeffrey Schwarz]] said, \"Although it was no secret that Allan Carr was gay, he never formally acknowledged it publicly.

[[Vietnam]] is a member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].\n\nSince the mid-1980s, through the [[Doi Moi]] reform period Vietnam has made a shift from a [[Centralization|highly centralized]] [[command economy]] to a [[mixed economy]] that uses both directive and [[indicative planning]] through [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam|five-year plans]] with support from an open [[market economy|market-based economy]]. Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy.

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study].

In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\n<u>Reminder:</u> \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html after the defeating the Khmer Rouge.]  \n\n[[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|The Khmer Rouge were a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] \n\nSubsequently, '''having lost <u>twice</u> to Vietnam''': \n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

de Vietnam, Ciudad Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, 2013-08-14, DD 01.JPG|thumb|National Bank of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City]]\n\n===Agriculture, fishery and forestry===\nIn 2003, Vietnam produced an estimated 30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to [[deforestation in Vietnam|dwindling forests]], Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam's [[fishing]] industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and [[rivers in Vietnam|extensive network of rivers and lakes]], has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by [[shrimp]] farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered [[antidumping]] complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/why-cant-vietnam-grow-better-rice/ |title=Why Can't Vietnam Grow Better Rice? |last1=Rosen |first1=Elisabeth |date=24 April 2014 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/coffee-exports-country/|title=World's Top Exports - Coffee Exports by Country|work=World's Top Exports|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Energy, mining and minerals===\n{{Main|Energy in Vietnam}}\n\n[[Petroleum]] is the main source of energy, followed by [[coal]], which contributes about 25% of the country's energy (excluding [[biomass]]). Vietnam's oil reserves are in the range of 270\u2013500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to {{convert|403300|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.\n\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are [[antimony]], [[bauxite]], [[chromium]], [[gold]], [[iron]], natural [[phosphates]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]].<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nCrude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/vnm/all/show/1996/?prod_class=hs4&details_treemap=2&disable_widgets=false&disable_search=false&node_size=none&queryActivated=true&highlight=&yaxis=complexity|title=What did Viet Nam export in 1996? - The Atlas Of Economic Complexity|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity.

Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam's potential [[natural gas]] reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric]] power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 1 Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]]  with [[Rosatom|Russian assistance]],<ref name=\"cp\"/> and a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 2 Nuclear Power Plant|second]] by a Japanese group.\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n{{Main|Manufacturing in Vietnam}}\n\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs.

Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]].

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nReminder: \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html after the defeating the Khmer Rouge.]  \n\n[[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|The Khmer Rouge were a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] \n\nSubsequently, '''having lost <u>twice</u> to Vietnam''': \n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy.

In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

The [[ASEAN]] is second with US$23.1 billion, [[South Korea]] is third, [[Japan]] is fourth and the [[EU]] is the fifth largest import partner of Vietnam.\n\n===External debt, foreign aid and foreign investment===\n{{See also|Foreign aid to Vietnam}}\nIn 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/444743/gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita-in-vietnam/|title=Vietnam- Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 2020 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nFrom 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nPledged foreign direct investment US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008.<ref name=\"IHT1\"/> Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy, especially after 2005.\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n* [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] (AFTA)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand Free Trade Area]] (AANZFTA) is a free trade area between ASEAN and [[ANZCERTA]], signed on 27 February 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|title=Welcome To The World Of Smokeless Cigarettes!|last=atinder|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527152141/http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|archivedate=27 May 2013}}</ref> and coming into effect on 1 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|title=ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand Leaders' Statement: Entry into Force of the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area 25 October 2009, Cha am Hua Hin, Thailand|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929174055/http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|archivedate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Details of the AANZFTA agreement are available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz/|title=ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) - ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013China Free Trade Area]] (ACFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\">{{Cite news| last = Pushpanathan | first = Sundram | title = ASEAN Charter: One year and going strong | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/12/22/asean-charter-one-year-and-going-strong.html | work = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 22 December 2009 | accessdate = 1 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013India Free Trade Area]] (AIFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (AJCEP)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Korea Free Trade Area]] (AKFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]]\n* [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]].\n* On 29 May 2015, Vietnam signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with [[Eurasian Economic Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/vietnam-new-trade-agreement-with-eurasia-economic-union/|title=Vietnam: New Trade Agreement with Eurasia Economic Union - Global Legal Monitor|author=|date=16 June 2015|website=www.LOC.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n* On 2 December 2015, the EU and Vietnam announced the conclusion of the negotiations for an EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietnam|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/vietnam/|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (VCFTA) came into effect on 1 January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/190-vietnam-chile/1|title=Vietnam - Chile - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212731/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-chile|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (VKFTA) came into effect on 20 December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/189-vietnam-south-korea/1|title=Vietnam - Korea - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075539/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/negotiations/vietnam-korea|archive-date=2017-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Japan-Vietnam Economic Partnership Agreement]] came into effect on 1 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/187-vietnam-japan/1|title=Vietnam - Japan - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212740/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-japan|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Economic development strategy==\n===Guiding principle===\n====Industrialization and Modernization (IM)====\n''\u201cIndustrialization and modernization is a process of fundamental and all-rounded change of production, business, services and social and economic management from the predominant use of artisanal labor to a predominant use of labor power17 with technology, methods and ways of working that are advanced, modern and rely upon the development of industry and scientific \u2013 technical progress to create high labor productivity. So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The company manufactured synthetic [[yarn]]s, a niche product at the time. By the start of [[World War II]], the company was known as '''Atlantic Rayon Corporation''' and manufactured [[parachute]]s. As war production wound down, the company started making civilian products as well and was renamed '''Textron''': \u201cTex\" for \"textiles\" and \"tron\" from synthetics such as \"Lustron\". The company was listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange|NYSE]] in 1947.<ref name=\"textron.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.textron.com/About/Company/History|title=History - Textron|work=textron.com|accessdate=August 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nRoyal Little began the process of turning Textron into a conglomerate in 1953,  with the purchase of Burkart Manufacturing Company (upholstery filling for automotive industry) in September 1953, followed by the purchase of Dalmo-Victor (airborne Radar Antennae) and MB Manufacturing Company in early 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nyti.ms/2OdeolR|title=Textron Expands Into Non-Textiles; Buys MB Manufacturing Co., Aircraft Parts Maker, as 'Hedge on Depression' |website=nyti.ms|accessdate=August 5, 2018}}</ref> The push for diversification would see Textron purchase various other manufacturing companies.

For example, archiving a collection of files with ''tar'' and then compressing the resulting archive file with ''gzip'' results a file with <code>.tar.gz</code> extension.\n\nThis approach has two goals:\n#It follows the [[Unix philosophy]] that each program should accomplish a single task to perfection, as opposed to attempting to accomplish everything with one tool. As compression technology progresses, users may use different compression programs without having to modify or abandon their archiver.\n#The archives use [[solid compression]]. When the files are combined, the compressor can exploit redundancy across several archived files and achieve better compression than a compressor that compresses each files individually.\n\nThis approach, however, has disadvantages too:\n#Extracting or modifying one file is difficult. Extracting one file requires decompressing an entire archive, which can be time- and space-consuming. Modifying one means the file needs to be put back into archive and the archive recompressed again. This operation requires additional time and disk space.\n#The archive becomes damage-prone. If the area holding shared data for several files is damaged, all those files are lost.\n#It's impossible to take advantage of redundancy between files unless the compression window is larger than the size of an individual file. For example, gzip uses [[DEFLATE]], which typically operates with a 32768 byte window, whereas bzip2 uses a [[Burrows-Wheeler transform]] roughly 27 times bigger. xz defaults to 8 MiB but supports significantly larger windows.\n\n==Windows archivers==\nThe built-in archiver of [[Microsoft Windows]] as well as third-party archiving software, such as [[WinRAR]] and [[7-zip]], often use a [[graphical user interface]]. They also offer an optional [[command-line interface]], while Windows itself does not. Windows archivers perform both archiving and compression.
