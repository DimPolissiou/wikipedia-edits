Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Agrium]] and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\nPrior to [[History of Canada|colonization]], the area around what is now Fort Saskatchewan was a gathering place and home to a variety of different [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous]] nations, including the [[Cree|Cree (N\u00e9hinaw)]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Nakota]] nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskatchewanrecord.com/news/local-news/here-is-a-sneak-peek|title=Here is a sneak peek|last=January 31|first=Arthur Green Published on:|last2=January 31|first2=2019 {{!}} Last Updated:|date=2019-01-31|website=Fort Saskatchewan Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=Est|first3=2019 4:20 Pm}}</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the region commonly traveled the North Saskatchewan River by [[Canoe]].

Jarvis, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P) established Sturgeon Creek Post as a [[Fortification|fort]] on the North Saskatchewan River.<ref name=\":1\" /> The post was soon renamed \"Fort (on the) Saskatchewan\", and it became a key northern police garrison. The community was incorporated as a [[village]] in 1899, a [[town]] in 1904, and a [[city]] in 1985.<ref name=\"AMACityProfiles\" />\n=== Arrival of the railway ===\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan CN Station.jpg|thumb|300px|left|alt=CN Station in Fort Saskatchewan.|Historic [[Fort Saskatchewan station|Fort Saskatchewan railway station]]]]\nPrior to the arrival of the railway, people travelling to and from Edmonton had to traverse a dirt trail that wound around woods and swamps.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time.

There were various additions to the jail throughout the next 70 years, including the construction of more cell blocks, a gymnasium, a stand-alone power plant, and carpentry, auto body, and licence plate shops.<ref name=\"peterream3\" />  The prison grew food for inmates on a 324 hectare farm.<ref name=\":1\" /> Although the prison was mainly used to house people awaiting trial or serving sentences of under two years, 29 prisoners were executed on site between 1914 and 1960. By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was burned down after the ring leaders burned clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n\n==== Replacement ====\nThe jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

The [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (C.N.R.) reached Fort Saskatchewan in 1905, placing the town on a transcontinental rail line.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=337}}</ref> The [[Fort Saskatchewan station|C.N.R. station]] is a modified third class station design (100-19 plan), which is a \"special station\" that was only used by C.N.R. at the most significant stops along their line.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hermis.alberta.ca/ARHP/Details.aspx?DeptID=1&ObjectID=4665-0701|title=Alberta Register of Historic Places|website=hermis.alberta.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> It is longer than other third class stations built by C.N.R. and has several unique features, including hip roofs on either side of the building, and a large interior that contains a vestibule, a kitchen, a living room, a large general waiting room, a separate waiting room for women, an office, and a small freight shed. An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time.

There were various additions to the jail throughout the next 70 years, including the construction of more cell blocks, a gymnasium, a stand-alone power plant, and carpentry, auto body, and licence plate shops.<ref name=\"peterream3\" />  The prison grew food for inmates on a 324 hectare farm.<ref name=\":1\" /> Although the prison was mainly used to house people awaiting trial or serving sentences of under two years, 29 prisoners were executed on site between 1914 and 1960. By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was burned down after the ring leaders burned clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n\n==== Replacement ====\nThe jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

However, as his activities became centered in [[Kyoto]], he kept a house in Kyoto. He also had his adopted son-in-law, [[Sen Sh\u014dan]], who was married to his daughter Okame, move from Sakai to Kyoto, leaving his natural son, [[Sen D\u014dan]], to tend the family home and business in Sakai. This represents the origin of the two branches of the Sen family (Senke) referred to as the Sakai-Senke and Ky\u014d-Senke. The Ky\u014d-Senke, headed by Sen Sh\u014dan, eventually settled in a house located on Ogawa Street, in the neighborhood of [[Honp\u014d-ji (Kyoto)]] temple; the house and property representing the original Sen estate in Kyoto. Following the death of Riky\u016b, both Sen D\u014dan of the Sakai-Senke and Sen Sh\u014dan of the Ky\u014d-Senke, inevitably caught up in the wrath of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] which had been the reason for Riky\u016b's self-immolation, were in danger of also losing their lives, and so, to protect their homes and families, they went into hiding. After a number of months, however, they both were able to return home. In the end, Sen D\u014dan, back in Sakai, left no successors to carry on the Sakai-Senke. On the other hand, Sen Sh\u014dan, returning home to Kyoto, already had a son, [[Sen S\u014dtan]], born between him and Okame, to succeed him as head of the Ky\u014d-Senke.<ref>Sen S\u014dsa, Sen S\u014dshitsu, Sen S\u014dsh\u016b supv. eds, ''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' (\u5229\u4f11\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, \"Riky\u016b Encyclopedia\") entries for \"Sakai Senke\" and \"Ky\u014d-Senke\".

On the other hand, S\u014dtan's second son, Kan'\u014d S\u014dsetsu, had been adopted by the Yoshioka family of lacquer-ware specialists in Kyoto, who were known by their business name, Yoshimonjiya. During this period, he went by the name Yoshioka Kan'uemon. In his later life, however, he reverted to the Sen family, established a tea room named \"Kankyuan\" at his residence on Mushak\u014dji street, and began to follow a course of life as a chanoyu expert. With this, Riky\u016b's chanoyu ideals and legacy as carried forward by his direct descendants branched into the three lines of the Sen family referred to as the san-Senke.<ref>''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' entry for \"S\u014dtan no t\u014djy\u014d\" (\"S\u014dtan enters the stage\"), p. 114.</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Meiji Restoration]] (1868), the heads of the three families, respectfully, were in service as chad\u014d magistrates under various [[daimy\u014d]], and received an adequate stipend from them. In the case of the family that eventually came to be known as the Urasenke, Sens\u014d was in service to the Maeda clan of Kaga. During the following generations, the Urasenke family head also came to serve as chad\u014d magistrate for the Hisamatsu clan of the Iyo Domain, in present-day [[Ehime prefecture]], as well as caretaker for that family's Kyoto residence. The eleventh generation family head, Gengensai (1810-77), who was born as the fifth son of a minor daimy\u014d named Matsudaira Noritomo of the Mikawa Okudono domain and married into the Urasenke family, also served the [[Owari branch]] of the [[Tokugawa family]]. With the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] (1868), however, the daimy\u014d lost their positions, and the hereditary stipends which the three Sen families had been receiving came to an end. It was after this, and the loss of their positions serving the daimy\u014d, that the Sen families established their [[iemoto]] system.<ref>Chanoyu Quarterly no. 73, \"The Diffusion of the Way of Tea\" p. 5-6.

Then, from the fourth generation, their family lineages divide. It is from the fourth generation that the heads of the three separate families came to carry the [[Japanese name#Professional names|hereditary professional name]] which has been used by the successive heads of their respective family. The head (''[[iemoto]]'') of the Urasenke family and its school of chad\u014d assumes the hereditary professional name S\u014dshitsu upon succession, to become officially referred to as [[Sen S\u014dshitsu]].

Its aims are to ensure the standardization of the Urasenke chanoyu rules and tea-making procedures (temae), support research, encourage cooperation and exchange among all members, promote the practice of the principles layed down by the grand master, and expand the chado population around the world. Also, it provides support for the purposes and activities of the Urasenke Foundation.\n\nIn Japan, the organization is divided into seventeen districts comprising 165 chapters (''shibu'') and 2 sub-chapters (''shisho''). Each district has a liaison council for the Gakk\u014d Chad\u014d (Tea Training in the Educational System) program sponsored by the organization. There are also 167 groups belonging to the organization's Seinenbu, or \"Youth Division.\" These three entities organize seminars, tea gatherings, conventions, and many other activities. The central office, serving to coordinate the programs and activities of all these, is located in the Urasenke Center building at Urasenke headquarters, Kyoto. Twice a year, in the spring and autumn, it calls together a national meeting of chapter presidents, to decide upon general policies and activities. In 1999, the International Division of the Urasenke Foundation was moved under the umbrella of this office, effectively extending the organization to overseas regions. Currently there are 92 official Chad\u014d Urasenke Tank\u014dkai associations spread over 37 countries outside Japan.<ref>Urasenke Konnichian English website page \"Urasenke Tankokai Federation,\" at http://www.urasenke.or.jp/texte/organ/tankokai/index_tan.html.

However, as his activities became centered in [[Kyoto]], he kept a house in Kyoto. He also had his adopted son-in-law, [[Sen Sh\u014dan]], who was married to his daughter Okame, move from Sakai to Kyoto, leaving his natural son, [[Sen D\u014dan]], to tend the family home and business in Sakai. This represents the origin of the two branches of the Sen family (Senke) referred to as the Sakai-Senke and Ky\u014d-Senke. The Ky\u014d-Senke, headed by Sen Sh\u014dan, eventually settled in a house located on Ogawa Street, in the neighborhood of [[Honp\u014d-ji (Kyoto)]] temple; the house and property representing the original Sen estate in Kyoto. Following the death of Riky\u016b, both Sen D\u014dan of the Sakai-Senke and Sen Sh\u014dan of the Ky\u014d-Senke, inevitably caught up in the wrath of [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] which had been the reason for Riky\u016b's self-immolation, were in danger of also losing their lives, and so, to protect their homes and families, they went into hiding. After a number of months, however, they both were able to return home. In the end, Sen D\u014dan, back in Sakai, left no successors to carry on the Sakai-Senke. On the other hand, Sen Sh\u014dan, returning home to Kyoto, already had a son, [[Sen S\u014dtan]], born between him and Okame, to succeed him as head of the Ky\u014d-Senke.<ref>Sen S\u014dsa, Sen S\u014dshitsu, Sen S\u014dsh\u016b supv. eds, ''Riky\u016b Daijiten'' (\u5229\u4f11\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, \"Riky\u016b Encyclopedia\") entries for \"Sakai Senke\" and \"Ky\u014d-Senke\".

It was initiated in 1940 by the fourteenth-generation head of Urasenke, Tantansai (1893-1964), with the aim of unifying and encouraging the practitioners of Urasenke chad\u014d.<ref>Urasenke Konnichian English website page \"The Urasenke Legacy,\" entry for \"14th Generation,\" at http://www.urasenke.or.jp/texte/legacy/lineage1.html. Retrieved 4.04.2020.</ref> In 1953, It was registered by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture as an incorporated body. Its aims are to ensure the standardization of the Urasenke chanoyu rules and tea-making procedures (temae), support research, encourage cooperation and exchange among all members, promote the practice of the principles layed down by the grand master, and expand the chado population around the world. Also, it provides support for the purposes and activities of the Urasenke Foundation.\n\nIn Japan, the organization is divided into seventeen districts comprising 165 chapters (''shibu'') and 2 sub-chapters (''shisho''). Each district has a liaison council for the Gakk\u014d Chad\u014d (Tea Training in the Educational System) program sponsored by the organization. There are also 167 groups belonging to the organization's Seinenbu, or \"Youth Division.\" These three entities organize seminars, tea gatherings, conventions, and many other activities. The central office, serving to coordinate the programs and activities of all these, is located in the Urasenke Center building at Urasenke headquarters, Kyoto. Twice a year, in the spring and autumn, it calls together a national meeting of chapter presidents, to decide upon general policies and activities. In 199, the International Division of the Urasenke Foundation waas moved under the umbrella of this office, effectively extending the organization to overseas regions. Currently there are 92 official Chad\u014d Urasenke Tank\u014dkai associations spread over 37 countries outside Japan.<ref>Urasenke Konnichian English website page \"Urasenke Tankokai Federation,\" at http://www.urasenke.or.jp/texte/organ/tankokai/index_tan.html.

It was released as the [[lead single]] from the album on June 5, 2006, by [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The song was written by [[Fernando Garibay]], [[Sheppard Solomon]] and Ralph McCarthy, and produced by Garibay with additional production by Solomon. \"Stars Are Blind\" is a mid-tempo [[reggae fusion]] song.\n\n\"Stars Are Blind\" was well received by [[Music journalism|music critic]]s. It peaked at number 18 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Dance Club Songs]] chart. Worldwide, the single topped the charts in Hungary, Scotland and Slovakia while reaching the top 10 in Australia, Canada, Venezuela and more than 10 European countries.\n\nA [[reggaeton]] [[remix]] featuring the Puerto Rican duo [[Wisin & Yandel]] was released in Latin America, receiving heavy airplay and achieving club success in countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Chile and Venezuela.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n\"Stars Are Blind\" received positive reviews from music critics.

In this version, scenes from the beach are still present, but exist as Hilton's fantasies during the photoshoot. At the end of the video, she wins the affection of her photographer, but ends up just taking his keys and stealing his car.

After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as [[Allison MacKenzie]] in the television [[soap opera]] ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' (1964\u20131966). Her credited feature film debut in ''[[Guns at Batasi]]'' (1964) earned her a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress|New Star of the Year]], and she gained further recognition for her subsequent two-year marriage to [[Frank Sinatra]], whom she married at age 21. Farrow's portrayal of Rosemary Woodhouse in the horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968) saw her nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]]. She earned a third Golden Globe nomination for her role in ''[[John and Mary (film)|John and Mary]]'' (1969).\n\nIn 1971, Farrow became the first American actress in history to join the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], appearing as [[Joan of Arc]] in a production of ''[[Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher]]''. This was followed by stage productions of ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' (1972), ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' (1973), and ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' (1976). Farrow also starred in several films throughout the 1970s, notably as [[Daisy Buchanan]] in the 1974 film adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', and [[Robert Altman]]'s comedy ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978).\n\nFarrow began a relationship with filmmaker [[Woody Allen]] in 1979, and over a decade-long period starred in 13 of his films, beginning with ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982). She received numerous critical accolades for her performances in several of Allen's films, including Golden Globe Award nominations for ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' (1984), ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), and ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'' (1990), as well as a BAFTA nomination for ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986). After separating from Allen in 1992, Farrow [[Woody Allen sexual assault allegation|made public allegations]] that he sexually assaulted their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan, which he has repeatedly denied. Despite inconclusive evidence, Farrow retained custody of Dylan. These claims received significant renewed public attention after Dylan recounted the alleged assault in a 2013 interview.\n\nSince the 2000s, Farrow has made occasional appearances on television, such as a recurring role on ''[[Third Watch]]'' (2001\u20132003), and had supporting parts in such films as ''[[The Omen (2006 film)|The Omen]]'' (2006), ''[[Be Kind Rewind]]'' (2008), and ''[[Dark Horse (2011 film)|Dark Horse]]'' (2011).

After working as a fashion model during her teenage years, she first gained notice for her role as [[Allison MacKenzie]] in the television [[soap opera]] ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'' (1964\u20131966). Her credited feature film debut in ''[[Guns at Batasi]]'' (1964) earned her a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year \u2013 Actress|New Star of the Year]], and she gained further recognition for her subsequent two-year marriage to [[Frank Sinatra]], whom she married at age 21. Farrow's portrayal of Rosemary Woodhouse in the horror film ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968) saw her nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe Award for Best Actress]]. She earned a third Golden Globe nomination for her role in ''[[John and Mary (film)|John and Mary]]'' (1969).\n\nIn 1971, Farrow became the first American actress in history to join the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]], appearing as [[Joan of Arc]] in a production of ''[[Jeanne d'Arc au b\u00fbcher]]''. This was followed by stage productions of ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' (1972), ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' (1973), and ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'' (1976). Farrow also starred in several films throughout the 1970s, notably as [[Daisy Buchanan]] in the 1974 film adaptation of ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', and [[Robert Altman]]'s comedy ''[[A Wedding]]'' (1978).\n\nFarrow began a relationship with filmmaker [[Woody Allen]] in 1979, and over a decade-long period starred in 13 of his films, beginning with ''[[A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]]'' (1982). She received numerous critical accolades for her performances in several of Allen's films, including Golden Globe Award nominations for ''[[Broadway Danny Rose]]'' (1984), ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), and ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'' (1990), as well as a BAFTA nomination for ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'' (1986). After separating from Allen in 1992, Farrow [[Woody Allen sexual assault allegation|made public allegations]] that he sexually assaulted their seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan, which he has repeatedly denied. Despite inconclusive evidence, Farrow retained custody of Dylan.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br/>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.]<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

L'Enfant died before the work was completed, which required Banneker to carry on in his stead.<ref name=Defender>{{cite web |url=http://www.thepearlofomega.org/Resources/Documents/The%20Dial,%20Ch%20iDefender,%202-16-29.pdf|format=PDF|title=Howard U Gets Memorial to Benjamin Banneker |work=Chicago, Illinois: [[The Chicago Defender]] (National edition)|date=1929-02-16 |page=A1 |publisher=[[ProQuest]] Historical Newspapers |accessdate=2017-11-09|via=[http://www.thepearlofomega.org The Pearl of Omega]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109123630/http://www.thepearlofomega.org/Resources/Documents/The%20Dial,%20Ch%20iDefender,%202-16-29.pdf|archivedate=2017-11-09}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHowever, as a book that won the 1917 [[Pulitzer Prize for History]] had earlier reported, L'Enfant lived long after he developed his plan for the federal capital city.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970|first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi|url-access=registration|title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital|work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395|oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19|quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"<br>(7) [http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano]. \"Some writers, in an effort to build up their hero, claim that Banneker was the designer of Washington.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br/>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

Banneker was employed directly by Ellicott and did not at any time, as far as can be determined, work with or for L'Enfant.\"</ref> In late February 1792, [[Presidency of George Washington|President George Washington]] dismissed L'Enfant, who had failed to have his plan published and who was experiencing frequent conflicts with the three Commissioners that Washington had appointed to supervise the planning and survey of the federal district and city.<ref name=planning/><ref name=\"Bowling\">Bowling</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/details/centennialhisto00woolgoog/page/n112 Crew, pp. 101-102] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111093014/https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA101&id=5Q81AAAAIAAJ |date=2015-11-11}}<br/>(2) {{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |title=Plan of the City of Washington|publisher=Washington Map Society|date=1997-03-22|accessdate=2012-06-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623142642/http://home.earthlink.net/~docktor/wmslogo.htm |archivedate=2012-06-23}}</ref>\n[[File:Silvio Bedini with bust of Thomas Jefferson 1981.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><sup>[[Smithsonian Institution]]</sup><br />Silvio Bedini (1981)</div>]]\nA number of undocumented stories connecting Benjamin Banneker with the planning and survey of the federal capital city have appeared over the years.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.]<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.
