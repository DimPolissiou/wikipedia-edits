Since in principle any gene can be [[Gene knockdown|knocked down]] by a synthetic siRNA with a complementary sequence, siRNAs are an important tool for validating gene function and drug targeting in the post-genomic era.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe mechanism by which siRNA causes gene silencing through repression of translation occurs as follows:\n[[File:SiRNA mechanism.2.png|thumb|300x300px|siRNA Mechanism]]\n# Long dsRNA (which can come from hairpin, complementary RNAs, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) is cleaved by an endo-ribonuclease called [[Dicer]]. Dicer cuts the long dsRNA to form short interfering RNA or siRNA; this is what enables the molecules to form the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC).\n# Once siRNA enters the cell it gets incorporated into other proteins to form the [[RNA-induced silencing complex|RISC]].\n# Once the siRNA is part of the RISC complex, the siRNA is unwound to form single stranded siRNA.\n# The strand that is thermodynamically less stable due to its base pairing at the 5\u00b4end is chosen to remain part of the RISC-complex\n# The single stranded siRNA which is part of the RISC complex now can scan and find a complementary mRNA\n# Once the single stranded siRNA (part of the RISC complex) binds to its target mRNA, it induces [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] cleavage.\n# The mRNA is now cut and recognized as abnormal by the cell. This causes degradation of the mRNA and in turn no translation of the mRNA into amino acids and then proteins. Thus silencing the gene that encodes that mRNA.\nsiRNA is also similar to [[MicroRNA|miRNA]], however, miRNAs are derived from shorter stemloop RNA products, typically silence genes by repression of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], and have broader specificity of action, while siRNAs typically work by cleaving the mRNA before translation, and have 100% complementarity, thus very tight target specificity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=MicroRNA gets down to business|first=George S.|last=Mack | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 June 2007|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=25|issue=6|pages=631\u20138|doi=10.1038/nbt0607-631|pmid=17557095}}</ref>\n\n==RNAi induction using siRNAs or their biosynthetic precursors==\n[[Image:2ffl-by-domain.png|thumb|right|Dicer protein colored by [[protein domain]].]]\n[[Gene knockdown]] by [[transfection]] of exogenous siRNA is often unsatisfactory because the effect is only transient, especially in rapidly dividing cells. This may be overcome by creating an [[expression vector]] for the siRNA. The siRNA sequence is modified to introduce a short loop between the two strands.

Here, genes with incomplete complementarity are inadvertently downregulated by the siRNA (in effect, the siRNA acts as a miRNA), leading to problems in data interpretation and potential toxicity. This, however, can be partly addressed by designing appropriate control experiments, and siRNA design algorithms are currently being developed to produce siRNAs free from off-targeting. Genome-wide expression analysis, e.g., by microarray technology, can then be used to verify this and further refine the algorithms.

Many autoimmune diseases see these types of antibodies. There haven't yet been reports of antibodies against siRNA bound to proteins. Some methods for siRNA delivery adjoin polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the oligonucleotide reducing excretion and improving circulating half-life. However recently a large Phase III trial of PEGylated RNA aptamer against factor IX had to be discontinued by Regado Biosciences because of a severe anaphylactic reaction to the PEG part of the RNA. This reaction led to death in some cases and raises significant concerns about siRNA delivery when PEGylated oligonucleotides are involved.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wittrup A, Lieberman J | title = Knocking down disease: a progress report on siRNA therapeutics | journal = Nature Reviews.

However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and immunogenic effects.\n\nThis method has potential use in gene silencing of the central nervous system for the treatment of [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's disease]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trinucleotide Repeat Protocols|volume=1010|last=Cambon|first=Karine|last2=D\u00e9glon|first2=Nicole | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013-01-01|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781627034104|editor-last=Kohwi|editor-first=Yoshinori|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=95\u2013109|language=English|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-411-1_7|pmid=23754221|editor-last2=McMurray|editor-first2=Cynthia T. }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Gene knockdown]]\n* [[Gene silencing]]\n* [[Oligonucleotide synthesis]]\n* [[EsiRNA]]\n* [[NatsiRNA]]\n* [[MicroRNA]]\n* [[Viroid]]\n* [[RNA interference]]\n* [[CRISPR]]\n* [[Dharmacon]]\n* [[Persomics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Hannon GJ, Rossi JJ | title = Unlocking the potential of the human genome with RNA interference | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7006 | pages = 371\u20138 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15372045 | doi = 10.1038/nature02870 | bibcode = 2004Natur.431..371H }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Small interfering RNA}}\n* An animation of the mechanism of siRNA by Nature Reviews Genetics [http://www.nature.com/nrg/multimedia/rnai/index.html]\n\n{{natural antisense transcripts}}\n{{Nucleic acids}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Small Interfering Rna}}\n[[Category:RNA]]\n[[Category:RNA interference]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n{{bots|deny=tagbot}}\n", "text_old": "{{see also|RNA interference}}\n[[Image:SiRNAvitro.gif|thumb|right|Mediating RNA interference in cultured mammalian cells.]]\n'''Small interfering RNA''' ('''siRNA'''), sometimes known as '''short interfering RNA''' or '''silencing RNA''', is a class of [[double-stranded RNA]] [[non-coding RNA]] [[molecule]]s, 20-25 [[base pair]]s in length, similar to [[MicroRNA|miRNA]], and operating within the [[RNA interference]] (RNAi) pathway.

Since in principle any gene can be [[Gene knockdown|knocked down]] by a synthetic siRNA with a complementary sequence, siRNAs are an important tool for validating gene function and drug targeting in the post-genomic era.\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe mechanism by which siRNA causes gene silencing through repression of transcription occurs as follows:\n[[File:SiRNA mechanism.2.png|thumb|300x300px|siRNA Mechanism]]\n# Long dsRNA (which can come from hairpin, complementary RNAs, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases) is cleaved by an endo-ribonuclease called [[Dicer]]. Dicer cuts the long dsRNA to form short interfering RNA or siRNA; this is what enables the molecules to form the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC).\n# Once siRNA enters the cell it gets incorporated into other proteins to form the [[RNA-induced silencing complex|RISC]].\n# Once the siRNA is part of the RISC complex, the siRNA is unwound to form single stranded siRNA.\n# The strand that is thermodynamically less stable due to its base pairing at the 5\u00b4end is chosen to remain part of the RISC-complex\n# The single stranded siRNA which is part of the RISC complex now can scan and find a complementary mRNA\n# Once the single stranded siRNA (part of the RISC complex) binds to its target mRNA, it induces [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] cleavage.\n# The mRNA is now cut and recognized as abnormal by the cell. This causes degradation of the mRNA and in turn no translation of the mRNA into amino acids and then proteins. Thus silencing the gene that encodes that mRNA.\nsiRNA is also similar to [[MicroRNA|miRNA]], however, miRNAs are derived from shorter stemloop RNA products, typically silence genes by repression of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], and have broader specificity of action, while siRNAs typically work by cleaving the mRNA before translation, and have 100% complementarity, thus very tight target specificity.<ref>{{cite journal|title=MicroRNA gets down to business|first=George S.|last=Mack | name-list-format = vanc |date=1 June 2007|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=25|issue=6|pages=631\u20138|doi=10.1038/nbt0607-631|pmid=17557095}}</ref>\n\n==RNAi induction using siRNAs or their biosynthetic precursors==\n[[Image:2ffl-by-domain.png|thumb|right|Dicer protein colored by [[protein domain]].]]\n[[Gene knockdown]] by [[transfection]] of exogenous siRNA is often unsatisfactory because the effect is only transient, especially in rapidly dividing cells.

Here, genes with incomplete complementarity are inadvertently downregulated by the siRNA (in effect, the siRNA acts as a miRNA), leading to problems in data interpretation and potential toxicity. This, however, can be partly addressed by designing appropriate control experiments, and siRNA design algorithms are currently being developed to produce siRNAs free from off-targeting. Genome-wide expression analysis, e.g., by microarray technology, can then be used to verify this and further refine the algorithms.

However recently a large Phase III trial of PEGylated RNA aptamer against factor IX had to be discontinued by Regado Biosciences because of a severe anaphylactic reaction to the PEG part of the RNA.

The cell membrane is made of phospholipids which makes it susceptible to an electric field. When quick but powerful electrical pulses are initiated the lipid molecules reorient themselves, while undergoing thermal phase transitions because of heating. This results in the making of hydrophilic pores and localized perturbations in the lipid bilayer cell membrane also causing a temporary loss of semipermeability. This allows for the escape of many intracellular contents, such as ions and metabolites as well as the simultaneous uptake of drugs, molecular probes, and nucleic acids. For cells that are difficult to transfect electroporation is advantageous however cell death is more probable under this technique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabosciences.com|title=siRNA Delivery Methods into Mammalian Cells |date=2016-10-13|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThis method has been used to deliver siRNA targeting VEGF into the xenografted tumors in nude mice, which resulted in a significant suppression of tumor growth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Electroporation Protocols|volume = 1121|last=Takei|first=Yoshifumi| name-list-format = vanc |date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer New York|isbn=9781461496311|editor-last=Li|editor-first=Shulin|series=Methods in Molecular Biology|pages=131\u2013138|language=English|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-9632-8_11|pmid = 24510818|editor-last2=Cutrera|editor-first2=Jeffry|editor-last3=Heller|editor-first3=Richard|editor-last4=Teissie|editor-first4=Justin |chapter = Electroporation-Mediated siRNA Delivery into Tumors}}</ref>\n\n=== Viral-mediated delivery ===\nThe gene silencing effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty can be overcome through an RNAi approach.

Another aspect is that in some cases synthetic viral vectors can integrate siRNA into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong.

That night, after barging into the house, when Harun went to search for items to rob, Yasin restrained Poon, and raped the woman. While Yasin was sitting on her chest as he was trying to rape her, Poon suffered fractures on her ribs and she died as a result. Her body was taken to the beach and dumped in the sea, where it was fished out by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when Harun was arrested for an unrelated case of theft, he surprised his interrogators by confessing that he was involved in the robbery. This led to Yasin's arrest and both men were charged with murder.

Although Yasin's appeal against the death sentence was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. Yasin was later charged with rape, but he denied raping the elderly woman at the trial. Yasin was eventually found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to 8 years' jail, and that sentence was ordered to run consecutively with the jail term he received for causing Poon's death.\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide any evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty of the murder of Liang Shan Shan and sentenced him to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found.

While Yasin was sitting on her chest as he was trying to rape her, Poon suffered fractures on her ribs and she died as a result. Her body was taken to the beach and dumped in the sea, where it was fished out by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when Harun was arrested for an unrelated case of theft, he surprised his interrogators by confessing that he was involved in the robbery. This led to Yasin's arrest and both men were charged with murder.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide any evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty of the murder of Liang Shan Shan and sentenced him to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to one of robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Judicial Comissioner Choo Han Teck, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial, accepting Abdul Nasir's defence that he had accidentally stepped onto Fujii while rejecting the prosecution's arguement that he had intentionally stamped on Fujii and killed her, therefore he acquitted Abdul Nasir of murder and found him guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced him to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal, but by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. However, that did not put an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee (who was eventually hanged for drug trafficking) during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being abducted. On 3 March 1997, Abdul Nasir was found guilty of kidnapping and despite the urgings of the prosecution to impose the death sentence on Abdul Nasir, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray accepted that Abdul Nasir did not make any threats on the hostages' lives and never harmed the hostages, and thus he sentenced Abdul Nasir to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane. Justice Sinnathuray also ordered that Abdul Nasir's life sentence should be run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

The charge was then reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to murder; Somsak pleaded guilty and he was then sentenced to 10 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.\n\n===2006===\n* 15 February 2006: In the first crime involving firearms since 2000, Tan Chor Jin, nicknamed the \"One-eyed Dragon\" forcefully entered the flat of Lim Hock Soon, a nightclub owner. He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang. (Under Singapore law, offenders charged with unlawful discharge of firearms will be sentenced to death, even with no intention to kill.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/AOA1973|title=Arms Offences Act - Singapore Statutes Online|last=|first=|date=|website=sso.agc.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> The Court of Appeal also dismissed Tan's appeal against his death sentence on 30 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tan Chor Jin v Public Prosecutor [2008] 4 SLR 306; [2008] SGCA 32|url=http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/13530-tan-chor-jin-v-public-prosecutor-2008-4-slr-306-2008-sgca-32|website=SingaporeLaw.sg|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130170543/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/court-of-appeal-judgments/13530-tan-chor-jin-v-public-prosecutor-2008-4-slr-306-2008-sgca-32|archive-date=30 January 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He was subsequently executed on 9 January 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Teo|first1=Wan Gek|title=Donor 'designated kidney expressly' for Tang|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090111-113780.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|date=11 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131175029/http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090111-113780.html|archive-date=31 January 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The suspected murderer who shocked Singapore|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/22/2003345842|accessdate=25 January 2015|agency=Taipei Times|date=22 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607153720/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2007/01/22/2003345842|archive-date=2014-06-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/guilty-as-charged-one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jin-shot-nightclub-owner|title=Guilty As Charged: 'One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin shot nightclub owner|last=Hoe|first=Pei Shan|date=2016-05-17|website=The Straits Times|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref> His accomplice, Ho, was charged on 15 July 2015 for harbouring Tan out of Singapore.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alkhatib |first1=Shaffiq |url=https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore-news/man-charged-harbouring-one-eyed-dragon |title=Man charged with harbouring 'One-Eyed Dragon' |website=The New Paper |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=15 July 2015}}</ref> Ho pleaded guilty on 8 August 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Amir |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jins-accomplice-found-guilty-after-9-years-on-the |title='One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice found guilty after 9 years on the run |website=The Straits Times |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=8 August 2016}}</ref> Two days later, he was sentenced to a 20-month jail term.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hussain |first1=Amir |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/one-eyed-dragon-tan-chor-jins-accomplice-jailed-20-months-after-9-years-on |title='One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice jailed 20 months after 9 years on the run |website=The Straits Times |access-date=13 October 2019 |date=10 August 2016}}</ref>\n*June 2006: Lawyer David Rasif fled with S$11.3 million of his clients' money, one of the largest amount misappropriated by a rogue Singaporean lawyer.

The spread of [[Buddhism]] in the region has occurred intermediately throughout its history. Starting in the 3rd century BCE, Buddhism was propagated by the [[Maurya Empire]] under the reign of [[Ashoka]]. The region would remain an important center for Buddhism under the [[Kushan Empire]] and its vassals.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tG0fnF0VRk0C&pg=PA72&dq=buddhism+himachal+pradesh+history&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjplbOxj5jkAhVQTd8KHQswCTwQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=buddhism%20himachal%20pradesh%20history&f=false|title=Social, Cultural, and Economic History of Himachal Pradesh|last=Ahluwalia|first=Manjit Singh|date=1998|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173870897|language=en}}</ref> Over the centuries the following of Buddhism has greatly fluctuated. Yet by experiencing revivals and migrations, Buddhism continued to be rooted in the region, particularly in the [[Lahaul]], [[Spiti Valley|Spiti]] and [[Kinnaur]] valleys.\n\nAfter the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]], escaped from Tibet with his followers in 1959 and took refuge in India, the focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]] spread further and attracted immense international sympathy and support. The Dalai Lama found [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]] in Himachal Pradesh as an ideal place to establish his \"capital in exile\" at [[McLeod Ganj]] in close vicinity to Dharamshala, and is called the '''Little Lhasa''' and also as '''Dhasa''' (a combination of Dharamshala and [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]]). This situation has given the state a unique status in the global firmament of Buddhist traditions. It is now the cradle of Tibetan Buddhism, with its undeniable link to the past activities initiated in the 8th century (in 747 AD) by Guru [[Padmasambhava]] (who went to Tibet from [[Rewalsar, India|Rewalsar]] in Himachal Pradesh in [[North India]] to spread Buddhism), who was known as the \"Guru Rinpoche\" and the \"Second Buddha\".<ref name=\"Lama\">{{Cite web|url=http://namgyalmonastery.org/hhdl|title=His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyaltso|accessdate=2010-01-17|publisher=Namgyal Monastery|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012005104/http://namgyalmonastery.org/hhdl|archivedate=12 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Behl\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2122/stories/20041105000106500.htm |title=Trans-Himalayan Murals |author=Benoy K.

Of the 21 scholars he had sent to revive Buddhism in the Trans Himalayan region, only two had survived, and one of them was the famous scholar-translator [[Rinchen Zangpo]] who transfused Buddhist activity in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Known by the epithet \"Lohtsawa\" or the \"Great Translator\", Zangpo built 108 monasteries in the trans-Himalayan region to spread Buddhism, which are considered as the main stay of [[Vajrayana]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (also known as [[Lamaism]]). He institutionalised Buddhism in this region. Zangpo had engaged Kashmiri artists who created wall paintings and sculptures in these legendary 108 monasteries; only a few of these have survived in Himachal Pradesh namely, the [[Lhalung Monastery]], [[Nako, India|Nako Gompa]] in Spiti and [[Tabo Monastery]] in Spiti, the last named monastery is known as the [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] of the [[Himalayas]]. In Himachal Pradesh, apart from these ancient Buddhist monasteries set up by Zangpo, his contemporaries of other [[Buddhist sects]] built many more monasteries. This activity thus further continued in the subsequent centuries under the four main traditions of [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]], [[Gelug]], and [[Sakya]], categorised as per teachings into three \"[[Yana (Buddhism)|vehicles]]\":[[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]. These monasteries are mostly in the Spiti, Lahaul and Kinnaur valleys. Some of the well known monasteries are [[Gandhola Monastery]] ([[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa]] [[Kargyu]] sect) [[Guru Ghantal Monastery]], [[Kardang Monastery]] (Drukpa sect), [[Shashur Monastery]], [[Tayul Monastery]] and [[Gemur Monastery]] in the Lahaul Valley, [[Dhankar Monastery]], [[Kaza Monastery]], [[Kye Monastery]], [[Tangyud Monastery]] ([[Sakya]] sect), [[Kungri Monastery]] (of the [[Nyingma]] sect), [[Kardang Monastery]] (Drukpa Kagyu sect) and [[Kibber|Kibber Monastery]] in the Spiti Valley, and the [[Bir Tibetan|Bir Monasteries]] ([[Bir Tibetan]] monasteries of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya sects) in the Kangra valley.<ref name=Handa/><ref name=himachal>{{Cite web|url=http://hplahaulspiti.gov.in/Monasteries.htm#KARDANG|title=Tourism:Monasteries|accessdate=2010-01-17|publisher=Government of Himachal Pradesh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428093752/http://hplahaulspiti.gov.in/Monasteries.htm#KARDANG#KARDANG|archive-date=28 April 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kalachakra Temple.jpg|thumb|Kalachakra Temple]]\nThe very earliest influence of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh is traced to the [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashokan]] period in the 3rd century BC.

In the 7th century, [[King Songtsen Gampo]] of Tibet had deputed Thomi Sambota to visit [[Buddhist]] [[Vihara]]s in India to imbibe more of [[Indian Buddhism|Indian Buddhist]] knowledge. It was in 749 AD that Padmasambhava (hailed as the second Buddha) with his compatriot [[Shantarakshita]] established the [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] in the Western Himalayan region.<ref name=Handa/> [[Rewalsar lake]] at [[Rewalsar, India|Rewalsar]] in [[Mandi district]] is where Padmasambhava (literal meaning \"lotus born\") is said to have meditated for long years.

[[Numismatic]] evidence has established the presence of Buddhism in the Kuluta region (upper Beas region of the Kuluta Kingdom) of the state in the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD. On the [[Palampur]]-Malan- Dadh-[[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]] road,{{convert|2.5|km|mi}} from Malan rock inscriptions in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] and [[Kharoshti]] scripts of 3rd and 2nd century BC have been discovered on a single granite rock known as ''Lakhina pathar'', which are supported by the Buddhist monuments at Chahri; inscribed pedestals of [[Vajravarahi]] (Buddhist [[Vajrayana|tantric]] goddess) is dated to 5th or early 6th century. Handa's archaeological explorations have also unearthed a headless stone image of Buddha (now in the [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] Museum) at sites of Chetru and Kanhiara villages; Chetru in local lingua is interpreted as [[Chaitya]] in [[Sanskrit]]. Names such as Matth and [[Trilokinath]] and dozen [[mutts|maths]] in Kangra and Mandi districts further point to Buddhist establishments between the 3rd century BC and 6th century AD. Cave type (''guha'' type) Buddhist monastery at Gandhala has been inferred from a copper lot (pot), chased with [[Jataka]] episode discovered in a monastic cell in [[Kullu]] subdivision of the Kangra division which is dated to the 2nd century AD. Trilokinath and Gandhala (also known as [[Guru Ghantal]]), beyond [[Rohtang la]] pass are considered classical Buddhist shrines of [[Indian Buddhism]] (inferred to predate Padmasmbhava's times by many centuries). Discovery of marble head (7th or 8th century AD) of [[Avalokiteshvara]] at the confluence of [[Chandra River|Chandra]] and Bhagha Rivers support evidence of monastic activities in these remote regions.<ref name=\"Handa p.75-80.\">Handa p.75-80</ref>\n\nArchaeological evidence also supports the influence of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] influence prior to the 8th century in the region east of Sutlej river. Cult powers of Padmasambhava, before he went to Tibet (before 747 AD), are also deciphered from legends at [[Nako, India|Nako]] in Kinnaur, Trilokinath and Gandhala in Lahaul, and Rewalsar in Mandi district. From the mid 8th century (after 747 AD) evidence of Buddhist activities remain obscure till Tibetan Buddhism penetrated the region in the 10th century.<ref name=\"Handa p.86.\">Handa p.86</ref>\n\n[[Rinchen Zangpo]] was urged by Buddhist Guru Shantarakshita from Kashmir, who had already established a monastic order in Tibet, to travel around to spread Buddhism in the trans-Himalayan region. At that time, Zangpo was teaching in Kashmir. He embarked on his campaign to teach Buddhism in the trans-Himalayan region by travelling through Lahaul, Spiti and Kinnaur valleys of the [[Sutlej River]] valley, in Himachal Pradesh, then to [[Ladakh]] and further on to Tibet, [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]]. He established [[Buddhist]] [[Dharma]] in all these regions. This period was called the \"Second Coming\" of Buddhism in the region since earlier efforts made had not progressed much.<ref name=\"sects\"/> It is said that Zangpo's persistence of amalgamating Tibetan Buddhism into the Indian creed was the \"Second Advancement\" or \"Second Coming\", also called the \"Classical Period\". Since then, Tibetan Buddhism has also imbibed many of the religious practices and culture of India. Buddhist monastic art and architecture thus went through a sea change.<ref name=Handa/>\n \nAnother Buddhist [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] [[Atisha|Guru Deepankara Srijnana]] ([[Atisha]]) (982\u20131054) was held in high esteem during the period of Zangpo. He had a great influence on Zangpo in teaching the finer aspects of Tantric texts in Sanskrit and the translated texts in [[Old Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Under Atisha's influence there was conceptual reformation of primitive Buddhism in Tibet into the [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which laid stress on \"celibacy and morality\". This resulted in the evolution of a reformed sect known as [[Kadampa|Kahdampa]], which eventually got subsumed under the [[Gelukpa]] [[sect]]. This reformation also caused further break-up of Buddhism under several sects and sub sects. The Kings of Guge had a significant role in propagation of the religion, which had strong influence on the architectural planning of Tibetan monasteries. One of the Guge brothers, Chang chub-O, had even got the [[Tabo Monastery]] in Spiti refurbished. But Tibet was fragmented under the influence of its various sects and subsects, which attracted [[Mongol]] invasion. Three events in the 13th century had profound effect on Tibetan Buddhism; one was [[Chengiz Khan]]'s invasion of Tibet in 1206; the second event in the second half of thirteenth century was that of the then Chinese ruler [[Kublai Khan]]'s (of [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], who later became a Buddhist); and the third of Kashmir, which until then had been a stronghold of Buddhism, going under Muslim rule after 1339, putting an end to cultural communication with India. Mongol invasion is also credited with uniting Tibet under the institution of the Dalai Lama. While the Mongols favoured the [[Sakya]] sect, the [[Ming dynasty]] (Chinese) favoured [[Kargyupa]] and Kahdampa sects; but these actions resulted in inter-sectoral rivalry and even destruction of each other's monasteries. It was during this period that monasteries were also built on hilltops and many were also well fortified. The period between 1300 AD and 1850 AD marked the development of hill-top monasteries and examples of this type in the western Himalayan region are the [[Ki Monastery]] in Spiti and the [[Hemis Monastery]] in [[Ladakh]].<ref name=\"Handa p.94-97\">Handa pp.94\u201397</ref>\n\nThus, from the 14th century onwards, the monasteries had adopted a fort-like design for its buildings from logistic considerations and built them as \"religio-military strongholds\"; many of them have disappeared due to invasions but some have survived in Ladakh and Spiti valleys in India. Zangpo's \"Classical monasteries\" in Western Tibet, in Lahaul, Spiti and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh, and in Ladakh have survived and are fairly well preserved for posterity. However, instances of greed and neglect have been reported in some monasteries.<ref name=Handa/>\n\n;Tibetan immigration\nThe Khadamp sect, which was reorganised as \"Gelukpa sect\" at the start of the 15th century by [[Tsongkhapa]] has dominated Tibet and became the \"Spiritual and Temporal Authority of Tibet\" with the Dalai Lama invested with full authority of this sect. While the founder Lama of Gelukpa sect was Tsongkhapa, his nephew [[Gendun Drup]] was the first Grand Lama and since then the mantle has been passed on to the subsequent Lamas under a [[Reincarnation]] theory of succession. The fifth Dalai Lama subsumed all of the other sub-sects under his control,{{fix|text=This was uninterrupted?}} with his headquarters at [[Lhasa]] as the supreme head of Buddhism in Tibet. The Dalai Lamas also held some political power in certain areas of Tibet until the [[14th Dalai Lama]] emigrated to India in 1959.<ref name=\"Handa p.97-99\">Handa pp.97\u201399</ref>\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama established his \"Government in exile\", in 1960 at Mcleod Ganj in the upper part of the town of Dharamshala. This has since become the nerve centre of Tibetan Buddhism with the Tibetan refugees establishing monasteries of their sects, such as the Gelukpa, Sakyapa, Kargyupa, Nyingmapa, Chonangpa and Dragung-Kargyupa; Non-Buddhist of [[B\u00f6n]] religion also have established their monastery here. Over 40 monasteries (unofficial records) of these sects have been reported.<ref name=\"Handa p.218-219.\">Handa pp.218\u2013219</ref>\n\nIn order to educate ethnic Tibetan youths in Dharamshala and the Himalayan border students of India, the [[Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies]] (CIHTS) was established at [[Varanasi]] by Pt. [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]] in consultation with the Dalai Lama. The Institute, a [[Deemed University]] since 1988, is currently headed by Prof. Ngawang Samten, assisted by faculty members of the Institute.

The Rewalsar Lake ('Tso Pema' or 'Pad-ma-can' to [[Tibetans]]) has a legend that started the belief that on the islands of floating reeds of the lake the spirit of Padmasambhava's resides. According to folk legend, Padmasmabhava tried to teach Buddhist dharma to the daughter (Mandarava) of the King of Mandi, Arshadhara of [[Sahor]], which was seriously resented by the King. It is also mentioned that Mandarva was enamoured of Padmasambhava of [[Nalanda]]. The King, therefore, ordered Padmasambhava to be burnt alive. However, the pyre burned for a full week, with great clouds of black smoke arising from it and a lake appeared there after a week at the spot where he was supposed to have been burnt. Then, Padmasambhava (also known as Vajracharya), unscathed by the fire, is said to have appeared seated on a full-blown lotus from within a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] in the middle of the lake. One version states that the King, as a repentance for his wrong actions, married his daughter with Padmasambhava. Another version states that Mandarava (stated to be the sister of [[Shantarakshita]]) as repentance, left her parents' house, and meditated near a well, which has now become a shrine (worshipped by Tibetan Buddhists as a manifestation of [[Shakthi]]). It was from this lake that Padmasambhava travelled to Tibet to spread the Vajrayana Buddhism.<ref name=tourism/><ref name=legend/><ref name=\"Handa p.214-216.\">Handa pp.214\u2013216</ref> Rawalsar has two monasteries, namely, the Drikung Kagyu Gompa and Tso-Pema Ogyen Heru-kai Nyingmapa Gompa.<ref name=mandi/><ref name=Rawalsar/><ref name=Tribune>{{cite web|title = Devotees throng Rewalsar| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040229/himachal.htm#6|accessdate = 2010-01-19}}</ref>\n\nTo commemorate Padmasmabahava (so named after he emerged from the Padmacan lake or lotus lake), a monastery was built on the western shore of the lake, called the Nyingmapa Monastery (built in Central Tibetan fashion), which has been expanded manifold into a multistoreyed [[pagoda]] type structure, with several renovations done till the late 19th century.

It was severely damaged in the [[1975 Kinnaur earthquake]] and has since been re-built with a new ''Dukhang'' (assembly hall). The Dalai Lama held the [[Kalachakra]] ceremonies here in 1983 and 1996. The year 1996 marked 1000 years of Tabo Monastery's existence. A number of caves carved into the cliff face are located above the monastery, which are used by monks for meditation. The monastery is studded with large collection of precious [[Thangka]] (scroll paintings), [[manuscripts]], well-preserved statues, frescos and extensive murals that cover almost every wall. The monastery is a national historic treasure of India and preserved by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]].<ref name=Behl/>\n\nThe few original paintings of [[Bodhisattvas]], from the period of the renovation of Tabo monastery in 1042, seen in the Dukong (assembly hall), are similar in style to those seen at [[Alchi Monastery]] in its aesthetic elegance. These have a gentle form with stress on unique detailing of textiles and ornaments. The paintings in the assembly hall are dedicated to [[Vairochana]]. Also seen are paintings of two narrative sequences namely, the first narrative is about the visit by [[Sudhana]], a merchant's son, deputed by [[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]], on a spiritual mission, while the second narrative depicts the life of the Buddha.

It is built like a fortified castle on the edge of a deep canyon, with massive slanted mud walls and battlements with vertical red ochre and white vertical stripes which make them look much taller than they really are. It is at an altitude of {{convert|4587|m|ft}}, on the edge of a deep canyon and overlooking the town of [[Kaza, Himachal Pradesh|Kaza]], {{convert|4|km|mi}} from the town. It is one of only two monasteries belonging to the Sakya sect left in Spiti \u2013 the other, at Kaza itself, is small and relatively insignificant. It is thought, however, that there was an earlier [[Kadampa]] establishment here founded by [[Rinchen Zangpo]] (958\u20131055 AD) and named ''Rador-lha''. The name, Tangyud, may refer to the Sakya revision of the ''Tang-rGyud'', or the 87 volumes of Tantra treatises which form part of the [[Tengyur]]; this was done around 1310 AD by a team of scholars under the Sakya lama, Ch'os-Kyi-O'd-zer. The unplanned arrangement of the monastery is attributed to several modifications carried out after it was ransacked by invasions of Central Tibet by Mongols, in 1655 AD. The monastery is also famous for the expertise of the Sakyapa tantric cult that even dacoits are scared to rob this monastery.<ref name=\"Handa p.139-140.\">Handa p.139-140</ref><ref>Kapadia p. 204</ref>\n\n===Dhankar Monastery===\n{{Further|Dhankar Gompa}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Dhankar.jpg \n| width1 = 190\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  Prayer-flags-in-dhankar.jpg \n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[Dhankar Monastery]] \u2013 a Fort monastery at {{convert|3894|m|ft}} altitude.

Below this Gompa is the small village of Shichilling where the new Dhankar Monastery has been built. It is home to about 150 monks belonging to the Gelukpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism.

In the 1840s, it was also ravaged by fire and in 1975 a violent earthquake caused more damage, which was repaired with the help of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and the State Public Works Department. The successive trails of destruction and patch-up jobs have resulted in a haphazard growth of box-like structures, and so the monastery looks like a fort, where temples are built on top of one another.

The spread of [[Buddhism]] in the region has occurred intermediately throughout its history. Starting in the 3rd century BCE, Buddhism was propagated by the [[Maurya Empire]] under the reign of [[Ashoka]]. The region would remain an important center for Buddhism under the [[Kushan Empire]] and its vassals.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tG0fnF0VRk0C&pg=PA72&dq=buddhism+himachal+pradesh+history&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjplbOxj5jkAhVQTd8KHQswCTwQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=buddhism%20himachal%20pradesh%20history&f=false|title=Social, Cultural, and Economic History of Himachal Pradesh|last=Ahluwalia|first=Manjit Singh|date=1998|publisher=Indus Publishing|isbn=9788173870897|language=en}}</ref> Over the centuries the following of Buddhism has greatly fluctuated. Yet by experiencing revivals and migrations, Buddhism continued to be rooted in the region, particularly in the [[Lahaul]], [[Spiti Valley|Spiti]] and [[Kinnaur]] valleys.\n\nAfter the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]], escaped from Tibet with his followers in 1959 and took refuge in India, the focus on [[Tibetan Buddhism]] spread further and attracted immense international sympathy and support. The Dalai Lama found [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]] in Himachal Pradesh as an ideal place to establish his \"capital in exile\" at [[McLeod Ganj]] in close vicinity to Dharamshala, and is called the '''Little Lhasa''' and also as '''Dhasa''' (a combination of Dharamshala and [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]]). This situation has given the state a unique status in the global firmament of Buddhist traditions. It is now the cradle of Tibetan Buddhism, with its undeniable link to the past activities initiated in the 8th century (in 747 AD) by Guru [[Padmasambhava]] (who went to Tibet from [[Rewalsar, India|Rewalsar]] in Himachal Pradesh in [[North India]] to spread Buddhism), who was known as the \"Guru Rinpoche\" and the \"Second Buddha\".<ref name=\"Lama\">{{Cite web|url=http://namgyalmonastery.org/hhdl|title=His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyaltso|accessdate=2010-01-17|publisher=Namgyal Monastery|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012005104/http://namgyalmonastery.org/hhdl|archivedate=12 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Behl\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2122/stories/20041105000106500.htm |title=Trans-Himalayan Murals |author=Benoy K.

Of the 21 scholars he had sent to revive Buddhism in the Trans Himalayan region, only two had survived, and one of them was the famous scholar-translator [[Rinchen Zangpo]] who transfused Buddhist activity in the state of Himachal Pradesh. Known by the epithet \"Lohtsawa\" or the \"Great Translator\", Zangpo built 108 monasteries in the trans-Himalayan region to spread Buddhism, which are considered as the main stay of [[Vajrayana]] of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (also known as [[Lamaism]]). He institutionalised Buddhism in this region. Zangpo had engaged Kashmiri artists who created wall paintings and sculptures in these legendary 108 monasteries; only a few of these have survived in Himachal Pradesh namely, the [[Lhalung Monastery]], [[Nako, India|Nako Gompa]] in Spiti and [[Tabo Monastery]] in Spiti, the last named monastery is known as the [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] of the [[Himalayas]]. In Himachal Pradesh, apart from these ancient Buddhist monasteries set up by Zangpo, his contemporaries of other [[Buddhist sects]] built many more monasteries. This activity thus further continued in the subsequent centuries under the four main traditions of [[Nyingma]], [[Kagyu]], [[Gelug]], and [[Sakya]], categorised as per teachings into three \"[[Yana (Buddhism)|vehicles]]\":[[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]]. These monasteries are mostly in the Spiti, Lahaul and Kinnaur valleys. Some of the well known monasteries are [[Gandhola Monastery]] ([[Drukpa Lineage|Drukpa]] [[Kargyu]] sect) [[Guru Ghantal Monastery]], [[Kardang Monastery]] (Drukpa sect), [[Shashur Monastery]], [[Tayul Monastery]] and [[Gemur Monastery]] in the Lahaul Valley, [[Dhankar Monastery]], [[Kaza Monastery]], [[Kye Monastery]], [[Tangyud Monastery]] ([[Sakya]] sect), [[Kungri Monastery]] (of the [[Nyingma]] sect), [[Kardang Monastery]] (Drukpa Kagyu sect) and [[Kibber|Kibber Monastery]] in the Spiti Valley, and the [[Bir Tibetan|Bir Monasteries]] ([[Bir Tibetan]] monasteries of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Sakya sects) in the Kangra valley.<ref name=Handa/><ref name=himachal>{{Cite web|url=http://hplahaulspiti.gov.in/Monasteries.htm#KARDANG|title=Tourism:Monasteries|accessdate=2010-01-17|publisher=Government of Himachal Pradesh|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428093752/http://hplahaulspiti.gov.in/Monasteries.htm#KARDANG#KARDANG|archive-date=28 April 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kalachakra Temple.jpg|thumb|Kalachakra Temple]]\nThe very earliest influence of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh is traced to the [[Emperor Ashoka|Ashokan]] period in the 3rd century BC. He had established many stupas, and one of them was traced to the state in the [[Kulu valley]], as cited in the chronicles of the [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] travellers.<ref name=tourism>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/destinations/himachal-pradesh.html|title=Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh|accessdate=2010-01-17|publisher=Buddhist Tourism|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100802074210/http://www.buddhist-tourism.com/countries/india/destinations/himachal-pradesh.html#|archive-date=2 August 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Mention is also made of a much earlier propagation during Buddha's time itself by Sthavira Angira and Stavira Kanakavatsa, in the [[Mount Kailash|Kailash]] area and [[Kashmir]] respectively. In the 7th century, [[King Songtsen Gampo]] of Tibet had deputed Thomi Sambota to visit [[Buddhist]] [[Vihara]]s in India to imbibe more of [[Indian Buddhism|Indian Buddhist]] knowledge. It was in 749 AD that Padmasambhava (hailed as the second Buddha) with his compatriot [[Shantarakshita]] established the [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] in the Western Himalayan region.<ref name=Handa/> [[Rewalsar lake]] at [[Rewalsar, India|Rewalsar]] in [[Mandi district]] is where Padmasambhava (literal meaning \"lotus born\") is said to have meditated for long years.

[[Numismatic]] evidence has established the presence of Buddhism in the Kuluta region (upper Beas region of the Kuluta Kingdom) of the state in the 1st century BC and 2nd century AD. On the [[Palampur]]-Malan- Dadh-[[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]] road,{{convert|2.5|km|mi}} from Malan rock inscriptions in [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] and [[Kharoshti]] scripts of 3rd and 2nd century BC have been discovered on a single granite rock known as ''Lakhina pathar'', which are supported by the Buddhist monuments at Chahri; inscribed pedestals of [[Vajravarahi]] (Buddhist [[Vajrayana|tantric]] goddess) is dated to 5th or early 6th century. Handa's archaeological explorations have also unearthed a headless stone image of Buddha (now in the [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] Museum) at sites of Chetru and Kanhiara villages; Chetru in local lingua is interpreted as [[Chaitya]] in [[Sanskrit]]. Names such as Matth and [[Trilokinath]] and dozen [[mutts|maths]] in Kangra and Mandi districts further point to Buddhist establishments between the 3rd century BC and 6th century AD. Cave type (''guha'' type) Buddhist monastery at Gandhala has been inferred from a copper lot (pot), chased with [[Jataka]] episode discovered in a monastic cell in [[Kullu]] subdivision of the Kangra division which is dated to the 2nd century AD. Trilokinath and Gandhala (also known as [[Guru Ghantal]]), beyond [[Rohtang la]] pass are considered classical Buddhist shrines of [[Indian Buddhism]] (inferred to predate Padmasmbhava's times by many centuries). Discovery of marble head (7th or 8th century AD) of [[Avalokiteshvara]] at the confluence of [[Chandra River|Chandra]] and Bhagha Rivers support evidence of monastic activities in these remote regions.<ref name=\"Handa p.75-80.\">Handa p.75-80</ref>\n\nArchaeological evidence also supports the influence of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] influence prior to the 8th century in the region east of Sutlej river. Cult powers of Padmasambhava, before he went to Tibet (before 747 AD), are also deciphered from legends at [[Nako, India|Nako]] in Kinnaur, Trilokinath and Gandhala in Lahaul, and Rewalsar in Mandi district. From the mid 8th century (after 747 AD) evidence of Buddhist activities remain obscure till Tibetan Buddhism penetrated the region in the 10th century.<ref name=\"Handa p.86.\">Handa p.86</ref>\n\n[[Rinchen Zangpo]] was urged by Buddhist Guru Shantarakshita from Kashmir, who had already established a monastic order in Tibet, to travel around to spread Buddhism in the trans-Himalayan region. At that time, Zangpo was teaching in Kashmir. He embarked on his campaign to teach Buddhism in the trans-Himalayan region by travelling through Lahaul, Spiti and Kinnaur valleys of the [[Sutlej River]] valley, in Himachal Pradesh, then to [[Ladakh]] and further on to Tibet, [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]] and [[Bhutan]]. He established [[Buddhist]] [[Dharma]] in all these regions. This period was called the \"Second Coming\" of Buddhism in the region since earlier efforts made had not progressed much.<ref name=\"sects\"/> It is said that Zangpo's persistence of amalgamating Tibetan Buddhism into the Indian creed was the \"Second Advancement\" or \"Second Coming\", also called the \"Classical Period\". Since then, Tibetan Buddhism has also imbibed many of the religious practices and culture of India. Buddhist monastic art and architecture thus went through a sea change.<ref name=Handa/>\n \nAnother Buddhist [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] [[Atisha|Guru Deepankara Srijnana]] ([[Atisha]]) (982\u20131054) was held in high esteem during the period of Zangpo. He had a great influence on Zangpo in teaching the finer aspects of Tantric texts in Sanskrit and the translated texts in [[Old Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Under Atisha's influence there was conceptual reformation of primitive Buddhism in Tibet into the [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which laid stress on \"celibacy and morality\". This resulted in the evolution of a reformed sect known as [[Kadampa|Kahdampa]], which eventually got subsumed under the [[Gelukpa]] [[sect]]. This reformation also caused further break-up of Buddhism under several sects and sub sects. The Kings of Guge had a significant role in propagation of the religion, which had strong influence on the architectural planning of Tibetan monasteries. One of the Guge brothers, Chang chub-O, had even got the [[Tabo Monastery]] in Spiti refurbished. But Tibet was fragmented under the influence of its various sects and subsects, which attracted [[Mongol]] invasion. Three events in the 13th century had profound effect on Tibetan Buddhism; one was [[Chengiz Khan]]'s invasion of Tibet in 1206; the second event in the second half of thirteenth century was that of the then Chinese ruler [[Kublai Khan]]'s (of Yunan, who later became a Buddhist); and the third of Kashmir, which until then had been a stronghold of Buddhism, going under Muslim rule after 1339, putting an end to cultural communication with India. Mongol invasion is also credited with uniting Tibet under the institution of the Dalai Lama. While the Mongols favoured the [[Sakya]] sect, the [[Ming dynasty]] (Chinese) favoured [[Kargyupa]] and Kahdampa sects; but these actions resulted in inter-sectoral rivalry and even destruction of each other's monasteries. It was during this period that monasteries were also built on hilltops and many were also well fortified. The period between 1300 AD and 1850 AD marked the development of hill-top monasteries and examples of this type in the western Himalayan region are the [[Ki Monastery]] in Spiti and the [[Hemis Monastery]] in [[Ladakh]].<ref name=\"Handa p.94-97\">Handa pp.94\u201397</ref>\n\nThus, from the 14th century onwards, the monasteries had adopted a fort-like design for its buildings from logistic considerations and built them as \"religio-military strongholds\"; many of them have disappeared due to invasions but some have survived in Ladakh and Spiti valleys in India. Zangpo's \"Classical monasteries\" in Western Tibet, in Lahaul, Spiti and Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh, and in Ladakh have survived and are fairly well preserved for posterity. However, instances of greed and neglect have been reported in some monasteries.<ref name=Handa/>\n\n;Tibetan immigration\nThe Khadamp sect, which was reorganised as \"Gelukpa sect\" at the start of the 15th century by [[Tsongkhapa]] has dominated Tibet and became the \"Spiritual and Temporal Authority of Tibet\" with the Dalai Lama invested with full authority of this sect. While the founder Lama of Gelukpa sect was Tsongkhapa, his nephew [[Gendun Drup]] was the first Grand Lama and since then the mantle has been passed on to the subsequent Lamas under a [[Reincarnation]] theory of succession. The fifth Dalai Lama subsumed all of the other sub-sects under his control,{{fix|text=This was uninterrupted?}} with his headquarters at [[Lhasa]] as the supreme head of Buddhism in Tibet. The Dalai Lamas also held some political power in certain areas of Tibet until the [[14th Dalai Lama]] emigrated to India in 1959.<ref name=\"Handa p.97-99\">Handa pp.97\u201399</ref>\n\nThe 14th Dalai Lama established his \"Government in exile\", in 1960 at Mcleod Ganj in the upper part of the town of Dharamshala. This has since become the nerve centre of Tibetan Buddhism with the Tibetan refugees establishing monasteries of their sects, such as the Gelukpa, Sakyapa, Kargyupa, Nyingmapa, Chonangpa and Dragung-Kargyupa; Non-Buddhist of [[B\u00f6n]] religion also have established their monastery here. Over 40 monasteries (unofficial records) of these sects have been reported.<ref name=\"Handa p.218-219.\">Handa pp.218\u2013219</ref>\n\nIn order to educate ethnic Tibetan youths in Dharamshala and the Himalayan border students of India, the [[Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies]] (CIHTS) was established at [[Varanasi]] by Pt. [[Jawahar Lal Nehru]] in consultation with the Dalai Lama. The Institute, a [[Deemed University]] since 1988, is currently headed by Prof. Ngawang Samten, assisted by faculty members of the Institute. Its primary goal is to achieve excellence in the field of [[Tibetology]], [[Buddhology]] and Himalayan Studies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiaeducation.ernet.in/insitutions/PROFILE.ASP?no=U01486|title=India education|accessdate=2010-01-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624031956/http://www.indiaeducation.ernet.in/insitutions/PROFILE.ASP?no=U01486|archivedate=24 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.smith.edu/cihts/|title=Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies|accessdate=2010-01-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091130070634/http://www.smith.edu/cihts/|archivedate=30 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Earliest lake and monasteries==\nThe earliest reverential link according to Padmasmabhava's legend is to the Rewalsar lake at Rewalsar in [[Mandi district]] of Himachal Pradesh where Padmasambhava is said to have meditated.

The Rewalsar Lake ('Tso Pema' or 'Pad-ma-can' to [[Tibetans]]) has a legend that started the belief that on the islands of floating reeds of the lake the spirit of Padmasambhava's resides. According to folk legend, Padmasmabhava tried to teach Buddhist dharma to the daughter (Mandarava) of the King of Mandi, Arshadhara of [[Sahor]], which was seriously resented by the King. It is also mentioned that Mandarva was enamoured of Padmasambhava of [[Nalanda]]. The King, therefore, ordered Padmasambhava to be burnt alive. However, the pyre burned for a full week, with great clouds of black smoke arising from it and a lake appeared there after a week at the spot where he was supposed to have been burnt. Then, Padmasambhava (also known as Vajracharya), unscathed by the fire, is said to have appeared seated on a full-blown lotus from within a [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] in the middle of the lake. One version states that the King, as a repentance for his wrong actions, married his daughter with Padmasambhava. Another version states that Mandarava (stated to be the sister of [[Shantarakshita]]) as repentance, left her parents' house, and meditated near a well, which has now become a shrine (worshipped by Tibetan Buddhists as a manifestation of [[Shakthi]]). It was from this lake that Padmasambhava travelled to Tibet to spread the Vajrayana Buddhism.<ref name=tourism/><ref name=legend/><ref name=\"Handa p.214-216.\">Handa pp.214\u2013216</ref> Rawalsar has two monasteries, namely, the Drikung Kagyu Gompa and Tso-Pema Ogyen Heru-kai Nyingmapa Gompa.<ref name=mandi/><ref name=Rawalsar/><ref name=Tribune>{{cite web|title = Devotees throng Rewalsar| url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040229/himachal.htm#6|accessdate = 2010-01-19}}</ref>\n\nTo commemorate Padmasmabahava (so named after he emerged from the Padmacan lake or lotus lake), a monastery was built on the western shore of the lake, called the Nyingmapa Monastery (built in Central Tibetan fashion), which has been expanded manifold into a multistoreyed [[pagoda]] type structure, with several renovations done till the late 19th century. A large gilded statue of Padmasambahava in the formal attire as the manifestation of Guru Rinpoche is deified here. There are two other new monasteries built around the ancient monastery; these are the [[Drigung Kagyu Monastery]] of the Kagyupa order and the other monastery called the [[Tso-Pema Ogyen Heru-kai Nyingmapa Gompa]] of the Nyingma sect; though of modern construction these two have retained the aesthetic Tibetan architectural ambience.<ref name=\"Handa p.214-216.\"/>\n\nIn 2004, to commemorate the birthday of Padmasambhava, the [[Tsechu]] fair was held here, after a gap of 12 years.

The year 1996 marked 1000 years of Tabo Monastery's existence. A number of caves carved into the cliff face are located above the monastery, which are used by monks for meditation. The monastery is studded with large collection of precious [[Thangka]] (scroll paintings), [[manuscripts]], well-preserved statues, frescos and extensive murals that cover almost every wall.

These have a gentle form with stress on unique detailing of textiles and ornaments. The paintings in the assembly hall are dedicated to [[Vairochana]]. Also seen are paintings of two narrative sequences namely, the first narrative is about the visit by [[Sudhana]], a merchant's son, deputed by [[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]], on a spiritual mission, while the second narrative depicts the life of the Buddha.

Of these, Tangyud monastery, Dhankar monastery and Key monastery in Spiti valley are some of the well known ones.\n\n===Tangyud Monastery===\n{{Further|Tangyud Monastery}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Sakya Tangyuth Gompa Tsewang & Tashi.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  Spiti Sakya Tangyuth Gompa 2.jpg\n| width2 = 200\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: Castle type [[Tangyud Monastery]], [[Spiti]] valley. Right: Inside Assembly Hall, [[Tangyud Monastery]], [[Spiti]]\n}}\n\nThe [[Tangyud Monastery]] in the Spiti valley was built in the early 14th century  when the Sakyapas rose to power under [[Mongolia|Mongol]] patronage. It is built like a fortified castle on the edge of a deep canyon, with massive slanted mud walls and battlements with vertical red ochre and white vertical stripes which make them look much taller than they really are. It is at an altitude of {{convert|4587|m|ft}}, on the edge of a deep canyon and overlooking the town of [[Kaza, Himachal Pradesh|Kaza]], {{convert|4|km|mi}} from the town. It is one of only two monasteries belonging to the Sakya sect left in Spiti \u2013 the other, at Kaza itself, is small and relatively insignificant. It is thought, however, that there was an earlier [[Kadampa]] establishment here founded by [[Rinchen Zangpo]] (958\u20131055 AD) and named ''Rador-lha''. The name, Tangyud, may refer to the Sakya revision of the ''Tang-rGyud'', or the 87 volumes of Tantra treatises which form part of the [[Tengyur]]; this was done around 1310 AD by a team of scholars under the Sakya lama, Ch'os-Kyi-O'd-zer. The unplanned arrangement of the monastery is attributed to several modifications carried out after it was ransacked by invasions of Central Tibet by Mongols, in 1655 AD. The monastery is also famous for the expertise of the Sakyapa tantric cult that even dacoits are scared to rob this monastery.<ref name=\"Handa p.139-140.\">Handa p.139-140</ref><ref>Kapadia p. 204</ref>\n\n===Dhankar Monastery===\n{{Further|Dhankar Gompa}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 =  Dhankar.jpg \n| width1 = 190\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 =  Prayer-flags-in-dhankar.jpg \n| width2 = 100\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left: [[Dhankar Monastery]] \u2013 a Fort monastery at {{convert|3894|m|ft}} altitude.

It belongs to the Gelukpa order but claims to its earlier founding in the 12th century has put forth by the local monks. Below this Gompa is the small village of Shichilling where the new Dhankar Monastery has been built. It is home to about 150 monks belonging to the Gelukpa sect of Tibetan Buddhism.

In 1841, it was severely damaged by the [[Dogra]] army under [[Ghulam Khan (disambiguation)|Ghulam Khan]] and [[Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana|Rahim Khan.]] Later that same year it suffered more damage from a [[Sikh]] army. In the 1840s, it was also ravaged by fire and in 1975 a violent earthquake caused more damage, which was repaired with the help of the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] and the State Public Works Department. The successive trails of destruction and patch-up jobs have resulted in a haphazard growth of box-like structures, and so the monastery looks like a fort, where temples are built on top of one another.

Taylor was baptized at the Bethel Seventh-day Adventist Church in [[Florida City, Florida|Florida City]] by Pastor David Peay. He grew up in a low-income neighborhood in Miami, on a street lined with candy-colored houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/sports/football/09taylor.html|title=Taylor\u2019s Heart of Kindness Might Have Left Him Vulnerable|first=Juliet|last=Macur|date=December 9, 2007|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adventistreview.org/2007-1534-32|title=Sean Taylor--1534 Adventist News|website=Adventist Review|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n\nTaylor played high school football in [[Pinecrest, Florida|Pinecrest]], a suburb of Miami. He originally began his high school football career at [[Miami Killian High School]], a Class 2A public school, but transferred to [[Gulliver Preparatory School]], a Class prep school, where he was a three-sport star in football, track and basketball. He played both [[Offense (sports)|offense]] and [[Defense (sport)|defense]]. Despite missing the first game of the season (the team's only loss), he helped Gulliver win the Florida Class 2A State Championship in 2000 with a 14\u20131 record. Taylor was a star on both sides of the ball during that season, playing [[running back]], [[defensive back]] and [[linebacker]].<ref name=heraldupdate1>Beras, Erika. [http://www.miamiherald.com/588/story/321952.html NFL's Taylor responsive after shooting]. ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.

He also compiled more than 100 tackles during the season and scored three touchdowns (two receiving, one rushing) in the state title game victory over [[Marianna High School]]. In [[track & field]], Taylor won the state 2A [[100-meter dash]] in 2000 and was also one of the state's top [[400-meter dash]] sprinters. At Gulliver, Taylor was a teammate of future NFL player [[Buck Ortega]]. His championship HS team was coached by [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], Ralph Ortega, Dirk Moran, Lee Horn, Dave Burns, and John McCloskey.\n\nTaylor was considered the No. 1 prospect in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. He was also rated the nation's No. 1 skill athlete and an All-American by ''[[Super Prep]]''. Taylor was also an ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' Super Southern Team selection, the No. 1 athlete on the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' Super 75 list and rated the No. 1 player in Florida by ''[[The Gainesville Sun]]''.\n\nIn 2007, he was also named to the [[FHSAA's All-Century Team|Florida High School Association All-Century Team]], which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state. After his death, Taylor was honored at Gulliver by a plaque that was placed in the school's cafeteria.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3135111 | work=ESPN | title=In life, and in death, Taylor was a natural mystery | date=December 2, 2007}}</ref> The football field at Gulliver Prep was renamed Sean Taylor Memorial Field on September 5, 2009.\n\n==College career==\nTaylor was recruited to play for coach [[Larry Coker]]'s [[Miami Hurricanes football]] team at the [[University of Miami]]. He was also a member of the Hurricanes [[track & field]] team, competing in events such as the 100-meter and 200-meters.\n\n===2001 season===\nAs a freshman (one of four true freshmen to play for the team), Taylor carved a niche for himself in Miami's secondary in nickel and dime defensive schemes. During the season, Taylor was named Big East [[Big East Conference football awards|Special Teams Player of the Week]] for his performance against the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]].<ref name=heraldupdate1 /> The Hurricanes won the national championship in 2001.\n\n===2002 season===\nIn 2002, his first season as a starter, Taylor was a second-team All-Big East selection by the league's head coaches. He finished third on the team in tackles with 85 (53 solo), broke up 15 passes, intercepted 4 passes, forced one fumble, blocked one kick and returned a punt for a touchdown. He led all Miami defensive backs in tackles, interceptions and passes broken up, and had a career-high 11 tackles (2 solo) and intercepted 2 passes in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] loss to [[Ohio State University football|Ohio State]]. He made a critical play during the game, in which he intercepted Buckeyes quarterback [[Craig Krenzel]] in the endzone and returned the ball out of the endzone. Buckeyes running back [[Maurice Clarett]] ran Taylor down, and in the process stripped the ball away from him. Clarett recovered the ball for Ohio State, allowing them to kick a field goal to go up 17\u20137 at the time.\n\n===2003 season===\nTaylor produced a historic season during his final year at Miami that culminated with a plethora of honors and awards. He was named a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big East Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the [[Jim Thorpe Award]], given to the nation's best defensive back. He led the Big East Conference and ranked first nationally in interceptions with 10, tying the record for interceptions in a season with former Hurricanes standout [[Bennie Blades]]. Taylor also finished first in total tackles with 77 (57 solo). He intercepted two passes in Miami's impressive 28\u201314 win over [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], playing a key role as the Hurricanes limited All-American receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]] to just three receptions for 26 yards.

He originally began his high school football career at [[Miami Killian High School]], a Class 2A public school, but transferred to [[Gulliver Preparatory School]], a Class prep school, where he was a three-sport star in football, track and basketball. He played both [[Offense (sports)|offense]] and [[Defense (sport)|defense]]. Despite missing the first game of the season (the team's only loss), he helped Gulliver win the Florida Class 2A State Championship in 2000 with a 14\u20131 record. Taylor was a star on both sides of the ball during that season, playing [[running back]], [[defensive back]] and [[linebacker]].<ref name=heraldupdate1>Beras, Erika. [http://www.miamiherald.com/588/story/321952.html NFL's Taylor responsive after shooting]. ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.

He also compiled more than 100 tackles during the season and scored three touchdowns (two receiving, one rushing) in the state title game victory over [[Marianna High School]]. In [[track & field]], Taylor won the state 2A [[100-meter dash]] in 2000 and was also one of the state's top [[400-meter dash]] sprinters. At Gulliver, Taylor was a teammate of future NFL player [[Buck Ortega]]. His championship HS team was coached by [[Steve Howey (footballer)|Steve Howey]], Ralph Ortega, Dirk Moran, Lee Horn, Dave Burns, and John McCloskey.\n\nTaylor was considered the No. 1 prospect in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]] by the ''[[Miami Herald]]''. He was also rated the nation's No. 1 skill athlete and an All-American by ''[[Super Prep]]''. Taylor was also an ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' Super Southern Team selection, the No. 1 athlete on the ''[[Florida Times-Union]]'' Super 75 list and rated the No. 1 player in Florida by ''[[The Gainesville Sun]]''.\n\nIn 2007, he was also named to the [[FHSAA's All-Century Team|Florida High School Association All-Century Team]], which selected the Top 33 players in the 100-year history of high school football in the state.

He was also a member of the Hurricanes [[track & field]] team, competing in events such as the 100-meter and 200-meters.\n\n===2001 season===\nAs a freshman (one of four true freshmen to play for the team), Taylor carved a niche for himself in Miami's secondary in nickel and dime defensive schemes. During the season, Taylor was named Big East [[Big East Conference football awards|Special Teams Player of the Week]] for his performance against the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]].<ref name=heraldupdate1 /> The Hurricanes won the national championship in 2001.\n\n===2002 season===\nIn 2002, his first season as a starter, Taylor was a second-team All-Big East selection by the league's head coaches. He finished third on the team in tackles with 85 (53 solo), broke up 15 passes, intercepted 4 passes, forced one fumble, blocked one kick and returned a punt for a touchdown. He led all Miami defensive backs in tackles, interceptions and passes broken up, and had a career-high 11 tackles (2 solo) and intercepted 2 passes in the [[Fiesta Bowl]] loss to [[Ohio State University football|Ohio State]]. He made a critical play during the game, in which he intercepted Buckeyes quarterback [[Craig Krenzel]] in the endzone and returned the ball out of the endzone. Buckeyes running back [[Maurice Clarett]] ran Taylor down, and in the process stripped the ball away from him. Clarett recovered the ball for Ohio State, allowing them to kick a field goal to go up 17\u20137 at the time.\n\n===2003 season===\nTaylor produced a historic season during his final year at Miami that culminated with a plethora of honors and awards. He was named a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big East Conference Defensive Player of the Year and a finalist for the [[Jim Thorpe Award]], given to the nation's best defensive back. He led the Big East Conference and ranked first nationally in interceptions with 10, tying the record for interceptions in a season with former Hurricanes standout [[Bennie Blades]]. Taylor also finished first in total tackles with 77 (57 solo). He intercepted two passes in Miami's impressive 28\u201314 win over [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]], playing a key role as the Hurricanes limited All-American receiver [[Larry Fitzgerald]] to just three receptions for 26 yards. He returned interceptions for an average of 18.4 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown return at [[Boston College football|Boston College]], a 50-yard scoring runback at [[Florida State University football|Florida State]] and a 44-yard scoring runback against [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]]. His three touchdown returns of interceptions is a Miami single-season record.\n\nTaylor also competed in [[track & field]] as a senior for the Hurricanes.

[[New Zealand]] and its surrounding islands are a distinctive sub-region of the Australasian realm.

The entire area has experienced a long period of biological isolation from other regions, and thus harbors a great many unique [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. In this context, Australasia is limited to Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, [[New Caledonia]], and neighbouring islands, including the [[Indonesia]]n islands from [[Lombok]] and [[Sulawesi]] eastward. \n\nThe [[Wallace Line]] to the west divides areas in the Indomalayan realm of tropical [[Asia]] which are or have at times been directly connected to the Asian mainland from islands that have never been so connected. [[Borneo]] and [[Bali]] lie on the western, Asian side. A second biological dividing line is [[Lydekker's Line]], which similarly separates islands isolated by surrounding deep water from those associated with the [[Sahul Shelf]] of the Australian continent. Islands between the two lines (e.g. Sulawesi, the Moluccas and Lombok through Timor) form the biogeographical area of [[Wallacea]], a transition zone between the Indomalayan and Australasian realms populated entirely by aerial or [[oceanic dispersal|oceanic]] dispersal (although defined here as part of the Australasian realm).\n\n==Geology==\nAustralia, New Zealand and New Caledonia are all fragments of the ancient supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the marks of which are still visible in the [[Christmas Island Seamount Province]] and other geophysical entities. These three land masses have been separated from other continents, and from one another, for tens millions of years. All of Australasia shares the [[Antarctic flora]], although the northern, tropical islands also share many plants with Southeast Asia.\n\nAustralia, New Guinea, and Tasmania are separated from one another by shallow [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], and were linked together when the sea level was lower during [[ice age]]s. They share a similar fauna which includes [[marsupial]] and [[monotreme]] mammals and [[ratite]] birds. [[Eucalypt]]s are the predominant trees in much of Australia and New Guinea. New Zealand has no native land mammals, but also had ratite birds, including the [[kiwi]] and the [[moa]]. The Australasian realm includes some nearby island groups, like [[Wallacea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]], which were not formerly part of Gondwana, but which share many characteristic plants and animals with Australasia.\n\n==Ecology==\nNote that this zonation is based on flora; [[animal]]s do not necessarily follow the same [[Biogeography|biogeographic]] boundaries. In the present case, many [[bird]]s occur in both \"Indomalayan\" and \"Australasian\" regions, but not across the whole of either. On the other hand, there are few faunistic commonalities shared only by Australia and New Zealand, except some birds. Meanwhile, Australia, Melanesia and the Wallacea are united by a large share of similar animals, but few of these occur farther into the Pacific.
