It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (established 1849), the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (established 1904), and the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (established 1871). The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that fosters innovation, merging the three institutions into one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |title=EU Policy Blog |publisher=Microsoft |work=EU Policy Blog |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170729/http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe university is composed of six schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff members, making it Finland's second largest university. The main campus of Aalto University is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]]. [[Aalto University Executive Education]] operates in the district of [[T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6]], [[Helsinki]]. In addition to the Greater Helsinki area, the university also operates its Bachelor's Programme in International Business in [[Mikkeli]] and the [[Mets\u00e4hovi Radio Observatory]] in [[Kirkkonummi]].\n\nAalto University's operations showcase Finland's experiment in higher education. The Aalto Design Factory, Aalto Ventures Program and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society ([[Aaltoes]]), among others, drive the university's mission for a radical shift towards multidisciplinary learning and have contributed substantially to the emergence of Helsinki as a hotbed for startups.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Aaltoes is Europe's largest and most active student run entrepreneurship community that has founded major concepts such as the Startup Sauna accelerator program and the [[Slush (event)|Slush]] startup event.\n\nThe university is named in honour of [[Alvar Aalto]], a prominent Finnish architect, designer and [[alumnus]] of the former Helsinki University of Technology, who was also instrumental in designing a large part of the university's main campus in Otaniemi.\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, a workgroup led by [[Anne Brunila]] of the Finnish [[Ministry of Finance (Finland)|Ministry of Finance]] concluded that Finland had too many universities and other institutes of tertiary education which should be consolidated. Following this, [[Yrj\u00f6 Sotamaa]], president of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] at the time, proposed the merger of Aalto University's founding schools in his president's opening speech in 2005. Sotamaa's line of reasoning was that this move would create a unique interdisciplinary university that was needed to create new innovative thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe idea received attention within the Finnish [[Ministry of Education (Finland)|Ministry of Education]], which appointed Raimo Sailas, a leading official at the [[Ministry of Finance (Finland)|Ministry of Finance]], to investigate the possibility of a merger. After Sailas' group reported that it considered the merger to be beneficial to the Finnish academic world and economy, the Finnish government decided to go on with the project on November 11, 2007.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, the government announced that the new university would be named after the Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]] in honor of his achievements in technology, economics and art. The Finnish Minister of Education at the time, Ms. [[Sari Sarkomaa]], together with representatives of Finnish industries and professional organisations, signed the Aalto University charter on June 25, 2008 in [[Helsinki]]. On December 19, 2008, Prof. [[Tuula Teeri]] was selected by the Board to be the first President of Aalto University.\n\nAalto University started operating on January 1, 2010. In the process of creating the university the university law of Finland was rewritten for the university to be allowed to collect endowment. The university managed to reach its goal of collecting 200 million euros in private donations. The sum was augmented by 2.5 times by the Finnish state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123144055/https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Aalto AlumniNET|author=Mira Network AB}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2017 analysis by [[Times Higher Education|The Times Higher Education]], Aalto University ranked 55th among technology challenger universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studyinternational.com/news/design-innovate-create-aalto-school-engineering/|title=Design, Innovate and Create with Aalto School of Engineering|date=2018-03-28|website=Study International|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Helsinki University of Technology ===\n[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|Surveying students with professor in the early days of the university of technology.]]\n{{main|Helsinki University of Technology}}\n\nAs the Aalto University was founded the four schools of science and engineering were formed out of the departments of the '''[[Helsinki University of Technology]]''' (TKK), founded in 1849 by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas I]]. It received university status in 1908. In 1966, the University of Technology moved from [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] in downtown Helsinki to its current Otaniemi campus, designed by [[Alvar Aalto]]. At the time of creation of Aalto University, TKK had about 250 professors and approximately 15,000 students. This means the largest part of the Aalto University is formed from the former Helsinki University of Technology.\n\nIn 2011, the former University of Technology (then known as ''Aalto University School of Science and Technology'') was split up into four schools, corresponding to the former TKK faculties: [[Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|School of Chemical Technology]] (CHEM), [[Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|School of Electrical Engineering]] (ELEC), [[Aalto University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] (ENG), and [[Aalto University School of Science|School of Science]] (SCI).\n\n=== Helsinki School of Economics ===\n{{main|Helsinki School of Economics}}\n\nThe '''Helsinki School of Economics''' ('''HSE''') was established in [[Helsinki]] in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974, when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university.\n\nFollowing the merger, the university was briefly renamed ''Aalto University School of Economics'', and is currently known as ''Aalto University School of Business'' (Aalto BIZ).\n\n=== University of Art and Design Helsinki ===\n{{main|University of Art and Design Helsinki}}\n[[File:Leo Mechelin (cropped).png|thumb|[[Leo Mechelin]] served as one of the first presidents of the school of art and design.]]\n\nThe '''University of Art and Design Helsinki''' has been the largest [[art university]] in the [[Nordic countries]]. It was founded in 1871. Media Centre Lume - the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media - is also located in the university. The university awarded the following academic degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Arts]].\n\nThe university has been active in establishing research projects and industrial collaborations via the private sector. During the rectorship of [[Yrj\u00f6 Sotamaa]] the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation networks.\n\nFollowing the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Art and Design. In 2012, the Department of Architecture, which historically has been a part of the Helsinki University of Technology, was moved to the school, and the name was changed to ''Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture'' (Aalto ARTS).\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n=== Governance ===\nThe university, which is incorporated as ''Aalto University Foundation'', is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board. The Board decides on the Foundation's strategy, operation and financial issues, is responsible for any far-reaching plans and appoints the University president and vice rectors. Formerly working as the Provost of Aalto University, Ilkka Niemel\u00e4 was elected President of Aalto University in 2017. The first President of Aalto University was [[Tuula Teeri]]. The university is organized into six schools with their respective deans and administrative structures.\n\n=== Schools ===\nThe university is organized since the beginning of 2011 into six schools formed out of the three merged universities.

From 2005, according to the [[Bologna process]], all students must also complete a bachelor's degree (B.Sc.(Tech), [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science in Technology]]), in Finnish ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' or ''TkK'', before the DI or architect's degree. However, the schools of science and technology do not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student may only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. The schools of science and technology require a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies are offered completely in English.\n\nUndergraduate studies are generally quite similar in between different programs with a considerable part being taken by a tuition of a solid base in mathematics and physics.\n\nApart from numerous programs in Finnish/Swedish, various international Master's programs are offered exclusively for studies in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/technology/|title=Aalto Game Changers.

The exam variant taken by most entrants mainly tests quantitative ability in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but specialized tests are available for students applying to a number of programs. The score required for entry to the Aalto University varies much depending on the intended field of study, however, in general the scores required for the Aalto University are higher than for any other university granting entry through the DIA exam. For example, the mean sum of mathematics and physics DIA exam scores was 7.2 in the year 2010, whereas the mean minimum sum of mathematics and physics exam scores for gaining admission to an Aalto program was 17.1-20.1, depending on the priority point distribution.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Valintaopas|url = http://dia.fi/media/4005/dia_hakuopas270111_fi_fk_2.pdf}}</ref> Aalto also contains five of the most selective programs with respect to the matriculation exam scores, out of approximately total of 50 [[Diplomi-insin\u00f6\u00f6ri|university technology programs]] in the nation, of which approximately 30 are outside of Aalto, and the three most selective programs with respect to entrance exam and combined scores. The minimum scores required for these top programs are in the 95th-99th percentile range of the whole applicant pool, and approximately 98th-99.8th percentile of what would be the score distribution of the whole age group.\n\n==== Study in Arts, Design and Architecture ====\n{{main|Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture}}\nThe School of Arts, Design and Architecture has been a leader in art and design education in Finland for over 138 years.

The [[amphitheatre]]-like structure contains the main auditoriums, while its exterior can be used for plays and other activities.|thumb]]\n\n=== Otaniemi Campus ===\nSince 2019, all of the Aalto University schools have been primarily located in Otaniemi, Espoo, roughly {{convert|10|km}} from the center of Helsinki. The original buildings of the campus were designed by Alvar Aalto. Several high-tech companies, the Finnish forest industry's joint experimental laboratory KCL, and [[business incubator]]s Innopoli and Technopolis are also situated nearby. It is also directly adjacent to [[Keilaniemi]], with the Life Science Center and the headquarters of several notable Finnish companies, such as [[Kone]] and [[Fortum]]. The [[Aalto University metro station]] connects Otaniemi to Helsinki via the [[L\u00e4nsimetro]] line.\n\nThe \"Teekkarikyl\u00e4\" Student Village, home to over 2,000 students, makes up the majority of residences in Otaniemi. There are over one hundred student organizations on campus, which provide a range of opportunities to take part in pastimes of various kinds, from sports to music.\n\n=== Other locations ===\nAalto University retains ownership of the former campus of the [[Aalto University School of Business|School of Business]], located in [[T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6]], Helsinki. As of 2019, the building is under renovation and primarily used by [[Aalto University Executive Education]]\n\nThe School of Business also maintains a Bachelor's Programme in International Business, which is taught in [[Mikkeli]]. The university also owns and operates the [[Mets\u00e4hovi Radio Observatory]] in [[Kirkkonummi]].\n\n== Culture and student life ==\n[[File:TFteknolog.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Finnish technology student's hat ({{lang|fi|teekkarilakki}}) photographed on top of a mirror.]]\nThe Aalto University students are known for active student life.\n\nAn integral part of many student traditions play the brightly colored overalls worn to many events. The color of the overall signals what the student studies (e.g. the economy students are recognized from ''dollar green'' overalls). The student community has also organised important charity events. In fact, the name for these events ''tempaus'', has entered common language to describe any carnival-like charity event.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe students of technology ({{lang|fi|teekkarit}}) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft on many occasions (both formal and informal). Technology students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, [[student prank]]s (''j\u00e4yn\u00e4''), similar in principle to [[MIT hack]]s. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of [[Paavo Nurmi]] onto the 300-year-old wreck of [[Regalskeppet Vasa]] just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.<ref name=\"iltasanomatttkyarchive\">[[Ilta-Sanomat]] 5 July 1961 \"Vasan veijarit\", scan available at  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html archive.org dump of ttky.fi].</ref>\n\nAlthough student traditions vary in between the different constituent schools common activities started to burgeon early after the foundation of Aalto University. The most noticeable student event of the first year of the university was ''Aalto on Tracks'', where a group of 100 students came together to rent a private train which they traveled 10 000&nbsp;km on from Helsinki to the [[Shanghai Expo]] enjoying multidisciplinary talks and workshops on the way.<ref name=\"aaltoontracks\">{{cite web|url=http://aaltoontracks.com/|title=Aalto on Tracks|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref> The event was such a success that the follow-up ''Aalto on waves'' is planned to arrange a trip by boat to South America. ''Aalto on Tracks'' also spurred students of [[Tongji University]] to arrange ''Tongji on Tracks'' which essentially takes the journey of ''Aalto on Tracks'' in the opposite direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&a=detail&id=26&nav_id=47|title=\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u540c\u6d4e\u5927\u5b66\u4e2d\u82ac\u4e2d\u5fc3|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041615/http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&a=detail&id=26&nav_id=47|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Aalto Entrepreneurship Society]] is a multi-disciplinary society uniting students and graduates of all disciplines of the University. It aims to encourage high-tech, high-growth, scalable entrepreneurship by arranging get-togethers to spark ideas and innovations and aid start-up initiatives among the Aalto students.\n\n=== Aalto Festival ===\nAalto Festival (formerly known as Masters of Aalto, and the Masters of Arts festival) is an annual event in May where the new professionals of the multidisciplinary university meet the public.\n\nAn extensive exhibition showcases a wide array of works: everything from distinguished theses, individual statements, concepts and products arising from commercial collaboration to works of art. For the graduating students, the exhibition is an opportunity to interact with society, future employers, the media and other influential parties.\n\nAalto Festival offers a varying program with exhibitions, seminars, discussions, films, workshops and guided tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moa.aalto.fi|title=Masters of Aalto University 2014 / MoA'14|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Student Union ===\nAalto University Student Union ({{lang-fi|Aalto-yliopiston ylioppilaskunta}}, AYY in short) is the official student union of Aalto University. Every bachelor's and master's degree student enrolled in Aalto University is a member of the Student Union.\n\nThe purpose of AYY is to represent the students, look after their interests, and support the community of 15,000 students. AYY provides its members with a variety of services such as healthcare, recreation and housing. The Student Union is financed by membership fees, investments and profits from student housing.\n\nAalto University Student Union was formed in the beginning of 2010 through a merger between the respective student unions of the merged universities.\n\nThe Aalto University is also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more Nations, a Finnish type of [[Corporation (University)|student corporation]]. AU's only nation is [[Teknologf\u00f6reningen|Teknologf\u00f6reningen (TF)]] and its goal is to unite Swedish-speaking students at the university. The nation is housed in its peculiar building called ''Urdsgjallar''. Since 1972, when the corresponding Finnish-speaking nation ''Tekniikan Ylioppilaat'' was abolished, there are no nations for the Finnish-speaking students, though the 15 regional nations at the [[University of Helsinki]], both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking, do welcome AU students as members.<ref>[http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml Osakunnat \u2013 Nationerna.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502091419/http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml |date=May 2, 2013 }} Osakuntien yhteisty\u00f6valiokunta ry.

There are more than 150 associations maintained by university students.\n\n==== List of student associations ====\n\nCurrently this list includes only the associations known to have English Wikipedia articles.\n\n* [[Polyteknikkojen kuoro|The Polytech Choir]] ({{lang-fi|Polyteknikkojen kuoro}})\n* [[Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho]]\n* [[Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat|Helsinki Academic Male Choir KYL]] ({{lang-fi|Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat}})\n\n=== Student housing ===\nThe housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as ''Teekkarikyl\u00e4'' (technology student village), is owned mostly by the student union and partly by [[Foundation for Student Housing in the Helsinki Region|HOAS]] (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing is characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offers housing for approximately 2,600 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Union web pages for the student village |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706062907/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archivedate=6 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during [[World War II]],<ref>{{cite web|title=History of ''Teekkarikyl\u00e4'' |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129041330/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |archivedate=2009-11-29 }}</ref> as a result of bombings by the [[Soviet Union]] itself. The student housing has been used for housing athletes again in e.g. the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.\n\nSome student housing is also available in the vicinity of the other campuses.\n\nThe Otaniemi campus also contains the former student union building ''[[Dipoli]]'', named as the second ''Poli'', the successor of the first student union building in downtown Helsinki. Dipoli was designed by [[Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4]] and completed in 1966. In 1993, the building was permanently rented to the university to act as a conference and [[continuing education]] center and later sold due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.\n\n== Notable people and famous alumni{{anchor|Notable People and Famous Alumni}} ==\n{{main|List of Aalto University people}}\nAll three constituent schools have played an integral part in educating many of the top names in their respective fields in Finland. After the Second World War Finland's economy grew and Finnish companies became players in the international markets requiring highly educated expertise and leadership. Both the schools of technology and economy catered to this need as the premier schools of their fields in the country. During the latter part of the 20th century the schools had to increase their student intake considerably to meet the demands of growing markets.\n\n<center>\n<gallery heights=\"150px\" widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m.jpg|[[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] <br>  D.Sc. <br> Professor <br>  Pioneering physicist\nFile:Virtanen.jpg|[[Artturi Ilmari Virtanen]] <br>  D.Sc. <br>Professor <br>  Nobel Laureate\nFile:Alvar aalto c1935.jpg|[[Alvar Aalto]] <br>  M.Sc (Arch.) <br>  Architect\nFile:Wirkkala.jpg|[[Tapio Wirkkala]] <br> Designer\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Erkki Tuomioja 1.jpg|[[Erkki Tuomioja]] <br>  D.Soc.Sc. <br>  Politician -->\nFile:Jorma Ollila.jpg|[[Jorma Ollila]] <br> M.Sc.

It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] (established 1849), the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (established 1904), and the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] (established 1871). The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. The Finnish government, in 2010, set out to create a university that fosters innovation, merging the three institutions into one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |title=EU Policy Blog |publisher=Microsoft |work=EU Policy Blog |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170729/http://www.microsoft.com/eu/whats-next/article/finlands-model-for-an-innovation-university.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe university is composed of six schools with close to 17,500 students and 4,000 staff members, making it Finland's second largest university. The main campus of Aalto University is located in [[Otaniemi]], [[Espoo]]. [[Aalto University Executive Education]] operates in the district of [[T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6]], [[Helsinki]]. In addition to the Greater Helsinki area, the university also operates its Bachelor's Programme in International Business in [[Mikkeli]] and the [[Mets\u00e4hovi Radio Observatory]] in [[Kirkkonummi]].\n\nAalto University's operations showcase Finland\u2019s experiment in higher education. The Aalto Design Factory, Aalto Ventures Program and Aalto Entrepreneurship Society ([[Aaltoes]]), among others, drive the university's mission for a radical shift towards multidisciplinary learning and have contributed substantially to the emergence of Helsinki as a hotbed for startups.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Aaltoes is Europe\u2019s largest and most active student run entrepreneurship community that has founded major concepts such as the Startup Sauna accelerator program and the [[Slush (event)|Slush]] startup event.\n\nThe university is named in honour of [[Alvar Aalto]], a prominent Finnish architect, designer and [[alumnus]] of the former Helsinki University of Technology, who was also instrumental in designing a large part of the university's main campus in Otaniemi.\n\n== History ==\nIn 2004, a workgroup led by [[Anne Brunila]] of the Finnish [[Ministry of Finance (Finland)|Ministry of Finance]] concluded that Finland had too many universities and other institutes of tertiary education which should be consolidated. Following this, [[Yrj\u00f6 Sotamaa]], president of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] at the time, proposed the merger of Aalto University's founding schools in his president's opening speech in 2005. Sotamaa's line of reasoning was that this move would create a unique interdisciplinary university that was needed to create new innovative thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe idea received attention within the Finnish [[Ministry of Education (Finland)|Ministry of Education]], which appointed Raimo Sailas, a leading official at the [[Ministry of Finance (Finland)|Ministry of Finance]], to investigate the possibility of a merger. After Sailas' group reported that it considered the merger to be beneficial to the Finnish academic world and economy, the Finnish government decided to go on with the project on November 11, 2007.\n\nOn May 29, 2008, the government announced that the new university would be named after the Finnish architect [[Alvar Aalto]] in honor of his achievements in technology, economics and art. The Finnish Minister of Education at the time, Ms. [[Sari Sarkomaa]], together with representatives of Finnish industries and professional organisations, signed the Aalto University charter on June 25, 2008 in [[Helsinki]]. On December 19, 2008, Prof. [[Tuula Teeri]] was selected by the Board to be the first President of Aalto University.\n\nAalto University started operating on January 1, 2010. In the process of creating the university the university law of Finland was rewritten for the university to be allowed to collect endowment. The university managed to reach its goal of collecting 200 million euros in private donations. The sum was augmented by 2.5 times by the Finnish state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123144055/https://alumninet.aalto.fi/Portal/Public/News/ShowNews.aspx?NewsID=2694|url-status=dead|archive-date=2015-11-23|title=Aalto AlumniNET|author=Mira Network AB}}</ref>\n\nIn a 2017 analysis by [[Times Higher Education|The Times Higher Education]], Aalto University ranked 55th among technology challenger universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.studyinternational.com/news/design-innovate-create-aalto-school-engineering/|title=Design, Innovate and Create with Aalto School of Engineering|date=2018-03-28|website=Study International|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n\n=== Helsinki University of Technology ===\n[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|thumb|Surveying students with professor in the early days of the university of technology.]]\n{{main|Helsinki University of Technology}}\n\nAs the Aalto University was founded the four schools of science and engineering were formed out of the departments of the '''[[Helsinki University of Technology]]''' (TKK), founded in 1849 by [[Nicholas I of Russia|Grand Duke Nicholas I]]. It received university status in 1908. In 1966, the University of Technology moved from [[Hietalahti, Helsinki|Hietalahti]] in downtown Helsinki to its current Otaniemi campus, designed by [[Alvar Aalto]]. At the time of creation of Aalto University, TKK had about 250 professors and approximately 15,000 students. This means the largest part of the Aalto University is formed from the former Helsinki University of Technology.\n\nIn 2011, the former University of Technology (then known as ''Aalto University School of Science and Technology'') was split up into four schools, corresponding to the former TKK faculties: [[Aalto University School of Chemical Technology|School of Chemical Technology]] (CHEM), [[Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering|School of Electrical Engineering]] (ELEC), [[Aalto University School of Engineering|School of Engineering]] (ENG), and [[Aalto University School of Science|School of Science]] (SCI).\n\n=== Helsinki School of Economics ===\n{{main|Helsinki School of Economics}}\n\nThe '''Helsinki School of Economics''' ('''HSE''') was established in [[Helsinki]] in 1904 by the business community and was given the status of a university in 1911. It operated as a private university until 1974, when the state of Finland was given the financial responsibility of the university.\n\nFollowing the merger, the university was briefly renamed ''Aalto University School of Economics'', and is currently known as ''Aalto University School of Business'' (Aalto BIZ).\n\n=== University of Art and Design Helsinki ===\n{{main|University of Art and Design Helsinki}}\n[[File:Leo Mechelin (cropped).png|thumb|[[Leo Mechelin]] served as one of the first presidents of the school of art and design.]]\n\nThe '''University of Art and Design Helsinki''' has been the largest [[art university]] in the [[Nordic countries]]. It was founded in 1871. Media Centre Lume - the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media - is also located in the university. The university awarded the following academic degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts]], [[Master of Arts]], and [[Doctor of Arts]].\n\nThe university has been active in establishing research projects and industrial collaborations via the private sector. During the rectorship of [[Yrj\u00f6 Sotamaa]] the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation networks.\n\nFollowing the merger, the university was briefly renamed Aalto University School of Art and Design. In 2012, the Department of Architecture, which historically has been a part of the Helsinki University of Technology, was moved to the school, and the name was changed to ''Aalto University School of Art, Design and Architecture'' (Aalto ARTS).\n\n== Administration and organisation ==\n\n=== Governance ===\nThe university, which is incorporated as ''Aalto University Foundation'', is governed by the seven-member Aalto University Foundation Board. The Board decides on the Foundation's strategy, operation and financial issues, is responsible for any far-reaching plans and appoints the University president and vice rectors. Formerly working as the Provost of Aalto University, Ilkka Niemel\u00e4 was elected President of Aalto University in 2017. The first President of Aalto University was [[Tuula Teeri]]. The university is organized into six schools with their respective deans and administrative structures.\n\n=== Schools ===\nThe university is organized since the beginning of 2011 into six schools formed out of the three merged universities.

From 2005, according to the [[Bologna process]], all students must also complete a bachelor's degree (B.Sc.(Tech), [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science in Technology]]), in Finnish ''tekniikan kandidaatti'' or ''TkK'', before the DI or architect's degree. However, the schools of science and technology do not offer programs terminating in a bachelor's degree; a student may only be accepted to study for the Master's level degree. The schools of science and technology require a bachelor's degree from foreign students studying in English, because only Master's studies are offered completely in English.\n\nUndergraduate studies are generally quite similar in between different programs with a considerable part being taken by a tuition of a solid base in mathematics and physics.\n\nApart from numerous programs in Finnish/Swedish, various international Master's programs are offered exclusively for studies in English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studies.aalto.fi/en/programs/technology/|title=Aalto Game Changers.

The exam variant taken by most entrants mainly tests quantitative ability in mathematics, physics and chemistry, but specialized tests are available for students applying to a number of programs. The score required for entry to the Aalto University varies much depending on the intended field of study, however, in general the scores required for the Aalto University are higher than for any other university granting entry through the DIA exam. For example, the mean sum of mathematics and physics DIA exam scores was 7.2 in the year 2010, whereas the mean minimum sum of mathematics and physics exam scores for gaining admission to an Aalto program was 17.1-20.1, depending on the priority point distribution.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Valintaopas|url = http://dia.fi/media/4005/dia_hakuopas270111_fi_fk_2.pdf}}</ref> Aalto also contains five of the most selective programs with respect to the matriculation exam scores, out of approximately total of 50 [[Diplomi-insin\u00f6\u00f6ri|university technology programs]] in the nation, of which approximately 30 are outside of Aalto, and the three most selective programs with respect to entrance exam and combined scores. The minimum scores required for these top programs are in the 95th-99th percentile range of the whole applicant pool, and approximately 98th-99.8th percentile of what would be the score distribution of the whole age group.\n\n==== Study in Arts, Design and Architecture ====\n{{main|Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture}}\nThe School of Arts, Design and Architecture has been a leader in art and design education in Finland for over 138 years.

The color of the overall signals what the student studies (e.g. the economy students are recognized from ''dollar green'' overalls). The student community has also organised important charity events. In fact, the name for these events ''tempaus'', has entered common language to describe any carnival-like charity event.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThe students of technology ({{lang|fi|teekkarit}}) are especially noticeable, as they wear a distinctive hat with a tuft on many occasions (both formal and informal). Technology students are also famous for, and Finland's leading practitioners of, [[student prank]]s (''j\u00e4yn\u00e4''), similar in principle to [[MIT hack]]s. Their most widely publicised stunt took place in 1961, when a team of students smuggled a statue of [[Paavo Nurmi]] onto the 300-year-old wreck of [[Regalskeppet Vasa]] just days before its lifting from the bottom of the sea.<ref name=\"iltasanomatttkyarchive\">[[Ilta-Sanomat]] 5 July 1961 \"Vasan veijarit\", scan available at  [https://web.archive.org/web/20040713124028/http://www.ttky.tut.fi/jaynat/nurmi.html archive.org dump of ttky.fi].</ref>\n\nAlthough student traditions vary in between the different constituent schools common activities started to burgeon early after the foundation of Aalto University. The most noticeable student event of the first year of the university was ''Aalto on Tracks'', where a group of 100 students came together to rent a private train which they traveled 10 000&nbsp;km on from Helsinki to the [[Shanghai Expo]] enjoying multidisciplinary talks and workshops on the way.<ref name=\"aaltoontracks\">{{cite web|url=http://aaltoontracks.com/|title=Aalto on Tracks|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref> The event was such a success that the follow-up ''Aalto on waves'' is planned to arrange a trip by boat to South America. ''Aalto on Tracks'' also spurred students of [[Tongji University]] to arrange ''Tongji on Tracks'' which essentially takes the journey of ''Aalto on Tracks'' in the opposite direction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&a=detail&id=26&nav_id=47|title=\u6b22\u8fce\u6765\u5230\u540c\u6d4e\u5927\u5b66\u4e2d\u82ac\u4e2d\u5fc3|publisher=|accessdate=21 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304041615/http://sfc.tongji.edu.cn/index.php?m=article&a=detail&id=26&nav_id=47|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Aalto Entrepreneurship Society]] is a multi-disciplinary society uniting students and graduates of all disciplines of the University.

Every bachelor's and master's degree student enrolled in Aalto University is a member of the Student Union.\n\nThe purpose of AYY is to represent the students, look after their interests, and support the community of 15,000 students. AYY provides its members with a variety of services such as healthcare, recreation and housing. The Student Union is financed by membership fees, investments and profits from student housing.\n\nAalto University Student Union was formed in the beginning of 2010 through a merger between the respective student unions of the merged universities.\n\nThe Aalto University is also one of the two universities in Finland to host one or more Nations, a Finnish type of [[Corporation (University)|student corporation]]. AU's only nation is [[Teknologf\u00f6reningen|Teknologf\u00f6reningen (TF)]] and its goal is to unite Swedish-speaking students at the university. The nation is housed in its peculiar building called ''Urdsgjallar''. Since 1972, when the corresponding Finnish-speaking nation ''Tekniikan Ylioppilaat'' was abolished, there are no nations for the Finnish-speaking students, though the 15 regional nations at the [[University of Helsinki]], both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking, do welcome AU students as members.<ref>[http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml Osakunnat \u2013 Nationerna.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502091419/http://www.helsinki.fi/jarj/oyv/osakunnat/index.shtml |date=May 2, 2013 }} Osakuntien yhteisty\u00f6valiokunta ry.

In this picture Retuper\u00e4 is performing in central Helsinki on top of their fire truck.]]\n\nIn addition to the student union, Aalto university students have formed numerous associations for studies, cultural activity and sports. There are more than 150 associations maintained by university students.\n\n==== List of student associations ====\n\nCurrently this list includes only the associations known to have English Wikipedia articles.\n\n* [[Polyteknikkojen kuoro|The Polytech Choir]] ({{lang-fi|Polyteknikkojen kuoro}})\n* [[Polyteknikkojen Ilmailukerho]]\n* [[Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat|Helsinki Academic Male Choir KYL]] ({{lang-fi|Kauppakorkeakoulun Ylioppilaskunnan Laulajat}})\n\n=== Student housing ===\nThe housing area of Otaniemi campus, known as ''Teekkarikyl\u00e4'' (technology student village), is owned mostly by the student union and partly by [[Foundation for Student Housing in the Helsinki Region|HOAS]] (Helsinki Student Housing Fund). The housing is characterised by the presence of foreign students of many nationalities. As of 2005, the village offers housing for approximately 2,600 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Union web pages for the student village |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706062907/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/ |archivedate=6 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Otaniemi campus was started in 1950, in order for the first buildings to host the athletes of the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Some of the building material originally used for the campus was acquired from the former Soviet Union embassy, which had been destroyed during [[World War II]],<ref>{{cite web|title=History of ''Teekkarikyl\u00e4'' |accessdate=2007-07-21 |url=http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129041330/http://www.tky.fi/fi/tky/teekkarikyla/teekkarikylan-historiaa/ |archivedate=2009-11-29 }}</ref> as a result of bombings by the [[Soviet Union]] itself. The student housing has been used for housing athletes again in e.g. the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics]], sometimes to the dismay of the students that have to move out during the events. The quality of the Otaniemi student housing holds a high standard in international comparison.\n\nSome student housing is also available in the vicinity of the other campuses.\n\nThe Otaniemi campus also contains the former student union building ''[[Dipoli]]'', named as the second ''Poli'', the successor of the first student union building in downtown Helsinki. Dipoli was designed by [[Reima and Raili Pietil\u00e4]] and completed in 1966. In 1993, the building was permanently rented to the university to act as a conference and [[continuing education]] center and later sold due to high maintenance costs. It is regularly used for conventions, congresses and student parties.\n\n== Notable people and famous alumni{{anchor|Notable People and Famous Alumni}} ==\n{{main|List of Aalto University people}}\nAll three constituent schools have played an integral part in educating many of the top names in their respective fields in Finland. After the Second World War Finland's economy grew and Finnish companies became players in the international markets requiring highly educated expertise and leadership. Both the schools of technology and economy catered to this need as the premier schools of their fields in the country. During the latter part of the 20th century the schools had to increase their student intake considerably to meet the demands of growing markets.\n\n<center>\n<gallery heights=\"150px\" widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m.jpg|[[Gunnar Nordstr\u00f6m]] <br>  D.Sc. <br> Professor <br>  Pioneering physicist\nFile:Virtanen.jpg|[[Artturi Ilmari Virtanen]] <br>  D.Sc. <br>Professor <br>  Nobel Laureate\nFile:Alvar aalto c1935.jpg|[[Alvar Aalto]] <br>  M.Sc (Arch.) <br>  Architect\nFile:Wirkkala.jpg|[[Tapio Wirkkala]] <br> Designer\n<!-- Deleted image removed: File:Erkki Tuomioja 1.jpg|[[Erkki Tuomioja]] <br>  D.Soc.Sc. <br>  Politician -->\nFile:Jorma Ollila.jpg|[[Jorma Ollila]] <br> M.Sc.

The Wolverines joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] at its inception in 1896, and other than a [[Charles A. Baird#1906 season and withdrawal from the Western Conference|hiatus from 1907 to 1916]], have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the [[AP Poll]] in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]], most recently that of the [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|1997 squad]] voted atop the final AP Poll.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1989, Michigan was led by a series of nine head coaches, each of whom has been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] either as a player or as a coach. [[Fielding H. Yost]] became Michigan's head coach in 1901 and guided his \"Point-a-Minute\" squads to a streak of 56 games without a defeat, spanning from his arrival until the season finale in 1905, including a victory in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. [[Fritz Crisler]] brought his winged helmet from [[Princeton University]] in 1938 and led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]] to a national title and Michigan's [[1948 Rose Bowl|second Rose Bowl win]]. [[Bo Schembechler]] coached the team for 21 seasons (1969\u20131989) in which he won 13 Big Ten titles and 194 games, a program record. The first decade of his tenure was underscored by a fierce competition with his former mentor, [[Woody Hayes]], whose [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] squared off against Schembechler's Wolverines in a stretch of the Michigan\u2013Ohio State rivalry dubbed the \"Ten-Year War\".\n\nFollowing Schembechler's retirement, the program was coached by two of his former assistants, [[Gary Moeller]] and then [[Lloyd Carr]], who maintained the program's overall success over the next 18 years. However, the program's fortunes declined under the next two coaches, [[Rich Rodriguez]] and [[Brady Hoke]], who were both fired after relatively short tenures.  Following Hoke's dismissal, Michigan hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] on December 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|title=Michigan Hires Jim Harbaugh as New Head Coach|first=Molly Geary and Scooby Axson / Sports|last=Illustrated|website=Time|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033514/https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Harbaugh is a former [[quarterback]] of the team, having played for Michigan between [[1982 Michigan Wolverines football team|1982]] and [[1986 Michigan Wolverines football team|1986]] under Schembechler.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines have featured 83 players that have garnered consensus selection to the [[College Football All-America Team]].

Michigan did, however, qualify for a bowl game with a 7\u20135 record, and clinched its bowl berth in dramatic fashion against [[2010 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], with Michigan winning 67\u201365 in three overtime periods.

The Wolverines received an invitation to the [[2012 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] in which they defeated [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], 23\u201320, in overtime.

Michigan then traveled to face eventual national runner-up [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. In this game, the Wolverines committed six turnovers, including five interceptions, as they fell to the Fighting Irish by a 13\u20136 final. After back-to-back wins over [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]], they defeated in-state rival [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] for the first time since 2007. The win was the 900th in program history, becoming the first program to reach the milestone.

The Wolverines joined the [[Big Ten Conference]] at its inception in 1896, and other than a [[Charles A. Baird#1906 season and withdrawal from the Western Conference|hiatus from 1907 to 1916]], have been members since. Michigan has won or shared 42 league titles, and, since the inception of the [[AP Poll]] in 1936, has finished in the top 10 a total of 38 times. The Wolverines claim 11 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]], most recently that of the [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|1997 squad]] voted atop the final AP Poll.\n\nFrom 1900 to 1989, Michigan was led by a series of nine head coaches, each of whom has been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] either as a player or as a coach. [[Fielding H. Yost]] became Michigan's head coach in 1901 and guided his \"Point-a-Minute\" squads to a streak of 56 games without a defeat, spanning from his arrival until the season finale in 1905, including a victory in the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], the first college football [[bowl game]] ever played. [[Fritz Crisler]] brought his winged helmet from [[Princeton University]] in 1938 and led the [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|1947 Wolverines]] to a national title and Michigan's [[1948 Rose Bowl|second Rose Bowl win]]. [[Bo Schembechler]] coached the team for 21 seasons (1969\u20131989) in which he won 13 Big Ten titles and 194 games, a program record. The first decade of his tenure was underscored by a fierce competition with his former mentor, [[Woody Hayes]], whose [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]] squared off against Schembechler's Wolverines in a stretch of the Michigan\u2013Ohio State rivalry dubbed the \"Ten-Year War\".\n\nFollowing Schembechler's retirement, the program was coached by two of his former assistants, [[Gary Moeller]] and then [[Lloyd Carr]], who maintained the program's overall success over the next 18 years. However, the program's fortunes declined under the next two coaches, [[Rich Rodriguez]] and [[Brady Hoke]], who were both fired after relatively short tenures.  Following Hoke's dismissal, Michigan hired [[Jim Harbaugh]] on December 30, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|title=Michigan Hires Jim Harbaugh as New Head Coach|first=Molly Geary and Scooby Axson / Sports|last=Illustrated|website=Time|access-date=December 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170907033514/https://www.si.com/college-football/2014/12/29/michigan-hires-jim-harbaugh-head-coach|archive-date=September 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Harbaugh is a former [[quarterback]] of the team, having played for Michigan between [[1982 Michigan Wolverines football team|1982]] and [[1986 Michigan Wolverines football team|1986]] under Schembechler.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines have featured 83 players that have garnered consensus selection to the [[College Football All-America Team]]. Three Wolverines have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]: [[Tom Harmon]] in 1940, [[Desmond Howard]] in 1991, and [[Charles Woodson]] in 1997.

The Wolverines received an invitation to the [[2012 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] in which they defeated [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], 23\u201320, in overtime. This was the program's first bowl win since the season of 2007. Until the streak was broken in 2008, Michigan had appeared in a bowl game each year since the 1975 season.\n\nIn Hoke's second season, he led Michigan to an 8\u20135 record. The Wolverines dropped their season opener to eventual national champions, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] in Dallas, Texas. U-M won the next two games at home in non-conference bouts against [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] and [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]], totaling 94 points over the two games. Michigan then traveled to face eventual national runner-up [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]. In this game, the Wolverines committed six turnovers, including five interceptions, as they fell to the Fighting Irish by a 13\u20136 final. After back-to-back wins over [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]], they defeated in-state rival [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] for the first time since 2007. The win was the 900th in program history, becoming the first program to reach the milestone. U-M finished the season with wins over [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]], [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] as well as losses to [[2012 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] to finish the regular season.

The first MA program was started in 1994 and the first research group assembled in 1996. The roots of the Media Lab are in the early [[Scandinavia]]n [[New media art|media art]], [[demoscene]], [[game design]], [[hacker culture]], and [[participatory design]] communities. Since its formation the Media Lab has been part of a relatively active digital culture scene in Helsinki and its surroundings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince 1995 Media Lab has collaborated in, generated and coordinated research and development projects funded by the [[European Commission]], [[Tekes (agency)|Tekes]] (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation), [[Nordic Council]], [[UNESCO]] and a number of industrial partners, including [[Nokia]], [[Elisa (company)|Elisa]], [[TeliaSonera]], [[Sanoma]], [[YLE]] and [[MTV3]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1998 the lab became an official department at the university. In January 2000 the Media Centre Lume&nbsp;\u2013 the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media&nbsp;\u2013 was officially opened. Lume was located in the same premises as the Media Lab and offered its resources for study and research projects carried out in the Lab. The Lume was closed in 2016 as part of the new [[Aalto University]]'s reorganisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lume.fi/lumenet.nsf/paasivut/base_fin|title=Mediakeskus Lume \u2013 Media Centre Lume|website=www.lume.fi|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Ministry of Education [[Finland]] chose Media Lab as one of the national top educational units.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korkealaatuisen koulutuksen yksik\u00f6t 2001-2003|last=|first=|publisher=Korkeakoulujen arviointineuvosto|year=2000|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Media Lab was invited to the [[Ars Electronica]]. The ''Beta Lounge'', Campus Exhibition presented over 20 works by Media Lab's MA, DA and alumni students and its four research groups of that time. Since then Media Lab researchers, designers and artist have collaborated in with the Ars Electronica Center in various projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-media-lab/about-us|title=About us {{!}} Aalto University|website=www.aalto.fi|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ars.electronica.art/futurelab/en/project/ars-electronica-futurelab-academy-media-lab-helsinki/|title=Ars Electronica Futurelab Academy @ Media Lab Helsinki|website=Futurelab|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\n2008 saw the beginnings of [[Aalto University]], a new university. Aalto is the fusion of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] where Media Lab is located, [[Helsinki School of Economics]] and [[Helsinki University of Technology]].\n\nIn 2010, as part of Aalto reorganisation, the Media Lab joined forces with Photography and Graphic Design, formerly of the Visual Culture department, to create the Department of Media.\n\nIn 2015 the Media Lab moved to a temporary space at the Aalto Campus in [[Otaniemi]]. In autumn 2018 the Lab moved to a new V\u00e4re-building designed and built for the School of Arts, Design and Architecture.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Teaching ==\nMedia Lab provides platform for [[Master of Arts]] and Doctor of Arts (equivalent to [[PhD]]) studies in three areas: [[New Media]] Design and Production, [[Sound]] in [[New Media]] and Game Design and Production. The doctoral students often  work within the thematic research groups. Teaching is in English and about 40% of students are non-Finns.<ref name=\":2\"/>\n\n== Research ==\n\nThere are three research groups in the Media Lab:\n\n'''The Learning Environments research group (LeGroup)''' is involved in research, design and development of New Media tools, as well as their use and application, in the field of learning.

The first MA program was started in 1994 and the first research group assembled in 1996. The roots of the Media Lab are in the early [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] [[New media art|media art]], [[demoscene]], [[game design]], [[hacker culture]], and [[participatory design]] communities. Since its formation the Media Lab has been part of a relatively active digital culture scene in Helsinki and its surroundings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince 1995 Media Lab has collaborated in, generated and coordinated research and development projects funded by the [[European Commission]], [[Tekes (agency)|Tekes]] (the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation), [[Nordic Council]], [[UNESCO]] and a number of industrial partners, including [[Nokia]], [[Elisa (company)|Elisa]], [[TeliaSonera]], [[Sanoma]], [[YLE]] and [[MTV3]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1998 the lab became an official department at the university. In January 2000 the Media Centre Lume&nbsp;\u2013 the National Research and Development Center of audiovisual media&nbsp;\u2013 was officially opened. Lume was located in the same premises as the Media Lab and offered its resources for study and research projects carried out in the Lab. The Lume was closed in 2016 as part of the new [[Aalto University]]'s reorganisation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lume.fi/lumenet.nsf/paasivut/base_fin|title=Mediakeskus Lume \u2013 Media Centre Lume|website=www.lume.fi|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the Ministry of Education [[Finland]] chose Media Lab as one of the national top educational units.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Korkealaatuisen koulutuksen yksik\u00f6t 2001-2003|last=|first=|publisher=Korkeakoulujen arviointineuvosto|year=2000|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 Media Lab was invited to the [[Ars Electronica]]. The ''Beta Lounge'', Campus Exhibition presented over 20 works by Media Lab's MA, DA and alumni students and its four research groups of that time. Since then Media Lab researchers, designers and artist have collaborated in with the Ars Electronica Center in various projects.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-media-lab/about-us|title=About us {{!}} Aalto University|website=www.aalto.fi|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ars.electronica.art/futurelab/en/project/ars-electronica-futurelab-academy-media-lab-helsinki/|title=Ars Electronica Futurelab Academy @ Media Lab Helsinki|website=Futurelab|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\n2008 saw the beginnings of [[Aalto University]], a new university. Aalto is the fusion of the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] where Media Lab is located, [[Helsinki School of Economics]] and [[Helsinki University of Technology]].\n\nIn 2010, as part of Aalto reorganisation, the Media Lab joined forces with Photography and Graphic Design, formerly of the Visual Culture department, to create the Department of Media.\n\nIn 2015 the Media Lab moved to a temporary space at the Aalto Campus in [[Otaniemi]]. In autumn 2018 the Lab moved to a new V\u00e4re-building designed and built for the School of Arts, Design and Architecture.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Teaching ==\nMedia Lab provides platform for [[Master of Arts]] and Doctor of Arts (equivalent to [[PhD]]) studies in three areas: [[New Media]] Design and Production, [[Sound]] in [[New Media]] and Game Design and Production. The doctoral students often  work within the thematic research groups. Teaching is in English and about 40% of students are non-Finns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-media-lab|title=Aalto Media Lab {{!}} Aalto University|website=www.aalto.fi|language=en|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref>\n\n== Research ==\n\nThere are three research groups in the Media Lab:\n\n'''The Learning Environments research group (LeGroup)''' is involved in research, design and development of New Media tools, as well as their use and application, in the field of learning. Besides academic research papers the outcomes of the group are often [[software system]]s, [[software prototyping|software prototypes]], applications and scenarios. The group's works are based on the social constructivist theory that sees learning as a participation in social processes of knowledge construction.
