His father, intending that he should enter the church, sent him to [[Eton College]] in 1737 and then to [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1748.<ref>{{acad|id=SMT747W2|name=Smith, William}}</ref> The vivacious spirit for which he was well known at Eton led him into problems at Cambridge. One evening he drank too freely with some friends and, being pursued by a proctor, he unwisely snapped an unloaded pistol at him. He refused the punishment that was imposed, and quit the University to avoid expulsion.<ref>'\"Gentleman Smith\", the original Charles Surface', in [[William Hone]] (ed.), ''The Every-Day Book: or, The Guide to the Year'' (London 1825), II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CEIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA260#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 1287\u20131291] (Google).</ref>\n\n===Covent Garden 1753\u20131774===\nSmith was inclined towards the stage: upon arrival in London, he applied to [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at the original [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Theatre, where he first appeared in January 1753 in the role of Theodosius (in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy of ''The Force of Love''<ref>'Obituary notice of William Smith', ''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), a performance attended by many of his college friends in a spirit of solidarity. He next appeared as Polydore in [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'', Southampton in ''The Earl of Essex'', and Dolabella in [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[All For Love (play)|All for Love]]''. Having taken various subordinate roles in casts led by Mrs. Cibber and [[Spranger Barry]] (whose pupil he had effectively become<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), on Barry's retirement he took on many of that actor's principal parts. If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life. The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith was just gone to school to say his part.\"<ref>C.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.<ref>J. Boaden, ''The Life of Mrs. Jordan: Including Original Private Correspondence'', 2 vols (Edward Bull, London 1831), I, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2H4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA120#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 120-23] (Google).</ref> However, he won popularity as [[Richard III (play)|Richard III]], [[Henry IV, Part 1|Hotspur]], and Hastings, and was also admired in the roles of Kitely (''[[Every Man in his Humour]]'', in which he was preferred to Garrick<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), Archer, and Oakly. It was said that he prided himself on the reflection that he was never called upon to perform in an [[after-piece]], or to pass through a trapdoor in any entrance or exit on the stage.<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', as above.</ref>\n\n===Charles Surface===\nSmith's masterpiece was his impersonation of Charles Surface in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ''[[The School for Scandal]]'',<ref>C. Deelman, 'The original cast of The School for Scandal', ''The Review of English Studies'' 1962 XIII (51), pp.&nbsp;257\u2013266.</ref> which won the highest praise for originality, boldness of conception, truth, freedom, ease, and gracefulness of action and manner.<ref>W. Hone, ''The Every-Day Book'' (London 1825), II, pp. 1287\u20131291.</ref> He is mentioned favourably in [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]'s ''[[Essays of Elia]]'':<blockquote>\"...it was then the fashion to cry down John Kemble, who took the part after Smith; but, I thought, very unjustly. Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy. He had not to expiate the fault of having pleased beforehand in lofty declamation. He had no sins of Hamlet or of Richard to atone for. His failure in these parts was a passport to success in one of so opposite a tendency.\"<ref>C. Lamb, 'On the artificial comedy of the last century', in ''Essays of Elia'' ed. A.

One evening he drank too freely with some friends and, being pursued by a proctor, he unwisely snapped an unloaded pistol at him. He refused the punishment that was imposed, and quit the University to avoid expulsion.<ref>'\"Gentleman Smith\", the original Charles Surface', in [[William Hone]] (ed.), ''The Every-Day Book: or, The Guide to the Year'' (London 1825), II, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8CEIAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA260#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 1287\u20131291] (Google).</ref>\n\n===Covent Garden 1753\u20131774===\nSmith was inclined towards the stage: upon arrival in London, he applied to [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]] at the original [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] Theatre, where he first appeared in January 1753 in the role of Theodosius (in [[Nathaniel Lee]]'s tragedy of ''The Force of Love''<ref>'Obituary notice of William Smith', ''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), a performance attended by many of his college friends in a spirit of solidarity. He next appeared as Polydore in [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[The Orphan (play)|The Orphan]]'', Southampton in ''The Earl of Essex'', and Dolabella in [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[All For Love (play)|All for Love]]''. Having taken various subordinate roles in casts led by Mrs. Cibber and [[Spranger Barry]] (whose pupil he had effectively become<ref>''Ipswich Journal'', 9 October 1819, p. 4.</ref>), on Barry's retirement he took on many of that actor's principal parts. If he had defects, they were generally overlooked by his audiences, who admired his upright and independent private life. The poet [[Charles Churchill (satirist)|Charles Churchill]], in his \"Rosciad\" satire of 1761, said of him: \"Smith the genteel, the airy, and the smart; Smith was just gone to school to say his part.\"<ref>C.

Though for a long time he played lead roles in tragedy, for which he had a suitably tall and well-proportioned figure, his facial features lacked the flexibility and expressiveness, and his vocal delivery was somewhat too harsh and monotonous, to be considered ideal.<ref>J.

Smith, I fancy, was more airy, and took the eye with a certain gaiety of person. He brought with him no sombre recollections of tragedy.
