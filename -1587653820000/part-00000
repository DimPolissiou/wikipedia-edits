The election results was released in the late evening that day and the ruling [[People's Action Party]] won a total of 81 out of 83 seats as well as a tenth consecutive term in office under the then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]. Other major political parties contesting in the election were the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]], [[Singapore Democratic Party]], [[National Solidarity Party (Singapore)|National Solidarity Party]], [[Singapore People's Party]] and the [[Democratic Progressive Party (Singapore)|Democratic Progressive Party]].\n\nAfter nomination day on 23 December 1996, the People's Action Party returned to power for the second consecutive (and third overall) election as 47 (more than half of the total 83) seats. On polling day, voters voted for the election for the remaining 36 seats; the oppositions retained two of the four seats they won in the last election. In this election, [[Constituencies of Singapore|Group Representation Constituencies]] were increased from four members to between four and six members (six-member seats would remain present for two decades until its first absence in the [[2020 Singaporean general election|2020 election]]).\n\n==Background==\nThe election would seek opportunity for Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] to score a better mandate after PAP's considerably poorer showing in the 1991 election. Two seats in PAP-held Eunos and Toa Payoh GRCs were vacated after the death of Member of Parliament (MP), Dr [[Tay Eng Soon]] and inauguration of former Deputy Prime Minister [[Ong Teng Cheong]] as Singapore's fifth and first elected President in [[1993 Singapore presidential election|1993]] respectively; however, both GRCs did not held by-elections and were instead subsumed into neighbouring GRCs. A third incumbent, Lim Chee Oon of the [[Marine Parade GRC]], retired from politics ahead of the [[1992 Marine Parade by-election|by-election in 1992]], and future Minister [[Teo Chee Hean]] succeeded Lim.\n\nIn 1993, a year following the events of the Marine Parade GRC by-election, the largest opposition party, [[Singapore Democratic Party]], faced a serious internal strife where former leader and [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency|Potong Pasir]] then-MP [[Chiam See Tong]] sued his party's Central Executive Committee (which include secretary-general [[Chee Soon Juan]] and chairman [[Ling How Doong]]) for defamation, which he won; Chiam resigned from SDP prior to nominations to lead his splinter party, [[Singapore People's Party]]. In 1994, Chee criticized then-[[Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Lee Hsien Loong]] over a lack of democracy, which led to the attention of Organising Secretary and [[Marine Parade GRC]] member-of-parliament [[Matthias Yao]]; Chee publicly request to challenge Yao with a condition of carving out his [[MacPherson SMC|MacPherson ward]] from Marine Parade GRC into a SMC, which the latter accepted.\n\n==Timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Chia Shi Teck became the first former Nominated MP to contest in the election as an independent candidate in an only four-cornered fight in [[Chua Chu Kang SMC]].

On 6 September 1999, the 9th Parliament was relocated to the [[Parliament House, Singapore|New Parliament House]] located within the [[Civic District]] facing [[North Bridge Road]], while the former Parliament House was closed until it reopened on 26 March 2004, in which it was renamed to [[The Arts House]].\n\n===Tang Liang Hong's self-imposed exile===\n{{main|Tang Liang Hong}}\nAfter the election, [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|WP]] candidate for [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]], [[Tang Liang Hong]] was sued for [[defamation]] by several of the PAP's leaders, including then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], then-Senior Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and then-Deputy Prime Ministers [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Tony Tan]], who accused him of making statements during the campaign which falsely questioned their integrity. A total of 13 judgements were entered against Tang for defamation.\n\nTang left Singapore shortly after the election and eventually found refuge in Australia.\n\n==External links==\n<!--Do NOT add links to blogs; it violates WP:NPOV and WP:NOT.

On 6 September 1999, the 9th Parliament was relocated to the [[Parliament House, Singapore|New Parliament House]] located within the [[Civic District]] facing [[North Bridge Road]], while the former Parliament House was closed until it reopened on 26 March 2004, in which it was renamed to [[The Arts House]].\n\n===Tang Liang Hong's self-imposed exile===\n{{main|Tang Liang Hong}}\nAfter the election, [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|WP]] candidate for [[Cheng San Group Representation Constituency]], [[Tang Liang Hong]] was sued for [[defamation]] by several of the PAP's leaders, including then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], then-Senior Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] and then-Deputy Prime Ministers [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and [[Tony Tan]], who accused him of making statements during the campaign which falsely questioned their integrity.

Added to this is the Senior Survey Project, a semester course during which students learn research skills specific to their own island-nations, linking them again to their communities. Components specific to Micronesia also enter into the syllabus in the first year coverage of Pacific history and geography, while focusing on relationships among the various Micronesian cultures. Also, senior English classes have discussions of human rights and social justice issues.\n\nEnvironmental studies is included in the biology course and also offered as an elective in senior year, along with another elective on developmental studies specific to their own places of origin. The other electives are Japanese in junior year and accounting and music in senior year.\n\nCollege and career prep are covered in third and fourth year English with preparation for the PSAT, SAT, and TOEFL tests, and also in college counselling courses in junior and senior year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xaviermicronesia.org/academics|title=Academics : Xavier High School, Micronesia|website=xaviermicronesia.org|access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==Staffing and enrollment==\nXavier High School employs an international staff of Jesuits, volunteers,<ref>[http://xaviermicronesia.org/about/staff Volunteer staff.

It was established in 1952. It was the first high school in the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]]. Bishop Thomas Feeney, S.J., D.D. from the New York Province of the [[Society of Jesus]] (the Jesuits) originally envisioned a minor seminary to train local clergy. Soon after, Xavier Seminary became the first college preparatory school in the Western Pacific.\n\nToday, Xavier High School continues to provide a college preparatory education as a Catholic school in the Jesuit tradition, serving the different island-nations of Micronesia. In 2014 Xavier produced four Gates scholars; the first recipient of the Ushiba Scholarship to Sophia University in Japan; and an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jesuits.org/news-detail?TN=NEWS-20150403080615_a|title=Jesuit Schools in Micronesia Damaged by Super Typhoon Maysak|website=jesuits.org|access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nDuring World War II, the Japanese government urged Mabuchi Construction Company to construct a communications center for the Japanese military in Chuuk. In 1952, Xavier High School was opened at its present site on Mabuchi hill, as the first high school in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

Added to this is the Senior Survey Project, a semester course during which students learn research skills specific to their own island-nations, linking them again to their communities. Components specific to Micronesia also enter into the syllabus in the first year coverage of Pacific history and geography, while focusing on relationships among the various Micronesian cultures. Also, senior English classes have discussions of human rights and social justice issues.\n\nEnvironmental studies is included in the biology course and also offered as an elective in senior year, along with another elective on developmental studies specific to their own places of origin. The other electives are Japanese in junior year and accounting and music in senior year.\n\nCollege and career prep are covered in third and fourth year English with preparation for the PSAT, SAT, and TOEFL tests, and also in college counselling courses in junior and senior year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xaviermicronesia.org/academics|title=Academics : Xavier High School, Micronesia|website=xaviermicronesia.org|access-date=2017-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==Staffing and enrollment==\nXavier High School employs an international staff of Jesuits, volunteers,<ref>[http://xaviermicronesia.org/about/staff Volunteer staff.
