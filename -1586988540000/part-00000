The film portrays the brutality of life inside a British [[borstal]].

Each is allocated a room; Angel and Davis get private rooms while Carlin is sent to a dormitory.\n\nCarlin wants to keep a low profile, having been transferred for assaulting a warden. He meets and befriends Archer, an eccentric and intellectual inmate intent on using [[non-violent]] means to cause as much of a nuisance to the staff as possible, and is informed his reputation is already known; Banks, the current \"Daddy\" (the inmate who controls the wing) is seeking Carlin for a fight to maintain his dominance over the wing.\n\nCarlin struggles to settle into the dormitory, and after having watched the timid and bullied Davis be attacked by Banks, is eventually violently ganged up on and beaten by Banks and his friends in an unprovoked attack.\n\nCarlin eventually gets his revenge on Banks. He uses a makeshift [[club (weapon)|cosh]] from a long sock with two snooker balls inside to beat Banks's crony, then confronts Banks in the bathroom and brutalises him. He then informs him that he is replacing him as the \"Daddy\" of the ward, and will 'kill him' if he ever interferes with his or his friends' business again. Carlin later acquires power over the adjacent wing of the borstal by administering a vicious beating to the adjacent wing's Daddy.\n\nLife improves for the inmates under Carlin, with victimisation of younger, weaker prisoners prevented, along with racially-motivated violence. Carlin gains status with the wardens. He persuades them to move him from the dormitory to a single cell in return for an agreement to be responsible in his status as a \"natural leader\". Mr Goodyear, the housemaster, offers Carlin a position of leadership in the borstal to help him develop his leadership skills.\n\nAnother inmate, Toyne, learns through a letter from his in-laws that his wife has died, and sinks into despair, eventually slashing his wrists. After being moved to another prison, word reaches the inmates that he has killed himself in a second suicide attempt. Davis, meanwhile, is framed for theft by Eckersley and placed on report. Carlin advises Davis to avoid them, though Davis is subsequently gang-raped by three youths in a greenhouse. This is seen by warder Sands, who merely smiles at the rape. Davis slips into despair, and kills himself when he uses a [[razor blade]] to slash himself in his cell at night. While bleeding to death, he presses the button in his cell for help, but is ignored by warder Greaves.\n\nDavis\u2019s suicide causes mass hysteria within the prison, with the inmates refusing to eat their food at dinner. Carlin initiates a full-scale riot in the dinner hall. Carlin, Archer and Toyne's friend Meakin are shown being dragged, bleeding and unconscious, into solitary confinement after having been beaten by the wardens. The Borstal's Governor later informs them the damage to the dinner hall will be repaid through lost earnings. The Governor then declares a minute's silent prayer for Davis and Toyne.\n\n==Cast==\n=== Inmates ===\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ray Winstone]] as Carlin\n*[[Mick Ford]] as Archer\n*[[Julian Firth]] as Davis\n*[[John Blundell (actor)|John Blundell]] as Banks\n*[[Phil Daniels]] as Richards\n*[[Ray Burdis]] as Eckersley\n*[[Alan Igbon]] as Meakin\n* John Fowler as Woods\n*[[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]] as Dougan\n* [[Herbert Norville]] as Toyne\n* George Winter as Rhodes\n*[[Alrick Riley]] as Angel\n* Philip DaCosta as Jackson\n* Peter Francis as Baldy\n*[[Andrew Paul]] as Betts\n*[[Sean Chapman]] as James\n* Ozzie Stevens as Smith\n* Ricky Wales as Chambers\n*[[Fuzz (musician)|James Lombard]] as Jameson\n*[[Perry Benson]] as Formby\n* [[John Rogan (actor)|John Rogan]] as Escort\n}}\n\n=== Borstal staff ===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Peter Howell (actor)|Peter Howell]] as The Governor\n* John Judd as Mr. Sands\n* [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as Mr. Greaves\n* [[John Grillo]] as Mr. Goodyear\n* [[Bill Dean]] as Mr. Duke\n* [[P.

The film contains strong language as opposed to the milder BBC version. The violent scenes were far more graphic in the 1979 remake. Ray Winstone, John Blundell, Phil Daniels, John Judd, Ray Burdis and Patrick Murray all reprise their respective roles as Carlin, Banks, Richards, Sands, Eckersley and Dougan from the BBC version, while all other roles are recast. [[David Threlfall]] had been intended to reprise his role as Archer from the BBC version, but he was working with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the time and was subsequently replaced with Mick Ford. The story was also changed. The BBC version features a homosexual relationship between Carlin and another inmate, which was dropped from the film. Minton later said that this was a pity as it would have expanded Carlin's character and made him vulnerable in an area where he could not afford to be vulnerable.\n\nThe television play version of the film also features less graphic rape and suicide scenes. An additional scene shows Davis trying to talk to Carlin about the incident. Carlin dismisses him when he told him to talk in front of his missus (partner) but Davis refuses to because it is too personal, then he  commits suicide. In the remake, the relationship between Carlin and his 'missus' does not feature. Instead, during the mess, Davis looks up at Carlin from the dining table as if about to confide in him, but Carlin unwittingly chooses that moment to get up and leave.\n\nAlso in the television play, it is made clear Banks is in hospital \u2013 resulting from the beating administered by Carlin when ousting him as the \"daddy\" \u2013 at the end of the film; in the theatrical version he is present at the end moment of silence.\n\n==Response==\nIn a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] case against Channel 4 for showing the film, British morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] initially won her private prosecution,<ref>[http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/4643.htm John Mark Ministries | Mary Whitehouse<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but the decision was later reversed on appeal. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] had approved on its transmission. However, the film was received well by critics, and today enjoys a reputation of a classic cult movie. Philip Thomas of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' said of the film, \"''Scum'''s brutality makes it a genuinely harrowing film. The bleak, snow-dusted locations, the featureless interiors of the institution, the perfect casting and magnificent acting of the indifferent and brutal staff make borstal appear to be what can only be described as a living hell.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/scum/review/|title=Scum Review|publisher= Empire|accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref> It currently holds an 89% approval rating on the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scum/|title=Scum (1979)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 2017 re-release ===\nIn 2017, [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] re-released the film in selected theatres for a limited time.

It was the digitally remastered uncut version but in fullscreen, with only a trailer and an interview as bonus features. In the US an Alan Clarke boxset was issued that included several films, among them both the BBC original and cinema version of the film plus audio commentaries. Prism Leisure released a limited edition 2 disc set in the UK on 13 June 2005. Disc One featured the [[Scum (television play)|BBC version]] with an audio commentary and two interviews. Disc Two instead featured the theatrical remake with an audio commentary, several interviews and featurettes and two trailers. It was digitally remastered from a widescreen print. This special edition DVD was sold in amaray slipcase packaging and also in a limited edition tin case.

The Governor then declares a minute's silent prayer for Davis and Toyne.\n\n==Cast==\n=== Inmates ===\n{{Cast listing|\n*[[Ray Winstone]] as Carlin\n*[[Mick Ford]] as Archer\n*[[Julian Firth]] as Davis\n*[[John Blundell (actor)|John Blundell]] as Banks\n*[[Phil Daniels]] as Richards\n*[[Ray Burdis]] as Eckersley\n*[[Alan Igbon]] as Meakin\n* John Fowler as Woods\n*[[Patrick Murray (actor)|Patrick Murray]] as Dougan\n* [[Herbert Norville]] as Toyne\n* George Winter as Rhodes\n*[[Alrick Riley]] as Angel\n* Philip DaCosta as Jackson\n* Peter Francis as Baldy\n*[[Andrew Paul]] as Betts\n*[[Sean Chapman]] as James\n* Ozzie Stevens as Smith\n* Ricky Wales as Chambers\n*[[Fuzz (musician)|James Lombard]] as Jameson\n*[[Perry Benson]] as Formby\n* [[John Rogan (actor)|John Rogan]] as Escort\n}}\n\n=== Borstal staff ===\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Peter Howell (actor)|Peter Howell]] as The Governor\n* John Judd as Mr. Sands\n* [[Philip Jackson (actor)|Philip Jackson]] as Mr. Greaves\n* [[John Grillo]] as Mr. Goodyear\n* [[Bill Dean]] as Mr. Duke\n* [[P.

The film contains strong language as opposed to the milder BBC version. The violent scenes were far more graphic in the 1979 remake. Ray Winstone, John Blundell, Phil Daniels, John Judd, Ray Burdis and Patrick Murray all reprise their respective roles as Carlin, Banks, Richards, Sands, Eckersley and Dougan from the BBC version, while all other roles are recast. [[David Threlfall]] had been intended to reprise his role as Archer from the BBC version, but he was working with the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] at the time and was subsequently replaced with Mick Ford. The story was also changed. The BBC version features a homosexual relationship between Carlin and another inmate, which was dropped from the film. Minton later said that this was a pity as it would have expanded Carlin's character and made him vulnerable in an area where he could not afford to be vulnerable.\n\nThe television play version of the film also features less graphic rape and suicide scenes. An additional scene shows Davis trying to talk to Carlin about the incident. Carlin dismisses him when he told him to talk in front of his missus (partner) but Davis refuses to because it is too personal, then he  commits suicide. In the remake, the relationship between Carlin and his 'missus' does not feature. Instead, during the mess, Davis looks up at Carlin from the dining table as if about to confide in him, but Carlin unwittingly chooses that moment to get up and leave.\n\nAlso in the television play, it is made clear Banks is in hospital \u2013 resulting from the beating administered by Carlin when ousting him as the \"daddy\" \u2013 at the end of the film; in the theatrical version he is present at the end moment of silence.\n\n==Response==\nIn a [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] case against Channel 4 for showing the film, British morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] initially won her private prosecution,<ref>[http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/4643.htm John Mark Ministries | Mary Whitehouse<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but the decision was later reversed on appeal. The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]] had approved on its transmission. However, the film was received well by critics, and today enjoys a reputation of a classic cult movie. Philip Thomas of ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' said of the film, \"''Scum'''s brutality makes it a genuinely harrowing film. The bleak, snow-dusted locations, the featureless interiors of the institution, the perfect casting and magnificent acting of the indifferent and brutal staff make borstal appear to be what can only be described as a living hell.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/scum/review/|title=Scum Review|publisher= Empire|accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref> It currently holds an 89% approval rating on the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scum/|title=Scum (1979)|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=January 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== 2017 re-release ===\nIn 2017, [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] re-released the film in selected theatres for a limited time.

It was the digitally remastered uncut version but in fullscreen, with only a trailer and an interview as bonus features. In the US an Alan Clarke boxset was issued that included several films, among them both the BBC original and cinema version of the film plus audio commentaries. Prism Leisure released a limited edition 2 disc set in the UK on 13 June 2005. Disc One featured the [[Scum (television play)|BBC version]] with an audio commentary and two interviews. Disc Two instead featured the theatrical remake with an audio commentary, several interviews and featurettes and two trailers. It was digitally remastered from a widescreen print. This special edition DVD was sold in amaray slipcase packaging and also in a limited edition tin case. A Region 0 DVD boxset featuring both the theatrical version and the 1977 BBC-banned television version on separate discs followed in the US, released by [[Blue Underground]].<ref>Scum: 2 Disc Collector's Special Edition, 2007 Quest Media</ref> In 2015, Australian company [[Shock Records|Shock Entertainment]] released ''Scum'' on DVD and Blu-ray as part of their Cinema Cult line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shock.com.au/product-details/dvd/scum/1/4910|title= Scum - Shock Entertainment|accessdate= January 28, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Scum-Blu-ray/123992/|title=Scum Blu-ray (Australia)|publisher=Blu-ray.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Scum (television play)|''Scum'' (television play)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|0079871}}\n* [https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/scum/ ''Scum''] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]\n* [http://www.bfi.org.uk/distribution/scum ''Scum''] at the [[British Film Institute]]\n\n{{Alan Clarke}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Scum (Film)}}\n[[Category:1979 films]]\n[[Category:1970s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1970s prison films]]\n[[Category:1970s teen films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:British films based on plays]]\n[[Category:British prison films]]\n[[Category:British teen drama films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Alan Clarke]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire]]\n[[Category:1979 directorial debut films]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:possessive", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scum_(film)"}

The ranges of size include standard, medium, and miniature (if the poodle parent was miniature). Upon reaching adulthood, a standard goldendoodle will often weigh 60 to 100 pounds. A medium goldendoodle will weigh between 30 and 45 pounds and a miniature goldendoodle will weigh approximately 15 to 30 pounds.
