It was later ported to other platforms, and spawned a series of follow up titles. The game was produced by [[Stainless Games]] and published by [[Interplay Productions]] and [[Sales Curve Interactive]].\n\nIn 2011, Stainless Games obtained the rights to ''Carmageddon'' from former company [[Square Enix Europe]]. In June 2012, it was announced that a new port of the game would be released for [[iOS]] and certain [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile devices.<ref name=kick>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stainlessgames/carmageddon-reincarnation/posts/238238/ |title=Carmageddon: Reincarnation Kickstarter Page |date=June 1, 2012 |publisher=Stainless Games |accessdate=2012-06-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604063110/http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stainlessgames/carmageddon-reincarnation/posts/238238 |archivedate=June 4, 2012 }}</ref> The game was released as both a free demo and paid game in 2013.

The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars, or by running over pedestrians. Unusual for a racing game, checkpoints do not extend the time limit.\n\nRaces are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, \"wasting\" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level. The game includes thirty six race tracks, played across eleven different locations. \n\nThe game featured three songs (in instrumental format) from [[Fear Factory]]'s 1995 album ''[[Demanufacture (album)|Demanufacture]]''. The title track and \"Body Hammer\" are both included with the song \"Zero Signal\" being used in the game's intro.\n\n==Development==\nThe game that became ''Carmageddon'' started out as \"3D Destruction Derby\", a [[banger racing]] sim prototyped by [[Stainless Games|Stainless Software]]. This was signed by [[Square Enix Europe|SCi]] in 1995, but under the condition that it be made into a licensed game in order to guarantee popularity. Initially, SCi wanted to use the ''[[Mad Max]]'' license, but they were unable to find out who owned the rights to the franchise. They instead secured the ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' license, as a sequel to the original film was at that time planned.<ref name=makingof>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/making-of%C3%B6-carmageddon | title=The Making Of...

They decided it made sense to create a game where this was the objective to begin with.<ref name=makingof/> Shortly after, [[Psygnosis]] released a game with this same concept, ''[[Destruction Derby]]''. \n\nThe notion of running over pedestrians was added in an effort to distinguish the game from ''Destruction Derby'' and arouse controversy.<ref name=NGen25>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Carmaggedon{{sic}}|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|pages=125\u20136}}</ref> However, there had been a number of recent games which involved running over pedestrians, such as ''[[Quarantine (video game)|Quarantine]]'' and ''[[Die Hard Trilogy]]''.<ref name=NGen25/> Rob Henderson from SCi suggested that they could increase the potential for controversy by awarding the player points for the pedestrian kills.<ref name=makingof/>\n\nThe sequel to ''Death Race 2000'' was later cancelled, but by this point SCi were impressed enough by Stainless's work on the game that they felt they could try creating their own [[Intellectual property|IP]].<ref name=makingof/> The name ''Carmageddon'' was coined, and development proceeded with the designers allowed unusually free rein with regard to the content of the game.\n\nThe game uses the [[BRender]] engine, which Stainless Software were already thoroughly familiar with; one of their previous contracts was to port BRender to Macintosh and build the corresponding tools and demos.<ref name=NGen25/> The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] conversion was subcontracted to developer in the United States, Elite, with the plan to release the PC and PlayStation versions simultaneously. Buckland anticipated that Elite would have problems with the conversion due to ''Carmageddon''{{'}}s open environments.<ref name=NGen25/>\n\n==Release==\n''Carmageddon'' was originally released for [[MS-DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Mac OS]] in 1997. An [[expansion pack]], ''Splat Pack'', was released in 1997. It included new tracks, vehicles, environments, network levels and [[3dfx Interactive|3Dfx]] support.

As a bonus, it also included a strategy guide, mousepad, and a leather car key chain with ''Carmageddon'''s logo on it.\n\nA port was in development for the [[Gizmondo]], but was never released due to the system's demise. ''Carmageddon'' and its expansion ''Splat Pack'' were released on [[GOG.com]] on 27 September 2012 for modern operating systems, likely in conjunction with the [[Interstate 405 (California)#\"Carmageddon\"|29\u201330 September closure of Interstate 405]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/carmageddon_max_pack |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906021025/http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/carmageddon_max_pack |archivedate=2012-09-06 }}</ref>\nIn addition, a port of the game for [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] mobile devices ([[Ipod touch|iPod Touch]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]]) was released on 17 October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carmageddon/id498240451?mt=8 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019190626/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/carmageddon/id498240451?mt=8 |archivedate=2012-10-19 }}</ref> A port for Android based devices was released on 10 May 2013.

The player has a certain amount of time to complete each race, but more time may be gained by collecting bonuses, damaging the competitors' cars, or by running over pedestrians. Unusual for a racing game, checkpoints do not extend the time limit.\n\nRaces are completed by either completing the course as one would a normal racing game, \"wasting\" (wrecking) all other race cars, or killing all pedestrians on the level. The game includes thirty six race tracks, played across eleven different locations. \n\nThe game featured three songs (in instrumental format) from [[Fear Factory]]'s 1995 album ''[[Demanufacture (album)|Demanufacture]]''. The title track and \"Body Hammer\" are both included with the song \"Zero Signal\" being used in the game's intro.\n\n==Development==\nThe game that became ''Carmageddon'' started out as \"3D Destruction Derby\", a [[banger racing]] sim prototyped by [[Stainless Games|Stainless Software]]. This was signed by [[Square Enix Europe|SCi]] in 1995, but under the condition that it be made into a licensed game in order to guarantee popularity. Initially, SCi wanted to use the ''[[Mad Max]]'' license, but they were unable to find out who owned the rights to the franchise. They instead secured the ''[[Death Race 2000]]'' license, as a sequel to the original film was at that time planned.<ref name=makingof>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/making-of%C3%B6-carmageddon | title=The Making Of...

They decided it made sense to create a game where this was the objective to begin with.<ref name=makingof/> Shortly after, [[Psygnosis]] released a game with this same concept, ''[[Destruction Derby]]''. \n\nThe notion of running over pedestrians was added in an effort to distinguish the game from ''Destruction Derby'' and arouse controversy.<ref name=NGen25>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Carmaggedon{{sic}}|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=25 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=January 1997|pages=125\u20136}}</ref> However, there had been a number of recent games which involved running over pedestrians, such as ''[[Quarantine (video game)|Quarantine]]'' and ''[[Die Hard Trilogy]]''.<ref name=NGen25/> Rob Henderson from SCi suggested that they could increase the potential for controversy by awarding the player points for the pedestrian kills.<ref name=makingof/>\n\nThe sequel to ''Death Race 2000'' was later cancelled, but by this point SCi were impressed enough by Stainless's work on the game that they felt they could try creating their own [[Intellectual property|IP]].<ref name=makingof/> The name ''Carmageddon'' was coined, and development proceeded with the designers allowed unusually free rein with regard to the content of the game.\n\nThe game uses the [[BRender]] engine, which Stainless Software were already thoroughly familiar with; one of their previous contracts was to port BRender to Macintosh and build the corresponding tools and demos.<ref name=NGen25/> The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] conversion was subcontracted to developer in the United States, Elite, with the plan to release the PC and PlayStation versions simultaneously. Buckland anticipated that Elite would have problems with the conversion due to ''Carmageddon''{{'}}s open environments.<ref name=NGen25/>\n\n==Release==\n''Carmageddon'' was originally released for [[MS-DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows]], and [[Mac OS]] in 1997. An [[expansion pack]], ''Splat Pack'', was released in 1997. It included new tracks, vehicles, environments, network levels and [[3dfx Interactive|3Dfx]] support.

It makes it possible to inoculate and grow dozens or hundreds of independent cultures of dozens of samples at the same time.  Besides being much cheaper and convenient than separate dishes, the multiwell plate is also more amenable to automated handling and inspection.\n\n==Uses==\n\n=== Microbiology ===\n[[File:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|thumb|left|A Petri dish with [[bacteria]]l colonies on an [[agar]]-based [[growth medium]]]]\n\nPetri dishes are widely used in biology to [[microbiological culture|cultivate]] microorganisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[yeast]]s, and [[mold]]s.  It is most suited for organisms that thrive on a solid or semisolid surface.  \n\nThe culture medium is often an [[agar plate]], a layer a few mm thick of [[agar]] or [[agarose]] [[hydrogel|gel]] containing whatever nutrients the organism requires (such as [[blood]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s) and other desired ingredients (such as [[staining|dyes]], [[chemical indicator|indicators]], and [[medicinal drug]]s).

It makes it possible to inoculate and grow dozens or hundreds of independent cultures of dozens of samples at the same time.  Besides being much cheaper and convenient than separate dishes, the multiwell plate is also more amenable to automated handling and inspection.\n\n==Uses==\n\n=== Microbiology ===\n[[File:Agar plate with colonies.jpg|thumb|left|A Petri dish with [[bacteria]]l colonies on an [[agar]]-based [[growth medium]]]]\n\nPetri dishes are widely used in biology to [[microbiological culture|cultivate]] microorganisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[yeast]]s, and [[mold]]s.  It is most suited for organisms that thrive on a solid or semisolid surface.  \n\nThe culture medium is often an [[agar plate]], a layer a few mm thick of [[agar]] or [[agarose]] [[hydrogel|gel]] containing whatever nutrients the organism requires (such as [[blood]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[amino acid]]s) and other desired ingredients (such as [[staining|dyes]], [[chemical indicator|indicators]], and [[medicinal drug]]s). The agar and other ingredients are dissolved in warm water and poured into the dish and left to cool down.  Once the medium solidifies, a sample of the organism is [[Inoculation|inoculated]] (\"plated\").\n\nThe dishes are then left undisturbed for hours or days while the organism grows, possibly in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]].

EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The beginnings (1986\u20131997) ===\n\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled ''Opportunities in Chemistry''. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n=== The early years (1997\u20132001) ===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\n[[File:Web Size-SynBio Fungi-5.jpg|thumb|right|A biologist is studying natural bioproducts using traditional genetics and synthetic biology. ]]\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students.

He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d.

He also served as a consultant with other museums on diorama restoration, as in 2018, when he helped restore the ''Hall of Fishes'' in the [[Vanderbilt Museum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tbrnewsmedia.com/tag/thomas-doncourt/|title=Thomas Doncourt {{!}} TBR News Media|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n\n== Cover Art for the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide''== \nBetween the years 2000 and 2017, Doncourt traveled to Japan four times. He was particularly interested in visiting Buddhist temples and gardens in [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]]. During his final trip to Japan shortly after his diagnosis, Doncourt visited Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d, a Buddhist temple of the Tendai sect in the Higashiyama district of Kyoto, several times. He produced a detailed drawing in the Hall of the Lotus King, where1,001 statues and their guardians stand. That drawing became the basis for his final painting, a large canvas portraying multiple rows of golden Kannon with a guardian statue in the foreground. The specific guardian Doncourt chose to focus on is named Sakara Ryu-o (literally the Sakara King of Dragons). He relied on memory alone to recreate the colors.  In September 2019, a kindred spirit, Lisa Schell, and her friend, an editor from the ''Kyoto Visitor\u2019s Guide'', expressed interest in using Doncourt\u2019s painting for the cover of an upcoming issue, with an accompanying article about 'the immortal force of compassion and mercy' that inspired him at Sanj\u016bsangen-d\u014d. The magazine offered Doncourt's estate an opportunity to showcase his artwork, and his lyrics about the nearby Philosopher\u2019s Path.<ref name=\":2\" /> The issue was published in February 2020.  \n \n== Discography == \n* 1978: Cathedral - ''Stained Glass Stories'', Delta Records<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441714-Cathedral-3|title=Cathedral (3)|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2002: Thomas Doncourt - ''Fauve,'' self released<ref>{{Citation|title=Fauve by Thomas Doncourt|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/thomas_doncourt/fauve/|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2007: Cathedral - ''The Bridge'', self released<ref name=\":8\" /> \n* 2009: FauveMuseum - ''Blacklight,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/FauveMuseum-Blacklight/release/5544720|title=FauveMuseum - Blacklight|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2014: Tom Doncourt - ''The Mortal Coil,'' self released<ref name=\":6\" /> \n* 2015: Tom Doncourt - ''The Moon Will Rise,'' self released<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/1441713-Tom-Doncourt|title=Tom Doncourt|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>\n* 2017: Tom Doncourt - ''House in the Woods,'' self released<ref name=\":7\" /> \n* 2018: Tom Doncourt & Nadia Ratsimandresy - ''Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Volume 1'', self released<ref>{{Citation|title=\u266b Ratsimandresy & Doncourt, Vol. 1 - Tom Doncourt.

However, some second-generation antihistamines, notably [[cetirizine]], can interact with [[Central nervous system|CNS]] [[psychoactive]] drugs such as [[bupropion]] and [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drug Interaction Report|url=https://www.drugs.com/interactions-check.php?drug_list=440-0,569-0,703-0&types[]=major&types[]=minor&types[]=moderate&types[]=food&types[]=therapeutic_duplication&professional=1|website=drugs.com|accessdate=28 January 2017}}</ref>\n;Examples -\nSystemic:\n* [[Astemizole|Astemizole (Hismanal)]] \n* [[Ketotifen|Ketotifen (Zaditor)]]\n* [[Cetirizine|Cetirizine (Zyrtec)]]\n* [[Loratadine|Loratadine (Claritin)]]\n* [[Rupatadine|Rupatadine (Rupafin)]]\n* [[Mizolastine|Mizolastine (Mizollen)]] \n* [[Acrivastine|Acrivastine (Benadryl Allergy Relief (UK), Semprex (US))]]\n* [[Ebastine|Ebastine (Evastin, Kestine, Ebastel, Aleva, Ebatrol)]]\n* [[Bilastine|Bilastine (Bilaxten)]]\n* [[Bepotastine|Bepotastine (Talion, Bepreve)]]\n* [[Terfenadine|Terfenadine (Seldane (US), Triludan (UK), and Teldane (Australia))]]\n* [[Quifenadine|Quifenadine (Phencarol, \u0424\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043b)]]\n\nTopical:\n\n* [[Azelastine]]\n* [[Levocabastine|Levocabastine (Livostin)]]\n* [[Olopatadine|Olopatadine (Pazeo)]]\n\n===Third-generation===\nThird-generation H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines are second-generation antihistamines informally labeled third-generation because the active [[enantiomer]] (levocetirizine) or [[metabolite]] (desloratadine and fexofenadine) derivatives of second-generation drugs are intended to have increased [[efficacy]] with fewer [[adverse drug reaction]]s. Fexofenadine is associated with a lower risk of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] compared to terfenadine. However, there is little evidence for any advantage of levocetirizine or desloratadine, compared to [[cetirizine]] or [[loratadine]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThere is some controversy associated with the use of the term \"third-generation antihistamines.\"<ref name=\"pmid17136293\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Camelo-Nunes IC | title = New antihistamines: a critical view | language = Portuguese | journal = Jornal de Pediatria | volume = 82 | issue = 5 Suppl | pages = S173-80 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17136293 | doi = 10.1590/S0021-75572006000700007 }}</ref>\n\n;Examples -\n\nSystemic:\n* [[Levocetirizine|Levocetirizine (Xyzal)]]<ref name=\"pmid16445787\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nettis E, Colanardi MC, Barra L, Ferrannini A, Vacca A, Tursi A | title = Levocetirizine in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 533\u20138 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16445787 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.07049.x }}</ref>\n* [[Desloratadine]]<ref name=\"pmid16109168\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Howell G, West L, Jenkins C, Lineberry B, Yokum D, Rockhold R | title = In vivo antimuscarinic actions of the third generation antihistaminergic agent, desloratadine | journal = BMC Pharmacology | volume = 5 | pages = 13 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16109168 | pmc = 1192807 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2210-5-13 }}</ref>\n* [[Fexofenadine|Fexofenadine (Allegra)]]<ref name=\"pmid12575922\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vena GA, Cassano N, Filieri M, Filotico R, D'Argento V, Coviello C | title = Fexofenadine in chronic idiopathic urticaria: a clinical and immunohistochemical evaluation | journal = International Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 217\u2013224 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12575922 | doi = 10.1177/039463200201500308 }}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n\n===Over-the-counter===\nH<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists that are approved for [[over-the-counter]] sale, at least in the [[United States]], include:<ref name=\"FDA\">{{cite web | url = https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/UCM135688.pdf | title = OTC Active Ingredients | date = 7 April 2010 | publisher = United States Food and Drug Administration }}</ref>\n\n====First-generation====\nCommon/marketed:\n\n* [[Brompheniramine]] (Dimetapp, Dimetane)\n* [[Chlorpheniramine]] (Chlor-Trimeton)\n* [[Dimenhydrinate]] (Dramamine, Gravol) \u2013 combination of [[diphenhydramine]] and [[8-chlorotheophylline]]\n* [[Diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl)\n* [[Doxylamine]] (Unisom)\n\nUncommon/discontinued:\n\n* [[Chlorcyclizine]]\n* [[Dexbrompheniramine]]\n* [[Dexchlorpheniramine]]\n* [[Methapyrilene]]\n* [[Phenindamine]]\n* [[Pheniramine]]\n* [[Phenyltoloxamine]]\n* [[Pyrilamine]]\n* [[Thenyldiamine]]\n* [[Thonzylamine]]\n* [[Triprolidine]]\n\n====Second-generation====\n* [[Cetirizine]] (Zyrtec)\n* [[Loratadine]] (Alavert, Claritin)\n\n====Third-generation====\n* [[Desloratadine]] (Clarinex)\n* [[Fexofenadine]] (Allegra)\n* [[Levocetirizine]] (Xyzal)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MeshName|Antihistaminics,+H1}}\n\n{{Antihistamines}}\n{{Histaminergics}}\n{{Major Drug Groups}}\n{{Neuromodulation}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:H1 Antagonist}}\n[[Category:H1 receptor antagonists| ]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(Fixing period locations)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H1_antagonist"}
