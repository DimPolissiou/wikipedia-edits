He has been threatened and attacked on several occasions for his work, including being held hostage in his home in 2003 and being kidnapped and beaten in 2008.\n\nZamora has received numerous international prizes and distinctions. He was awarded the [[Maria Moors Cabot Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1994, he received an [[CPJ International Press Freedom Awards|International Press Freedom Award]] from the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] in 1994, he was named one of 50 [[World Press Freedom Heroes]] of the 20th century by the [[International Press Institute]]<ref name=IPI2>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemedia.at/awards/world-press-freedom-heroes/ |title=World Press Freedom Heroes: Symbols of courage in global journalism |year=2012 |publisher=[[International Press Institute]] |accessdate=January 26, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116082802/http://www.freemedia.at/awards/world-press-freedom-heroes |archivedate=January 16, 2012 }}</ref> in 2000, and in 2003 the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] awarded him its [[Knight International Journalism Award|International Journalism Award]].\n\n==Education and Early Career==\nZamora began working as a reporter in ''La Hora'' (\"The Hour\"), a newspaper owned by his family, when he was 17. He earned degrees in [[industrial engineering]] and business administration, and in 1986, founded ANC, a documentary and news production company in 1985.<ref name=IPI/>\n\n==''Siglo Veintiuno''==\nIn 1990, Zamora founded his first newspaper, ''Siglo Veintiuno''. The paper advocated judicial and tax reforms, and reported on dangerous subjects including narcotics smuggling, human rights issues, guerrilla groups, and corruption in the government of President [[Jorge Serrano]]. As a result, Zamora and the staff received death threats and were subject to physical attacks.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nThree years later, Guatemala saw a [[1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]], in which Serrano suspended the constitution and dissolved [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]]. He also instituted press censorship, surrounding the ''Siglo Veintiuno'' offices with national police forces. During this period, Zamora satirized the censorship by renaming his paper ''Siglo Catorce'' (\"14th Century\") and running stories covered in solid blocks of ink; he also faxed uncensored versions of the stories to newspapers in neighboring countries. The [[International Press Institute]] credits this clandestine reporting with contributing to Serrano's condemnation by the international community and his eventual flight from the country.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nIn May 1996, Zamora left the paper following disagreements with its board of directors.<ref name=IPI/>\n\n==''El Peri\u00f3dico''==\nZamora's new newspaper, ''El Peri\u00f3dico'', launched on November 6, 1996, funded by the donations of 125 citizens who supported his stand on press freedom. One year later, it was bought by the owners of ''[[Prensa Libre (Guatemala)|Prensa Libre]]'', Guatemala's best-selling newspaper.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nIn 2001, the ''Peri\u00f3dico'' offices were attacked by a group of fifty protesters after reporting on alleged corruption in the staff of Communications Minister [[Luis Rabb\u00e9]]. The crowd attempted to force the building's doors and set it on fire, and Zamora was burned in effigy. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, police took more than forty minutes to respond and made no arrests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifex.org/guatemala/2001/02/27/newspaper_under_attack_after_reports/ |title=Newspaper Under Attack After Reports on Government Corruption |date=February 27, 2001 |publisher=International Freedom of Expression Exchange |url-status=dead |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014235508/http://www.ifex.org/guatemala/2001/02/27/newspaper_under_attack_after_reports/ |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe newspaper conducted a lengthy investigation into links between the government of President [[Alfonso Portillo]] and organized crime, the results of which were published in November 2002. The government then sent auditors to the ''Peri\u00f3dico'' offices for 40 days, withdrawing them only after a complaint by the [[World Association of Newspapers]] (WAN).<ref name=BBC286 />\n\n== Attacks on Zamora ==\nZamora has been attacked several times in connection with his reporting. In 1995, his car was driven off the road by two people who threatened to kill him for publishing allegations in ''Siglo Veintiuno'' that the [[military of Guatemala]] had links to organized crime. In May 1996, attackers drove past his parked car, throwing two grenades at it; Zamora was unhurt because neither he nor other passengers were in the car.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nIn June 2003, Zamora and his family were held hostage in their home for hours by a group of eleven men and one woman.<ref name=P /><ref name=BBC266>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3021960.stm |title=Editor assaulted in Guatemala |author=David Brewer |date=June 26, 2003 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=March 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306160020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3021960.stm |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}</ref> The attackers beat Zamora's children and forced him to strip and kneel at gunpoint. According to Zamora, one of the gang stated: \"If you value your children stop bothering the people above.

Knight Foundation]] awarded him its [[Knight International Journalism Award|International Journalism Award]].\n\n==Education and Early Career==\nZamora began working as a reporter in ''La Hora'' (\"The Hour\"), a newspaper owned by his family, when he was 17. He earned degrees in [[industrial engineering]] and business administration, and in 1986, founded ANC, a documentary and news production company in 1985.<ref name=IPI/>\n\n==''Siglo Veintiuno''==\nIn 1990, Zamora founded his first newspaper, ''Siglo Veintiuno''. The paper advocated judicial and tax reforms, and reported on dangerous subjects including narcotics smuggling, human rights issues, guerrilla groups, and corruption in the government of President [[Jorge Serrano]]. As a result, Zamora and the staff received death threats and were subject to physical attacks.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nThree years later, Guatemala saw a [[1993 Guatemalan constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]], in which Serrano suspended the constitution and dissolved [[Congress of Guatemala|Congress]]. He also instituted press censorship, surrounding the ''Siglo Veintiuno'' offices with national police forces. During this period, Zamora satirized the censorship by renaming his paper ''Siglo Catorce'' (\"14th Century\") and running stories covered in solid blocks of ink; he also faxed uncensored versions of the stories to newspapers in neighboring countries. The [[International Press Institute]] credits this clandestine reporting with contributing to Serrano's condemnation by the international community and his eventual flight from the country.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nIn May 1996, Zamora left the paper following disagreements with its board of directors.<ref name=IPI/>\n\n==''El Peri\u00f3dico''==\nZamora's new newspaper, ''El Peri\u00f3dico'', launched on November 6, 1996, funded by the donations of 125 citizens who supported his stand on press freedom. One year later, it was bought by the owners of ''[[Prensa Libre (Guatemala)|Prensa Libre]]'', Guatemala's best-selling newspaper.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nIn 2001, the ''Peri\u00f3dico'' offices were attacked by a group of fifty protesters after reporting on alleged corruption in the staff of Communications Minister [[Luis Rabb\u00e9]]. The crowd attempted to force the building's doors and set it on fire, and Zamora was burned in effigy. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, police took more than forty minutes to respond and made no arrests.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifex.org/guatemala/2001/02/27/newspaper_under_attack_after_reports/ |title=Newspaper Under Attack After Reports on Government Corruption |date=February 27, 2001 |publisher=International Freedom of Expression Exchange |url-status=dead |archivedate=October 14, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014235508/http://www.ifex.org/guatemala/2001/02/27/newspaper_under_attack_after_reports/ |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe newspaper conducted a lengthy investigation into links between the government of President [[Alfonso Portillo]] and organized crime, the results of which were published in November 2002. The government then sent auditors to the ''Peri\u00f3dico'' offices for 40 days, withdrawing them only after a complaint by the [[World Association of Newspapers]] (WAN).<ref name=BBC286 />\n\n== Attacks on Zamora ==\nZamora has been attacked several times in connection with his reporting. In 1995, his car was driven off the road by two people who threatened to kill him for publishing allegations in ''Siglo Veintiuno'' that the [[military of Guatemala]] had links to organized crime. In May 1996, attackers drove past his parked car, throwing two grenades at it; Zamora was unhurt because neither he nor other passengers were in the car.<ref name=IPI/>\n\nIn June 2003, Zamora and his family were held hostage in their home for hours by a group of eleven men and one woman.<ref name=P /><ref name=BBC266>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3021960.stm |title=Editor assaulted in Guatemala |author=David Brewer |date=June 26, 2003 |publisher=BBC News |archivedate=March 6, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306160020/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3021960.stm |accessdate=August 24, 2012 }}</ref> The attackers beat Zamora's children and forced him to strip and kneel at gunpoint.

He was born on his father's [[Bonaventure Plantation]], near [[Savannah, Georgia]]. After studying in England, he was appointed a [[midshipman]] on 1 January 1812 and attended the [[Naval academy]] at [[Washington, D.C.]], until 1 August when he was assigned to the [[frigate]] [[USS Constellation (1797)|''Constellation'']].\n\nWhen his ship tried to slip out to sea, the strong [[United Kingdom|British]] squadron operating in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] forced her to put into [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Constellation'' remained bottled up in [[Hampton Roads]] for the duration of the War of 1812, but Tattnall and his comrades still managed to get into the fray. He was among the 100 or so sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] assigned to the shore battery on [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]]. On 22 June 1813, the [[United Kingdom|British]] attempted to carry the island by storm in preparation for an attack on nearby Norfolk. Tattnall's battery and a force of American boats gave the attackers a sound rebuff that deterred the British from further attempts to take the city.\n\nIn April 1814, Midshipman Tattnall was detached from ''Constellation'' and, by 24 August, was in command of a force of employees from the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. He led them into the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] in an unsuccessful effort to stop the British advance on the American capital. On 14 October, he was ordered to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] for duty on [[HMS Epervier (1812)|''Epervier'']]. In May 1815, that sloop sailed for the [[Mediterranean]] with Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]]'s squadron to engage the [[Barbary Pirates]] in [[Algiers]] in the [[Second Barbary War]]. On 17 June, she participated in the [[Battle off Cape Gata|capture of the frigate]] ''[[Mashouda]]'' and, two days later, of the [[brig]] [[Battle off Cape Palos|''Estedio'']]. In July, when ''Epervier'' was ordered back to the United States with dispatches, Tattnall remained in the Mediterranean in ''Constellation''. In January 1817, he transferred to [[USS Ontario (1813)|''Ontario'']] and returned in her to the United States.\n\n==Interwar years, 1818\u20131845==\nPromoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1818, Tattnall was assigned to the frigate [[USS Macedonian (1810)|''Macedonian'']] on 30 June, and he sailed in her for the [[Pacific]] in November. He was detached from ''Macedonian'' on 30 August 1820, and returned to the United States. Ordered to Norfolk on 26 December 1822, he joined Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s squadron in [[schooner]] [[USS Jackall (1823)|''Jackall'']]. Lieutenant Tattnall served in the [[West Indies]] on an expedition to suppress piracy until he was detached on 4 May 1823. On 23 June 1824, Tattnall was ordered to ''Constitution'' for Mediterranean service. In March 1826, he transferred to [[USS Brandywine|''Brandywine'']] and returned home in her in May. On the 15th of that month, he was granted six months leave, which was later extended into 1828.\n\nTattnall served in [[USS Erie (1813)|''Erie'']] from October 1828 to August 1829 and then went on to survey the [[Dry Tortugas|Tortugas]] until March 1830. Lt. Tattnall took command of schooner [[USS Grampus (1820)|''Grampus'']] on 15 April 1831, and cruised the West Indies and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In August 1832, he captured the Mexican schooner, [[Montezuma (ship)|''Montezuma'']], which had boarded and robbed an American ship on the high seas.

Tattnall commanded Southern naval units during the defense of [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal]] until the harbor was captured by Union forces on 7 November 1861.

He was born on his father's plantation of ''Bonaventure'', near [[Savannah, Georgia]]. After studying in England, he was appointed a [[midshipman]] on 1 January 1812 and attended the [[Naval academy]] at [[Washington, D.C.]], until 1 August when he was assigned to the [[frigate]] [[USS Constellation (1797)|''Constellation'']].\n\nWhen his ship tried to slip out to sea, the strong [[United Kingdom|British]] squadron operating in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] forced her to put into [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. ''Constellation'' remained bottled up in [[Hampton Roads]] for the duration of the War of 1812, but Tattnall and his comrades still managed to get into the fray. He was among the 100 or so sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|marines]] assigned to the shore battery on [[Craney Island (Virginia)|Craney Island]]. On 22 June 1813, the [[United Kingdom|British]] attempted to carry the island by storm in preparation for an attack on nearby Norfolk. Tattnall's battery and a force of American boats gave the attackers a sound rebuff that deterred the British from further attempts to take the city.\n\nIn April 1814, Midshipman Tattnall was detached from ''Constellation'' and, by 24 August, was in command of a force of employees from the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. He led them into the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] in an unsuccessful effort to stop the British advance on the American capital. On 14 October, he was ordered to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] for duty on [[HMS Epervier (1812)|''Epervier'']]. In May 1815, that sloop sailed for the [[Mediterranean]] with Commodore [[Stephen Decatur]]'s squadron to engage the [[Barbary Pirates]] in [[Algiers]] in the [[Second Barbary War]]. On 17 June, she participated in the [[Battle off Cape Gata|capture of the frigate]] ''[[Mashouda]]'' and, two days later, of the [[brig]] [[Battle off Cape Palos|''Estedio'']]. In July, when ''Epervier'' was ordered back to the United States with dispatches, Tattnall remained in the Mediterranean in ''Constellation''. In January 1817, he transferred to [[USS Ontario (1813)|''Ontario'']] and returned in her to the United States.\n\n==Interwar years, 1818\u20131845==\nPromoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1818, Tattnall was assigned to the frigate [[USS Macedonian (1810)|''Macedonian'']] on 30 June, and he sailed in her for the [[Pacific]] in November. He was detached from ''Macedonian'' on 30 August 1820, and returned to the United States. Ordered to Norfolk on 26 December 1822, he joined Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]'s squadron in [[schooner]] [[USS Jackall (1823)|''Jackall'']]. Lieutenant Tattnall served in the [[West Indies]] on an expedition to suppress piracy until he was detached on 4 May 1823. On 23 June 1824, Tattnall was ordered to ''Constitution'' for Mediterranean service. In March 1826, he transferred to [[USS Brandywine|''Brandywine'']] and returned home in her in May. On the 15th of that month, he was granted six months leave, which was later extended into 1828.\n\nTattnall served in [[USS Erie (1813)|''Erie'']] from October 1828 to August 1829 and then went on to survey the [[Dry Tortugas|Tortugas]] until March 1830. Lt. Tattnall took command of schooner [[USS Grampus (1820)|''Grampus'']] on 15 April 1831, and cruised the West Indies and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. In August 1832, he captured the Mexican schooner, [[Montezuma (ship)|''Montezuma'']], which had boarded and robbed an American ship on the high seas. He was detached from ''Grampus'' in September 1832 and went on leave awaiting orders for almost four years before being ordered in, July 1836, to recruit men for Captain [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]]' survey and exploration expedition.\n\nTattnall was promoted to commander on 25 February 1836, and, in April, reported for a three-year tour of duty at the [[Boston Navy Yard]].\n\n==Mexican\u2013American War==\nFollowing service with the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean]] and [[African Squadron|African squadrons]], Commander Tattnall joined the [[Mosquito Division]] in the Gulf of Mexico in 1846, commanding the steam gunboat, [[USS Spitfire (1846)|''Spitfire'']].

[[midfielder]].\n\nBorn in [[Ipswich]], Dyer played youth football for his home club [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] before going on to make nearly 100 league appearances for the club's first team. He was sold to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for \u00a36&nbsp;million, at the time the highest fee paid for an Ipswich player, and made nearly 200 appearances for Newcastle between 1999 and 2007. A move for the same fee to [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] followed, but Dyer suffered from various injuries, restricting him to 30 league appearances in four seasons. After a short loan back to Ipswich in March 2011, he signed for newly promoted club [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] ahead of their [[2011\u201312 Premier League]] season. However, his time at QPR was again blighted by injuries and he made just eight appearances for the club before being released in January 2013, spending the rest of the season at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] before retiring.\n\nDyer represented [[England national football team|England]] on 33 occasions between 1999 and 2007. He was a member of the England squads which reached the quarter-finals at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2004]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Ipswich Town===\nDyer was born in [[Ipswich]], to
