Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings, seven from Alick's previous marriage and seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage, and afterward three full sisters, though one sibling, Jemima, died in childbirth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family were to later settle in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported the Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

Born in Madowla Park, near [[Echuca]] in Victoria, Atkinson and her family were forced to move frequently, either through the necessity of finding work, or at times forcibly by authorities. She converted to [[Christianity]] when the [[Aborigines' Inland Mission]] (AIM) visited the [[Cummeragunja Reserve]], where she was living, and served the mission for many years in roles such as organist and deacon. Atkinson supported key Aboriginal activists including [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], [[Jack Patten]] and [[Thomas Shadrach James]], and participated in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]]. At the end of her life she finally saw the building of her church, which she found bittersweet as her husband [[Edwin Atkinson|Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson]], who was also a key figure in the church community, had not lived to see the culmination of his life's work.\n\n==Early life==\nAtkinson's father, Alick Campbell, was a \"[[Half-caste#Australia|half-caste]]\" Aboriginal stockman<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> and a widower who had followed his first wife, Emma Jackson Patterson, from Ganawarra Station (near [[Kerang]]) to [[Coranderrk]]. When his first wife died he married Elizabeth Briggs Charles, and Ellen was born at Madowla Park, near Echuca, in August 1894.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/><ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Atkinson had sixteen siblings, seven from Alick's previous marriage and seven from Elizabeth's previous marriage, and afterward three full sisters, though one sibling, Jemima, died in childbirth.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> \n\nThe Campbell family had a dislocated history. Ellen\u2019s mother was born to John Briggs and his \"quarter-caste Aboriginal\" wife, [[Louisa Briggs|Louisa]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Loiusa's mother, Mary&mdash;herself a \"half-caste\" Aborigine&mdash;and grandmother, Marjorie, had been kidnapped in 1833 from [[Point Nepean]] by sealers before Mary later married John Strugnell, a former [[chimney sweeper]] who had been [[Penal transportation|transported]] to Australia in 1818 at the age of 17.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> Louisa married John Briggs in Tasmania in 1844, and later moved to [[Elmhurst, Victoria|Mount Cole]]<ref name=\"genealogy\"/> where John worked on the [[Goldfields region of Victoria]] as a shepherd whilst Louisa worked as a [[midwife]].<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/>\n\nBefore Ellen was born, Alick Campbell had found it increasingly hard to get adequate work, so returned to Ganawarra station. In the meantime, the Campbell family had been forced out of Coranderrk to the [[Maloga Mission]], which was across the [[Murray River]]. After Alick became sick, he requested food and provisions for his 15 children, which was denied because the [[Board for the Protection of Aborigines]] accused him of spending his money on alcohol, though they eventually sent him blankets.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> The family were to later settle in the Cummeragunja Reserve in New South Wales on condition Alick would declare they would never again seek the aid of the Board or return to Victoria.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> This was not their preferred home as Louisa was living in Corranderk, however even when a Member of the Legislative Assembly of NSW supported the Campbell's petitions to return to Corranderk, he was told that it was forbidden as it was against the law.<ref name=\"barwick-p179\"/> At Cummerangunja the Campbell children received a basic education by preacher, teacher and doctor [[Thomas Shadrach James]].<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\n==Married life and conversion to Christianity==\nEllen married Edwin \"Eddy\" Atkinson on 3 May 1911 in Christ Church, Echuca.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Edwin Atkinson's father, also named Eddy, was born in Cummeragunja and made a great impression on Ellen, who described him as a \"skilled shearer, clever carpenter and a 'leader of his people{{' \"}}.<ref name=\"barwick-p180\"/> Eddy was living in Cummeragunja at the time and Ellen was working at Strathmerton pastoral station, and before her marriage was in danger of being taken away from her family by authorities.<ref name=\"barwick-p181\"/> Life on Cummeragunja was difficult as, though farming there was well run and highly productive, in 1907 the authorities revoked the blocks under the pretence that they were mismanaged.<ref name=\"goodall-p126\"/> When the non-sectarian Christian Aborigines' Inland Mission (AIM) visited Cummeragunja, both Eddy and Ellen converted to Christianity and became deacons and organists in an independent church that sprung up there.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Eddy took over from his uncle, [[Doug Nicholls]], when he retired in 1922 and was to be an unpaid preacher and pastor to a congregation amongst a dwindling populace as the authorities started to increasingly disperse residents of the reserve under the increased powers of the ''[[Aborigines Protection Act 1909|Aborigines Protection Act]]''.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe couple had four children, born between 1919 and 1927.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> During this time the couple managed on an increasingly subsistence living as farming at Cummeragunja had been ceased, and, forced to make ends meet, would travel to Victoria in season to work as fruit-pickers.<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/> Atkinson told Aboriginal researcher [[Diane Barwick]] that family was important and would support each other, saying that \"We've had nothing this week&mdash;and we've had nothing before. But we've never begged; we've battled along. Our families always help each other.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p182\"/>\n\nThe Atkinsons were active in the [[Barham, New South Wales|Barham]] mission. Eddy was first mentioned in AIM's monthly newsletter in July 1921 as addressing services there,<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\"/> and in May 1925 was made a \"native helper\" before being appointed a \"Native Missionary\" in 1928.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/><ref name=\"austdictbio\"/> Ellen would be the organist whilst Eddy led the congregation.<ref name=\"barwick-p185\"/> By 1929, AIM had reported that the Atkinsons had a \"flock of over 200 people\".<ref name=\"AIM-1929-p10\"/> After 1930 Eddy became very sick and W. B. Payne took over from him. The Atkinsons were increasingly involved in preaching and pastoral care, and Eddy spoke at a number of AIM conventions from 1930 to 1935, including the Barham, Goolagong,<ref name=\"barwick-pp185-186\"/> and Moonah Cullah station conventions,<ref name=\"AIM-March-1932\"/> though were unable to get to a later Moonah Cullah convention as Eddy was injured when his horse had an accident.<ref name=\"AIM-December-1932\"/> The Atkinsons' ministry with AIM came to a halt in 1935, however, after Payne spoke out about the \"indifferences of churches to Australian aborigines\".<ref name=\"mercury-1935-p7\"/> Payne was then removed and the Atkinsons ceased working for AIM. Payne and the Atkinsons moved to the [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]], bringing over a number of their congregation, which caused some consternation for AIM, who wrote that \"[on reaching Cummeragunja with the Memorial Van] Mr Long was confronted with a serious situation, through one, who was our representative, dividing the Native Church and taking with him a portion of it.\"<ref name=\"djenidi-2008-p218\"/> The Atkinsons and Paynes remained good friends and the Atkinsons' daughter Daisy was taken in by the Paynes so that she could get an education, which she could not get at Cummeragunja.<ref name=\"barwick-p186\"/>\n\n==Cummerangunja walk-off and aftermath==\nIn 1934 a new manager, J. G. Danvers, was appointed to Cummerangunja. Danvers had previously been the manager of Brewarrina Aboriginal Mission Station and had previously worked with [[Indigenous people of New Guinea|Papuan people]] in Papua New Guinea.<ref name=\"western-age-1934-p4\"/> Danvers ignored the policies of the time and provided much needed rations to the Aboriginal community,<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> however he was promoted to the Menindle Aboriginal reserve where he again stood up for the Aboriginal population there, but was later sacked after allegedly \"giving information to the Press\".<ref name=\"inverall-times-1938-p1\"/><ref name=\"armidale-express-1938-p1\"/> After Danvers left, life for the Aborigines living in Cummerangunja steadily worsened and, despite lobbying by Eddy Atkinson's uncle, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], conditions did not change. The [[Australian Aborigines' League]] was eventually established by Cooper in Sydney, and later a division was formed in Melbourne by [[William Ferguson (Australian Aboriginal leader)|William Ferguson]], who was a father-in-law to one of the Atkinsons' nieces.<ref name=\"barwick-p187\"/> (Ferguson was to later write a letter of protest to ''[[Daily Liberal|The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate]]'' protesting the dismissal of Danvers from the Menindle reserve.<ref name=\"ferguson-letter-dubbo-liberal-p4\"/>) Despite a Select Committee conducting an inquiry into the reserves in 1937, nothing changed. Matters reached a head when [[Jack Patten]], who had become president of the Sydney league, warned the Aboriginal community at Cummerangunja that the Board planned to turn it into a closed compound, control their earnings and take away children. Patten formed these conclusions after he had read extracts of the Committee's report. As a result, 170 people who were part of the Atkinsons' community crossed the Murray to camp at Burmah in what was known as the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]] and Patten was charged with \"inciting Aborigines to leave their reserve\".<ref name=\"argus-1939-p2\"/><ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1939-p2\"/>\n\nFourteen days later, the Atkinsons moved with their community to Burmah. They had been entrusted with money for food for those who left, and the new manager of Cummerangunja, a Mr A. J. McQuigan, had threatened Eddy and ordered him to \"remain neutral and not to help the people who had left\".<ref name=\"barwick-p188\"/> The Atkinsons eventually moved to [[Mooroopna]] in 1941, following many in their community who moved there as work was more readily available because it was a fruit growing centre.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> They later moved to Melbourne, yet again following and ministering to their community&mdash;many of who had found paid work in factories.<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> Some time after they moved back to Cummerangunja and continued to support Ferguson and James, who continued making deputations to the Minister for the Interior.<ref name=\"barwick-p191\"/> In the meantime the division between AIM and the Church of Christ had been healed in 1943 when they both conducted joint services praying for the men serving in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"barwick-p189\"/> The Atkinsons later moved their ministry to Mooroopna. After many lost their homes from severe flooding in March 1950, the government built a three-roomed weatherboard hut and, as parishioners guaranteed the Atkinsons' rent, they moved into this as their rental home in April of 1951.<ref name=\"barwick-p191-192\"/>\n\n==Later life and death==\nOn 2 November, 1952 Eddy Atkinson died. Atkinson told Diane Barwick that \"Eddy worked so hard for the people [and] the doctor told me his heart just gave out.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/> After her husband's death, Atkinson urged the Church of Christ leadership to accept her son, Geoff, as pastor but was largely ignored and Doug Nicholls was made the pastor. Eventually there was a split in the church as  James started his own independent church. According to Barwick, \"this division of her family and community grieved Ellen. She was grateful for the genuine kindness of some clergymen and wanted Eddy's church to survive as his memorial. But she also resented the paternalism and regretted that Geoff was not helped to carry on his father's work.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nThe Aboriginal community had many people living on a patch of land in Mooroopna that was high enough to escape flooding&mdash;this patch of land was known as Daish's paddock. By 1946 James had secured promises to transfer ownership of the 150 acres of land to his community to build houses,<ref name=\"shepparton-advertiser-1946-p5\"/> instead it was converted into a rubbish tip.<ref name=\"atkinson-the-age-2006\"/> By 1956 there were proposals to integrate those living in Mooroopna into Housing Commission homes, but this resulted in sustained and vitriolic opposition from non-Aboriginal residents of nearby townships. Later, however, McCallum notes that a press clipping (of unknown origin) at the time recorded that \"Speakers at public meetings 'slated the \"filthy\", \"unhygenic\", \"disgraceful\" and \"Communist breeding\" conditions of Daish's paddock and in some cases condemned the local municipal bodies for their tolerance of a vice ridden and degrading environment{{' \"}}, resulting in plans for a proposed subdivision of twenty-two rowed blocks<ref name=\"mccallum-2017-p231-232\"/> (building and land on what was Daish's paddock is now managed by the Rumbalara Aboriginal Co-operative). Later, after the police committed twenty-four children as state wards, Atkinson lamented that \"It would have been better to help their parents keep them. Those mothers were doing their best. You can't keep children clean on a rubbish tip, when you have to carry every drop of water half a mile.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p192\"/>\n\nPopulation growth from the housing development allowed the Church of Christ to donate enough money to allow the building of an Aboriginal church, by voluntary labour, that adjoined the Atkinsons' house. When it was opened, Barwick reported that Atkinson \"had wept when they handed her the keys: 'It was the church they promised Eddy.{{' \"}} The opening was attended by over 300 people and was officiated by Doug Nicholls.<ref name=\"barwick-pp176-177\"/>\n\nIn 1960 the late [[anthropologist]], historian and Aboriginal-rights activist [[Diane Barwick]] met and spent four months interviewing Atkinson. In her article \"Aunty Ellen: The Pastor's Wife\" she wrote that \"I did not plan, all those years ago, to write her life story. I do so now as a tribute to a woman who deeply influenced my life.\"<ref name=\"barwick-p174\"/> Barwick recounted that her time with Atkinson was at first reserved, but changed in time. She wrote that,\n\n{{quote|At first our conversations were limited to the topics appropriate between strangers. I was shy and afraid of being impertinent; she was kind yet implacable in her skilful management of interviews. She had played an important role in interpreting ''koories''{{'}} (Aborigines') needs to ''gubba'' (European) sympathisers during forty years of church work. Initially she saw me as yet another inquiring ''gubba'' to be instructed and gently manipulated as a potential resource for her community. But our relationship changed, just because I was a young girl without relatives and needed help. Her people have, I think, a special kindness for waifs and strays bereft of family, perhaps because their own identity is based upon kinship ties.<ref name=\"barwick-p176\"/>}}\n\nAtkinson remained a prominent community leader until her death on 30 August 1965 at Mooroopna. She was buried in Mooroopna local cemetery.<ref name=\"austdictbio\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"austdictbio\">{{ref|white-1993|\u03b1}} White 1993</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p179\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 179</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"genealogy\">{{ref|mollison-1978|\u03b3}} Mollison 1978</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p180\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 180</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p181\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 181</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"barwick-p182\">{{ref|barwick-1995|\u03b2}} Barwick 1995, p. 182</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"goodall-p126\">{{ref|goodall-1996|\u03b4}} Goodall 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"AIM-1921-p4\">{{cite news|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/sites/default/files/docs/digitised_collections/our_aim/v14s11_a_0.pdf|department=The Harvest Field|title=Barham|last=Crebbin|first=M.

After the performance, Chanel rushes home to tell her mother about the show, but her mother is preoccupied preparing for a date with her new [[Paris|Parisian]] boyfriend to pay attention. Galleria comes home to her parents, who chastise her for not taking phone messages for her mother or walking their [[Bichon Frise]] dog, Toto. Meanwhile, Dorinda attends to her job, doing [[janitor|janitorial]] work at a community center.\n\nThe girls hope to become the first [[freshmen]] to win the [[talent show]] in their school's history. After a successful audition for the talent show, a famous [[alumnus]] of the school, Jackal Johnson, expresses interest in signing The Cheetah Girls to his [[record label]]. Galleria introduces herself as the founder and [[songwriter]] of The Cheetah Girls, which is not appreciated by the group's other members. While Galleria's mother, Dorothea, is initially hesitant to let The Cheetah Girls pursue the opportunity with Jackal, she eventually allows the girls to have a meeting after being encouraged by Galleria's father.\n\nThe meeting is a success, and despite some ongoing concerns from Galleria, the girls begin to prepare to record their first song. Without asking the group's other members for opinions, Galleria suggests that The Cheetah Girls should not make time for the talent show due to their record deal, and criticizes Dorinda for repeatedly wearing the same dull clothing. Aqua encourages Chanel, Galleria's oldest friend, to speak to Galleria about her behavior. Meanwhile, Dorinda has the opportunity to take a dance audition at the center where she is employed. She is offered a paying role because of her work, but taking on the role would require her to leave the Cheetah Girls.\n\nLater, Chanel becomes distressed after overhearing a [[voicemail]] suggesting that her mother was planning to sell their [[New York City]] apartment to move to Paris with her boyfriend. Feeling neglected, Chanel takes advantage of having her mother's credit card to go on a shopping spree on [[Madison Avenue]]. In an act of kindness, Chanel purchases a cheetah jacket for Dorinda who reveals her financial troubles: She is a poor [[foster child]] who lives in a 10-child household with a mother whose husband is a superintendent for the building. Chanel assures Dorinda that they will remain friends and she will always be a Cheetah Girl.\n\nAt the next meeting between The Cheetah Girls and Jackal Johnson, Jackal reveals that a marketing team has developed a new image for the group that will require them to wear masks and [[lip sync]]. Galleria is devastated by this and declares that the group refuse the offer, but the other girls stay behind due to their frustrations with Galleria's attitude. Galleria leaves under the impression that the other Cheetah Girls have taken the deal. Chanel arrives home where her mother reveals her credit card was declined due to Chanel's shopping spree. Chanel breaks down after thinking about how grateful she is for her mother given Dorinda's current status as a foster child, and Chanel's mother agrees to make more time for her daughter.\n\nLater, Galleria's dog Toto falls into an obstruction on the Manhattan streets. This attracts a great deal of attention, including a live news story, which alerts all four Cheetah Girls members about what is going on and causes them to come to Toto's rescue. Their singing helps calm Toto down and allow for his safe removal from the obstruction. This act of bonding ultimately causes the girls to repair their friendship, and they go on to sing a new song on the news for all of New York to see. Jackal Johnson arrives, voicing his regret trying to change The Cheetah Girl, but the girls refuse an offer with him. The Cheetah Girls end up winning the talent show, and the girls renew their commitment to achieving their dreams and maintaining their friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] \u2013 [[Galleria Garibaldi]], also known as Bubbles\n* [[Adrienne Bailon]] \u2013 [[Chanel Simmons]], also known as Chuchie\n* [[Kiely Williams]] \u2013 [[Aquanetta Walker]], also known as Aqua\n* [[Sabrina Bryan]] \u2013 [[Dorinda Rogers|Dorinda Thomas]], also known as Do\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] \u2013 Dorothea Garibaldi, Galleria's mother\n* [[Juan Chioran]] \u2013 Francobollo Garibaldi, Galleria's father\n* Lori Anne Alter \u2013 Juanita Simmons, Chanel's mother\n* [[Vince Corazza]] \u2013 Jackal Johnson, a record producer and the film's antagonist\n* [[Kyle Schmid]] \u2013 Derek, Galleria's love interest\n* Kyle Saunders \u2013 Pucci Simmons (Chanel's little brother)\n* [[Ennis Esmer]] \u2013 Rick (Comedian)\n* Johnie Chase \u2013 Doorman\n* [[Kim Roberts (actress)|Kim Roberts]] \u2013 Mrs. Bosco (Dorinda's foster mom)\n* Sandra Caldwell \u2013 Drinka Champane\n\n==Production==\nThe film was directed by [[Oz Scott]] and produced by [[Whitney Houston]], [[Debra Martin Chase]] and Co Producer Cheryl Hill.

Feeling neglected, Chanel takes advantage of having her mother's credit card to go on a shopping spree on [[Madison Avenue]]. In an act of kindness, Chanel purchases a cheetah jacket for Dorinda who reveals her financial troubles: She is a poor [[foster child]] who lives in a 10-child household with a mother whose husband is a superintendent for the building. Chanel assures Dorinda that they will remain friends and she will always be a Cheetah Girl.\n\nAt the next meeting between The Cheetah Girls and Jackal Johnson, Jackal reveals that a marketing team has developed a new image for the group that will require them to wear masks and [[lip sync]]. Galleria is devastated by this and declares that the group refuse the offer, but the other girls stay behind due to their frustrations with Galleria's attitude. Galleria leaves under the impression that the other Cheetah Girls have taken the deal. Chanel arrives home where her mother reveals her credit card was declined due to Chanel's shopping spree. Chanel breaks down after thinking about how grateful she is for her mother given Dorinda's current status as a foster child, and Chanel's mother agrees to make more time for her daughter.\n\nLater, Galleria's dog Toto falls into an obstruction on the Manhattan streets. This attracts a great deal of attention, including a live news story, which alerts all four Cheetah Girls members about what is going on and causes them to come to Toto's rescue. Their singing helps calm Toto down and allow for his safe removal from the obstruction. This act of bonding ultimately causes the girls to repair their friendship, and they go on to sing a new song on the news for all of New York to see. Jackal Johnson arrives, voicing his regret trying to change The Cheetah Girl, but the girls refuse an offer with him. The Cheetah Girls end up winning the talent show, and the girls renew their commitment to achieving their dreams and maintaining their friendship.\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] \u2013 [[Galleria Garibaldi]], also known as Bubbles\n* [[Adrienne Bailon]] \u2013 [[Chanel Simmons]], also known as Chuchie\n* [[Kiely Williams]] \u2013 [[Aquanetta Walker]], also known as Aqua\n* [[Sabrina Bryan]] \u2013 [[Dorinda Rogers|Dorinda Thomas]], also known as Do\n* [[Lynn Whitfield]] \u2013 Dorothea Garibaldi, Galleria's mother\n* [[Juan Chioran]] \u2013 Francobollo Garibaldi, Galleria's father\n* Lori Anne Alter \u2013 Juanita Simmons, Chanel's mother\n* [[Vince Corazza]] \u2013 Jackal Johnson, a record producer and the film's antagonist\n* [[Kyle Schmid]] \u2013 Derek, Galleria's love interest\n* Kyle Saunders \u2013 Pucci Simmons (Chanel's little brother)\n* [[Ennis Esmer]] \u2013 Rick (Comedian)\n* Johnie Chase \u2013 Doorman\n* [[Kim Roberts (actress)|Kim Roberts]] \u2013 Mrs. Bosco (Dorinda's foster mom)\n* Sandra Caldwell \u2013 Drinka Champane\n\n==Production==\nThe film was directed by [[Oz Scott]] and produced by [[Whitney Houston]], [[Debra Martin Chase]] and Co Producer Cheryl Hill.

{"title_page": "Characters of Halo", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Characters of ''Halo''}}\n'''Major recurring characters of the ''[[Halo (series)|Halo]]'' multimedia franchise''' are organized below by their respective affiliations within the series' fictional universe. The [[Halo (franchise)#Original trilogy|original trilogy's]] central story revolved around conflict between humanity under the auspices of the [[Factions of Halo|United Nations Space Command]] or UNSC, and an alien alliance known as the [[Factions of Halo#Covenant|Covenant]]. The artifacts left behind by an ancient race known as the [[Factions of Halo#Forerunner|Forerunner]] play a central role\u2014particularly the [[ringworld]]s known as [[Halo (megastructure)|Halos]], built to contain the threat of the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].\n\nBungie founder [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] noted that bringing together the elements of a video game is unmistakably \"art\", but character designers and artists had to make a \"living, breathing world\" and populate it with interesting characters and places. The first ''Halo'' game's development brought numerous evolutions and revisions to the character's designs and personalities. Characters were also updated to take full advantage of new graphics technologies; for instance, the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]]'s armor was redesigned in a lengthy conceptual process and the final model was [[bump mapping|bump mapped]]. Subsequent games offered opportunities to refine the character's appearances and design.\n\n''Halo''{{'}}s commercial and critical success has led to large amounts of merchandise featuring the franchise's characters to be produced. The Master Chief, the most visible symbol of the series, has been heavily marketed, with the character's visage appearing on soda bottles, T-shirts, and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] controllers. Other merchandise produced includes several sets of [[action figure]]s. ''Halo''{{'}}s characters have received varying reception, with characters such as the Chief, [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], and the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] being well received by critics.\n\n== Character design and creation ==\nThe ''Halo'' franchise originated with the 2001 video game ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The game's characters were continually refined through development, as developer [[Bungie]] was bought by [[Microsoft]] and the platform shifted from the [[Macintosh]] to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Other Bungie developers would often add input to character development, even if they were not working on the game itself.<ref>Trautmann, 19.</ref> An outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character.<ref>Trautmann, 20.</ref> Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.<ref>Trautmann, 38.</ref>\n\nOriginally, the game designers decided to hand-key character animations.<ref>Trautmann, 14.</ref> The animators videotaped themselves to have reference footage for the movement of game characters; art director Marcus Lehto's wife recorded him \"running around a field with a two-by-four\" for the human marines. By ''Halo 3'', Bungie staff had a special room designed for capturing reference material.<ref name=Brutes/> Many of the subsequent human character's features were based on Bungie designers,<ref name=aoh27>Trautmann, 27.</ref> while character animators looked to simian, ursine, insectoid, and reptilian features for the various races of the Covenant.<ref>Trautmann, 53.</ref> The artificial intelligences of the characters was also deliberately limited to make sure they acted realistically to environmental changes and situations.<ref name=\"AI\">{{cite web| url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/halo2-ai.htm| title=In the Mind of the Enemy: The Artificial Intelligence of Halo 2 | author=Robert Valdes| publisher=How Stuff Works| date=November 17, 2004| accessdate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> Later games use [[motion capture]] to capture the movement and facial acting of the cast.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Voice acting ===\n[[File:Steve Downes and Jen Taylor at HaloFest 2011 (6097609270).jpg|thumb|right|[[Steve Downes]] and [[Jen Taylor]], the voices of Master Chief and Cortana, at HaloFest during [[PAX (event)|PAX]] Prime 2011]]\nThe ''Halo'' series features voice work by television and film actors including [[Ron Perlman]], [[Orlando Jones]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Robert Davi]], and [[Terence Stamp]].<ref name=\"scifi-faces\">{{cite web|author=Staff |date=November 22, 2007 |url=http://dvice.com/archives/2007/11/the_faces_of_halo.php |title=The Faces of 'Halo' |publisher=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |accessdate=September 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226093408/http://dvice.com/archives/2007/11/the_faces_of_halo.php |archivedate=February 26, 2008 }}</ref> Voice acting became more important as ''Halo: Combat Evolved''{{'}}s sequels were developed; ''Halo 2'' had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while ''Halo 3'' has in excess of 14,000 lines.<ref name=\"bungie-h2dvdvoice\">{{cite video|people=[[Martin O'Donnell|O'Donnell, Martin]]; [[Joseph Staten|Staten, Joseph]]|date=November 7, 2004|title=Voices of Halo 2 / Music: Halo 2 Limited Edition|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Bungie]]|location=Kirkland, Washington}}</ref> Some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, while others traveled to a studio to record their lines.<ref name=\"gameinformer-downes/dadabo\">{{cite web|date=February 27, 2007 |title=Voicing Halo: The Steve Downes And Tim Dadabo Interview |url= http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200702/N07.0227.1815.49562.htm|work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=September 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310030952/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200702/N07.0227.1815.49562.htm |archivedate = March 10, 2007|url-status=dead|author1 = Berghammer|first1 = Billy|author2 = [[Tim Dadabo]] |author3=[[Steve Downes]]}}</ref> In interviews, ''Halo''{{'}}s voice actors stated that they had no idea that the games would become such a critical and commercial success.

Johnson is featured in ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel]]'' story, \"Breaking Quarantine,\" which details Johnson's escape from the Flood in ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', and a main character in the 2007 novel ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]''. Johnson later appears as a main character in ''Halo: Silent Storm'' where it's revealed that he's a Spartan-I, a precursor to the Spartan-II program that the Master Chief is a part of. Taking place about a year after ''Contact Harvest'', Johnson is recruited to be a part of a strike force launching a counterattack behind enemy lines to buy humanity some time. Johnson is recruited both for his experience with the Covenant and his Spartan training and acts as a mentor and friend to the young Master Chief, becoming one of the few people the Spartans trust implicitly on the mission where insurrectionists are trying to destroy them and they can't be sure of whom to trust.\n\nIn many ways similar to the stereotype of charismatic black Marines found in other science fiction (such as [[List of Alien characters|Sergeant Apone]] in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' whom Johnson was partially based on),<ref name=gametap>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametap.com/home/read/article/8a25090115d6b7e40115d9725623148e |title=The Halo Harvest Interview, Part 1 |publisher=[[Gametap]] |author=Perry, Douglass |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=October 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102071253/http://www.gametap.com/home/read/article/8a25090115d6b7e40115d9725623148e |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}</ref> some publications found Johnson, though enjoyable, somewhat of a [[flat character]].

As the planet is [[glass transition|glassed]] by the Covenant, Keyes follows Cole Protocol, which leads his new ship, the ''Pillar of Autumn'' to [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]. There, Keyes leads a [[guerrilla]] insurgency against the Covenant, until he is captured and assimilated by the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. After being found by the Master Chief in his assimilated state, the Master Chief sadly ends Keyes' suffering by punching into his skull to retrieve Keyes' neural implants in order to destroy the ''Pillar of Autumn''. His daughter is Miranda Keyes.\n\n=== Miranda Keyes ===\nCommander Miranda Keyes is the daughter of [[#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]] and [[#Catherine Halsey|Catherine Halsey]], whom she lived with in her younger years. Halsey and Miranda had a falling out in which she changed her last name (then Halsey) to her father's name (Keyes). Miranda appears in ''Halo 2'', ''Halo 3'' and in the final chapter of ''Halo: The Cole Protocol''. At the beginning of ''Halo 2'', Keyes is present at an awards ceremony on board the Cairo defense platform above [[Earth]] to accept a medal posthumously for her father. Soon after, a Covenant fleet launches an attack on Earth, and Keyes takes control of the UNSC ship ''In Amber Clad'' and assists in the defense of New Mombasa, Kenya. When the [[High Prophet of Regret|Prophet of Regret]] retreats from Earth, Keyes orders ''In Amber Clad'' to follow; this results in the discovery of [[Installation 05]], another Halo. Keyes, along with Johnson and a squad of Marines, head for Halo's library in order to retrieve the Activation Index and prevent the ring's activation while the Master Chief assassinates the Prophet of Regret; in the process, she and Johnson are captured by the Brute Chieftain [[#Tartarus|Tartarus]]. As a \"Reclaimer,\" only she or another human can insert the Index into Halo's control panel, and Tartarus attempts to make her do this. When the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] tries to stop the firing, Tartarus forces Keyes to insert the Index, initiating Halo's firing sequence. After the Arbiter engages and kills Tartarus, Keyes successfully removes the Index and prevents Halo from activating, but inadvertently causes all the remaining Halo installations to enter standby mode, enabling the remote firing of these installations from [[The Ark (Halo)|The Ark]].<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Fail-safe protocol: in the event of unexpected shut-down, the entire system will move to standby status.

''[[#first strike|Halo: First Strike]]'', pg 107.</ref> Due to the competition between Ackerson and other departments, most notably Section Three and the [[#Spartans|SPARTAN-II project]], Ackerson harbors a strong resentment toward his opponents and toward the Spartans in particular. He does eventually convince the top members of ONI to approve his [[#Spartans|SPARTAN-III]] Program in 2531 as seen in ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]''. As part of this, he kidnapped Spartan-II Kurt-051, renamed Kurt Ambrose, to lead the program. In ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', he attempts to sabotage the MJOLNIR Mark V testing process by using ordnance far above the established guidelines, including Lotus anti-tank mines, a full squad of [[Halo 3: ODST|ODST]]s ordered to shoot to kill, automated gun turrets, and an airstrike. However, Cortana retaliates by forging a letter requesting a reassignment to the front lines as well as planting evidence of illicit activities in his bank records.

Instead, Ruwan used the deception to help the UNSC strike a blow against the Covenant. In the aftermath, Ackerson taunted his captors about the deception and was decapitated in retaliation.\n\n=== Franklin Mendez ===\nSenior Chief Petty Officer Franklin Mendez is the [[#Spartans|SPARTAN-II]]'s trainer on Reach during the early events of ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]''. He provides his trainees with excellent weapons and physical lessons, as well as tactical and mental training. He is not very talkative, but possesses a brilliant mind for warfare, and this is reflected in the Master Chief's abilities. He is described as neither tall nor muscular, with close-cut hair that has a dash of gray at the temples.<ref>Nylund, Eric.

In ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Hood receives an urgent message by Dr. Halsey requesting for him to send Spartans to assist her, and obliges by ordering Fred-104, Will-043, and Linda-058 to Onyx. In ''Halo 3'', Hood is in overall command of Earth's defense following the death of Fleet Admiral Harper and shares command with Commander Miranda Keyes, who reports directly to him. He accepts the need for humanity to ally with the Elites, but is not entirely happy about it. He leads the remaining human naval forces in an attack on the Prophet of Truth's dreadnought,<ref>'''Hood''': I'll initiate a low-level strike. Hit 'em right where it hurts. I only have a handful of ships, Master Chief. It's a big risk.

When the Master Chief, Keyes, and several Elite and human forces choose to follow the Prophet of Truth through the portal, he decides to stay behind to make a final stand on Earth.<ref>{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 3]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2007| platform =[[Xbox 360]]| version = | level = Floodgate}}</ref> At the end of the game, he commemorates a small monument to the war and the sacrifices it involved. Though unable to forgive the Arbiter for his actions during the war, Hood thanks him for standing by the Master Chief \"to the end\" and expresses sorrow at the Spartan's apparent death. Hood also appears in the spin-off media, including several of the books and comics which delve further into his backstory. Its revealed that Hood was captain of a ship during the Battle for Arcadia in ''Halo Wars'' and was ordered to collect the ''Spirit of Fire's'' log buoy, but instead attacked a Covenant destroyer, resulting in its loss. Hood subsequently blamed himself for the loss of the ''Spirit of Fire''. In ''Halo: Renegades'', John Forge's daughter finds the wreck of Hood's old ship and captain's logs by Hood's successor pointing to the destroyer having subsequently recovered the buoy, leading to her own search for the ''Spirit of Fire''. In the short story \"Rosbach's World\" taking place after ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', Hood is revealed to have escaped Cortana's attack on Earth along with Admiral Serin Osman of ONI thanks to preparations set up in secret by Osman's still-loyal AI Black Box. The two are also able to escape with many of ONI's AIs in their possession, leaving Osman with the dilemma of whether or not to destroy them or risk the AIs defecting to Cortana. However, Hood blames himself for the situation due to allowing the Master Chief free rein and falls into a depression.\n\n=== Wallace Jenkins ===\nPrivate First Class Wallace A. Jenkins is one of the UNSC forces that survives the initial Covenant attack in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' reveals that the Marine was a member of the colony Harvest's defense militia, where his family is killed. In ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', Jenkins assists in defending the human stronghold under the command of Major Antonio Silva. He is also part of an assault team led by [[#Avery Johnson|Sergeant Avery Johnson]] and [[#Jacob Keyes|Captain Jacob Keyes]], sent to recover a Covenant arms cache during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The team is overwhelmed by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], leaving the entire squad except Sergeant Johnson infected and resulting in the eventual death of Captain Keyes. In the video game, the Master Chief recovers Jenkins' helmet, and reviews the recording of the mission that it contained, introducing the Flood to the player through the Marine's eyes. In ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the fate of the Marine is left unknown.\n\n''[[Halo: The Flood]]'' reveals the fate of Jenkins; the Private is transformed into a Flood Combat Form along with the rest of his squad, but he is able to exercise a certain degree of control over the infection, due to the mind of the parasite being weakened by its long hibernation.<ref>[[#the flood|Dietz]], 155.</ref> He uses this limited control in an attempt to end his own life, charging at UNSC Marines in the hope that they would shoot him.<ref>Dietz, William. ''[[#the flood|Halo: The Flood]]'', pg 221.</ref> Instead, he is captured as a live specimen for study. He is brought aboard the Covenant cruiser ''Truth and Reconciliation'' as part of a mission under Orbital Drop Shock Trooper Major Silva to capture a Covenant vessel and return it to [[Earth]] intact. Jenkins successfully convinces Lieutenant Melissa McKay, that such a mission would spread the Flood to Earth, and Jenkins dies with the other human troops on the vessel as it crashed into Halo.<ref>[[#the flood|Dietz]], 291.</ref>\n\n===Serin Osman===\nAdmiral Serin Osman is the head of ONI by 2558 and also a former Spartan-II during which time she was known as Serin-019. Unlike most of the Spartans, Osman's augmentations didn't take, though she wasn't left physically debilitated like most of the other \"wash-outs.\" Admiral Margret Parangorsky, the head of ONI at the time, saw promise in Osman and reversed her augmentations and gave her a career in ONI instead. Unable to remember her real last name, she was given the last name of Osman by Parangorsky and groomed to be her successor.\n\nIn the Kilo-Five Trilogy, Osman, a Captain at the time, leads the black ops team Kilo-Five who are sent on covert operations in the post-war period. ONI uses the team to cause chaos between the various Covenant factions in an attempt to keep any one from gaining too much power and filling the power vacuum left by the fall of the Covenant Empire. After the Onyx shield world is discovered, Osman and her team arrest Dr. Catherine Halsey for war crimes and imprison the captured [[#Jul 'Mdama|Jul 'Mdama]] on Onyx before he manages to escape. The team also comes up against the father of one of their members who is seeking revenge for the presumed death of his daughter. They subsequently decide to cover up his survival, knowing that he is no longer a threat.\n\nBy the time of ''Halo: Last Light'', Osman has been promoted to Rear Admiral, though she is not yet in charge of ONI. Osman coordinates with the UNSC forces on Gao and orders Blue Team to drop a nuclear weapon on the underground Forerunner base to keep it out of enemy hands. Osman personally joins the extraction team and gives Veta Lopis the chance to destroy the Forerunner AI Intrepid Eye as a test. Afterwards, Osman removes the Spartan-III's from Blue Team due to the dangers of their augmentations becoming public knowledge, but instead turns them into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis. During the ''Halo: Fractures'' short story ''A Necessary Truth'', the Ferrets are targeted by Dark Moon Enterprises operatives hoping to expose their augmentations and thus destroy ONI. The Ferrets are able to stop the plot and turn over the evidence they gather to Osman. Though the Ferrets lie to Osman about some of the details of the mission, she decides to accept it despite being somewhat dubious.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Osman oversees the mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family. After the mission exposes a dangerous bioweapon plot, apparently done by ONI, Osman gives orders to shut down the project. However, Intrepid Eye, the true culprit, manipulates Osman's final report to give the project an unlimited black budget and continues it in secret on ''Argent Moon''.\n\nIn ''Spartan Ops'', Captain [[#Thomas Lasky|Thomas Lasky]] contacts Osman after Dr. Catherine Halsey is abducted by [[#Jul 'Mdama|Jul 'Mdama]]. Osman laments not following Parangorsky's suggestion of killing Halsey or burying her as deep as she could and orders Lasky to assassinate Halsey.\n\nIn the short story ''Rossbach's World'', Osman is revealed to have escaped the subjugation of Earth by [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]] along with Lord Hood thanks to her personal AI Black Box who remained loyal and set up an escape plan for her if needed. Osman and Hood escape with many of ONI's AIs and Osman is left contemplating whether or not to destroy them.\n\n=== Thomas Lasky ===\nCaptain Thomas Lasky is the current captain of the UNSC ''Infinity'' and is currently voiced by Darren O'Hare. He made his debut in his origin web series ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'' portrayed by [[Tom Green (Australian actor)|Tom Green]] as a young military cadet saved by the Master Chief and [[Ty Olsson]] as an adult. In ''[[Halo 4]]'', Lasky serves as ''Infinity's'' first officer at the rank of Commander and aids the Master Chief on Requiem. When ''Infinity's'' captain Andrew Del Rio refuses to listen to the Master Chief and Cortana, the Spartan decides to go rogue rather than abandon the fight with the ''Infinity''. Lasky, ordered to stop the Master Chief, instead secretly supports him by providing the Spartan with a combat-outfitted Pelican for his use. When the Master Chief returns to Earth, he discovers that Del Rio has been relieved of command for abandoning the Master Chief and Lasky promoted to Captain as his replacement. Now commanding ''Infinity'', Lasky aids the Master Chief in boarding the Didact's ship. After the Master Chief is rescued from the wreckage, Lasky attempts to comfort the grieving Spartan and reminds him that soldiers aren't machines, they are just people. Six months later, Lasky returns in ''Spartan Ops'', leading the ''Infinity'' back to Requiem. After helping defend his ship from a Promethean and Covenant attack, Lasky clashes with Commander Sarah Palmer over orders to assassinate Dr. Catherine Halsey. With Palmer refusing to stand down, Lasky orders Fireteam Majestic to rescue Halsey in an attempt to save her life.\n\nAs Captain of the ''Infinity'', Lasky appears in spin-off media, particularly the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series.\n\nLasky returns in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''. After receiving a message from Halsey, Lasky sends Fireteam Osiris to Kamchatka to rescue the doctor and to kill [[#Jul 'Mdama|Jul 'Mdama]] if possible. Following the successful mission, Lasky reluctantly sends Fireteam Osiris after Blue Team on Meridian and later authorizes a covert operation to Sanghelios to seek out the Arbiter's help in chasing Blue Team using a Guardian on the planet. Due to ONI refusing to get involved in the Arbiter's civil war, Lasky is unable to bring ''Infinity'' into the fight and warns Spartan Jameson Locke that if something goes wrong, the mission will have never officially existed. When AIs begin pledging loyalty to Cortana ''en mass'', Lasky and ''Infinity'' witness the beginning of the subjugation of Earth, though ''Infinity's'' AI Roland chooses to remain loyal to humanity. Lasky orders a series of random slipspace jumps, planning to run until they can figure out a way to fight back.\n\nIn ''Halo: Bad Blood'', taking place after ''Halo 5: Guardians'', Lasky and ''Infinity'' link up with Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris the next day. Along with debriefing the team leaders, Lasky meets with Spartan Edward Buck in a more informal setting and offers the Spartan, who has been ordered on a covert mission even Lasky isn't allowed to know about, advice, particularly regarding leadership. The conversation with Lasky helps settle some of Buck's doubts and issues, many of which stem from the mission requiring Buck to work with an old friend who betrayed his trust. After the mission, Lasky and Palmer debrief Buck and he convinces them to allow Mickey Crespo to remain in the fight, at least until Cortana has been defeated, despite Mickey being in prison for treason.\n\n===Roland===\nRoland, voiced by Brian T. Delaney, is the current AI of the UNSC ''Infinity'', the flagship of the UNSC fleet. Roland's avatar takes the form of a golden World War II fighter pilot. Roland first appears in ''Spartan Ops'' where he helps plan missions and in some cases, aids the Spartan controllers in leading fireteams on Requiem, something that Roland comes to greatly enjoy. Using an override code, Dr. Catherine Halsey is briefly able to take control of Roland and force him to help her, learning from the AI that the Master Chief is in fact still alive and was even on ''Infinity'' which no one had informed Dr. Halsey of. However, before Dr. Halsey can escape to meet up with Jul 'Mdama, Roland manages to regain control of himself and expose Dr. Halsey's deception to the guards before a Promethean attack on the ship captures the doctor.\n\nRoland appears in spin-off media, including the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, ''Halo: Fractures'' and ''Halo: Tales from Slipspace''. Along with acting as ''Infinity's'' AI, Roland takes part in fellow AI Iona's \"trial\" with Black Box and takes part in Fireteam Majestic's poker night.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: Spartan Assault]]'', Roland takes on the role of a narrator for cadets undergoing battle simulations based on the Battle of Draetheus V in 2554.\n\nIn ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', Roland continues to act as the ''Infinity's'' AI. Roland is outraged when Dr. Halsey returns and makes accusations that, in Roland's own words, could effectively condemn the other AI to death. Roland angrily confronts the doctor on her hypocrisy and the fact that Cortana is being condemned simply for surviving past her normal lifespan. When Cortana subverts many of the AIs of the galaxy to her cause, Roland is one of the very few AIs that remains loyal to humanity instead of pledging his loyalty to Cortana, showing no signs of considering Cortana's offer even when she appears on ''Infinity's'' bridge. Roland is shocked when Lasky decides to run, but Lasky explains that they will run until they have a way to fight back.\n\nRoland appears in ''Halo: Bad Blood'', taking place after ''Halo 5: Guardians''. Roland is confirmed to continue to be loyal to humanity which is a good thing due to the amount of control the AI has over ''Infinity's'' systems. Roland's ability to see through Cortana's offer for the bad deal it is endears him greatly to Spartan [[#Edward Buck|Edward Buck]]. When Buck and Captain [[#Veronica Dare|Veronica Dare]] decide to get married, Roland interrupts their argument about whether or not to do it via a program or call in Captain Lasky as captain of the ship. Roland offers to marry Buck and Dare himself, stating that as the ship's AI, which in many ways effectively makes Roland ''Infinity'', he can perform a marriage as legally as if Lasky did it. Due to his fondness for the AI, Buck accepts and Roland marries the two, ending with \"feed the birds!\"\n\n=== Spartans ===\n{{redirect|SPARTAN||Spartan (disambiguation)}}\nConceived by [[#Catherine Halsey|Halsey]], the SPARTAN-II program was secretly commissioned to create an elite corps of [[supersoldiers]] who could stem rebellion in the UNSC colonies; these soldiers became the best weapon against the alien Covenant when war broke out. While John-117, also known as the Master Chief, is the hero of the trilogy, other soldiers play a significant role in the novels, ''[[Halo Legends]]'', and the prequel games ''[[Halo Wars]]'' and ''[[Halo: Reach]]''. To raise morale as the war continued to sour for humanity, the existence of the SPARTAN-II Program is disclosed to the [[general public]]. The Spartans become [[hero]]es and veritable legends; in order to maintain public confidence that the war is going well, Spartans are never listed as killed, only as [[Missing in Action]] or [[Wounded in Action]].<ref>Nylund (2003), 253.</ref> The SPARTANS were kidnapped as children, who were replaced by flash clones, which died of natural causes afterwards. The physical augmentation they undergo to turn them into super soldiers is lengthy, expensive, and strenuous, with not all of them surviving the process. Both male and female SPARTANS average {{convert|7|ft}} tall. After being recruited into the UNSC, the Spartans' last name are disposed of; their callsign is simply their first name, and a corresponding 3-digit figure (for example, Alice-130, Douglas-042, Samuel-034, etc.).\n\nThe SPARTAN-III Project was started by Colonel James Ackerson to serve as cheaper, disposable supersoldiers. Some of these Spartans were main protagonists in the game ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', including the player character SPARTAN-B312, aka \"Noble Six\". Later, the UNSC creates the SPARTAN-IV project. Unlike the SPARTAN-II and -III projects\u2014which kidnapped and conscripted children or used [[war orphan]]s, respectively\u2014the Spartan-IVs are adult volunteers drawn from all branches of the UNSC. These Spartans participate in [[Military exercise|war games]] on the starship ''Infinity'', which forms the fictional basis for ''[[Halo 4]]''{{'}}s multiplayer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/halo-4/Multiplayer|title=Multiplayer|work=IGN}}{{Better source|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe most distinctive element of the Spartans is their special MJOLNIR [[powered armor|powered assault armor]].

She appears in ''[[Halo 4]]'', ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', ''[[Halo: Spartan Assault]]'', and the ''Halo Escalation'' comic series.\n\n==== Edward Buck ====\nGunnery Sergeant Edward Malcolm Buck ([[Nathan Fillion]]) is a longtime human soldier. In ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]'' he is the leader of Alpha-Nine, a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs). He is subsequently inducted into the SPARTAN-IV program, and is a playable member of Fireteam Osiris in the video game ''Halo 5''. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Halo: Reach]]'' and is the main character of the novels ''Halo: New Blood'' and ''Halo: Bad Blood''. In the latter, Buck reunites his old squad Alpha-Nine for a classified ONI mission following the events of ''Halo 5'' and is reluctantly forced to work with his old friend Mickey Crespo who betrayed Buck's trust and was imprisoned for treason. At the end of the novel, Buck decides to return to leading Alpha-Nine full-time and is married to long-time girlfriend Veronica Dare by ''Infinity's'' AI [[#Roland|Roland]].\n\n==== Jameson Locke ====\nJameson Locke is a Spartan IV who first appeared in ''Halo 2 Anniversary''{{'}}s both opening and ending with the task of hunting down the Master Chief in ''Halo 5: Guardians''. [[Mike Colter]] portrays Locke in both Anniversary and the ''Nightfall'' origin movie, and only provided the [[motion-capture]] performance for the character in ''Guardians''. Due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' and ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', Locke's voice acting is replaced by [[Ike Amadi]]. He is the current squad leader of Fireteam Osiris, tasked with hunting down Master Chief and Blue Team.\n\n====Fred-104====\nFred-104, voiced by Andrew Lowe in ''Halo: Legends'', portrayed by Tony Giroux in ''Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn'' and Travis Willingham in the ''Halo 2: Anniversary'' Terminals and in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', is a Spartan-II and one of the Master Chief's closest friends.\n\nFred survives the fall of Reach, as shown in ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and assists Master Chief and other Spartans in destroying a Covenant armada massing to attack Earth. In ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Fred and Blue Team help defend the Earth from Covenant attack during the events of ''[[Halo 2]]'' while the Master Chief is away on the second Halo ring. Following a message from Halsey, Blue Team hijacks a Covenant destroyer to travel to the planet Onyx where Halsey and the Spartan-III's are located. There, Blue Team is reunited with both Kelly and the Spartan-III leader, Lieutenant Commander Kurt Ambrose, an old friend theirs believed to be dead for nearly twenty years. Under heavy Covenant and Sentinel attack, the group takes out a Sentinel factory on the planet and defends the entrance to the interior shield world. Ultimately, Kurt decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the Covenant ground forces with nuclear weapons. Before sending the others through the portal, Kurt promotes Fred to the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade. Afterwards, Fred and the others mourn those they lost in the battle and prepare to explore the world they are now on. They reconnect with the outside world in ''Halo: Glasslands''; though to them only a few days have passed, outside months have.\n\nFred continues to serve in the post-Covenant War Spartan branch. In ''Halo: Last Light'', Fred and Blue Team investigate a Forerunner structure on the politically-unstable planet of Gao and get caught in both the machinations of a power hungry leader and the plans of a rogue Forerunner AI, Intrepid Eye. This pits the UNSC against the Covenant splinter faction known as the Keepers of the One Freedom which Gao's Minister of Protection, Arlo Casille, uses to gain power and turn on the UNSC, having secretly brought the Keepers to the planet for just that purpose. Intrepid Eye destroys Fred's AI Wendell and nearly escapes using Fred's armor, but Veta Lopis, a Gao investigator who was investigating a series of murders committed by Intrepid Eye, disables Fred's suit with an explosive she had earlier planted and the rogue AI is captured. Fleeing the planet, Blue Team destroys the Forerunner base with a nuclear weapon, but Admiral [[#Serin Osman|Serin Osman]], herself a former Spartan-II, removes the Spartan-III's from the team due to the danger if their illegal augmentations are exposed. Instead, Osman turns the III's into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Fred is given tactical command of a mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family, apparently by the Keepers of the One Freedom. Blue Team works alongside the Ferrets who manage to infiltrate a Keeper base, but discover the Admiral's family dead. Blue Team provides backup and destroys the base with nuclear weapons, but it's discovered that the bodies were planted. The investigation leads them back to Gao and ultimately to Meridian where the group exposes and foils a dangerous bioweapon plot, unaware that the true culprit was Intrepid Eye.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, Fred and the other members of Blue Team are reunited with the Master Chief who had survived the final battle with the Covenant and made it back to Earth after over four and a half years. Despite being the ranking officer as a Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Fred returns control of the team to the Master Chief and returns to his old role as second-in-command. Together, they defeat the returned Didact and go on a series of non-stop missions.\n\nFred appears alongside the Master Chief, Kelly and Linda in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\n====Linda-058====\nLinda-058 (voiced by [[Andrea Bogart]] in the ''[[Halo 2: Anniversary]]'' terminals and Brittany Uomoleale in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'') is the sniper of the Spartan-II's and one of the Master Chief's closest friends. Linda is notable for her exceptional sniping skills and ability to make seemingly impossible shots. Ironically, she has a non-existent temper. She is also notable for being clinically dead for several weeks after being mortally wounded during the Fall of Reach. She appears in both much of the spin-off media and ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', Linda takes part in the Spartans first mission to capture a rebel leader, but is one of the Spartans to miss the Covenant ship they board to destroy it from the inside. Later, during the Fall of Reach, Linda accompanies the Master Chief and another Spartan, James, to Reach Station Gamma to destroy an unsecured navigation database. James is blown into space and presumably killed while the Master Chief and Linda succeed in completing their mission with the help of some Marines on the station, including Sergeant Avery Johnson. However, while securing their exit, Linda is hit by Covenant fire and mortally wounded. She dies in the Master Chief's arms after confirming that they had succeeded. Despite this, the Master Chief places Linda into a cryo-chamber immediately upon returning to the ''Pillar of Autumn'', believing that, while its a long shot, due to her resilience as a Spartan, Linda might be able to be revived if they can get her to a UNSC hospital. However, this plan is foiled by the loss of Reach and the need to flee the system.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', the Master Chief and Cortana recover several ejected cryo-chambers from the wreckage of Halo, the ''Pillar of Autumn'' having ejected some occupants who hadn't been awakened before the ship crashed. One of these chambers and the only one to still be functional is Linda's as the Master Chief later discovers. Due to her state, the Master Chief leaves Linda in the chamber until they can hopefully get her to a hospital. After being rescued along with several other survivors of the Fall of Reach, Dr. Catherine Halsey decides to use the medical facilities on board the salvaged UNSC frigate ''Gettysburg'' to try to save Linda's life due to the recently discovered threat to Earth from the Covenant. Cloning several replacement organs for her, Halsey successfully manages to revive Linda who she predicts will need weeks to properly recover from her injuries. Despite this, Linda is able to be up and about in a short amount of time to join her friends in planning a first strike against the Covenant, though she is still visibly suffering the effects of her near-fatal injuries. Despite Linda's weakened state, she is allowed to join the operation due to the limited number of available Spartans and her unique sniper skills. Linda's sniper abilities prove invaluable on the mission which proves to be a success, decimating the Covenant fleet that is poised to attack Earth and buying the human race some more time. However, during this time, Kelly is kidnapped by Halsey who vanishes with her off to parts unknown.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', a fully recovered Linda and Blue Team help defend the Earth from Covenant attack during the events of ''[[Halo 2]]'' while the Master Chief is away on the second Halo ring. Following a message from Halsey, Blue Team hijacks a Covenant destroyer to travel to the planet Onyx where Halsey and the Spartan-III's are located. There, Blue Team is reunited with both Kelly and the Spartan-III leader, Lieutenant Commander Kurt Ambrose, an old friend theirs believed to be dead for nearly twenty years. Under heavy Covenant and Sentinel attack, the group takes out a Sentinel factory on the planet and defends the entrance to the interior shield world. Ultimately, Kurt decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the Covenant ground forces with nuclear weapons. Afterwards, Linda and the others mourn those they lost in the battle and prepare to explore the world they are now on.\n\nIn ''Halo: Glasslands'', the Spartans are able to make contact with several Huragok in the shield world and convince them to bring it out of slipspace. The group is then rescued what to them is a few days later, but to the rest of the universe, months later. To their relief, they discover that the Covenant has been defeated, but the Master Chief apparently perished in the final battle. Blue Team, now made up of both the survivors of the original team and the surviving Spartan-III's, decide to join the new Spartan branch and continue serving in the post-war universe.\n\nIn ''Halo: Last Light'', Linda and Blue Team investigate a Forerunner structure on the politically-unstable planet of Gao and get caught in both the machinations of a power hungry leader and the plans of a rogue Forerunner AI, Intrepid Eye. This pits the UNSC against the Covenant splinter faction known as the Keepers of the One Freedom which Gao's Minister of Protection, Arlo Casille, uses to gain power and turn on the UNSC, having secretly brought the Keepers to the planet for just that purpose. Intrepid Eye destroys Fred's AI Wendell and nearly escapes using Fred's armor, but Veta Lopis, a Gao investigator who was investigating a series of murders committed by Intrepid Eye, disables Fred's suit with an explosive she had earlier planted and the rogue AI is captured. Fleeing the planet, Blue Team destroys the Forerunner base with a nuclear weapon, but Admiral [[#Serin Osman|Serin Osman]], herself a former Spartan-II, removes the Spartan-III's from the team due to the danger if their illegal augmentations are exposed. Instead, Osman turns the III's into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Blue Team is given a mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family, apparently by the Keepers of the One Freedom. Blue Team works alongside the Ferrets who manage to infiltrate a Keeper base, but discover the Admiral's family dead. Blue Team provides backup and destroys the base with nuclear weapons which are rearmed by Linda, but its discovered that the bodies were planted. The investigation leads them back to Gao and ultimately to Meridian where the group exposes and foils a dangerous bioweapon plot, unaware that the true culprit was Intrepid Eye.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, Linda and the other members of Blue Team are reunited with the Master Chief who had survived the final battle with the Covenant and made it back to Earth after over four and a half years. Together, they defeat the returned Didact and go on a series of non-stop missions.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Lone Wolf'' comics, Linda is sent on a solo mission to assassinate the traitorous Dr. Chen. However, her original mission is superseded by ONI with a mission to retrieve the AI Gabriella, thought lost with the UNSC ''Promise of Dawn'' during the Fall of Reach. The recovery of Gabriella is important as she is the only AI implanted with all of human history. Linda was forced to combat both Chen and a Covenant splinter faction to retrieve the AI, attempting to convince Chen's followers to leave the planet and avoiding repeated treachery by the doctor. After disabling Chen, Linda chose not to kill him and he had his followers leave with her while Chen sacrificed himself to set off the ''Promise of Dawn's'' self-destruct, creating an [[avalanche]] that buried the attacking Covenant forces. Linda and the survivors escaped the planet and she was able to return Gabriella to ONI. Though ONI was initially less than pleased with Linda's choices, the support of her AI Athos caused them to chalk it up to the ends justifying the means.\n\nLinda appears alongside the Master Chief, Kelly and Fred in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\n====Kelly-087====\nKelly-087, voiced by [[Luci Christian]] in ''Halo: Legends'', Jenna Berman in ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'' and [[Michelle Lukes]] in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', is the Spartan-II's scout and the Master Chief's best friend. Kelly is noted for her incredible speed, something that she had even before she underwent augmentation which only increased her speed. She is also notable for being one of the very few Spartan-II's to ever truly be [[Missing in Action]] rather than being declared as such to keep up the appearance that the Spartans are invincible. Kelly appears in much of the spin-off media and ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''. She also acts as the narrator for the animated version of ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]''.\n\nIn ''Halo: The Fall of Reach'', the Master Chief meets Kelly and fellow trainee Sam on their very first day of Spartan training. Initially, Kelly and Sam hate the Master Chief because his refusal to work as a team on a training exercise gets them into trouble, but the three quickly become best friends. Kelly quickly establishes herself as the Spartans scout due to her incredible speed which no one else can match. When the Spartans undergo augmentation, Kelly barely survives and is the slowest to recover, creating fears that she won't make it. However, Kelly pulls through in the end and joins the Spartans first real mission to capture a rebel leader and is part of the team that makes it aboard a Covenant ship to destroy it after the Spartans receive their armor. However, that mission ends up costing Sam his life. Along with most of the other Spartans, Kelly is sent to Reach's surface to defend the planet from the Covenant and is presumed killed when Reach falls to the Covenant.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', Kelly is revealed to have survived the Fall of Reach, but is one of the very few Spartans to do so. Kelly joins Fred and another Spartan Joshua on a mission to destroy a Covenant cruiser that, although successful, costs them Joshua and in the long run has no impact on the outcome of the battle. Kelly is seriously injured at some point, either during the Spartans' crash-landing, the attack on the cruiser, or the subsequent flight to Castle Base, but she hides this fact from everyone else. At the base, the Spartans are reunited with Dr. Catherine Halsey who treats Kelly's injuries and they flee into a nearby mine to avoid Covenant forces where they recover a Forerunner crystal. Kelly is once again severely injured by the assault cannons of multiple Covenant Hunters with burns to seventy-two percent of her body, but the group is rescued by friendly forces led by the Master Chief. Kelly's injuries keep her out of the fight to defend the captured Covenant flagship ''Ascendant Justice'', but Halsey is able to treat her using the medical facilities aboard the salvaged frigate ''Gettysburg''. Under the guise of a secret mission, Halsey subsequently kidnaps Kelly and flees in a stolen rebel starship to an unknown destination. Following the success of Operation: First Strike, the Master Chief officially declares Kelly Missing in Action.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Halsey transports herself and Kelly to the planet Onyx which Halsey had discovered was the training grounds for the Spartan-IIIs. Crashing on Onyx, Halsey and Kelly get caught up in the conflict between the local forces and Onyx's Sentinels and Kelly is reunited with the Spartans commander Kurt Ambrose, a Spartan-II who was kidnapped years earlier by ONI to train the new Spartans and Franklin Mendez, the Spartan-II's old trainer. Having decided to save as many Spartans as she can, Halsey had kidnapped Kelly in an attempt to protect her by taking Kelly and as many of the Spartan-IIIs away from the fighting as possible. Halsey manages to transmit a message to Earth that brings the rest of Blue Team, minus the Master Chief, to Onyx. Caught in a three-way battle between the Covenant and Forerunner constructs, the surviving Spartans retreat through a portal to Onyx's interior shield world while Kurt sacrifices himself to destroy the Covenant forces with [[nuclear weapon]]s. After holding a memorial for those they lost, the Spartans prepare to explore the shield world.\n\nIn ''Halo: Glasslands'', the Spartans are able to make contact with several Huragok in the shield world and convince them to bring it out of slipspace. The group is then rescued what to them is a few days later, but to the rest of the universe, months later. To their relief, they discover that the Covenant has been defeated, but the Master Chief apparently perished in the final battle. Blue Team, now made up of both the survivors of the original team and the surviving Spartan-III's, decide to join the new Spartan branch and continue serving in the post-war universe.\n\nIn ''Halo: Last Light'', Kelly and Blue Team investigate a Forerunner structure on the politically-unstable planet of Gao and get caught in both the machinations of a power hungry leader and the plans of a rogue Forerunner AI, Intrepid Eye. This pits the UNSC against the Covenant splinter faction known as the Keepers of the One Freedom which Gao's Minister of Protection, Arlo Casille, uses to gain power and turn on the UNSC, having secretly brought the Keepers to the planet for just that purpose. Intrepid Eye destroys Fred's AI Wendell and nearly escapes using Fred's armor, but Veta Lopis, a Gao investigator who was investigating a series of murders committed by Intrepid Eye, disables Fred's suit with an explosive she had earlier planted and the rogue AI is captured. Fleeing the planet, Blue Team destroys the Forerunner base with a nuclear weapon, but Admiral [[#Serin Osman|Serin Osman]], herself a former Spartan-II, removes the Spartan-III's from the team due to the danger if their illegal augmentations are exposed. Instead, Osman turns the III's into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Blue Team is given a mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family, apparently by the Keepers of the One Freedom. Blue Team works alongside the Ferrets who manage to infiltrate a Keeper base, but discover the Admiral's family dead. Blue Team provides backup and destroys the base with nuclear weapons which are rearmed by Linda, but its discovered that the bodies were planted. The investigation leads them back to Gao and ultimately to Meridian where the group exposes and foils a dangerous bioweapon plot, unaware that the true culprit was Intrepid Eye.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, Kelly and the other members of Blue Team are reunited with the Master Chief who had survived the final battle with the Covenant and made it back to Earth after over four and a half years. Together, they defeat the returned Didact and go on a series of non-stop missions.\n\nKelly appears alongside the Master Chief, Linda and Fred in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\n== Covenant ==\n\n=== High Prophets ===\n[[Image:Highprophets halo2.png|thumb|200px|right|Two of the Hierarchs, Regret (left) and Truth (right), consult]]\nHigh Prophets, or Hierarchs, are the supreme leaders of the theocratic [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. Upon assuming office, each Hierarch picks a new [[regnal name]] from a list of names of former Hierarchs, similar to the practice of some [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Patriarchs]].<ref>Staten, Joseph. ''[[#harvest|Halo: Contact Harvest]]'', pg 384.</ref> In ''Halo 2'', there are shown to be only three; the Prophets of Truth, Mercy, and Regret (voiced by [[Michael Wincott]], [[Hamilton Camp]] and [[Robin Atkin Downes]] in ''Halo 2'', respectively; in ''Halo 3'', Truth is voiced by [[Terence Stamp]]). The novel ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' reveals that these three Prophets, originally known as the Minister of Fortitude, the Vice-Minister of Tranquility, and the Philologist,<ref>Staten, Joseph. ''[[#harvest|Halo: Contact Harvest]]'', pg 383.</ref> plotted to usurp the throne of the Hierarchs; in the process, they hide the truth that humanity is descended from the Covenant gods, the Forerunners, believing that the revelation could shatter the Covenant. During the course of ''Halo 2'', Regret attacks Earth, and then retreats to Delta Halo. There, he calls for reinforcements, but is killed by the Master Chief. Later, Mercy is attacked by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] on ''High Charity''; Truth could have saved him, but left him to die so he could have full control over the Covenant. In ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]'', Truth is seen inspecting some Engineers around the Forerunner construct near New Mombasa. In ''[[Halo 3]]'', Truth also meets his demise at the hands of the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] when the Prophet attempts to activate all the Halo rings from the [[The Ark (Halo)|Ark]]. His death become the culmination of the Covenant's downfall.\n\nPreliminary designs for the Prophets, including the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to ''The Art of Halo'', the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister.<ref name=aoh55>Trautmann, Eric. ''[[#art of halo|The Art of Halo]]'', pg 55.</ref> Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport;<ref name=aoh55/> even in the final designs, the Prophets are made to be dependent on their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.<ref>Trautmann, Eric. ''[[#art of halo|The Art of Halo]]'', pg 56.</ref>\n\n=== Arbiter ===\n{{main|Arbiter (Halo)}}\nThe Arbiter is a rank given to special Covenant Elite soldiers who undertake suicidal missions on behalf of the [[Hierarchs (Halo)|Hierarchs]] to gain honor upon their death. They are revered amongst the Covenant for their bravery and skills. In ''Halo 2'', the rank of Arbiter is given to Thel 'Vadamee, the disgraced former Supreme Commander of the Fleet of Particular Justice, which was responsible for destroying Reach. It was under his watch that Installation 04 was destroyed in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and the ''Ascendant Justice'' was captured by the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] in ''[[Halo: First Strike]]''. Rather than killing him, the Prophets allow the Commander to become the Arbiter, and to carry on his missions as the \"Blade of the Prophets.\"<ref>'''Truth''': Not as you are. But become the Arbiter...and you shall be set loose against this heresy with our blessing.\u2014{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004 | level = The Arbiter}}</ref> Eventually, the Arbiter rebels against the Prophets during the Great Schism by dropping the \"-ee\" suffix from his surname as a symbol of his resignation from the Covenant, and joins his fellow Elites in siding with humanity and stopping the Halo array from firing. Some of his backstory is featured in ''[[Halo: The Cole Protocol]]'' set about fifteen years before ''Combat Evolved'' where the Arbiter, then Shipmaster Thel 'Vadamee, comes into conflict with UNSC forces led by then-Lieutenant [[#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]]. The events sow the seeds of doubt in the future Arbiter's mind about the Prophets and their plans.

Working directly under the Prophet of Regret, he is assigned to lead the destruction of humanity and investigates a structure on the planet Harvest where his attempt to destroy it is foiled by forces led by Sergeant [[#John Forge|John Forge]]. He is later ordered by the Prophet of Regret to kidnap Professor Ellen Anders to activate a massive Forerunner fleet on a shield world. He comes into direct conflict with Forge twice, once when the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and a second time when Forge and a team of Spartans attempt to destroy the Forerunner planet and the fleet. After a brutal fight, the Arbiter nearly kills Forge who tricks the warrior before seriously wounding him with Forge's [[combat knife]]. Forge kills the Arbiter with one of his own energy swords and a Spartan rolls the Arbiter's body off of a cliff. Like the more well-known Arbiter, his history is somewhat explored in the expanded canon which reveals him to be a disgraced warrior named Ripa 'Moramee who was spared from execution by the Prophet of Regret and made into an Arbiter due to his ruthlessness and likelihood not to question his mission. This particular Arbiter is voiced by [[David Sobolov]].\n\n=== Rtas 'Vadum ===\nMaking his debut in ''Halo 2'', [[Special Ops]] Commander Rtas 'Vadum is never named in the game itself, leading to the unofficial nickname of \"Half-Jaw\" by fans,<ref>{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://halostory.bungie.org/half-jaw.html|title=HBO Character Profiles|publisher=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> due to the missing mandibles on the left side of his face. With the release of ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel]]'', however, the character was finally named in the story ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'' as Rtas 'Vadumee. The character is voiced by [[Robert Davi]].\n\n'Vadum, originally 'Vadumee before the Covenant Civil War, is a veteran Covenant Elite and the second most prominent Elite character in the series after the Arbiter. He carries the Covenant rank of Shipmaster. ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel#The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]'' explains how he loses his left mandibles; he is injured after fighting one of his friends, who was infected by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammack|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0-7851-2372-5 |page=55}}</ref> During the early events of ''Halo 2'', 'Vadumee serves as a messenger between the Hierarchs and the Elite Council, as he is seen relaying messages between the two parties in the Prophets' chamber.<ref>'''Spec Ops''': I shall relay your . . . decision . . . to the Council.\u2014{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =| version = | level =Quarantine Zone| isolang = | quote = }}</ref> Surviving the Prophets' betrayal, 'Vadumee joins his brethren in fighting the Brutes, dropping the \"-ee\" suffix from his surname to symbolize his resignation from the Covenant.

Along with the Arbiter, 'Vadum leaves Earth to return to the Elite's homeworld with the end of the war. Rtas 'Vadum is known for being a quick, smart, and ingenious tactician and an unparalleled fighter, especially with an Energy Sword and is an excellent leader. He expresses great care for his soldiers, even the [[Covenant (Halo)#Unggoy (Monachus frigus)|Unggoy]]. He is eager to exact revenge on the Brutes after the Great Schism.\n\n'Vadum appears in the novella ''Halo: Shadow of Intent'' taking place after the war. Still the Shipmaster of the ''Shadow of Intent'', 'Vadum protects Sangheili space and comes into conflict with a Covenant splinter faction led by two surviving Prophets, Prelate Tem'Bhetek and the Minister of Preparation Boru'a'Neem. The Prelate is shown to have a personal grudge against 'Vadum, blaming him for the death of his family when High Charity fell to the Flood and 'Vadum had the city partially glassed in a failed effort to contain the Flood. After capturing the Prelate, 'Vadum shows sympathy for him and reveals that the Prelate's family may well have been alive when the Prelate departed the city, meaning that Preparation lied to him. 'Vadum's words shake the Prelate's faith in Preparation who is revealed to be planning to use a prototype Halo ring to destroy Sanghelios using the ''Shadow of Intent'' to power it. The Prelate sacrifices himself to stop Preparation, leaving 'Vadum with a new outlook following the encounter. Along with getting the Arbiter to relax age-old rules not allowing females to serve in the military, 'Vadum reveals that he plans to use navigation data recovered from the Prelate's ship to seek out the rest of the Prophets and attempt to determine who should be punished as [[war criminal]]s and who should be pardoned to coexist in peace as innocents.\n\n=== Tartarus ===\nTartarus (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is the Chieftain of the Brutes, easily recognized by his white hair, distinctive [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], and massive gravity hammer known as the \"Fist of Rukt.\" Rough, arrogant, and disdainful of the Elites, Tartarus is completely dedicated to the Prophets' salvific \"Great Journey.\" ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' reveals that Tartarus became Chieftain after killing the former Chieftain, his uncle Maccabeus, and seizing the Chieftain's weapon. In ''Contact Harvest'', Tartarus acts as one of the main antagonists, working to destroy the human colony of Harvest and coming into conflict with Sergeant Johnson. During the final battle of the novel, Johnson's life is inadvertently saved when one of Tartarus' own soldiers turns against him, damaging Tartarus' armor and forcing him to retreat. Tartarus makes his first appearance in the novel ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', as one of the first Brutes allowed into the chamber of the [[#High Prophets|High Prophet of Truth]].<ref>Nylund, Eric. ''[[#first strike|Halo: First Strike]]'', pg 340.</ref> In ''Halo 2'', Tartarus acts as an agent of the Prophets, branding the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] for his failures. The Chieftain later appears when the Arbiter tries to retrieve the Activation Index of [[Installation 05|Delta Halo]]. On the Prophets' orders, Tartarus takes the Index and pushes the Arbiter to what was intended to be his death in a deep chasm.<ref>'''Tartarus''': A bloody fate awaits you and the rest of your incompetent race... and I, Tartarus!, Chieftain of the Brutes, will send you to it. / '''Arbiter''': When the Prophets learn of this, they will take your head! / '''Tartarus''': Learn of it?

Blind to the Prophets' deception about the Great Journey, Tartarus activates the ring; the Brute is ultimately killed by the coordinated efforts of the Arbiter with the help of Sergeant Major Johnson, successfully preventing the firing of [[Installation 05|Delta Halo]].\n\nDesigns for Tartarus began after the basic shape and design of the common Brutes was complete.<ref>Trautmann, Eric.

Calling himself \"the Didact's Hand,\" Jul's faction initially seeks the Forerunner warrior Didact as an ally against humanity. The character appears in Karen Traviss' Kilo-5 trilogy of novels, as well as ''[[Halo 4]]'' and ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\nFirst appearing in the ''Kilo-Five trilogy'', Jul is depicted as a member of the Servants of the Abiding Truth, a Covenant religious splinter faction that is opposed to the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] and his Swords of Sanghelios. However, Jul is shown to have only joined the Servants as they were the best equipped to combat the Arbiter and his forces as Jul did not believe humanity would change and must be stopped while the Arbiter wanted to form a lasting alliance with them. The Servants attempt to defeat the Arbiter ended in catastrophe thanks to the intervention of the UNSC ''Infinity'' in the battle. Jul was subsequently captured by the Kilo-Five black ops team and imprisoned on the Forerunner shield world of Onyx. Jul eventually escaped using one of the shield world's slipspace portals and traveled to the Sangheili colony world of Hesduros which had been cut off from the goings-on in the galaxy since before the Covenant civil war. By portraying his experiences on the shield world in a religious light, Jul was able to win over the inhabitants, but learned that his wife had been killed. Grief-stricken and blaming humanity, Jul discovered the coordinates to the shield world of Requiem on Hesduros and began building up a massive following, forming a new Sangheili-led Covenant. Jul's Covenant eventually found Requiem, but were trapped outside for three years as depicted in the ''Halo 4'' Terminals because the planet required the presence of a Reclaimer to open.\n\nIn ''Halo 4'', the Master Chief arrives at Requiem in the rear half of the ''Forward Unto Dawn'' and comes into conflict with Jul and his forces. The Master Chief's presence causes Requiem to finally open, granting Jul's Covenant access to the planet. Jul eventually leads some of his forces into Requiem's core where the Forerunner known as the Didact is imprisoned. The Didact is able to trick the Master Chief into releasing him and Jul bows down before him. Despite the core's subsequent collapse, Jul manages to escape with his life and allies himself with the Didact against the humans from the ''Infinity''. Jul's alliance with the Didact leaves him with the ability to command the Didact's Promethean soldiers even after the Didact's own defeat. Subsequent to this, Jul brands himself \"the Didact's Hand\" with his status and ability to control the Prometheans giving him even more power and attracting more followers to his cause.\n\nIn ''Spartan Ops'', six months after the Battle of Requiem, the ''Infinity'' returns to Requiem which is still occupied by Jul and his Covenant. The forces of the ''Infinity'' and Jul's forces battle each other for control over the planet while Jul personally leads the attempt to access the [[#Librarian|Librarian]]'s AI which Jul wants to use for the power that the Librarian can give to him. In ''Halo: Escalation'', Jul and Halsey work together while Jul faces a mutiny inside of his own forces. Their mission to access the Absolute Record of Forerunner installations, however, fails.\n\nIn ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', Jul's power has begun to break following all of his defeats and his Prometheans turning against him under the influence of [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]]. On the remote world of Kamchatka, Jul attempts to access the Forerunner Domain with the help of Halsey while his loyal forces battle the Prometheans. However, Jul is unaware that Halsey has betrayed his location to the UNSC due to the threat Cortana poses. He is killed by Spartan Jameson Locke in single combat and Jul's Covenant falls apart soon thereafter.\n\n== Forerunner ==\n\n=== 343 Guilty Spark ===\n[[Image:Spark-halo3.jpg|thumb|right|343 Guilty Spark, as he appears in ''Halo&nbsp;3'']]\n343 Guilty Spark (or Guilty Spark or just Spark) (voiced by [[Tim Dadabo]]) is a [[robot]] [[character (arts)|character]] who appears in the original Halo trilogy. 343 Guilty Spark was originally a human named Chakas who was digitized by the Forerunners at the expense of his biological form. Guilty Spark served as the caretaker of the Halo ring Installation 04, where he was an occasional ally and enemy to the Master Chief. He is ultimately severely damaged when he tries to stop Master Chief from activating Installation 08 to stop the threat of the Flood. A fragment of Spark was recovered by the UNSC, and the AI ended up commandeering the ship to seek out the Librarian and bring back his old friends from when he was human.\n\nIn the novel ''Halo: Renegades'', Guilty Spark, now inhabiting the body of a Forerunner armiger robot, is rescued by the salvage crew of the ''Ace of Spades'' after crashing on an isolated planet. Having recovered his sanity and much of his human personality, Spark, as he now chooses to go by, is left horrified by what he became as 343 Guilty Spark. Spark allies with the crew to recover their stolen property from ONI who are after the AI as well and to complete his own mission of finding the Librarian. Succeeding in both, Spark is talked out of his original plan by the Librarian and made to recognize the friends he has made amongst the crew. Given a coordinate key to \"the safe place\" by the Librarian, Spark helps his friends to escape ONI and offers his services to the crew as the shipboard AI for the ''Ace of Spades'' which Spark greatly upgrades using Forerunner technology. The crew dedicates themselves to finding the long-lost ''Spirit of Fire'' while the Librarian indicates to Captain Rion Forge that Spark, who she calls singularly unique due to his ability to evolve so greatly on his own over time, may still have an important role to play in the events to come.\n\nBungie originally wanted Guilty Spark to sound similar to the robot [[C-3PO]].<ref name=\"ttl-dadabointerview\"/> Dadabo noted in an interview that reactions to his character have been hostile, finding Spark highly annoying.<ref name=\"gameinformer-downes/dadabo\" /> He described Spark's character as a \"bastard\" who strings others along in order to accomplish his ends.<ref name=\"ttl-dadabointerview\">{{cite web|date=November 30, 2008|url=http://blog.tiedtheleader.com/article/860/greetings-reclaimer|title=Greetings Reclaimer...|publisher=TiedTheLeader|accessdate=December 4, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205064847/http://blog.tiedtheleader.com/article/860/greetings-reclaimer|archivedate=December 5, 2008}}</ref> An annual [[Halloween]] pumpkin carving contest named ''343 Guilt O'Lantern'' is organized by [[Halo.Bungie.Org]]; both the contest's title and logo use the character's design and name as inspiration.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/guiltolantern07.html| title=343 Guilt O'Lantern: 2007 Edition| publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|year=2007| accessdate=October 17, 2007|author=Staff}}</ref> Gaming site [[GameDaily]] listed Guilty Spark as one of the top \"evil masterminds\" of video games, stating \"If [[HAL-9000]] had any distant relatives, [Guilty Spark would] be closest of kin.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |date=November 29, 2008 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-evil-masterminds-of-all-time/?page=11 |title=The top 25 evil masterminds of all time |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210075912/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-evil-masterminds-of-all-time/?page=11 |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== 05-032 Mendicant Bias ===\n05-032 Mendicant Bias (\"''Beggar after Knowledge''\" as revealed in ''[[Halo: Cryptum]]'') was the Contender-class Forerunner A.I. charged with organizing Forerunner defense against the Flood. It was later defected by [[Gravemind]] turning it rampant and against the Forerunners, but was eventually defeated after the firing of the Halo array and broken into sections, one of which was taken to [[The Ark (Halo)|the Ark]], while another was left on the Forerunner ship that would eventually be incorporated into the Covenant city of ''High Charity''. It is this section of Mendicant Bias that informs the Covenant [[#High Prophets|Hierarchs]] of the human's descendance from the Forerunners in ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'', prompting the Hierarchs to usurp the Covenant leadership and instigate the Human-Covenant War.\n\nMendicant Bias is first encountered in ''[[Halo 3]]'' on the Ark, as it attempted to communicate with the Master Chief through Terminals, claiming it sought atonement for its defection to the Flood by helping the Spartan and may have been destroyed when the Chief activated the incomplete Halo that the Ark was constructing.<ref name=arkConver>''And so here at the end of my life, I do once again betray a former master. The path ahead is fraught with peril. But I will do all I can to keep it stable \u2013 keep you safe. I'm not so foolish to think this will absolve me of my sins. One life hardly balances billions. But I would have my masters know that I have changed. And you shall be my example.''\u2014Mendicant Bias to John-117.</ref> However, as the Ark survived the firing, albeit badly damaged, Mendicant Bias may have survived as well.\n\n=== Didact ===\nThe Didact, born Shadow-of-Sundered-Star, (voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]]) is a Forerunner military leader  and the ''Halo 4'''s main antagonist. The Didact developed a deep animosity towards humanity after fighting a war with them that cost him many soldiers and his children. The Didact disagrees with the plan to build the Halo Array to fight the Flood, instead proposing a system of \"shield worlds\" that is ultimately rejected. Going into exile in a kind of stasis within a device known as a Cryptum, he is later awoken by the Forerunner Bornstellar with the help of humans Chakas and Riser, all guided by the Librarian. The Didact imprints his consciousness on Bornstellar, who then becomes the Iso-Didact; when the Ur-Didact is presumed dead after being captured by the Master Builder, Bornstellar assumes the Didact's military role. Unknown to most, the Ur-Didact was actually abandoned in a Flood-infested system where he was captured and tortured by the Gravemind. Though he survived, the Ur-Didact was spurred to more drastic measures in an effort to stop the Flood, forcibly composing humans and turning them into mechanical soldiers. The Librarian incapacitated him and placed him in a Cryptum on his shield world Requiem, hoping that meditation and long exposure to the Domain would amend his motives and heal his mind; however, the activation of the Halos severed the Didact from the Domain, and he spent the next 100 millennia alone, with only his own rage and madness to keep him company.\n\nDuring the events of ''Halo 4'', the Ur-Didact is accidentally released from his Cryptum by the Master Chief and Cortana. He immediately retakes control of the Prometheans and attempts to digitize the population of Earth, but is stopped by Cortana and Master Chief who is made immune to the Composer by an imprint of the Librarian on Requiem. The comic series ''Escalation'' reveals the Didact survived this encounter, but the Spartans of Blue Team stop his plans once again. He is apparently digitized by the Master Chief using several Composers, but the Master Chief considers him contained, not dead.\n\nIn ''Halo: Renegades'', 343 Guilty Spark, formerly Bornstellar's human companion Chakas who once helped release the Ur-Didact from his Cryptum, learns from the Librarian of the Ur-Didact's release from his Cryptum on Requiem. From the Librarian's reaction to his questions, Spark realizes that the Ur-Didact's threat is currently \"not worrisome\" and that the Librarian still hopes for her husband to find peace. However, the Librarian sadly admitted that she believed the Ur-Didact to be beyond redemption.\n\n=== Librarian ===\nThe Librarian (voiced by Lori Tritel) is a highly ranked Forerunner who is married to the Didact. The Librarian spares humanity from extinction after their war with the Forerunners. She convinces the Forerunner council to use the Halos as preserves for fauna in addition to weapons and manipulates the humans Chakas and Riser as well as the young Forerunner Bornstellar into rescuing her husband from his Cryptum on Earth. She ultimately incapacitates and imprisons the Ur-Didact to stop his plans. While she is presumed to have died when the Halo Array was fired, she uploaded various copies of her personality to aid humanity in assuming the Forerunner's Mantle of Responsibility.\n\nIn ''Halo 4'', the Master Chief encounters one such copy on Requiem where the Librarian explains some of the history of the Didact, the war between the humans and the Forerunners as well as the Composer. The Librarian reveals that the Master Chief is \"the culmination of a thousand lifetimes of planning,\" the Librarian having guided humanity through their genetic code to reach the eventuality that became the Master Chief. However, the Librarian is unable to explain what she was planning for before they are interrupted by the Didact. At the Librarian's urging, the Master Chief permits her to accelerate his evolution in order to grant the Master Chief an immunity to the Composer, allowing the Master Chief to survive the Didact's later firing of the weapon. In ''Spartan Ops'', taking place six months later, both the UNSC and Ju 'Mdama's Covenant splinter faction search Requiem for this copy of the Librarian. Dr. Catherine Halsey manages to access a shrine containing the Librarian who provides Halsey with the Janus Key and directs her to find the Absolute Record. The Librarian helps Fireteam Crimson track Halsey's signal in an effort to rescue Halsey from 'Mdama and Crimson helps the Librarian transmit herself to the Absolute Record. She later appears there in ''Halo: Escalation''.\n\nIn ''Halo: Primordium'', 343 Guilty Spark, once the human Chakas, claims to know where to find the Librarian, suggesting that she has survived. Rescued from an isolated planet by the crew of the salvage ship ''Ace of Spades'' in ''Halo: Renegades'', Spark continues his search for the Librarian, which is ultimately revealed to be a search for another of her copies, not the Librarian herself. In a Forerunner structure on Earth beneath [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], Spark attempts to get the Librarian to help him bring back his friends from when he was human or to join them in the Domain, but the Librarian helps Spark see the folly of his plan. Instead, the Librarian helps Spark recognize the friends he has made amongst the ''Ace of Spades'' crew. Though the Librarian offers Spark the chance to join her in joining the rest of her copies at the Absolute Record, he decides to remain behind with his friends. The Librarian provides Spark with a coordinate key to \"the safe place\" and orders him to \"find what's missing. Fix the path. Right what my kind has turned wrong.\" Before departing, the Librarian seemingly communicates with each member of the crew, telling Captain Rion Forge in particular to look after Spark who is more fragile and important than she could ever know and who might still have a role to play in events to come.\n\n== Flood ==\n=== Gravemind ===\n{{main|Gravemind}}\nGravemind (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is one of the primary antagonists in the Halo series. The Gravemind is a large, sentient creature of [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] origin, created by the parasite to serve as its central intelligence once a critical biomass has been achieved. It was introduced during the events of ''Halo 2'', where the creature saves both the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] and [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] from their deaths, bringing the two face to face in the bowels of [[Installation 05|Delta Halo]]. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the \"sacred rings\" are actually weapons of last resort; a fact the Master Chief confirms.<ref>'''Gravemind''': Your Prophets have promised you freedom from a doomed existence, but you will find no salvation on this ring. Those who built this place knew what they wrought; do not mistake their intent or all will perish as they did before. / '''Master Chief''': This thing is right. Halo is a weapon. Your Prophets are making a big mistake.\u2014{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| level = Gravemind}}</ref> In order to stop Halo from being fired, Gravemind teleports the Master Chief and Arbiter to separate locations, but also uses them as a distraction; Gravemind infests the human ship ''In Amber Clad'', and uses it to invade the Covenant city of ''High Charity''.<ref>'''Cortana''': Flood-controlled dropships are touching down all over the city.

It is also mentioned in the game's menu that while the Gravemind's \"most recent physical avatar\" was destroyed by the Master Chief, it is \"only a matter of time before it rises again\". Though the Flood released upon the Ark form a Proto-Gravemind and come close to forming a new Gravemind, the Proto-Gravemind is killed by the Banished and the Flood are once again contained by the Banished and the Ark's Sentinels.\n\nDesigned to be a massive, horrifying combination of tentacles and rotting matter,<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Joseph Staten|Staten, Joseph]] |date=September 25, 2007 |title=Halo 2 Developer's Commentary |medium=[[Halo 3 Legendary Edition|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]] | time=54:00| publisher=[[Bungie]]}}\u2014'''Staten:''' \"...as originally designed, the Gravemind was this seething mass of corpses right, his teeth were skulls and he talked from the shadows.

The [[Halo (franchise)#Original trilogy|original trilogy's]] central story revolved around conflict between humanity under the auspices of the [[Factions of Halo|United Nations Space Command]] or UNSC, and an alien alliance known as the [[Factions of Halo#Covenant|Covenant]]. The artifacts left behind by an ancient race known as the [[Factions of Halo#Forerunner|Forerunner]] play a central role\u2014particularly the [[ringworld]]s known as [[Halo (megastructure)|Halos]], built to contain the threat of the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].\n\nBungie founder [[Jason Jones (programmer)|Jason Jones]] noted that bringing together the elements of a video game is unmistakably \"art\", but character designers and artists had to make a \"living, breathing world\" and populate it with interesting characters and places. The first ''Halo'' game's development brought numerous evolutions and revisions to the character's designs and personalities. Characters were also updated to take full advantage of new graphics technologies; for instance, the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]]'s armor was redesigned in a lengthy conceptual process and the final model was [[bump mapping|bump mapped]]. Subsequent games offered opportunities to refine the character's appearances and design.\n\n''Halo''{{'}}s commercial and critical success has led to large amounts of merchandise featuring the franchise's characters to be produced. The Master Chief, the most visible symbol of the series, has been heavily marketed, with the character's visage appearing on soda bottles, T-shirts, and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] controllers. Other merchandise produced includes several sets of [[action figure]]s. ''Halo''{{'}}s characters have received varying reception, with characters such as the Chief, [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]], and the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] being well received by critics.\n\n== Character design and creation ==\nThe ''Halo'' franchise originated with the 2001 video game ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The game's characters were continually refined through development, as developer [[Bungie]] was bought by [[Microsoft]] and the platform shifted from the [[Macintosh]] to the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Other Bungie developers would often add input to character development, even if they were not working on the game itself.<ref>Trautmann, 19.</ref> An outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a 3D model, the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character.<ref>Trautmann, 20.</ref> Early Covenant Elites had a more natural jaw rather than the split mandibles they would later sport; at one point, Jason Jones was also insistent about having a tail on the Elites, but this idea was eventually dropped.<ref>Trautmann, 38.</ref>\n\nOriginally, the game designers decided to hand-key character animations.<ref>Trautmann, 14.</ref> The animators videotaped themselves to have reference footage for the movement of game characters; art director Marcus Lehto's wife recorded him \"running around a field with a two-by-four\" for the human marines. By ''Halo 3'', Bungie staff had a special room designed for capturing reference material.<ref name=Brutes/> Many of the subsequent human character's features were based on Bungie designers,<ref name=aoh27>Trautmann, 27.</ref> while character animators looked to simian, ursine, insectoid, and reptilian features for the various races of the Covenant.<ref>Trautmann, 53.</ref> The artificial intelligences of the characters was also deliberately limited to make sure they acted realistically to environmental changes and situations.<ref name=\"AI\">{{cite web| url=http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/halo2-ai.htm| title=In the Mind of the Enemy: The Artificial Intelligence of Halo 2 | author=Robert Valdes| publisher=How Stuff Works| date=November 17, 2004| accessdate=December 19, 2007}}</ref> Later games use [[motion capture]] to capture the movement and facial acting of the cast.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n=== Voice acting ===\n[[File:Steve Downes and Jen Taylor at HaloFest 2011 (6097609270).jpg|thumb|right|[[Steve Downes]] and [[Jen Taylor]], the voices of Master Chief and Cortana, at HaloFest during [[PAX (event)|PAX]] Prime 2011]]\nThe ''Halo'' series features voice work by television and film actors including [[Ron Perlman]], [[Orlando Jones]], [[Michelle Rodriguez]], [[Robert Davi]], and [[Terence Stamp]].<ref name=\"scifi-faces\">{{cite web|author=Staff |date=November 22, 2007 |url=http://dvice.com/archives/2007/11/the_faces_of_halo.php |title=The Faces of 'Halo' |publisher=[[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] |accessdate=September 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226093408/http://dvice.com/archives/2007/11/the_faces_of_halo.php |archivedate=February 26, 2008 }}</ref> Voice acting became more important as ''Halo: Combat Evolved''{{'}}s sequels were developed; ''Halo 2'' had 2,000 lines of combat dialogue, while ''Halo 3'' has in excess of 14,000 lines.<ref name=\"bungie-h2dvdvoice\">{{cite video|people=[[Martin O'Donnell|O'Donnell, Martin]]; [[Joseph Staten|Staten, Joseph]]|date=November 7, 2004|title=Voices of Halo 2 / Music: Halo 2 Limited Edition|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Bungie]]|location=Kirkland, Washington}}</ref> Some actors voiced their lines in remote locations, while others traveled to a studio to record their lines.<ref name=\"gameinformer-downes/dadabo\">{{cite web|date=February 27, 2007 |title=Voicing Halo: The Steve Downes And Tim Dadabo Interview |url= http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200702/N07.0227.1815.49562.htm|work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=September 10, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070310030952/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200702/N07.0227.1815.49562.htm |archivedate = March 10, 2007|url-status=dead|author1 = Berghammer|first1 = Billy|author2 = [[Tim Dadabo]] |author3=[[Steve Downes]]}}</ref> In interviews, ''Halo''{{'}}s voice actors stated that they had no idea that the games would become such a critical and commercial success.

Johnson later appears as a main character in ''Halo: Silent Storm'' where it's revealed that he's a Spartan-I, a precursor to the Spartan-II program that the Master Chief is a part of. Taking place about a year after ''Contact Harvest'', Johnson is recruited to be a part of a strike force launching a counterattack behind enemy lines to buy humanity some time. Johnson is recruited both for his experience with the Covenant and his Spartan training and acts as a mentor and friend to the young Master Chief, becoming one of the few people the Spartans trust implicitly on the mission where insurrectionists are trying to destroy them and they can't be sure of whom to trust.\n\nIn many ways similar to the stereotype of charismatic black Marines found in other science fiction (such as [[List of Alien characters|Sergeant Apone]] in ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' whom Johnson was partially based on),<ref name=gametap>{{cite web|url=http://www.gametap.com/home/read/article/8a25090115d6b7e40115d9725623148e |title=The Halo Harvest Interview, Part 1 |publisher=[[Gametap]] |author=Perry, Douglass |accessdate=January 15, 2008 |date=October 29, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102071253/http://www.gametap.com/home/read/article/8a25090115d6b7e40115d9725623148e |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}</ref> some publications found Johnson, though enjoyable, somewhat of a [[flat character]].

As the planet is [[glass transition|glassed]] by the Covenant, Keyes follows Cole Protocol, which leads his new ship, the ''Pillar of Autumn'' to [[Halo (megastructure)|Halo]]. There, Keyes leads a [[guerrilla]] insurgency against the Covenant, until he is captured and assimilated by the parasitic [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]]. After being found by the Master Chief in his assimilated state, the Master Chief sadly ends Keyes' suffering by punching into his skull to retrieve Keyes' neural implants in order to destroy the ''Pillar of Autumn''. His daughter is Miranda Keyes.\n\n=== Miranda Keyes ===\nCommander Miranda Keyes is the daughter of [[#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]] and [[#Catherine Halsey|Catherine Halsey]], whom she lived with in her younger years. Halsey and Miranda had a falling out in which she changed her last name (then Halsey) to her father's name (Keyes). Miranda appears in ''Halo 2'', ''Halo 3'' and in the final chapter of ''Halo: The Cole Protocol''. At the beginning of ''Halo 2'', Keyes is present at an awards ceremony on board the Cairo defense platform above [[Earth]] to accept a medal posthumously for her father. Soon after, a Covenant fleet launches an attack on Earth, and Keyes takes control of the UNSC ship ''In Amber Clad'' and assists in the defense of New Mombasa, Kenya. When the [[High Prophet of Regret|Prophet of Regret]] retreats from Earth, Keyes orders ''In Amber Clad'' to follow; this results in the discovery of [[Installation 05]], another Halo. Keyes, along with Johnson and a squad of Marines, head for Halo's library in order to retrieve the Activation Index and prevent the ring's activation while the Master Chief assassinates the Prophet of Regret; in the process, she and Johnson are captured by the Brute Chieftain [[#Tartarus|Tartarus]]. As a \"Reclaimer,\" only she or another human can insert the Index into Halo's control panel, and Tartarus attempts to make her do this. When the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] tries to stop the firing, Tartarus forces Keyes to insert the Index, initiating Halo's firing sequence. After the Arbiter engages and kills Tartarus, Keyes successfully removes the Index and prevents Halo from activating, but inadvertently causes all the remaining Halo installations to enter standby mode, enabling the remote firing of these installations from [[The Ark (Halo)|The Ark]].<ref>'''343 Guilty Spark''': Fail-safe protocol: in the event of unexpected shut-down, the entire system will move to standby status.

In ''Halo 3'', Hood is in overall command of Earth's defense following the death of Fleet Admiral Harper and shares command with Commander Miranda Keyes, who reports directly to him. He accepts the need for humanity to ally with the Elites, but is not entirely happy about it. He leads the remaining human naval forces in an attack on the Prophet of Truth's dreadnought,<ref>'''Hood''': I'll initiate a low-level strike. Hit 'em right where it hurts. I only have a handful of ships, Master Chief. It's a big risk. But I'm confident.\u2014{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 3]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2007| platform =[[Xbox 360]]| version = | level = Floodgate}}</ref> but the attack fails when the Forerunner artifact under New Mombasa activates, creating a portal to the Ark. When the Master Chief, Keyes, and several Elite and human forces choose to follow the Prophet of Truth through the portal, he decides to stay behind to make a final stand on Earth.<ref>{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 3]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2007| platform =[[Xbox 360]]| version = | level = Floodgate}}</ref> At the end of the game, he commemorates a small monument to the war and the sacrifices it involved. Though unable to forgive the Arbiter for his actions during the war, Hood thanks him for standing by the Master Chief \"to the end\" and expresses sorrow at the Spartan's apparent death. Hood also appears in the spin-off media, including several of the books and comics which delve further into his backstory. Its revealed that Hood was captain of a ship during the Battle for Arcadia in ''Halo Wars'' and was ordered to collect the ''Spirit of Fire's'' log buoy, but instead attacked a Covenant destroyer, resulting in its loss. Hood subsequently blamed himself for the loss of the ''Spirit of Fire''. In ''Halo: Renegades'', John Forge's daughter finds the wreck of Hood's old ship and captain's logs by Hood's successor pointing to the destroyer having subsequently recovered the buoy, leading to her own search for the ''Spirit of Fire''. In the short story \"Rosbach's World\" taking place after ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', Hood is revealed to have escaped Cortana's attack on Earth along with Admiral Serin Osman of ONI thanks to preparations set up in secret by Osman's still-loyal AI Black Box. The two are also able to escape with many of ONI's AIs in their possession, leaving Osman with the dilemma of whether or not to destroy them or risk the AIs defecting to Cortana. However, Hood blames himself for the situation due to allowing the Master Chief free rein and falls into a depression.\n\n=== Wallace Jenkins ===\nPrivate First Class Wallace A. Jenkins is one of the UNSC forces that survives the initial Covenant attack in ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' reveals that the Marine was a member of the colony Harvest's defense militia, where his family is killed. In ''[[Halo: The Flood]]'', Jenkins assists in defending the human stronghold under the command of Major Antonio Silva. He is also part of an assault team led by [[#Avery Johnson|Sergeant Avery Johnson]] and [[#Jacob Keyes|Captain Jacob Keyes]], sent to recover a Covenant arms cache during ''Halo: Combat Evolved''. The team is overwhelmed by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]], leaving the entire squad except Sergeant Johnson infected and resulting in the eventual death of Captain Keyes. In the video game, the Master Chief recovers Jenkins' helmet, and reviews the recording of the mission that it contained, introducing the Flood to the player through the Marine's eyes. In ''Halo: Combat Evolved'', the fate of the Marine is left unknown.\n\n''[[Halo: The Flood]]'' reveals the fate of Jenkins; the Private is transformed into a Flood Combat Form along with the rest of his squad, but he is able to exercise a certain degree of control over the infection, due to the mind of the parasite being weakened by its long hibernation.<ref>[[#the flood|Dietz]], 155.</ref> He uses this limited control in an attempt to end his own life, charging at UNSC Marines in the hope that they would shoot him.<ref>Dietz, William. ''[[#the flood|Halo: The Flood]]'', pg 221.</ref> Instead, he is captured as a live specimen for study. He is brought aboard the Covenant cruiser ''Truth and Reconciliation'' as part of a mission under Orbital Drop Shock Trooper Major Silva to capture a Covenant vessel and return it to [[Earth]] intact. Jenkins successfully convinces Lieutenant Melissa McKay, that such a mission would spread the Flood to Earth, and Jenkins dies with the other human troops on the vessel as it crashed into Halo.<ref>[[#the flood|Dietz]], 291.</ref>\n\n===Serin Osman===\nAdmiral Serin Osman is the head of ONI by 2558 and also a former Spartan-II during which time she was known as Serin-019. Unlike most of the Spartans, Osman's augmentations didn't take, though she wasn't left physically debilitated like most of the other \"wash-outs.\" Admiral Margret Parangorsky, the head of ONI at the time, saw promise in Osman and reversed her augmentations and gave her a career in ONI instead. Unable to remember her real last name, she was given the last name of Osman by Parangorsky and groomed to be her successor.\n\nIn the Kilo-Five Trilogy, Osman, a Captain at the time, leads the black ops team Kilo-Five who are sent on covert operations in the post-war period. ONI uses the team to cause chaos between the various Covenant factions in an attempt to keep any one from gaining too much power and filling the power vacuum left by the fall of the Covenant Empire. After the Onyx shield world is discovered, Osman and her team arrest Dr. Catherine Halsey for war crimes and imprison the captured [[#Jul 'Mdama|Jul 'Mdama]] on Onyx before he manages to escape. The team also comes up against the father of one of their members who is seeking revenge for the presumed death of his daughter. They subsequently decide to cover up his survival, knowing that he is no longer a threat.\n\nBy the time of ''Halo: Last Light'', Osman has been promoted to Rear Admiral, though she is not yet in charge of ONI. Osman coordinates with the UNSC forces on Gao and orders Blue Team to drop a nuclear weapon on the underground Forerunner base to keep it out of enemy hands. Osman personally joins the extraction team and gives Veta Lopis the chance to destroy the Forerunner AI Intrepid Eye as a test. Afterwards, Osman removes the Spartan-III's from Blue Team due to the dangers of their augmentations becoming public knowledge, but instead turns them into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis. During the ''Halo: Fractures'' short story ''A Necessary Truth'', the Ferrets are targeted by Dark Moon Enterprises operatives hoping to expose their augmentations and thus destroy ONI. The Ferrets are able to stop the plot and turn over the evidence they gather to Osman. Though the Ferrets lie to Osman about some of the details of the mission, she decides to accept it despite being somewhat dubious.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Osman oversees the mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family. After the mission exposes a dangerous bioweapon plot, apparently done by ONI, Osman gives orders to shut down the project. However, Intrepid Eye, the true culprit, manipulates Osman's final report to give the project an unlimited black budget and continues it in secret on ''Argent Moon''.\n\nIn ''Spartan Ops'', Captain [[#Thomas Lasky|Thomas Lasky]] contacts Osman after Dr. Catherine Halsey is abducted by [[#Jul 'Mdama|Jul 'Mdama]]. Osman laments not following Parangorsky's suggestion of killing Halsey or burying her as deep as she could and orders Lasky to assassinate Halsey.\n\nIn the short story ''Rossbach's World'', Osman is revealed to have escaped the subjugation of Earth by [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]] along with Lord Hood thanks to her personal AI Black Box who remained loyal and set up an escape plan for her if needed. Osman and Hood escape with many of ONI's AIs and Osman is left contemplating whether or not to destroy them.\n\n=== Thomas Lasky ===\nCaptain Thomas Lasky is the current captain of the UNSC ''Infinity'' and is currently voiced by Darren O'Hare. He made his debut in his origin web series ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'' portrayed by [[Tom Green (Australian actor)|Tom Green]] as a young military cadet saved by the Master Chief and [[Ty Olsson]] as an adult. In ''[[Halo 4]]'', Lasky serves as ''Infinity's'' first officer at the rank of Commander and aids the Master Chief on Requiem. When ''Infinity's'' captain Andrew Del Rio refuses to listen to the Master Chief and Cortana, the Spartan decides to go rogue rather than abandon the fight with the ''Infinity''. Lasky, ordered to stop the Master Chief, instead secretly supports him by providing the Spartan with a combat-outfitted Pelican for his use. When the Master Chief returns to Earth, he discovers that Del Rio has been relieved of command for abandoning the Master Chief and Lasky promoted to Captain as his replacement. Now commanding ''Infinity'', Lasky aids the Master Chief in boarding the Didact's ship. After the Master Chief is rescued from the wreckage, Lasky attempts to comfort the grieving Spartan and reminds him that soldiers aren't machines, they are just people. Six months later, Lasky returns in ''Spartan Ops'', leading the ''Infinity'' back to Requiem. After helping defend his ship from a Promethean and Covenant attack, Lasky clashes with Commander Sarah Palmer over orders to assassinate Dr. Catherine Halsey. With Palmer refusing to stand down, Lasky orders Fireteam Majestic to rescue Halsey in an attempt to save her life.\n\nAs Captain of the ''Infinity'', Lasky appears in spin-off media, particularly the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series.\n\nLasky returns in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''. After receiving a message from Halsey, Lasky sends Fireteam Osiris to Kamchatka to rescue the doctor and to kill [[#Jul 'Mdama|Jul 'Mdama]] if possible. Following the successful mission, Lasky reluctantly sends Fireteam Osiris after Blue Team on Meridian and later authorizes a covert operation to Sanghelios to seek out the Arbiter's help in chasing Blue Team using a Guardian on the planet. Due to ONI refusing to get involved in the Arbiter's civil war, Lasky is unable to bring ''Infinity'' into the fight and warns Spartan Jameson Locke that if something goes wrong, the mission will have never officially existed. When AIs begin pledging loyalty to Cortana ''en mass'', Lasky and ''Infinity'' witness the beginning of the subjugation of Earth, though ''Infinity's'' AI Roland chooses to remain loyal to humanity. Lasky orders a series of random slipspace jumps, planning to run until they can figure out a way to fight back.\n\nIn ''Halo: Bad Blood'', taking place after ''Halo 5: Guardians'', Lasky and ''Infinity'' link up with Blue Team and Fireteam Osiris the next day. Along with debriefing the team leaders, Lasky meets with Spartan Edward Buck in a more informal setting and offers the Spartan, who has been ordered on a covert mission even Lasky isn't allowed to know about, advice, particularly regarding leadership. The conversation with Lasky helps settle some of Buck's doubts and issues, many of which stem from the mission requiring Buck to work with an old friend who betrayed his trust. After the mission, Lasky and Palmer debrief Buck and he convinces them to allow Mickey Crespo to remain in the fight, at least until Cortana has been defeated, despite Mickey being in prison for treason.\n\n===Roland===\nRoland, voiced by Brian T. Delaney, is the current AI of the UNSC ''Infinity'', the flagship of the UNSC fleet. Roland's avatar takes the form of a golden World War II fighter pilot. Roland first appears in ''Spartan Ops'' where he helps plan missions and in some cases, aids the Spartan controllers in leading fireteams on Requiem, something that Roland comes to greatly enjoy. Using an override code, Dr. Catherine Halsey is briefly able to take control of Roland and force him to help her, learning from the AI that the Master Chief is in fact still alive and was even on ''Infinity'' which no one had informed Dr. Halsey of. However, before Dr. Halsey can escape to meet up with Jul 'Mdama, Roland manages to regain control of himself and expose Dr. Halsey's deception to the guards before a Promethean attack on the ship captures the doctor.\n\nRoland appears in spin-off media, including the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, ''Halo: Fractures'' and ''Halo: Tales from Slipspace''. Along with acting as ''Infinity's'' AI, Roland takes part in fellow AI Iona's \"trial\" with Black Box and takes part in Fireteam Majestic's poker night.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: Spartan Assault]]'', Roland takes on the role of a narrator for cadets undergoing battle simulations based on the Battle of Draetheus V in 2554.\n\nIn ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', Roland continues to act as the ''Infinity's'' AI. Roland is outraged when Dr. Halsey returns and makes accusations that, in Roland's own words, could effectively condemn the other AI to death. Roland angrily confronts the doctor on her hypocrisy and the fact that Cortana is being condemned simply for surviving past her normal lifespan. When Cortana subverts many of the AIs of the galaxy to her cause, Roland is one of the very few AIs that remains loyal to humanity instead of pledging his loyalty to Cortana, showing no signs of considering Cortana's offer even when she appears on ''Infinity's'' bridge. Roland is shocked when Lasky decides to run, but Lasky explains that they will run until they have a way to fight back.\n\nRoland appears in ''Halo: Bad Blood'', taking place after ''Halo 5: Guardians''. Roland is confirmed to continue to be loyal to humanity which is a good thing due to the amount of control the AI has over ''Infinity's'' systems. Roland's ability to see through Cortana's offer for the bad deal it is endears him greatly to Spartan [[#Edward Buck|Edward Buck]]. When Buck and Captain [[#Veronica Dare|Veronica Dare]] decide to get married, Roland interrupts their argument about whether or not to do it via a program or call in Captain Lasky as captain of the ship. Roland offers to marry Buck and Dare himself, stating that as the ship's AI, which in many ways effectively makes Roland ''Infinity'', he can perform a marriage as legally as if Lasky did it. Due to his fondness for the AI, Buck accepts and Roland marries the two, ending with \"feed the birds!\"\n\n=== Spartans ===\n{{redirect|SPARTAN||Spartan (disambiguation)}}\nConceived by [[#Catherine Halsey|Halsey]], the SPARTAN-II program was secretly commissioned to create an elite corps of [[supersoldiers]] who could stem rebellion in the UNSC colonies; these soldiers became the best weapon against the alien Covenant when war broke out. While John-117, also known as the Master Chief, is the hero of the trilogy, other soldiers play a significant role in the novels, ''[[Halo Legends]]'', and the prequel games ''[[Halo Wars]]'' and ''[[Halo: Reach]]''. To raise morale as the war continued to sour for humanity, the existence of the SPARTAN-II Program is disclosed to the [[general public]]. The Spartans become [[hero]]es and veritable legends; in order to maintain public confidence that the war is going well, Spartans are never listed as killed, only as [[Missing in Action]] or [[Wounded in Action]].<ref>Nylund (2003), 253.</ref> The SPARTANS were kidnapped as children, who were replaced by flash clones, which died of natural causes afterwards. The physical augmentation they undergo to turn them into super soldiers is lengthy, expensive, and strenuous, with not all of them surviving the process. Both male and female SPARTANS average {{convert|7|ft}} tall. After being recruited into the UNSC, the Spartans' last name are disposed of; their callsign is simply their first name, and a corresponding 3-digit figure (for example, Alice-130, Douglas-042, Samuel-034, etc).\n\nThe SPARTAN-III Project was started by Colonel James Ackerson to serve as cheaper, disposable supersoldiers. Some of these Spartans were main protagonists in the game ''[[Halo: Reach]]'', including the player character SPARTAN-B312, aka \"Noble Six\". Later, the UNSC creates the SPARTAN-IV project. Unlike the SPARTAN-II and -III projects\u2014which kidnapped and conscripted children or used [[war orphan]]s, respectively\u2014the Spartan-IVs are adult volunteers drawn from all branches of the UNSC. These Spartans participate in [[Military exercise|war games]] on the starship ''Infinity'', which forms the fictional basis for ''[[Halo 4]]''{{'}}s multiplayer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/halo-4/Multiplayer|title=Multiplayer|work=IGN}}{{Better source|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe most distinctive element of the Spartans is their special MJOLNIR [[powered armor|powered assault armor]].

She appears in ''[[Halo 4]]'', ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', ''[[Halo: Spartan Assault]]'', and the ''Halo Escalation'' comic series.\n\n==== Edward Buck ====\nGunnery Sergeant Edward Malcolm Buck ([[Nathan Fillion]]) is a longtime human soldier. In ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]'' he is the leader of Alpha-Nine, a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troopers (ODSTs). He is subsequently inducted into the SPARTAN-IV program, and is a playable member of Fireteam Osiris in the video game ''Halo 5''. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Halo: Reach]]'' and is the main character of the novels ''Halo: New Blood'' and ''Halo: Bad Blood''. In the latter, Buck reunites his old squad Alpha-Nine for a classified ONI mission following the events of ''Halo 5'' and is reluctantly forced to work with his old friend Mickey Crespo who betrayed Buck's trust and was imprisoned for treason. At the end of the novel, Buck decides to return to leading Alpha-Nine full-time and is married to long-time girlfriend Veronica Dare by ''Infinity's'' AI [[#Roland|Roland]].\n\n==== Jameson Locke ====\nJameson Locke is a Spartan IV who first appeared in ''Halo 2 Anniversary''{{'}}s both opening and ending with the task of hunting down the Master Chief in ''Halo 5: Guardians''. [[Mike Colter]] portrays Locke in both Anniversary and the ''Nightfall'' origin movie, and only provided the [[motion-capture]] performance for the character in ''Guardians''. Due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'' and ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', Locke's voice acting is replaced by [[Ike Amadi]]. He is the current squad leader of Fireteam Osiris, tasked with hunting down Master Chief and Blue Team.\n\n====Fred-104====\nFred-104, voiced by Andrew Lowe in ''Halo: Legends'', portrayed by Tony Giroux in ''Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn'' and Travis Willingham in the ''Halo 2: Anniversary'' Terminals and in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', is a Spartan-II and one of the Master Chief's closest friends.\n\nFred survives the fall of Reach, as shown in ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', and assists Master Chief and other Spartans in destroying a Covenant armada massing to attack Earth. In ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Fred and Blue Team help defend the Earth from Covenant attack during the events of ''[[Halo 2]]'' while the Master Chief is away on the second Halo ring. Following a message from Halsey, Blue Team hijacks a Covenant destroyer to travel to the planet Onyx where Halsey and the Spartan-III's are located. There, Blue Team is reunited with both Kelly and the Spartan-III leader, Lieutenant Commander Kurt Ambrose, an old friend theirs believed to be dead for nearly twenty years. Under heavy Covenant and Sentinel attack, the group takes out a Sentinel factory on the planet and defends the entrance to the interior shield world. Ultimately, Kurt decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the Covenant ground forces with nuclear weapons. Before sending the others through the portal, Kurt promotes Fred to the rank of Lieutenant, Junior Grade. Afterwards, Fred and the others mourn those they lost in the battle and prepare to explore the world they are now on. They reconnect with the outside world in ''Halo: Glasslands''; though to them only a few days have passed, outside months have. \n\nFred continues to serve in the post-Covenant War Spartan branch. In ''Halo: Last Light'', Fred and Blue Team investigate a Forerunner structure on the politically-unstable planet of Gao and get caught in both the machinations of a power hungry leader and the plans of a rogue Forerunner AI, Intrepid Eye. This pits the UNSC against the Covenant splinter faction known as the Keepers of the One Freedom which Gao's Minister of Protection, Arlo Casille, uses to gain power and turn on the UNSC, having secretly brought the Keepers to the planet for just that purpose. Intrepid Eye destroys Fred's AI Wendell and nearly escapes using Fred's armor, but Veta Lopis, a Gao investigator who was investigating a series of murders committed by Intrepid Eye, disables Fred's suit with an explosive she had earlier planted and the rogue AI is captured. Fleeing the planet, Blue Team destroys the Forerunner base with a nuclear weapon, but Admiral [[#Serin Osman|Serin Osman]], herself a former Spartan-II, removes the Spartan-III's from the team due to the danger if their illegal augmentations are exposed. Instead, Osman turns the III's into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Fred is given tactical command of a mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family, apparently by the Keepers of the One Freedom. Blue Team works alongside the Ferrets who manage to infiltrate a Keeper base, but discover the Admiral's family dead. Blue Team provides backup and destroys the base with nuclear weapons, but it's discovered that the bodies were planted. The investigation leads them back to Gao and ultimately to Meridian where the group exposes and foils a dangerous bioweapon plot, unaware that the true culprit was Intrepid Eye.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, Fred and the other members of Blue Team are reunited with the Master Chief who had survived the final battle with the Covenant and made it back to Earth after over four and a half years. Despite being the ranking officer as a Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Fred returns control of the team to the Master Chief and returns to his old role as second-in-command. Together, they defeat the returned Didact and go on a series of non-stop missions.\n\nFred appears alongside the Master Chief, Kelly and Linda in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n====Linda-058====\nLinda-058 (voiced by [[Andrea Bogart]] in the ''[[Halo 2: Anniversary]]'' terminals and Brittany Uomoleale in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'') is the sniper of the Spartan-II's and one of the Master Chief's closest friends. Linda is notable for her exceptional sniping skills and ability to make seemingly impossible shots. Ironically, she has a non-existent temper. She is also notable for being clinically dead for several weeks after being mortally wounded during the Fall of Reach. She appears in both much of the spin-off media and ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]'', Linda takes part in the Spartans first mission to capture a rebel leader, but is one of the Spartans to miss the Covenant ship they board to destroy it from the inside. Later, during the Fall of Reach, Linda accompanies the Master Chief and another Spartan, James, to Reach Station Gamma to destroy an unsecured navigation database. James is blown into space and presumably killed while the Master Chief and Linda succeed in completing their mission with the help of some Marines on the station, including Sergeant Avery Johnson. However, while securing their exit, Linda is hit by Covenant fire and mortally wounded. She dies in the Master Chief's arms after confirming that they had succeeded. Despite this, the Master Chief places Linda into a cryo-chamber immediately upon returning to the ''Pillar of Autumn'', believing that, while its a long shot, due to her resilience as a Spartan, Linda might be able to be revived if they can get her to a UNSC hospital. However, this plan is foiled by the loss of Reach and the need to flee the system.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', the Master Chief and Cortana recover several ejected cryo-chambers from the wreckage of Halo, the ''Pillar of Autumn'' having ejected some occupants who hadn't been awakened before the ship crashed. One of these chambers and the only one to still be functional is Linda's as the Master Chief later discovers. Due to her state, the Master Chief leaves Linda in the chamber until they can hopefully get her to a hospital. After being rescued along with several other survivors of the Fall of Reach, Dr. Catherine Halsey decides to use the medical facilities onboard the salvaged UNSC frigate ''Gettysburg'' to try to save Linda's life due to the recently-discovered threat to Earth from the Covenant. Cloning several replacement organs for her, Halsey successfully manages to revive Linda who she predicts will need weeks to properly recover from her injuries. Despite this, Linda is able to be up and about in a short amount of time to join her friends in planning a first strike against the Covenant, though she is still visibly suffering the effects of her near-fatal injuries. Despite Linda's weakened state, she is allowed to join the operation due to the limited number of available Spartans and her unique sniper skills. Linda's sniper abilities prove invaluable on the mission which proves to be a success, decimating the Covenant fleet that is poised to attack Earth and buying the human race some more time. However, during this time, Kelly is kidnapped by Halsey who vanishes with her off to parts unknown.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', a fully recovered Linda and Blue Team help defend the Earth from Covenant attack during the events of ''[[Halo 2]]'' while the Master Chief is away on the second Halo ring. Following a message from Halsey, Blue Team hijacks a Covenant destroyer to travel to the planet Onyx where Halsey and the Spartan-III's are located. There, Blue Team is reunited with both Kelly and the Spartan-III leader, Lieutenant Commander Kurt Ambrose, an old friend theirs believed to be dead for nearly twenty years. Under heavy Covenant and Sentinel attack, the group takes out a Sentinel factory on the planet and defends the entrance to the interior shield world. Ultimately, Kurt decides to sacrifice himself to destroy the Covenant ground forces with nuclear weapons. Afterwards, Linda and the others mourn those they lost in the battle and prepare to explore the world they are now on.\n\nIn ''Halo: Glasslands'', the Spartans are able to make contact with several Huragok in the shield world and convince them to bring it out of slipspace. The group is then rescued what to them is a few days later, but to the rest of the universe, months later. To their relief, they discover that the Covenant has been defeated, but the Master Chief apparently perished in the final battle. Blue Team, now made up of both the survivors of the original team and the surviving Spartan-III's, decide to join the new Spartan branch and continue serving in the post-war universe.\n\nIn ''Halo: Last Light'', Linda and Blue Team investigate a Forerunner structure on the politically-unstable planet of Gao and get caught in both the machinations of a power hungry leader and the plans of a rogue Forerunner AI, Intrepid Eye. This pits the UNSC against the Covenant splinter faction known as the Keepers of the One Freedom which Gao's Minister of Protection, Arlo Casille, uses to gain power and turn on the UNSC, having secretly brought the Keepers to the planet for just that purpose. Intrepid Eye destroys Fred's AI Wendell and nearly escapes using Fred's armor, but Veta Lopis, a Gao investigator who was investigating a series of murders committed by Intrepid Eye, disables Fred's suit with an explosive she had earlier planted and the rogue AI is captured. Fleeing the planet, Blue Team destroys the Forerunner base with a nuclear weapon, but Admiral [[#Serin Osman|Serin Osman]], herself a former Spartan-II, removes the Spartan-III's from the team due to the danger if their illegal augmentations are exposed. Instead, Osman turns the III's into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Blue Team is given a mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family, apparently by the Keepers of the One Freedom. Blue Team works alongside the Ferrets who manage to infiltrate a Keeper base, but discover the Admiral's family dead. Blue Team provides backup and destroys the base with nuclear weapons which are rearmed by Linda, but its discovered that the bodies were planted. The investigation leads them back to Gao and ultimately to Meridian where the group exposes and foils a dangerous bioweapon plot, unaware that the true culprit was Intrepid Eye.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, Linda and the other members of Blue Team are reunited with the Master Chief who had survived the final battle with the Covenant and made it back to Earth after over four and a half years. Together, they defeat the returned Didact and go on a series of non-stop missions.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Lone Wolf'' comics, Linda is sent on a solo mission to assassinate the traitorous Dr. Chen. However, her original mission is superseded by ONI with a mission to retrieve the AI Gabriella, thought lost with the UNSC ''Promise of Dawn'' during the Fall of Reach. The recovery of Gabriella is important as she is the only AI implanted with all of human history. Linda was forced to combat both Chen and a Covenant splinter faction to retrieve the AI, attempting to convince Chen's followers to leave the planet and avoiding repeated treachery by the doctor. After disabling Chen, Linda chose not to kill him and he had his followers leave with her while Chen sacrificed himself to set off the ''Promise of Dawn's'' self-destruct, creating an [[avalanche]] that buried the attacking Covenant forces. Linda and the survivors escaped the planet and she was able to return Gabriella to ONI. Though ONI was initially less than pleased with Linda's choices, the support of her AI Athos caused them to chalk it up to the ends justifying the means.\n\nLinda appears alongside the Master Chief, Kelly and Fred in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\n====Kelly-087====\nKelly-087, voiced by [[Luci Christian]] in ''Halo: Legends'', Jenna Berman in ''[[Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn]]'' and [[Michelle Lukes]] in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', is the Spartan-II's scout and the Master Chief's best friend. Kelly is noted for her incredible speed, something that she had even before she underwent augmentation which only increased her speed. She is also notable for being one of the very few Spartan-II's to ever truly be [[Missing in Action]] rather than being declared as such to keep up the appearance that the Spartans are invincible. Kelly appears in much of the spin-off media and ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''. She also acts as the narrator for the animated version of ''[[Halo: The Fall of Reach]]''.\n\nIn ''Halo: The Fall of Reach'', the Master Chief meets Kelly and fellow trainee Sam on their very first day of Spartan training. Initially, Kelly and Sam hate the Master Chief because his refusal to work as a team on a training exercise gets them into trouble, but the three quickly become best friends. Kelly quickly establishes herself as the Spartans scout due to her incredible speed which no one else can match. When the Spartans undergo augmentation, Kelly barely survives and is the slowest to recover, creating fears that she won't make it. However, Kelly pulls through in the end and joins the Spartans first real mission to capture a rebel leader and is part of the team that makes it aboard a Covenant ship to destroy it after the Spartans receive their armor. However, that mission ends up costing Sam his life. Along with most of the other Spartans, Kelly is sent to Reach's surface to defend the planet from the Covenant and is presumed killed when Reach falls to the Covenant.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', Kelly is revealed to have survived the Fall of Reach, but is one of the very few Spartans to do so. Kelly joins Fred and another Spartan Joshua on a mission to destroy a Covenant cruiser that, although successful, costs them Joshua and in the long run has no impact on the outcome of the battle. Kelly is seriously injured at some point, either during the Spartans' crash-landing, the attack on the cruiser, or the subsequent flight to Castle Base, but she hides this fact from everyone else. At the base, the Spartans are reunited with Dr. Catherine Halsey who treats Kelly's injuries and they flee into a nearby mine to avoid Covenant forces where they recover a Forerunner crystal. Kelly is once again severely injured by the assault cannons of multiple Covenant Hunters with burns to seventy-two percent of her body, but the group is rescued by friendly forces led by the Master Chief. Kelly's injuries keep her out of the fight to defend the captured Covenant flagship ''Ascendant Justice'', but Halsey is able to treat her using the medical facilities aboard the salvaged frigate ''Gettysburg''. Under the guise of a secret mission, Halsey subsequently kidnaps Kelly and flees in a stolen rebel starship to an unknown destination. Following the success of Operation: First Strike, the Master Chief officially declares Kelly Missing in Action.\n\nIn ''[[Halo: Ghosts of Onyx]]'', Halsey transports herself and Kelly to the planet Onyx which Halsey had discovered was the training grounds for the Spartan-IIIs. Crashing on Onyx, Halsey and Kelly get caught up in the conflict between the local forces and Onyx's Sentinels and Kelly is reunited with the Spartans commander Kurt Ambrose, a Spartan-II who was kidnapped years earlier by ONI to train the new Spartans and Franklin Mendez, the Spartan-II's old trainer. Having decided to save as many Spartans as she can, Halsey had kidnapped Kelly in an attempt to protect her by taking Kelly and as many of the Spartan-IIIs away from the fighting as possible. Halsey manages to transmit a message to Earth that brings the rest of Blue Team, minus the Master Chief, to Onyx. Caught in a three-way battle between the Covenant and Forerunner constructs, the surviving Spartans retreat through a portal to Onyx's interior shield world while Kurt sacrifices himself to destroy the Covenant forces with [[nuclear weapon]]s. After holding a memorial for those they lost, the Spartans prepare to explore the shield world.\n\nIn ''Halo: Glasslands'', the Spartans are able to make contact with several Huragok in the shield world and convince them to bring it out of slipspace. The group is then rescued what to them is a few days later, but to the rest of the universe, months later. To their relief, they discover that the Covenant has been defeated, but the Master Chief apparently perished in the final battle. Blue Team, now made up of both the survivors of the original team and the surviving Spartan-III's, decide to join the new Spartan branch and continue serving in the post-war universe.\n\nIn ''Halo: Last Light'', Kelly and Blue Team investigate a Forerunner structure on the politically-unstable planet of Gao and get caught in both the machinations of a power hungry leader and the plans of a rogue Forerunner AI, Intrepid Eye. This pits the UNSC against the Covenant splinter faction known as the Keepers of the One Freedom which Gao's Minister of Protection, Arlo Casille, uses to gain power and turn on the UNSC, having secretly brought the Keepers to the planet for just that purpose. Intrepid Eye destroys Fred's AI Wendell and nearly escapes using Fred's armor, but Veta Lopis, a Gao investigator who was investigating a series of murders committed by Intrepid Eye, disables Fred's suit with an explosive she had earlier planted and the rogue AI is captured. Fleeing the planet, Blue Team destroys the Forerunner base with a nuclear weapon, but Admiral [[#Serin Osman|Serin Osman]], herself a former Spartan-II, removes the Spartan-III's from the team due to the danger if their illegal augmentations are exposed. Instead, Osman turns the III's into an investigative team known as the Ferrets led by Lopis.\n\nIn ''Halo: Retribution'', Blue Team is given a mission to avenge the murder of an Admiral and the kidnapping of her family, apparently by the Keepers of the One Freedom. Blue Team works alongside the Ferrets who manage to infiltrate a Keeper base, but discover the Admiral's family dead. Blue Team provides backup and destroys the base with nuclear weapons which are rearmed by Linda, but its discovered that the bodies were planted. The investigation leads them back to Gao and ultimately to Meridian where the group exposes and foils a dangerous bioweapon plot, unaware that the true culprit was Intrepid Eye.\n\nIn the ''Halo: Escalation'' comic series, Kelly and the other members of Blue Team are reunited with the Master Chief who had survived the final battle with the Covenant and made it back to Earth after over four and a half years. Together, they defeat the returned Didact and go on a series of non-stop missions.\n\nKelly appears alongside the Master Chief, Linda and Fred in ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\n== Covenant ==\n\n=== High Prophets ===\n[[Image:Highprophets halo2.png|thumb|200px|right|Two of the Hierarchs, Regret (left) and Truth (right), consult]]\nHigh Prophets, or Hierarchs, are the supreme leaders of the theocratic [[Covenant (Halo)|Covenant]]. Upon assuming office, each Hierarch picks a new [[regnal name]] from a list of names of former Hierarchs, similar to the practice of some [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Patriarchs]].<ref>Staten, Joseph. ''[[#harvest|Halo: Contact Harvest]]'', pg 384.</ref> In ''Halo 2'', there are shown to be only three; the Prophets of Truth, Mercy, and Regret (voiced by [[Michael Wincott]], [[Hamilton Camp]] and [[Robin Atkin Downes]] in ''Halo 2'', respectively; in ''Halo 3'', Truth is voiced by [[Terence Stamp]]). The novel ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' reveals that these three Prophets, originally known as the Minister of Fortitude, the Vice-Minister of Tranquility, and the Philologist,<ref>Staten, Joseph. ''[[#harvest|Halo: Contact Harvest]]'', pg 383.</ref> plotted to usurp the throne of the Hierarchs; in the process, they hide the truth that humanity is descended from the Covenant gods, the Forerunners, believing that the revelation could shatter the Covenant. During the course of ''Halo 2'', Regret attacks Earth, and then retreats to Delta Halo. There, he calls for reinforcements, but is killed by the Master Chief. Later, Mercy is attacked by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] on ''High Charity''; Truth could have saved him, but left him to die so he could have full control over the Covenant. In ''[[Halo 3: ODST]]'', Truth is seen inspecting some Engineers around the Forerunner construct near New Mombasa. In ''[[Halo 3]]'', Truth also meets his demise at the hands of the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] when the Prophet attempts to activate all the Halo rings from the [[The Ark (Halo)|Ark]]. His death become the culmination of the Covenant's downfall.\n\nPreliminary designs for the Prophets, including the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to ''The Art of Halo'', the Prophets were designed to look feeble, yet sinister.<ref name=aoh55>Trautmann, Eric. ''[[#art of halo|The Art of Halo]]'', pg 55.</ref> Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport;<ref name=aoh55/> even in the final designs, the Prophets are made to be dependent on their technology. Special headdresses, stylized differently for each of the Hierarchs, adds personality to the aliens and a regal presence.<ref>Trautmann, Eric. ''[[#art of halo|The Art of Halo]]'', pg 56.</ref>\n\n=== Arbiter ===\n{{main|Arbiter (Halo)}}\nThe Arbiter is a rank given to special Covenant Elite soldiers who undertake suicidal missions on behalf of the [[Hierarchs (Halo)|Hierarchs]] to gain honor upon their death. They are revered amongst the Covenant for their bravery and skills. In ''Halo 2'', the rank of Arbiter is given to Thel 'Vadamee, the disgraced former Supreme Commander of the Fleet of Particular Justice, which was responsible for destroying Reach. It was under his watch that Installation 04 was destroyed in ''[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]'' and the ''Ascendant Justice'' was captured by the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] in ''[[Halo: First Strike]]''. Rather than killing him, the Prophets allow the Commander to become the Arbiter, and to carry on his missions as the \"Blade of the Prophets.\"<ref>'''Truth''': Not as you are. But become the Arbiter...and you shall be set loose against this heresy with our blessing.\u2014{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004 | level = The Arbiter}}</ref> Eventually, the Arbiter rebels against the Prophets during the Great Schism by dropping the \"-ee\" suffix from his surname as a symbol of his resignation from the Covenant, and joins his fellow Elites in siding with humanity and stopping the Halo array from firing. Some of his backstory is featured in ''[[Halo: The Cole Protocol]]'' set about fifteen years before ''Combat Evolved'' where the Arbiter, then Shipmaster Thel 'Vadamee, comes into conflict with UNSC forces led by then-Lieutenant [[#Jacob Keyes|Jacob Keyes]]. The events sow the seeds of doubt in the future Arbiter's mind about the Prophets and their plans.

Working directly under the Prophet of Regret, he is assigned to lead the destruction of humanity and investigates a structure on the planet Harvest where his attempt to destroy it is foiled by forces led by Sergeant [[#John Forge|John Forge]]. He is later ordered by the Prophet of Regret to kidnap Professor Ellen Anders to activate a massive Forerunner fleet on a shield world. He comes into direct conflict with Forge twice, once when the Arbiter kidnaps Anders and a second time when Forge and a team of Spartans attempt to destroy the Forerunner planet and the fleet. After a brutal fight, the Arbiter nearly kills Forge who tricks the warrior before seriously wounding him with Forge's [[combat knife]]. Forge kills the Arbiter with one of his own energy swords and a Spartan rolls the Arbiter's body off of a cliff. Like the more well-known Arbiter, his history is somewhat explored in the expanded canon which reveals him to be a disgraced warrior named Ripa 'Moramee who was spared from execution by the Prophet of Regret and made into an Arbiter due to his ruthlessness and likelihood not to question his mission. This particular Arbiter is voiced by [[David Sobolov]].\n\n=== Rtas 'Vadum ===\nMaking his debut in ''Halo 2'', [[Special Ops]] Commander Rtas 'Vadum is never named in the game itself, leading to the unofficial nickname of \"Half-Jaw\" by fans,<ref>{{cite web|year=2007|url=http://halostory.bungie.org/half-jaw.html|title=HBO Character Profiles|publisher=halo.bungie.org|accessdate=June 3, 2007}}</ref> due to the missing mandibles on the left side of his face. With the release of ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel]]'', however, the character was finally named in the story ''Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor'' as Rtas 'Vadumee. The character is voiced by [[Robert Davi]].\n\n'Vadum, originally 'Vadumee before the Covenant Civil War, is a veteran Covenant Elite and the second most prominent Elite character in the series after the Arbiter. He carries the Covenant rank of Shipmaster. ''[[The Halo Graphic Novel#The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor]]'' explains how he loses his left mandibles; he is injured after fighting one of his friends, who was infected by the [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Hammack|first= Lee|title=The Last Voyage of the Infinite Succor|year= 2006|publisher= Marvel Comics|location=|isbn=0-7851-2372-5 |page=55}}</ref> During the early events of ''Halo 2'', 'Vadumee serves as a messenger between the Hierarchs and the Elite Council, as he is seen relaying messages between the two parties in the Prophets' chamber.<ref>'''Spec Ops''': I shall relay your . . . decision . . . to the Council.\u2014{{cite video game| title = [[Halo 2]]| developer = Bungie| publisher = Microsoft| date = 2004| platform =| version = | level =Quarantine Zone| isolang = | quote = }}</ref> Surviving the Prophets' betrayal, 'Vadumee joins his brethren in fighting the Brutes, dropping the \"-ee\" suffix from his surname to symbolize his resignation from the Covenant.

Along with the Arbiter, 'Vadum leaves Earth to return to the Elite's homeworld with the end of the war. Rtas 'Vadum is known for being a quick, smart, and ingenious tactician and an unparalleled fighter, especially with an Energy Sword and is an excellent leader. He expresses great care for his soldiers, even the [[Covenant (Halo)#Unggoy (Monachus frigus)|Unggoy]]. He is eager to exact revenge on the Brutes after the Great Schism.\n\n'Vadum appears in the novella ''Halo: Shadow of Intent'' taking place after the war. Still the Shipmaster of the ''Shadow of Intent'', 'Vadum protects Sangheili space and comes into conflict with a Covenant splinter faction led by two surviving Prophets, Prelate Tem'Bhetek and the Minister of Preparation Boru'a'Neem. The Prelate is shown to have a personal grudge against 'Vadum, blaming him for the death of his family when High Charity fell to the Flood and 'Vadum had the city partially glassed in a failed effort to contain the Flood. After capturing the Prelate, 'Vadum shows sympathy for him and reveals that the Prelate's family may well have been alive when the Prelate departed the city, meaning that Preparation lied to him. 'Vadum's words shake the Prelate's faith in Preparation who is revealed to be planning to use a prototype Halo ring to destroy Sanghelios using the ''Shadow of Intent'' to power it. The Prelate sacrifices himself to stop Preparation, leaving 'Vadum with a new outlook following the encounter. Along with getting the Arbiter to relax age-old rules not allowing females to serve in the military, 'Vadum reveals that he plans to use navigation data recovered from the Prelate's ship to seek out the rest of the Prophets and attempt to determine who should be punished as [[war criminal]]s and who should be pardoned to coexist in peace as innocents.\n\n=== Tartarus ===\nTartarus (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is the Chieftain of the Brutes, easily recognized by his white hair, distinctive [[mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], and massive gravity hammer known as the \"Fist of Rukt.\" Rough, arrogant, and disdainful of the Elites, Tartarus is completely dedicated to the Prophets' salvific \"Great Journey.\" ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'' reveals that Tartarus became Chieftain after killing the former Chieftain, his uncle Maccabeus, and seizing the Chieftain's weapon. In ''Contact Harvest'', Tartarus acts as one of the main antagonists, working to destroy the human colony of Harvest and coming into conflict with Sergeant Johnson. During the final battle of the novel, Johnson's life is inadvertently saved when one of Tartarus' own soldiers turns against him, damaging Tartarus' armor and forcing him to retreat. Tartarus makes his first appearance in the novel ''[[Halo: First Strike]]'', as one of the first Brutes allowed into the chamber of the [[#High Prophets|High Prophet of Truth]].<ref>Nylund, Eric. ''[[#first strike|Halo: First Strike]]'', pg 340.</ref> In ''Halo 2'', Tartarus acts as an agent of the Prophets, branding the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] for his failures.

On the Prophets' orders, Tartarus takes the Index and pushes the Arbiter to what was intended to be his death in a deep chasm.<ref>'''Tartarus''': A bloody fate awaits you and the rest of your incompetent race... and I, Tartarus!, Chieftain of the Brutes, will send you to it. / '''Arbiter''': When the Prophets learn of this, they will take your head! / '''Tartarus''': Learn of it?

Calling himself \"the Didact's Hand,\" Jul's faction initially seeks the Forerunner warrior Didact as an ally against humanity. The character appears in Karen Traviss' Kilo-5 trilogy of novels, as well as ''[[Halo 4]]'' and ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]''.\n\nFirst appearing in the ''Kilo-Five trilogy'', Jul is depicted as a member of the Servants of the Abiding Truth, a Covenant religious splinter faction that is opposed to the [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] and his Swords of Sanghelios. However, Jul is shown to have only joined the Servants as they were the best equipped to combat the Arbiter and his forces as Jul did not believe humanity would change and must be stopped while the Arbiter wanted to form a lasting alliance with them. The Servants attempt to defeat the Arbiter ended in catastrophe thanks to the intervention of the UNSC ''Infinity'' in the battle. Jul was subsequently captured by the Kilo-Five black ops team and imprisoned on the Forerunner shield world of Onyx. Jul eventually escaped using one of the shield world's slipspace portals and traveled to the Sangheili colony world of Hesduros which had been cut off from the goings-on in the galaxy since before the Covenant civil war. By portraying his experiences on the shield world in a religious light, Jul was able to win over the inhabitants, but learned that his wife had been killed. Grief-stricken and blaming humanity, Jul discovered the coordinates to the shield world of Requiem on Hesduros and began building up a massive following, forming a new Sangheili-led Covenant. Jul's Covenant eventually found Requiem, but were trapped outside for three years as depicted in the ''Halo 4'' Terminals because the planet required the presence of a Reclaimer to open.\n\nIn ''Halo 4'', the Master Chief arrives at Requiem in the rear half of the ''Forward Unto Dawn'' and comes into conflict with Jul and his forces. The Master Chief's presence causes Requiem to finally open, granting Jul's Covenant access to the planet. Jul eventually leads some of his forces into Requiem's core where the Forerunner known as the Didact is imprisoned. The Didact is able to trick the Master Chief into releasing him and Jul bows down before him. Despite the core's subsequent collapse, Jul manages to escape with his life and allies himself with the Didact against the humans from the ''Infinity''. Jul's alliance with the Didact leaves him with the ability to command the Didact's Promethean soldiers even after the Didact's own defeat. Subsequent to this, Jul brands himself \"the Didact's Hand\" with his status and ability to control the Prometheans giving him even more power and attracting more followers to his cause.\n\nIn ''Spartan Ops'', six months after the Battle of Requiem, the ''Infinity'' returns to Requiem which is still occupied by Jul and his Covenant. The forces of the ''Infinity'' and Jul's forces battle each other for control over the planet while Jul personally leads the attempt to access the [[#Librarian|Librarian]]'s AI which Jul wants to use for the power that the Librarian can give to him. In ''Halo: Escalation'', Jul and Halsey work together while Jul faces a mutiny inside of his own forces. Their mission to access the Absolute Record of Forerunner installations, however, fails.\n\nIn ''[[Halo 5: Guardians]]'', Jul's power has begun to break following all of his defeats and his Prometheans turning against him under the influence of [[Cortana (Halo)|Cortana]]. On the remote world of Kamchatka, Jul attempts to access the Forerunner Domain with the help of Halsey while his loyal forces battle the Prometheans. However, Jul is unaware that Halsey has betrayed his location to the UNSC due to the threat Cortana poses. He is killed by Spartan Jameson Locke in single combat and Jul's Covenant falls apart soon thereafter.\n\n== Forerunner ==\n\n=== 343 Guilty Spark ===\n[[Image:Spark-halo3.jpg|thumb|right|343 Guilty Spark, as he appears in ''Halo&nbsp;3'']]\n343 Guilty Spark (or Guilty Spark or just Spark) (voiced by [[Tim Dadabo]]) is a [[robot]] [[character (arts)|character]] who appears in the original Halo trilogy. 343 Guilty Spark was originally a human named Chakas who was digitized by the Forerunners at the expense of his biological form. Guilty Spark served as the caretaker of the Halo ring Installation 04, where he was an occasional ally and enemy to the Master Chief. He is ultimately severely damaged when he tries to stop Master Chief from activating Installation 08 to stop the threat of the Flood. A fragment of Spark was recovered by the UNSC, and the AI ended up commandeering the ship to seek out the Librarian and bring back his old friends from when he was human.\n\nIn the novel ''Halo: Renegades'', Guilty Spark, now inhabiting the body of a Forerunner armiger robot, is rescued by the salvage crew of the ''Ace of Spades'' after crashing on an isolated planet. Having recovered his sanity and much of his human personality, Spark, as he now chooses to go by, is left horrified by what he became as 343 Guilty Spark. Spark allies with the crew to recover their stolen property from ONI who are after the AI as well and to complete his own mission of finding the Librarian. Succeeding in both, Spark is talked out of his original plan by the Librarian and made to recognize the friends he has made amongst the crew. Given a coordinate key to \"the safe place\" by the Librarian, Spark helps his friends to escape ONI and offers his services to the crew as the shipboard AI for the ''Ace of Spades'' which Spark greatly upgrades using Forerunner technology. The crew dedicates themselves to finding the long-lost ''Spirit of Fire'' while the Librarian indicates to Captain Rion Forge that Spark, who she calls singularly unique due to his ability to evolve so greatly on his own over time, may still have an important role to play in the events to come.\n\nBungie originally wanted Guilty Spark to sound similar to the robot [[C-3PO]].<ref name=\"ttl-dadabointerview\"/> Dadabo noted in an interview that reactions to his character have been hostile, finding Spark highly annoying.<ref name=\"gameinformer-downes/dadabo\" /> He described Spark's character as a \"bastard\" who strings others along in order to accomplish his ends.<ref name=\"ttl-dadabointerview\">{{cite web|date=November 30, 2008|url=http://blog.tiedtheleader.com/article/860/greetings-reclaimer|title=Greetings Reclaimer...|publisher=TiedTheLeader|accessdate=December 4, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205064847/http://blog.tiedtheleader.com/article/860/greetings-reclaimer|archivedate=December 5, 2008}}</ref> An annual [[Halloween]] pumpkin carving contest named ''343 Guilt O'Lantern'' is organized by [[Halo.Bungie.Org]]; both the contest's title and logo use the character's design and name as inspiration.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://nikon.bungie.org/misc/guiltolantern07.html| title=343 Guilt O'Lantern: 2007 Edition| publisher=[[Halo.Bungie.Org]]|year=2007| accessdate=October 17, 2007|author=Staff}}</ref> Gaming site [[GameDaily]] listed Guilty Spark as one of the top \"evil masterminds\" of video games, stating \"If [[HAL-9000]] had any distant relatives, [Guilty Spark would] be closest of kin.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Staff |date=November 29, 2008 |url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-evil-masterminds-of-all-time/?page=11 |title=The top 25 evil masterminds of all time |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |accessdate=December 1, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210075912/http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/galleries/top-25-evil-masterminds-of-all-time/?page=11 |archivedate=December 10, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== 05-032 Mendicant Bias ===\n05-032 Mendicant Bias (\"''Beggar after Knowledge''\" as revealed in ''[[Halo: Cryptum]]'') was the Contender-class Forerunner A.I. charged with organizing Forerunner defense against the Flood. It was later defected by [[Gravemind]] turning it rampant and against the Forerunners, but was eventually defeated after the firing of the Halo array and broken into sections, one of which was taken to [[The Ark (Halo)|the Ark]], while another was left on the Forerunner ship that would eventually be incorporated into the Covenant city of ''High Charity''. It is this section of Mendicant Bias that informs the Covenant [[#High Prophets|Hierarchs]] of the human's descendance from the Forerunners in ''[[Halo: Contact Harvest]]'', prompting the Hierarchs to usurp the Covenant leadership and instigate the Human-Covenant War.\n\nMendicant Bias is first encountered in ''[[Halo 3]]'' on the Ark, as it attempted to communicate with the Master Chief through Terminals, claiming it sought atonement for its defection to the Flood by helping the Spartan and may have been destroyed when the Chief activated the incomplete Halo that the Ark was constructing.<ref name=arkConver>''And so here at the end of my life, I do once again betray a former master. The path ahead is fraught with peril. But I will do all I can to keep it stable \u2013 keep you safe. I'm not so foolish to think this will absolve me of my sins. One life hardly balances billions. But I would have my masters know that I have changed. And you shall be my example.''\u2014Mendicant Bias to John-117.</ref> However, as the Ark survived the firing, albeit badly damaged, Mendicant Bias may have survived as well.\n\n=== Didact ===\nThe Didact, born Shadow-of-Sundered-Star, (voiced by [[Keith Szarabajka]]) is a Forerunner military leader  and the ''Halo 4'''s main antagonist. The Didact developed a deep animosity towards humanity after fighting a war with them that cost him many soldiers and his children. The Didact disagrees with the plan to build the Halo Array to fight the Flood, instead proposing a system of \"shield worlds\" that is ultimately rejected. Going into exile in a kind of stasis within a device known as a Cryptum, he is later awoken by the Forerunner Bornstellar with the help of humans Chakas and Riser, all guided by the Librarian. The Didact imprints his consciousness on Bornstellar, who then becomes the Iso-Didact; when the Ur-Didact is presumed dead after being captured by the Master Builder, Bornstellar assumes the Didact's military role. Unknown to most, the Ur-Didact was actually abandoned in a Flood-infested system where he was captured and tortured by the Gravemind. Though he survived, the Ur-Didact was spurred to more drastic measures in an effort to stop the Flood, forcibly composing humans and turning them into mechanical soldiers. The Librarian incapacitated him and placed him in a Cryptum on his shield world Requiem, hoping that meditation and long exposure to the Domain would amend his motives and heal his mind; however, the activation of the Halos severed the Didact from the Domain, and he spent the next 100 millennia alone, with only his own rage and madness to keep him company.\n\nDuring the events of ''Halo 4'', the Ur-Didact is accidentally released from his Cryptum by the Master Chief and Cortana. He immediately retakes control of the Prometheans and attempts to digitize the population of Earth, but is stopped by Cortana and Master Chief who is made immune to the Composer by an imprint of the Librarian on Requiem. The comic series ''Escalation'' reveals the Didact survived this encounter, but the Spartans of Blue Team stop his plans once again. He is apparently digitized by the Master Chief using several Composers, but the Master Chief considers him contained, not dead.\n\nIn ''Halo: Renegades'', 343 Guilty Spark, formerly Bornstellar's human companion Chakas who once helped release the Ur-Didact from his Cryptum, learns from the Librarian of the Ur-Didact's release from his Cryptum on Requiem. From the Librarian's reaction to his questions, Spark realizes that the Ur-Didact's threat is currently \"not worrisome\" and that the Librarian still hopes for her husband to find peace. However, the Librarian sadly admitted that she believed the Ur-Didact to be beyond redemption.\n\n=== Librarian ===\nThe Librarian (voiced by Lori Tritel) is a highly-ranked Forerunner who is married to the Didact. The Librarian spares humanity from extinction after their war with the Forerunners. She convinces the Forerunner council to use the Halos as preserves for fauna in addition to weapons and manipulates the humans Chakas and Riser as well as the young Forerunner Bornstellar into rescuing her husband from his Cryptum on Earth. She ultimately incapacitates and imprisons the Ur-Didact to stop his plans. While she is presumed to have died when the Halo Array was fired, she uploaded various copies of her personality to aid humanity in assuming the Forerunner's Mantle of Responsibility.\n\nIn ''Halo 4'', the Master Chief encounters one such copy on Requiem where the Librarian explains some of the history of the Didact, the war between the humans and the Forerunners as well as the Composer. The Librarian reveals that the Master Chief is \"the culmination of a thousand lifetimes of planning,\" the Librarian having guided humanity through their genetic code to reach the eventuality that became the Master Chief. However, the Librarian is unable to explain what she was planning for before they are interrupted by the Didact. At the Librarian's urging, the Master Chief permits her to accelerate his evolution in order to grant the Master Chief an immunity to the Composer, allowing the Master Chief to survive the Didact's later firing of the weapon. In ''Spartan Ops'', taking place six months later, both the UNSC and Ju 'Mdama's Covenant splinter faction search Requiem for this copy of the Librarian. Dr. Catherine Halsey manages to access a shrine containing the Librarian who provides Halsey with the Janus Key and directs her to find the Absolute Record. The Librarian helps Fireteam Crimson track Halsey's signal in an effort to rescue Halsey from 'Mdama and Crimson helps the Librarian transmit herself to the Absolute Record. She later appears there in ''Halo: Escalation''.\n\nIn ''Halo: Primordium'', 343 Guilty Spark, once the human Chakas, claims to know where to find the Librarian, suggesting that she has survived. Rescued from an isolated planet by the crew of the salvage ship ''Ace of Spades'' in ''Halo: Renegades'', Spark continues his search for the Librarian, which is ultimately revealed to be a search for another of her copies, not the Librarian herself. In a Forerunner structure on Earth beneath [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], Spark attempts to get the Librarian to help him bring back his friends from when he was human or to join them in the Domain, but the Librarian helps Spark see the folly of his plan. Instead, the Librarian helps Spark recognize the friends he has made amongst the ''Ace of Spades'' crew. Though the Librarian offers Spark the chance to join her in joining the rest of her copies at the Absolute Record, he decides to remain behind with his friends. The Librarian provides Spark with a coordinate key to \"the safe place\" and orders him to \"find what's missing. Fix the path. Right what my kind has turned wrong.\" Before departing, the Librarian seemingly communicates with each member of the crew, telling Captain Rion Forge in particular to look after Spark who is more fragile and important than she could ever know and who might still have a role to play in events to come.\n\n== Flood ==\n=== Gravemind ===\n{{main|Gravemind}}\nGravemind (voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is one of the primary antagonists in the Halo series. The Gravemind is a large, sentient creature of [[Flood (Halo)|Flood]] origin, created by the parasite to serve as its central intelligence once a critical biomass has been achieved. It was introduced during the events of ''Halo 2'', where the creature saves both the [[Master Chief (Halo)|Master Chief]] and [[Arbiter (Halo)|Arbiter]] from their deaths, bringing the two face to face in the bowels of [[Installation 05|Delta Halo]]. Gravemind reveals to the Arbiter that the \"sacred rings\" are actually weapons of last resort; a fact the Master Chief confirms.<ref>'''Gravemind''': Your Prophets have promised you freedom from a doomed existence, but you will find no salvation on this ring. Those who built this place knew what they wrought; do not mistake their intent or all will perish as they did before. / '''Master Chief''': This thing is right. Halo is a weapon.

It is also mentioned in the game's menu that while the Gravemind's \"most recent physical avatar\" was destroyed by the Master Chief, it is \"only a matter of time before it rises again\". Though the Flood released upon the Ark form a Proto-Gravemind and come close to forming a new Gravemind, the Proto-Gravemind is killed by the Banished and the Flood are once again contained by the Banished and the Ark's Sentinels.\n\nDesigned to be a massive, horrifying combination of tentacles and rotting matter,<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Joseph Staten|Staten, Joseph]] |date=September 25, 2007 |title=Halo 2 Developer's Commentary |medium=[[Halo 3 Legendary Edition|''Halo 3'' Legendary Edition]] | time=54:00| publisher=[[Bungie]]}}\u2014'''Staten:''' \"...as originally designed, the Gravemind was this seething mass of corpses right, his teeth were skulls and he talked from the shadows.

It stood as Buenos Aires' tallest building for more than a decade until the construction of the [[Kavanagh Building]] in 1936. Its twin brother, [[Palacio Salvo]], is a building designed and erected in [[Eclecticism in art|Eclectic style]], but of greater height, built by the same architect in Montevideo.\n\nThis building was declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|national historic monument]] in 1997.<ref>[http://infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/40000-44999/43370/norma.htm Decreto 437/97]</ref> Currently, the building has several travel agencies, a Spanish school for foreigners, a store that sells clothes for tango, offices and studios of architects, accountants, and lawyers.\n\n==History==\nItalian architect [[Mario Palanti]] was commissioned to design the building by the empresario Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant who had arrived in Argentina in 1890 and had made a fortune in knitted fabrics. The basic design, in eclectic style, was conceived simultaneously with one for the [[Palacio Salvo]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].\n\nThe Palacio Barolo was designed in accordance with the cosmology of Dante's [[Divine Comedy]], motivated by the architect's admiration for [[Dante Alighieri|Alighieri]]. There are 22 floors, divided into three \"sections\". The basement and ground floor represent hell, floors 1-14 are the purgatory, and 15-22 represent heaven. The building is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall, one meter for each ''canto'' of the Divine Comedy. The lighthouse at the top of the building can be seen all the way in Montevideo, Uruguay. The owner planned to use only 3 floors, and to rent the rest.\n \nWhen completed in 1923 it was the tallest building, not only in the city, but also in the whole of [[South America]]. It remained the city's tallest building until 1935 when, on completion, the [[Kavanagh Building]] acquired this distinction. Today it houses mainly lawyer offices, a Spanish-language school, and a store that sells [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] clothing.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe steel-structured skyscraper measures 100 meters and has 18 floors; each floor has a unique design and ornamentation. Staying with the Divine Comedy (in addition to the meter for each canto), the lighted beacon at the top of the building represents the nine choirs of angels. The structure is topped by a small spire with an ornament depicting the [[Crux|Southern Cross constellation]]. The building is listed in the [[Emporis]] database.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/131587/palacio-barolo-buenos-aires-argentina |title=Palacio Barolo |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Emporis |publisher= |access-date=June 6, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe building's foundations conform to the [[golden ratio]]. The skyscraper was constructed to house Dante's ashes; Barolo believed \"that Europe had begun drifting toward collapse\" and wanted to house them as far away as possible from the Continent.<ref name=atlasobscura>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-barolo |title=Palacio Barolo, A tower devoted to \u2014 and modeled after \u2014 the Divine Comedy  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Atlas Obscura |publisher= |access-date=June 6, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe lobby features a central hall adorned with inscriptions in [[Latin language|Latin]] verse and monster statues.

It stood as Buenos Aires' tallest building for more than a decade until the construction of the [[Kavanagh Building]] in 1936. Its twin brother, [[Palacio Salvo]], is a building designed and erected in [[Eclecticism in art|Eclectic style]], but of greater height, built by the same architect in Montevideo.\n\nThis building was declared a [[List of National Historic Monuments of Argentina|national historic monument]] in 1997.<ref>[http://infoleg.gov.ar/infolegInternet/anexos/40000-44999/43370/norma.htm Decreto 437/97]</ref> Currently, the building has several travel agencies, a Spanish school for foreigners, a store that sells clothes for tango, offices and studios of architects, accountants, and lawyers.\n\n==History==\nItalian architect [[Mario Palanti]] was commissioned to design the building by the empresario Luis Barolo, an Italian immigrant who had arrived in Argentina in 1890 and had made a fortune in knitted fabrics. The basic design, in eclectic style, was conceived simultaneously with one for the [[Palacio Salvo]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].\n\nThe Palacio Barolo was designed in accordance with the cosmology of Dante's [[Divine Comedy]], motivated by the architect's admiration for [[Dante Alighieri|Alighieri]]. There are 22 floors, divided into three \"sections\". The basement and ground floor represent hell, floors 1-14 are the purgatory, and 15-22 represent heaven. The building is {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} tall, one meter for each ''canto'' of the Divine Comedy. The lighthouse at the top of the building can be seen all the way in Montevideo, Uruguay. The owner planned to use only 3 floors, and to rent the rest.\n \nWhen completed in 1923 it was the tallest building, not only in the city, but also in the whole of [[South America]]. It remained the city's tallest building until 1935 when, on completion, the [[Kavanagh Building]] acquired this distinction. Today it houses mainly lawyer offices, a Spanish-language school, and a store that sells [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] clothing.\n\n==Technical details==\nThe steel-structured skyscraper measures 100 meters and has 18 floors; each floor has a unique design and ornamentation. Staying with the Divine Comedy (in addition to the meter for each canto), the lighted beacon at the top of the building represents the nine choirs of angels. The structure is topped by a small spire with an ornament depicting the [[Crux|Southern Cross constellation]]. The building is listed in the [[Emporis]] database.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/131587/palacio-barolo-buenos-aires-argentina |title=Palacio Barolo |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Emporis |publisher= |access-date=June 6, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe building's foundations conform to the [[golden ratio]]. The skyscraper was constructed to house Dante's ashes; Barolo believed \"that Europe had begun drifting toward collapse\" and wanted to house them as far away as possible from the Continent.<ref name=atlasobscura>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/palacio-barolo |title=Palacio Barolo, A tower devoted to \u2014 and modeled after \u2014 the Divine Comedy  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Atlas Obscura |publisher= |access-date=June 6, 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe lobby features a central hall adorned with inscriptions in [[Latin language|Latin]] verse and monster statues.
