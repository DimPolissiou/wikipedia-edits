In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good [[sportsmanship]]. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality.

Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand. Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person's hand. Like a handshake the fist bump may be used to acknowledge a relationship with another person. However, unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings.\n* The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of \"cocoon\".<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title = Handshake: Student's Book: A Course in Communication \n  |publisher = OUP Oxford \n  |date=7 November 1996\n  |isbn = 978-90-5617-910-6\n}}</ref>\n* Another version popular with politicians is a \"photo-op handshake\" in which, after the initial grasp both individuals turn to face present photographers and camera men and stay this way for several seconds.\n* Scouts [[scout handshake|shake hands]] with their left hand as a gesture of trust, a practice which originated when the founder of the movement, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell]], then a British [[cavalry officer]], met an African tribesman.\n*In some areas of [[Africa]], handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation.\n* [[Maasai people|Masai]] men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time.\n* In [[Liberia]], the [[Liberian snap handshake|snap handshake]] is customary in which the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake.\n* In [[Ethiopia]], it is considered rude to use the left hand during a handshake. While greeting the elderly or a person in authority, it is also customary to accompany the handshake with a bow and the left hand supporting the right. This is especially important if it is the first time.\n*In [[Thailand]], handshaking is only done if the traditional \"Wai\" is not offered. The person will offer what's called a \u201cwai,\u201d placing their palms together at chest level and bowing. Return the gesture. If you're a man, greet then with \u201cSawadee-krap.\u201d If you're a woman, say \u201cSawadee-kah\u201d (both mean \u201cHello). <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Germ spreading ==\nHandshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as [[scabies]] are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that [[fist bumps]] and [[high five]]s spread fewer germs than handshakes.<ref name=\"germ-latimes\" /><ref name=\"germ-abcnews\"/>\n\nIn light of the [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]], the dean of medicine at the [[University of Calgary]], [[Tomas Feasby]], suggested that fist bumps may be a \"nice replacement of the handshake\" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus.<ref name=\"germ-cbc\"/>\n\nFollowing a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at [[UCLA]] hospital, decided to test \"a handshake-free zone\" as a method  for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/880856|title=Handshake-Free Zone: Stopping the Spread of Germs in the Hospital|website=Medscape}}</ref> However, UCLA did not allow the ban of the handshakes outright, but they rather suggested other options like fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact [[Namaste]] gestures.

They may serve an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or [[Rural area|rural]] Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Idan Frumin|author2=Ofer Perl|author3=Yaara Endevelt-Shapira|author4=Ami Eisen|author5=Neetai Eshel|author6=Iris Heller|author7=Maya Shemesh|author8=Aharon Ravia|author9=Lee Sela|author10=Anat Arzi|author11=Noam Sobel|title=A social chemosignaling function for human handshaking|journal=eLife |volume=4|date=3 March 2015|doi=10.7554/eLife.05154|pmid=25732039|pmc=4345842}}</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn 1963, Lance Dowson shook 12,500 individuals' hands in {{frac|10|1|2}} hours, in Wrexham, N.

In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good [[sportsmanship]]. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality. If it is done to form an agreement, the agreement is not official until the hands are parted.<ref name=\"GQ\">{{cite web\n  |url = https://www.gq.com/style/style-guy/miscellany/200006/women-hand-shaking\n  |title = Shaking hands with women\n  |work = GQ\n  |publisher = Cond\u00e9 Nast Digital\n  |year = 2000\n  |accessdate = 4 September 2011\n}}</ref>\n\nUnless health issues or local [[tradition|custom]]s dictate otherwise, a handshake is made usually with bare hands.

Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand. Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person's hand. Like a handshake the fist bump may be used to acknowledge a relationship with another person. However, unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings.\n* The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of \"cocoon\".<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title = Handshake: Student's Book: A Course in Communication \n  |publisher = OUP Oxford \n  |date=7 November 1996\n  |isbn = 978-90-5617-910-6\n}}</ref>\n* Another version popular with politicians is a \"photo-op handshake\" in which, after the initial grasp both individuals turn to face present photographers and camera men and stay this way for several seconds.\n* Scouts [[scout handshake|shake hands]] with their left hand as a gesture of trust, a practice which originated when the founder of the movement, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell]], then a British [[cavalry officer]], met an African tribesman.\n*In some areas of [[Africa]], handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation.\n* [[Maasai people|Masai]] men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time.\n* In [[Liberia]], the [[Liberian snap handshake|snap handshake]] is customary in which the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake.\n* In [[Ethiopia]], it is considered rude to use the left hand during a handshake. While greeting the elderly or a person in authority, it is also customary to accompany the handshake with a bow and the left hand supporting the right. This is especially important if it is the first time.\n*In [[Thailand]], handshaking is only done if the traditional \"Wai\" is not offered. The person will offer what's called a \u201cwai,\u201d placing their palms together at chest level and bowing. Return the gesture. If you're a man, greet then with \u201cSawadee-krap.\u201d If you're a woman, say \u201cSawadee-kah\u201d (both mean \u201cHello). <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Germ spreading ==\nHandshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as [[scabies]] are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that [[fist bumps]] and [[high five]]s spread fewer germs than handshakes.<ref name=\"germ-latimes\" /><ref name=\"germ-abcnews\"/>\n\nIn light of the [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]], the dean of medicine at the [[University of Calgary]], [[Tomas Feasby]], suggested that fist bumps may be a \"nice replacement of the handshake\" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus.<ref name=\"germ-cbc\"/>\n\nFollowing a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at [[UCLA]] hospital, decided to test \"a handshake-free zone\" as a method  for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/880856|title=Handshake-Free Zone: Stopping the Spread of Germs in the Hospital|website=Medscape}}</ref> However, UCLA did not allow the ban of the handshakes outright, but they rather suggested other options like fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact [[Namaste]] gestures. Other sources suggest raised brows, smiling, [[w:Thai_greeting|wai bow]], two claps, hand over heart, [[w:American_Sign_Language|sign language]] wave, or the [[w:shaka|shaka]] sign.<ref>Stop shaking hands.

They may serve an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or [[Rural area|rural]] Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Idan Frumin|author2=Ofer Perl|author3=Yaara Endevelt-Shapira|author4=Ami Eisen|author5=Neetai Eshel|author6=Iris Heller|author7=Maya Shemesh|author8=Aharon Ravia|author9=Lee Sela|author10=Anat Arzi|author11=Noam Sobel|title=A social chemosignaling function for human handshaking|journal=eLife |volume=4|date=3 March 2015|doi=10.7554/eLife.05154|pmid=25732039|pmc=4345842}}</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn 1963, Lance Dowson shook 12,500 individuals' hands in {{frac|10|1|2}} hours, in Wrexham, N.

Those who tested positive, but who were not drafted, will undergo a 13-day rehabilitation regimen in their home provinces.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\" />  Those who do not pass the physical and mental health examinations are promptly discharged. The enlisting volunteers then choose the service branch (Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, or Royal Thai Air Force) and the reporting date of their choice, and receive documentation of the year's draft selection, and an enlistment order to report for basic training with notification details of the reporting time and location. The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure.

By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialised training.\n\nFormal honours and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition. The government grants numerous awards, and outstanding acts of heroism, courage, and meritorious service receive prompt recognition.\n\n===Officer and enlisted rank insignia===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Thailand}}\n|}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Thailand}}\n|}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Thai soldiers and Type 85 APCs during 2010 Thai political protests.jpg|RTA troops take cover next to a [[Type 85 AFV]] near the Red Shirt barricade at [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]]\nFile:2010 0513 silom 11.JPG|Soldiers with riot shields at a barricade on [[Silom Road]] and Soi Convent\nFile:2010 0513 saladaeng station 02.JPG|Soldiers beneath Saladaeng BTS station, Silom Road\nFile:2010 0513 silom 07.JPG|Soldiers and a helmeted journalist buy water and food, Silom Road\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 02.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, [[Chiang Mai]], days after the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 01.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, Chiang Mai\nFile:Defense.gov News Photo 110211-M-VX252-046 - Royal Thai and U.S. Marines discuss how to eliminate hostile forces firing on them from a building during a mock mechanized raid on Feb. 11 2011.jpg|[[Royal Thai Marine Corps|Royal Thai]] and [[US Marines]] eliminating hostile forces during a mock raid, 11 February 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-027.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces service member clears a building during a mock raid, [[Cobra Gold]], 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-017.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces clear a building during a mock raid, Cobra Gold, 2011\nFile:Thai service members participate in a rivierine subject matter expert exchange with U.S. Sailors in the Nakhon Nayok River as part of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2013 in Thailand June 8 130608-N-RG360-224.jpg|Thai troops in a riverine exercise with US sailors on the Nakhon Nayok River, [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT), 8 June 2013\nFile:Rtaf All FlighterJet.jpg|RTAF fighters: [[JAS 39 Gripen]], [[F-16|F-16 ADF]], [[Northrop F-5|F-5]], [[Alpha jet]], [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] and [[SAAB-340]]\nFile:HTMS Naresuan in Hong Kong.JPG|RTN frigate [[HTMS Naresuan]] FFG-421 moored in [[Victoria Harbour]], Hong Kong\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Border Patrol Police]]\n* [[King's Guard (Thailand)]]\n* [[List of flags of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]]\n* [[Military ranks of the Thai armed forces]]\n* [[Royal Thai Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Thai Police]]\n* [[Territorial Defence Student]]\n* [[Thahan Phran]]\n* [[Underwater Demolition Assault Unit]]\n* [[Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{loc}}\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Osornprasop, Sutayut. \"Thailand and the Secret War in Laos\", 1960\u20131974 (in) Albert Lau (ed.), ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War''.

The enlistment draft is held in early-April annually. On the draftee selection day, those who are called up for the draft report to their selection center at 07:00.

Over 3,000 of those who tested positive will serve in the military where they will receive drug rehabilitation treatment. Those who tested positive, but who were not drafted, will undergo a 13-day rehabilitation regimen in their home provinces.<ref name=\"BP-20180420\" />  Those who do not pass the physical and mental health examinations are promptly discharged. The enlisting volunteers then choose the service branch (Royal Thai Army, Royal Thai Navy, or Royal Thai Air Force) and the reporting date of their choice, and receive documentation of the year's draft selection, and an enlistment order to report for basic training with notification details of the reporting time and location. The enlistees are then dismissed for the day until the enlistment day that they have to report for basic training.\n\nAfter the enlisting volunteers are dismissed for the day, the lottery process begins. Each selection center has a set quota, and the number of individuals conscripted through the lottery at each selection center will be the quota subtracted by the number of volunteers. Those who choose to proceed with the lottery then undergo the same physical and mental health exams as the volunteers, with the same procedure for dismissal for those who do not pass the health exams. Each man who stays for the lottery draws a card out of an opaque box. Those who draw a black card are discharged from their military service requirement and are issued the letter of exemption. Those who draw a red card are required to serve in the branch starting from the induction date as specified on the card. Those with higher educational qualification can request reduction of service obligation. In 2018, the Royal Thai Armed Forces called up more than 500,000 men for selection. The combined quota was approximately 104,000 men: 80,000 men for the [[Royal Thai Army]], 16,000 for the [[Royal Thai Navy]], and 8,700 for the [[Royal Thai Air Force]]. On selection day, there were 44,800 men who volunteered to serve. After accepting the volunteers and dismissing those who were deemed ineligible, there remained a quota of approximately 60,000 slots for approximately 450,000 men who entered the draft lottery, i.e., the overall probability of drawing a red card in the lottery was approximately 13%.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nanuam|first1=Wassana|title=Image, pay draw volunteers for armed service| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1446206/image-pay-draw-volunteers-for-armed-service|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=15 April 2018}}</ref> In 2017, 103,097 men participated in the draft between 1\u201312 April. The armed forces needed only 77,000 conscripts per annum. It has not been uncommon for some selection centers to not have to conduct the balloting lottery at all, because the quota were fortunately met by the enlisting volunteers. In such instances, those who decided not to volunteer and stay for the lottery were all issued with a certificate of exemption.\n\nLength of service varies by whether a person volunteers to enlist and their educational background. The advantageous benefit of serving a shortened period of time are of course given to the volunteers who voluntarily enlist. Those without a high school diploma are required to serve 2 years regardless of whether they volunteer. High school graduates who volunteer are required to serve one year, while high school graduates who draw red cards are required to serve two years. Those with associate degree or higher who volunteer are required to serve for six months, while those with associate degree or higher who draw red cards can request reduction in time of service to one year. University students can request for deferment of conscription until they are awarded their diploma or reach 26 years of age.\n\nAll conscripts are in the grade of Private / Seaman / Aircraftman (OR-1) for the entire length of service, regardless of educational qualification. There are wage increases after completion of basic training and with time-in-grade.

It refers to the military forces of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] and the early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] in chronological order. The Siamese army was one of the dominant armed forces in Southeast Asia. As Thailand has never been colonized by a European power, the Royal Thai Armed Forces boasts one of the longest and uninterrupted military traditions in Asia.\n\nThe army was organized into a small standing army of a few thousand, which defended the capital and the palace, and a much larger [[conscription]]-based wartime army. Conscription was based on the \"ahmudan\" system, which required local chiefs to supply, in times of war, a predetermined quota of men from their jurisdiction on the basis of population. The wartime army also consisted of [[war elephants|elephantry]], [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[navy|naval]] units.\n\nIn 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King [[Mongkut]], who needed a [[Europe]]an trained military force to thwart any Western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King [[Chulalongkorn]], a permanent military command in the [[Kalahom|''Kalahom'' Department]] was established. The office of ''Kalahom'', as a permanent office of war department, was established by King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431\u20131488) in the mid-15th century during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080624075931/http://aarm2007.rta.mi.th/history_royal_th.htm The Royal Thai Army.

However, most these were within [[Southeast Asia]]. The only three foreign incursions into Thai territory were the [[Franco-Siamese War]], the [[Japanese invasion of Thailand]] in December 1941, and in the 1980s with [[Vietnam]]ese incursions into Thailand that led to several battles with the Thai Army. Operations on foreign territory were either territorial wars (such as the [[Laos Civil War]]) or conflicts mandated by the [[United Nations]].\n\n====Franco-Siamese War (1893)====\nWith the rapid expansion of the [[French Third Republic|French]] [[French colonial empire|Empire]] into [[Indochina]], conflicts necessarily occurred. War became inevitable when a French mission led by [[Auguste Pavie]] to King [[Chulalongkorn]] to try to bring [[Laos]] under French rule ended in failure. The French colonialists invaded Siam from the northeast and sent two warships to fight their way past the river forts and train their guns on the Grand Palace in [[Bangkok]] (the [[Paknam Incident]]). They also declared a blockade of Bangkok, which almost brought them into conflict with the British Navy. Siam was forced to accept the French [[ultimatum]] and surrendered Laos to France, also allowing French troops to occupy the Thai province of [[Chantaburi]] for several decades.<ref>[http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html Legacy of the Paknam clash] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421214229/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/11/02/headlines/data/headlines_19040213.html |date=21 April 2009 }}. nationmultimedia.com. 2 November 2005</ref>\n\n[[Image:Firstworldwar.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The Siamese Expeditionary Force in Paris, 1919.]]\n\n====World War I (1917\u20131918)====\n{{main|Siam in World War I}}\n\nKing [[Vajiravudh]] on 22 July 1917 declared war on the [[Central Powers]] and joined the [[Entente Powers]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

The war also bolstered Phibun's program of promoting Thai nationalism.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090731201111/http://www.geocities.com/thailandwwii/nationalism.html Nation-building and the Pursuit of Nationalism under Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram]</ref> The war ended indecisively, with Thai victories on land and a naval defeat at sea. However, the disputed territories in French Indochina were ceded to Thailand.\n\n====World War II (1942\u20131945)====\n{{main|Thailand in World War II}}\nTo attack [[British India]], [[British Burma]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]], the Japanese Empire needed to use bases in Thailand. By playing the British Empire against Japan, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram was able to maintain a degree of neutrality for some time. However, this ended in the early hours of 8 December 1941, when Japan launched a [[Japanese invasion of Thailand|surprise attack]] on Thailand at nine places along the coastline and from French Indo-China. The greatly outnumbered Thai forces put up resistance, but were soon overwhelmed. By 07:30, Phibun ordered an end to hostilities, though resistance continued for at least another day until all units could be notified. Phibun signed an [[armistice]] with Japan that allowed the empire to move its troops through Thai territory. Impressed by Japan's easy defeat of the British military in Malaya, Phibun formally made Thailand part of the [[Axis powers|Axis]] by declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, though the Regent refused to sign it in the young king's name. (The Thai ambassador to Washington refused to deliver the declaration, and the United States continued to consider Thailand an occupied country.) An active and foreign-assisted underground resistance movement, the [[Free Thai]], was largely successful and helped Thailand to rehabilitate after the war and be treated as an occupied nation rather than a defeated enemy.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+th0031) Thailand].

Lcweb2.loc.gov. Retrieved on 18 January 2012.</ref> Many Thai military uniforms reflect historical foreign influences. For example, most of the distinctive service uniforms were patterned on those of the US, but lower ranking enlisted navy personnel wear uniforms resembling those of their French counterparts. The early influence of British advisers to the Thai royal court and the historical role of the military in royal pomp and ceremony contributed to the splendor of formal dress uniforms worn by high-ranking officers and guards of honour on ceremonial occasions.\n\n[[File:Royal Thai Army Band in the royal guard dress.jpg|thumb|230px|The [[Royal Thai Army]] Band in uniforms of various [[King's Guard (Thailand)|royal guards]] unit, ranked in the shape of the [[flag of Thailand]]]]\n\nThe rank structures of the three armed services are similar to those of the respective branches of the US Armed Forces, although the Thai system has fewer NCO and warrant officer designations. The king, as head of state and constitutional head of the armed forces, commissions all officers. Appointments to NCO ranks are authorised by the minister of defence. In theory, the authority and responsibilities of officers of various ranks correspond to those of their US counterparts. However, because of a perennial surplus of senior officers\u2014in 1987 there were some 600 generals and admirals in a total force of about 273,000\u2014Thai staff positions are often held by officers of higher rank than would be the case in the US or other Western military establishments.\n\nThai military personnel are highly conscious of rank distinctions and of the duties, obligations, and benefits they entail. Relationships among officers of different grades and among officers, NCOs, and the enlisted ranks are governed by military tradition in a society where observance of differences in status are highly formalised. The social distance between officers and NCOs is widened by the fact that officers usually are college or military academy graduates, while most NCOs have not gone beyond secondary school. There is a wider gap between officers and conscripts, most of whom have even less formal education, service experience, or specialised training.\n\nFormal honours and symbols of merit occupy an important place in Thai military tradition. The government grants numerous awards, and outstanding acts of heroism, courage, and meritorious service receive prompt recognition.\n\n===Officer and enlisted rank insignia===\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OF/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OF/Thailand}}\n|}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Blank}}\n{{Ranks and insignia of Non NATO Armies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Navies/OR/Thailand}}\n{{Ranks and Insignia of Non NATO Air Forces/OR/Thailand}}\n|}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Thai soldiers and Type 85 APCs during 2010 Thai political protests.jpg|RTA troops take cover next to a [[Type 85 AFV]] near the Red Shirt barricade at [[Chulalongkorn Hospital]]\nFile:2010 0513 silom 11.JPG|Soldiers with riot shields at a barricade on [[Silom Road]] and Soi Convent\nFile:2010 0513 saladaeng station 02.JPG|Soldiers beneath Saladaeng BTS station, Silom Road\nFile:2010 0513 silom 07.JPG|Soldiers and a helmeted journalist buy water and food, Silom Road\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 02.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, [[Chiang Mai]], days after the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]]\nFile:2014 0526 Thailand coup Chang Phueak Gate Chiang Mai 01.jpg|Troops at Chang Phueak Gate, Chiang Mai\nFile:Defense.gov News Photo 110211-M-VX252-046 - Royal Thai and U.S. Marines discuss how to eliminate hostile forces firing on them from a building during a mock mechanized raid on Feb. 11 2011.jpg|[[Royal Thai Marine Corps|Royal Thai]] and [[US Marines]] eliminating hostile forces during a mock raid, 11 February 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-027.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces service member clears a building during a mock raid, [[Cobra Gold]], 2011\nFile:USMC-110213-M-GT770-017.jpg|Royal Thai Special Forces clear a building during a mock raid, Cobra Gold, 2011\nFile:Thai service members participate in a rivierine subject matter expert exchange with U.S. Sailors in the Nakhon Nayok River as part of Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) 2013 in Thailand June 8 130608-N-RG360-224.jpg|Thai troops in a riverine exercise with US sailors on the Nakhon Nayok River, [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT), 8 June 2013\nFile:Rtaf All FlighterJet.jpg|RTAF fighters: [[JAS 39 Gripen]], [[F-16|F-16 ADF]], [[Northrop F-5|F-5]], [[Alpha jet]], [[Aero L-39 Albatros|L-39]] and [[SAAB-340]]\nFile:HTMS Naresuan in Hong Kong.JPG|RTN frigate [[HTMS Naresuan]] FFG-421 moored in [[Victoria Harbour]], Hong Kong\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Border Patrol Police]]\n* [[King's Guard (Thailand)]]\n* [[List of flags of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]]\n* [[Military ranks of the Thai armed forces]]\n* [[Royal Thai Air Force]]\n* [[Royal Thai Police]]\n* [[Territorial Defence Student]]\n* [[Thahan Phran]]\n* [[Underwater Demolition Assault Unit]]\n* [[Volunteer Defense Corps (Thailand)]]\n\n==References==\n{{loc}}\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Osornprasop, Sutayut. \"Thailand and the Secret War in Laos\", 1960\u20131974 (in) Albert Lau (ed.), ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War''.

The film also stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Allison Janney]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Maya Rudolph]], with [[Rob Corddry]], [[Amanda Peet]], Faxon, and Rash in supporting roles.\n\nFaxon and Rash conceived the film in the early 2000s, however it spent several years in [[development hell]] before funding could be secured. Eventually, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] (the same studio who distributed other independent films such as ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'') agreed to distribute the film. Filming lasted several months during the Summer of 2012.

Trent emotionally belittles Duncan, frequently making comments and gestures that are condescending and rude to him. Steph follows suit in attitude towards him and is spoiled by Trent. On the way to the beach house, Trent asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of one to ten; Duncan rates himself a six while Trent tells him he thinks Duncan is a three. They arrive at the beach house and are greeted by the neighbors: the gregarious, hard-drinking Betty, her children Susanna and Peter, and married couple Kip and Joan. Later that evening, Duncan and Susanna have an awkward conversation from their adjacent porches.\n\nDuncan discovers a small [[Step-through frame|girl's bicycle]] in the garage of the beach house and uses it to begin exploring the town. At a pizza restaurant, he runs into the staff of [[Water Wizz]], the local [[water park]]. He meets Owen, who is playing ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and eventually Owen takes Duncan under his wing and shows him around the park. Duncan meets the park's colorful, rag-tag group of employees: Caitlin, Lewis, and Roddy. Several kids at the water park speak reverently of a legendary pass in the tube slide, wondering how it could have been done. Owen hires Duncan for odd jobs at Water Wizz.\n\nOutside the park, Duncan is continually neglected by his mother, Pam, who indulges in drinking, staying out at night, and smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] with other adult vacationers. At a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] cookout, Susanna sees that he is upset about this and invites him to go hunting for [[ghost crab]]s with her and Peter, where she talks about her absent father and helps Duncan to open up. Later that night, Duncan witnesses Trent and Joan kissing by the side of the house, but does not reveal what he saw.\n\nPam begins to suspect Trent and Joan are having an affair, but Trent convinces her nothing is going on. Later, Duncan confronts Pam in front of friends and neighbors and tells her to face up to Trent's affair and get rid of him. Trent in retaliation tells Duncan his divorced father does not want him. Duncan stalks away. Susanna follows him and comforts Duncan out on the beach. Duncan attempts to kiss Susanna, but she moves away, which makes him become even more upset. Accompanied by Peter, Duncan sneaks away to Water Wizz where Owen is throwing a going away party for Lewis.\n\nAfter spending all night with his friends at Water Wizz, Duncan is still at the park the next morning, refusing to leave. Owen confronts him and asks him why he does not want to go home. Duncan opens up to Owen about his relationship with Trent and how the water park is the only place where he feels happy and accepted. Owen sympathizes with Duncan's problems.\n\nWhen Duncan arrives back at the beach house, Pam tells him they are leaving with Trent and Steph. Betty and her kids arrive to say their goodbyes. Susanna finally kisses Duncan. When Trent stops for gas on their way out of town, Duncan jumps out of the station wagon and runs to Water Wizz, followed by his mother, then Trent and Steph. Duncan tells Owen and the other employees that he has to leave and tells Owen to follow him. He takes Owen to the Devil's Peak slide, and Duncan becomes the first person to ever pass someone in the water slide while the rest of the park watches. After finally introducing Owen to his mother, Duncan says goodbye to everyone at the park. Owen tells Pam she has a great kid, and introduces himself to Trent as \"a good friend of the three\". Trent, Steph, Pam and Duncan regroup in the car, where Pam finally stands up for herself as they head out of town. Pam climbs to the way, way back of the car where Duncan is sitting and they share a smile as Trent's protests are heard in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam James]] as Duncan\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Trent Ramsey\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Pam\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Owen\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Betty Thompson\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as Susanna Thompson\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Caitlin\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Kip\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Joan\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Lewis\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Roddy\n* [[Robert Capron]] as Kyle\n* [[River Alexander]] as Peter Thompson\n* [[Ava Deluca-Verley]] as Katy\n* [[Zoe Levin]] as Steph Ramsey\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Anchor|Release|Box office}}\nThe film had its premiere screening at the 2013 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name=\"filmguide.sundance.org\" /> The film became one of the most financially successful films to come out of the festival that year, outperforming well-known entries and Oscar-nominated films from the previous year.<ref name=\"thewrap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/how-have-those-sundance-pick-ups-performed-box-office-109211|title=Sundance 2013 Pickups Are Outperforming Last Year's Crop |work=[[TheWrap]]|date=August 8, 2013|first=Todd|last=Cunningham|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> It was released on July 5, 2013 in 19 theaters and surpassed box office expectations, averaging an impressive $30,263 per screen and grossing $525,000 total for the weekend.<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/specialty-box-office-way-way-back-scores-strong-debut-midnight-tops-sunrise-and-sunset|first=Peter|last=Knegt|date=July 8, 2013|title=Specialty Box Office: 'Way, Way Back' Scores Strong Debut; 'Midnight' Tops 'Sunrise' and 'Sunset'|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> On July 15, 2013, the film was added to an additional 60 theaters, and grossed $1,110,000.

The film stars [[Liam James]] as Duncan, a shy 14-year-old who goes on summer vacation to [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] with his mother and her abusive boyfriend. The film also stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Allison Janney]], [[AnnaSophia Robb]], [[Sam Rockwell]], and [[Maya Rudolph]], with [[Rob Corddry]], [[Amanda Peet]], Faxon, and Rash in supporting roles.\n\nFaxon and Rash conceived the film in the early 2000s, however it spent several years in [[development hell]] before funding could be secured. Eventually, [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] (the same studio who distributed other independent films such as ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'' and ''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]'') agreed to distribute the film. Filming lasted several months during the Summer of 2012. It premiered at the [[2013 Sundance Film Festival]]<ref name=\"filmguide.sundance.org\">{{cite web|url=http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13111/the_way_way_back |title=The Way, Way Back |publisher=[[The Sundance Institute]] |work=[[Sundance Film Festival]] |accessdate=March 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230211222/http://filmguide.sundance.org/film/13111/the_way_way_back |archive-date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref> and had a wider release on July 5, 2013, where it received positive reviews and was a box office success, grossing $26.9 million against its $5 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nFourteen-year-old Duncan from [[Albany, New York]] reluctantly goes on summer vacation to a beach house in a small seaside town near [[Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] with his mother, Pam; her wealthy boyfriend, Trent; and Trent's stuck up daughter, Steph. Trent emotionally belittles Duncan, frequently making comments and gestures that are condescending and rude to him. Steph follows suit in attitude towards him and is spoiled by Trent. On the way to the beach house, Trent asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of one to ten; Duncan rates himself a six while Trent tells him he thinks Duncan is a three. They arrive at the beach house and are greeted by the neighbors: the gregarious, hard-drinking Betty, her children Susanna and Peter, and married couple Kip and Joan. Later that evening, Duncan and Susanna have an awkward conversation from their adjacent porches.\n\nDuncan discovers a small [[Step-through frame|girl's bicycle]] in the garage of the beach house and uses it to begin exploring the town. At a pizza restaurant, he runs into the staff of [[Water Wizz]], the local [[water park]]. He meets Owen, who is playing ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and eventually Owen takes Duncan under his wing and shows him around the park. Duncan meets the park's colorful, rag-tag group of employees: Caitlin, Lewis, and Roddy. Several kids at the water park speak reverently of a legendary pass in the tube slide, wondering how it could have been done. Owen hires Duncan for odd jobs at Water Wizz.\n\nOutside the park, Duncan is continually neglected by his mother, Pam, who indulges in drinking, staying out at night, and smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] with other adult vacationers. At a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] cookout, Susanna sees that he is upset about this and invites him to go hunting for [[ghost crab]]s with her and Peter, where she talks about her absent father and helps Duncan to open up. Later that night, Duncan witnesses Trent and Joan kissing by the side of the house, but does not reveal what he saw.\n\nPam begins to suspect Trent and Joan are having an affair, but Trent convinces her nothing is going on. Later, Duncan confronts Pam in front of friends and neighbors and tells her to face up to Trent's affair and get rid of him. Trent in retaliation tells Duncan his divorced father does not want him. Duncan stalks away. Susanna follows him and comforts Duncan out on the beach. Duncan attempts to kiss Susanna, but she moves away, which makes him become even more upset. Accompanied by Peter, Duncan sneaks away to Water Wizz where Owen is throwing a going away party for Lewis.\n\nAfter spending all night with his friends at Water Wizz, Duncan is still at the park the next morning, refusing to leave. Owen confronts him and asks him why he does not want to go home. Duncan opens up to Owen about his relationship with Trent and how the water park is the only place where he feels happy and accepted. Owen sympathizes with Duncan's problems.\n\nWhen Duncan arrives back at the beach house, Pam tells him they are leaving with Trent and Steph. Betty and her kids arrive to say their goodbyes. Susanna finally kisses Duncan. When Trent stops for gas on their way out of town, Duncan jumps out of the station wagon and runs to Water Wizz, followed by his mother, then Trent and Steph. Duncan tells Owen and the other employees that he has to leave and tells Owen to follow him. He takes Owen to the Devil's Peak slide, and Duncan becomes the first person to ever pass someone in the water slide while the rest of the park watches. After finally introducing Owen to his mother, Duncan says goodbye to everyone at the park. Owen tells Pam she has a great kid, and introduces himself to Trent as \"a good friend of the three\". Trent, Steph, Pam and Duncan regroup in the car, where Pam finally stands up for herself as they head out of town. Pam climbs to the way, way back of the car where Duncan is sitting and they share a smile as Trent's protests are heard in the background.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Liam James]] as Duncan\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Trent Ramsey\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Pam\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Owen\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Betty Thompson\n* [[AnnaSophia Robb]] as Susanna Thompson\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Caitlin\n* [[Rob Corddry]] as Kip\n* [[Amanda Peet]] as Joan\n* [[Jim Rash]] as Lewis\n* [[Nat Faxon]] as Roddy\n* [[Robert Capron]] as Kyle\n* [[River Alexander]] as Peter Thompson\n* [[Ava Deluca-Verley]] as Katy\n* [[Zoe Levin]] as Steph Ramsey\n}}\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n{{Anchor|Release|Box office}}\nThe film had its premiere screening at the 2013 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name=\"filmguide.sundance.org\" /> The film became one of the most financially successful films to come out of the festival that year, outperforming well-known entries and Oscar-nominated films from the previous year.<ref name=\"thewrap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/how-have-those-sundance-pick-ups-performed-box-office-109211|title=Sundance 2013 Pickups Are Outperforming Last Year's Crop |work=[[TheWrap]]|date=August 8, 2013|first=Todd|last=Cunningham|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> It was released on July 5, 2013 in 19 theaters and surpassed box office expectations, averaging an impressive $30,263 per screen and grossing $525,000 total for the weekend.<ref name=\"indiewire\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/specialty-box-office-way-way-back-scores-strong-debut-midnight-tops-sunrise-and-sunset|first=Peter|last=Knegt|date=July 8, 2013|title=Specialty Box Office: 'Way, Way Back' Scores Strong Debut; 'Midnight' Tops 'Sunrise' and 'Sunset'|work=[[IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|accessdate=March 23, 2014}}</ref> On July 15, 2013, the film was added to an additional 60 theaters, and grossed $1,110,000.

All of the moms on the Irreplaceables team then criticise Brynn's solo calling her a \"baby\", and the ALDC moms criticise the Irreplaceables for pulling their solos, calling them \"cowardly\". The Irreplaceables' moms then criticise Abby for recycling an old dance, and the ALDC moms criticise Aisha's routine, claiming it was inappropriate. Abby walks out, disgusted by Aisha's routine and doesn't return. Yolanda  is upset that the one time Elliana beats Lilliana, she is absent and unable to see it. The Irreplaceables' moms then mock Brynn when her solo doesn't place at all, but karma soon when comes around when the ALDC win their division and the Irreplaceables don't win theirs. Ashlee says that the Irreplaceables' moms are \"disgusting\", which make them criticise Brynn even more, causing her to bite back at them.

The group routine is about protesting against Abby, and the moms and girls are all excited.\n\nMeanwhile at the ALDC, Abby's employee Miranda choreographs a group number which is a tribute to Abby and Gianna. The moms are hoping that this tribute will make Abby return and work with the girls again. \n\nAt competition, the Irreplaceables' moms mock the tribute for its title, but the ALDC moms don't retaliate. Kendall and Camryn's duet wins, and Nia and Chloe's places 3rd. The Irreplaceables' group routine gets 5th overall, and the ALDC's tribute gets 2nd overall. Abby texts Miranda and fires her for choreographing a routine behind her back, and Ashlee and Brynn leave the team due to the Irreplaceables' moms verbally abusing them online.

Eisele]] were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7|Apollo{{nbsp}}7]] plus an extramarital affair) and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of a lack of qualified manpower in the [[Chief of the Astronaut Office|Astronaut Office]] at the time the assignment needed to be made. Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (which was eventually cut down to only the [[Skylab]] component) and not a lunar mission.<ref>[[#Slayton & Cassutt|Slayton & Cassutt 1994]], p. 236</ref>\n\n==Objectives==\n{| {{Table|class=floatright}}\n|+ Comparison of LM weights\n|-\n! !!

Apollo 10 was the first mission to carry a [[color television]] camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV transmissions from space.\n\nAfter reaching lunar orbit three days later, Young remained in the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) ''Charlie Brown'' while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM ''Snoopy'' and flew it separately. The LM crew performed the descent orbit insertion maneuver by firing their descent engine, and tested their craft's landing radar as they approached the {{convert|50000|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} altitude where the subsequent Apollo 11 mission would begin powered descent to actually land on the Moon. They surveyed the future Apollo 11 landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]], then jettisoned the descent stage and fired the [[Ascent Propulsion System|engine]] of the ascent stage to return to ''Charlie Brown'' Command Module. The descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually may have crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field. Its location is unknown as it was not tracked.\n\nDuring descent stage separation, the lunar module began to roll unexpectedly because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{YouTube|id=fsObsxU08ys|title=\"Astronaut Gene Cernan Interview on Apollo 10 (December 23, 2009)\"|link=no}}</ref> The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM.

It was on Apollo 10 that John Young became the first human to fly solo around the Moon, while Stafford and Cernan flew the LM in lunar orbit as part of the preparations for Apollo 11. Young was also backup commander of [[Apollo 13]] and Apollo 17 and Cernan was backup commander of Apollo 14.\n\nThe Apollo 10 crew are also the humans who have traveled the farthest away from home, some {{convert|408950|km|nmi|sp=us}} from their homes and families in [[Houston]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-06/far-away-from-home |title=Far Away From Home |last=Holtkamp |first=Gerhard |date=June 6, 2009 |work=SpaceTimeDreamer |publisher=SciLogs |type=Blog |accessdate=20 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111031132720/http://www.scilogs.eu/en/blog/spacetimedreamer/2009-06-06/far-away-from-home |archivedate=October 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> While most Apollo missions orbited the Moon at the same {{convert|111|km|nmi|sp=us}} from the lunar surface, the distance between the Earth and Moon varies by about {{convert|43000|km|nmi|sp=us}}, between [[perigee]] and [[apogee]], throughout each lunar month, and the Earth's rotation makes the distance to Houston vary by another {{convert|12000|km|nmi|sp=us}} each day. The Apollo 10 crew reached the farthest point in their orbit around the far side of the Moon at about the same time Earth's rotation put Houston nearly a full Earth diameter away.<ref>[[#Glenday|Glenday 2010]], p. 13</ref>\n\nBy the normal rotation in place during Apollo, the backup crew would have been scheduled to fly on Apollo 13. However, [[Alan Shepard]], then number two at the [[Chief of the Astronaut Office|Astronaut Office]], gave himself the Apollo 13 command slot instead. [[Gordon Cooper|L. Gordon Cooper Jr.]], Commander of the Apollo 10 backup crew, was enraged and resigned from NASA. [[Deke Slayton]] also removed [[Donn F. Eisele]] from the crew due to the personal misconduct and a professional misconduct in the [[Apollo 7]] mission and was replaced by [[Stuart Roosa]]. Later,Shepard's crew was forced to switch places with [[Jim Lovell]]'s tentative [[Apollo 14]] crew.<ref>[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 2007]], pp. 347\u201348</ref>\n\n[[Deke Slayton]] wrote in his memoirs that Cooper and [[Donn F. Eisele]] were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training, and Eisele for incidents aboard [[Apollo 7|Apollo{{nbsp}}7]] plus an extramarital affair) and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of a lack of qualified manpower in the [[Chief of the Astronaut Office|Astronaut Office]] at the time the assignment needed to be made. Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he did not. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (which was eventually cut down to only the [[Skylab]] component) and not a lunar mission.<ref>[[#Slayton & Cassutt|Slayton & Cassutt 1994]], p. 236</ref>\n\n==Objectives==\n{| {{Table|class=floatright}}\n|+ Comparison of LM weights\n|-\n! !!

Apollo 10 was the first mission to carry a [[color television]] camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV transmissions from space.\n\nAfter reaching lunar orbit three days later, Young remained in the [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) ''Charlie Brown'' while Stafford and Cernan entered the LM ''Snoopy'' and flew it separately. The LM crew performed the descent orbit insertion maneuver by firing their descent engine, and tested their craft's landing radar as they approached the {{convert|50000|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} altitude where the subsequent Apollo 11 mission would begin powered descent to actually land on the Moon. They surveyed the future Apollo 11 landing site in the [[Sea of Tranquility]], then jettisoned the descent stage and fired the [[Ascent Propulsion System|engine]] of the ascent stage to return to ''Charlie Brown'' Command Module. The descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually may have crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field. Its location is unknown as it was not tracked.\n\nDuring descent stage separation, the lunar module began to roll unexpectedly because the crew accidentally duplicated commands into the flight computer which took the LM out of abort mode, the correct configuration for this maneuver.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{YouTube|id=fsObsxU08ys|title=\"Astronaut Gene Cernan Interview on Apollo 10 (December 23, 2009)\"|link=no}}</ref> The live network broadcasts caught Cernan and Stafford uttering several expletives before regaining control of the LM.
