Instead, black soldier fly larvae play a similar role to that of [[redworm]]s as essential decomposers in breaking down organic substrates and returning nutrients to the soil. The larvae have voracious appetites and can be used for [[composting]] household [[food waste|food scraps]] and [[agricultural waste]] products.\n\nAdditionally, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are an alternative source of protein for [[aquaculture]], [[animal feed]], [[Insect based pet food|pet food]] and [[Insects as food|human nutrition]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Potential and challenges of insects as an innovative source for food and feed production | last=Rumpold | first=Brigit A. | last2=Schl\u00fcter | first2=Olivier K. | journal=Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies | year=2013 | volume=17 | pages=1\u201311 | doi=10.1016/j.ifset.2012.11.005}}</ref>\n\nThe larvae are produced and processed in industrial-scale [[maggot farming|insect factories]] globally by biotechnology companies such as [[AgriProtein]], [[InnovaFeed]] and [[Protix]], the latter operating the world's largest insect factory in the Netherlands.<ref>[[Forbes]]/Davide Banis (14 June 2019): ''[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/06/14/can-using-insects-as-animal-feed-reduce-the-climate-impact-of-meat-production/ Can Using Insects As Animal Feed Reduce The Climate Impact Of Meat Production?]''.</ref>\n\n=== As decomposers / in composting ===\nBlack soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are used to compost waste or convert the waste into animal feed. Fly larvae are among the most efficient animals at converting feed into biomass.\n\nWhen the larvae have completed their larval development through six [[instars]], they enter a stage called the \"prepupa\" wherein they cease to eat and empty their guts, their mouth parts change to an appendage that aids climbing, and they seek a humid, sheltered area to [[pupate]]. This prepupal migration instinct is used by [[wikiversity:grub composting|grub composting]] bins to self-harvest the mature larvae. [[wikiversity:Grub composting#BSFL bin designs|These containers]] have ramps or holes on the sides to allow the prepupae to climb out of the composter and drop into a collection area.The wastes include fresh manure and food wastes of both animal and vegetable origin.\n\nLarvae are beneficial in these ways:\n\n*Their large size relative to houseflies and blowflies allows them to prevent [[houseflies]] and [[blowflies]] from laying eggs in decaying matter by consuming larvae of other species. This matters because compost systems inhabited by houseflies and blowflies carry a much greater stench than systems inhabited by BSFL, making'' H. illucens'' a more human-friendly way to minimize food waste.<ref name=\"compiled research\">{{cite web | url=http://biosystemsblog.com/2008/07/09/black-soldier-fly-compiled-research-on-best-cultivation-practices/ | title=Black Soldier Fly: Compiled Research On Best Cultivation Practices | publisher=Research Resources | date=9 July 2008}}</ref>\n*They are not a pest to humans. Unlike houseflies, adult black soldier flies have greatly-reduced sponging mouthparts and can only consume liquids such as flower nectar or do not eat at all. They do not regurgitate food along with digestive enzymes like houseflies, thus do not spread diseases.<ref name=\"Cranshaw\">{{cite book | date=2017 | first1=Whitney | first2=David | edition=2nd | isbn=978-1-4008-8894-8 | last1=Cranshaw | title=Garden Insects of North America: The Ultimate Guide to Backyard Bugs | publisher=Princeton University Press | last2=Shetlar | page=510}}</ref>\n*They are not attracted to human habitation or foods.<ref name=\"compiled research\" /> As a [[detritivore]] and [[coprovore]], the egg-bearing females are attracted to rotting food or manure.\n*Black soldier flies do not fly around as much as houseflies. They have less expendable energy due to their limited ability to consume food as adults. They are very easy to catch and relocate when they get inside a house, as they do not avoid being picked up, they are sanitary, and they neither bite nor sting. Their only defense seems to be hiding. When using a wet grub bin that will collect or kill all the pupae, the black soldier fly population is easy to reduce by killing the pupae/prepupae in the collection container, before they become flies. They may be killed by freezing, drying, manually feeding to domestic animals, putting the collection container in a chicken coop for automatic feeding, or feeding to wild birds with a mouse/pest-proof feeder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=122.msg405#msg405 | title=Feeding Grubs to Birds EXPERIMENT}}</ref>\n*Significant reductions of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and'' Salmonella enterica'' were measured in hen manure after larvae activity was added onto the manure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Marilyn C.|last2=Islam|first2=Mahbub|last3=Sheppard|first3=Craig|last4=Liao|first4=Jean|last5=Doyle|first5=Michael P.|date=April 2004|title=Reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in chicken manure by larvae of the black soldier fly|journal=Journal of Food Protection|volume=67|issue=4|pages=685\u2013690|doi=10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.685|issn=0362-028X|pmid=15083719|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f1450fa78326f7f8d17d6412a2f38875a4964050}}</ref>\n*They quickly reclaim [[wiktionary:would-be|would-be]] pollutants: Nine organic chemicals were greatly reduced or eliminated from manure in 24 hours.<ref name=\"alt to fish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/15054/research-summary:-black-soldier-fly-prepupae-a-compelling-alternative-to-fish-meal-and-fish-oil|title=Research Summary: Black Soldier Fly Prepupae \u2013 A Compelling Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil|date=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n*They quickly reduce the volume and weight of would-be waste: The larval colony breaks apart its food, churns it, and creates heat, increasing compost evaporation.

This is usually done by enticing the soldier flies to lay eggs in small holes over the grub bin. Adult flies lay clusters of eggs in the edges of [[corrugated cardboard]] or [[corrugated plastic]]. In some regions, it is possible to start or maintain adequate larvae colonies from native soldier flies; however, pest species such as houseflies and blowflies are also drawn to many of the foods used to attract soldier flies (such as fermented chicken feed).\n\nIn tropical or subtropical climates, they might breed year-round, but in other climates, a greenhouse may be needed to obtain eggs in the cooler periods. The grubs are quite hardy and can handle more acidic conditions and higher temperatures than [[redworm]]s. Larvae can survive cold winters, particularly with large numbers of grubs, insulation, or [[compost]] heat (generated by the microorganisms in the grub bin or compost pile). Heat stimulates the grubs to crawl off, pupate, and hatch, and a great deal of light and heat seem to be required for breeding. Many small-scale grub farmers build their larval colonies from eggs deposited by wild soldier flies.\n\n==== Space and shape ====\nNewly emerged soldier flies perform the beginning of their mating ritual in flight.  The male grabs onto the female, and then grasps the female's ovipositor with his genitals.

The activity of larvae can keep temperatures around {{convert|37|C}}, while redworms require cooler temperatures. Most attempts to raise large numbers of larvae with redworms in the same container, at the same time, are unsuccessful. Worms have been able to survive in/under grub bins when the bottom is the ground. Redworms can live in grub bins when a large number of larvae are not present. Worms can be added if the larval population gets low (in the cold season) and worms can be raised in grub bins while awaiting eggs from wild black soldier flies.\n\nAs a feeder species, BSFL are not known to be [[intermediate host]]s of [[parasitic worm]]s that infect poultry, while redworms are host to many.<ref name=\"worm table\">{{cite web | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/htm/bc/tpou05.htm | title=TABLE 05: Common Helminths of Poultry | work=The Merck Veterinary Manual / Poultry / Helminthiasis | accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Names and trademarks ====\nBSFL were developed as a feeder insect for exotic pets by D.

Instead, black soldier fly larvae play a similar role to that of [[redworm]]s as essential decomposers in breaking down organic substrates and returning nutrients to the soil. The larvae have voracious appetites and can be used for [[composting]] household [[food waste|food scraps]] and [[agricultural waste]] products.\n\nAdditionally, black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are an alternative source of protein for [[aquaculture]], [[animal feed]], [[Insect based pet food|pet food]] and [[Insects as food|human nutrition]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Potential and challenges of insects as an innovative source for food and feed production | last=Rumpold | first=Brigit A. | last2=Schl\u00fcter | first2=Olivier K. | journal=Innovative Food Science & Emerging Technologies | year=2013 | volume=17 | pages=1\u201311 | doi=10.1016/j.ifset.2012.11.005}}</ref>\n\nThe larvae are produced and processed in industrial-scale [[maggot farming|insect factories]] globally by biotechnology companies such as [[AgriProtein]], [[InnovaFeed]] and [[Protix]], the latter operating the world's largest insect factory in the Netherlands.<ref>[[Forbes]]/Davide Banis (14 June 2019): ''[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidebanis/2019/06/14/can-using-insects-as-animal-feed-reduce-the-climate-impact-of-meat-production/ Can Using Insects As Animal Feed Reduce The Climate Impact Of Meat Production?]''.</ref>\n\n=== As decomposers / in composting ===\nBlack soldier fly larvae (BSFL) are used to compost waste or convert the waste into animal feed. Fly larvae are among the most efficient animals at converting feed into biomass.\n\nWhen the larvae have completed their larval development through six [[instars]], they enter a stage called the \"prepupa\" wherein they cease to eat and empty their guts, their mouth parts change to an appendage that aids climbing, and they seek a humid, sheltered area to [[pupate]]. This prepupal migration instinct is used by [[wikiversity:grub composting|grub composting]] bins to self-harvest the mature larvae. [[wikiversity:Grub composting#BSFL bin designs|These containers]] have ramps or holes on the sides to allow the prepupae to climb out of the composter and drop into a collection area.The wastes include fresh manure and food wastes of both animal and vegetable origin.\n\nLarvae are beneficial in these ways:\n\n*Their large size relative to houseflies and blowflies allows them to prevent [[houseflies]] and [[blowflies]] from laying eggs in decaying matter by consuming larvae of other species. This matters because compost systems inhabited by houseflies and blowflies carry a much greater stench than systems inhabited by BSFL, making'' H. illucens'' a more human-friendly way to minimize food waste.<ref name=\"compiled research\">{{cite web | url=http://biosystemsblog.com/2008/07/09/black-soldier-fly-compiled-research-on-best-cultivation-practices/ | title=Black Soldier Fly: Compiled Research On Best Cultivation Practices | publisher=Research Resources | date=9 July 2008}}</ref>\n*They are not a pest to humans. Unlike houseflies, adult black soldier flies have greatly-reduced sponging mouthparts and can only consume liquids such as flower nectar or do not eat at all.

They have less expendable energy due to their limited ability to consume food as adults. They are very easy to catch and relocate when they get inside a house, as they do not avoid being picked up, they are sanitary, and they neither bite nor sting. Their only defense seems to be hiding. When using a wet grub bin that will collect or kill all the pupae, the black soldier fly population is easy to reduce by killing the pupae/prepupae in the collection container, before they become flies. They may be killed by freezing, drying, manually feeding to domestic animals, putting the collection container in a chicken coop for automatic feeding, or feeding to wild birds with a mouse/pest-proof feeder.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=122.msg405#msg405 | title=Feeding Grubs to Birds EXPERIMENT}}</ref>\n*Significant reductions of ''E. coli'' 0157:H7 and'' Salmonella enterica'' were measured in hen manure after larvae activity was added onto the manure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Marilyn C.|last2=Islam|first2=Mahbub|last3=Sheppard|first3=Craig|last4=Liao|first4=Jean|last5=Doyle|first5=Michael P.|date=April 2004|title=Reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in chicken manure by larvae of the black soldier fly|journal=Journal of Food Protection|volume=67|issue=4|pages=685\u2013690|doi=10.4315/0362-028x-67.4.685|issn=0362-028X|pmid=15083719|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f1450fa78326f7f8d17d6412a2f38875a4964050}}</ref>\n*They quickly reclaim [[wiktionary:would-be|would-be]] pollutants: Nine organic chemicals were greatly reduced or eliminated from manure in 24 hours.<ref name=\"alt to fish\">{{cite web|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/15054/research-summary:-black-soldier-fly-prepupae-a-compelling-alternative-to-fish-meal-and-fish-oil|title=Research Summary: Black Soldier Fly Prepupae \u2013 A Compelling Alternative to Fish Meal and Fish Oil|date=February 14, 2011}}</ref>\n*They quickly reduce the volume and weight of would-be waste: The larval colony breaks apart its food, churns it, and creates heat, increasing compost evaporation.

This is usually done by enticing the soldier flies to lay eggs in small holes over the grub bin. Adult flies lay clusters of eggs in the edges of [[corrugated cardboard]] or [[corrugated plastic]]. In some regions, it is possible to start or maintain adequate larvae colonies from native soldier flies; however, pest species such as houseflies and blowflies are also drawn to many of the foods used to attract soldier flies (such as fermented chicken feed).\n\nIn tropical or subtropical climates, they might breed year-round, but in other climates, a greenhouse may be needed to obtain eggs in the cooler periods. The grubs are quite hardy and can handle more acidic conditions and higher temperatures than [[redworm]]s. Larvae can survive cold winters, particularly with large numbers of grubs, insulation, or [[compost]] heat (generated by the microorganisms in the grub bin or compost pile). Heat stimulates the grubs to crawl off, pupate, and hatch, and a great deal of light and heat seem to be required for breeding. Many small-scale grub farmers build their larval colonies from eggs deposited by wild soldier flies.\n\n==== Space and shape ====\nNewly emerged soldier flies perform the beginning of their mating ritual in flight.  The male grabs onto the female, and then grasps the female's ovipositor with his genitals.  They mate while stationary and connected.\n\nGerman scientists have successfully bred soldier flies in a space as small as 10 liters.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thebiopod.com/forum/index.php?topic=175.msg1783#msg1783 | title=Breeding BSF in captivity / Re: not easy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-10-08 | archive-date=2013-11-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112175106/http://www.terrarienbilder.com/vb/futtertiere_und_futterpflanzen/315-zucht_der_schwarzen_soldatenfliege_hermetia_illucens.html | url=http://www.terrarienbilder.com/vb/futtertiere_und_futterpflanzen/315-zucht_der_schwarzen_soldatenfliege_hermetia_illucens.html | title=Zucht der schwarzen Soldatenfliege (Hermetia illucens) | date=2010-04-02 | last=Jetter | first=Michael | language=de | trans-title=Breeding the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) | url-status=dead | website=Terrarienbilder.com}}</ref>\n\n==== Heat ====\nAdults typically mated and oviposited at temperatures of {{convert|24|to|40|C|F}} or more.

The activity of larvae can keep temperatures around {{convert|37|C}}, while redworms require cooler temperatures. Most attempts to raise large numbers of larvae with redworms in the same container, at the same time, are unsuccessful. Worms have been able to survive in/under grub bins when the bottom is the ground. Redworms can live in grub bins when a large number of larvae are not present. Worms can be added if the larval population gets low (in the cold season) and worms can be raised in grub bins while awaiting eggs from wild black soldier flies.\n\nAs a feeder species, BSFL are not known to be [[intermediate host]]s of [[parasitic worm]]s that infect poultry, while redworms are host to many.<ref name=\"worm table\">{{cite web | url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/htm/bc/tpou05.htm | title=TABLE 05: Common Helminths of Poultry | work=The Merck Veterinary Manual / Poultry / Helminthiasis | accessdate=April 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Names and trademarks ====\nBSFL were developed as a feeder insect for exotic pets by D. Craig Sheppard, who named the larvae '''Phoenix Worms''' and began marketing them as pet food. In 2006, Phoenix Worms' became the first feeder insect to be granted a U.S. registered trademark. Other companies also market BSFL under such brand names as NutriGrubs, Soldier Grubs, Reptiworms, Calciworms, and BIOgrubs. In Australia, BSFL are marketed as live feeder insects under the brand name Beardie Grubs. In Africa they are marketed as live feeder by ProtiCycle for fish such as Tilapia and Cat Fish.\n\n== Possible natural enemies ==\nIn West Africa, ''[[Dirhinus]] giffardii'' has been found to be a [[parasitoid]] of ''H. illucens'' pupae and decrease egg production.

The boys panic and decide to hide both Daryl's body and the katana.\n\nDuring the next two days of school, rumors circulate about Daryl's disappearance. Zach has nightmares and Josh doesn\u2019t attend classes. Zach wants to return to Daryl's burial site and attend Allison's upcoming party with Josh. Josh refuses to do either.\n\nZach goes to Allison's party where he is surprised to see Josh sharing his brother's weed with everyone. Zach, disturbed, leaves.

Zach sees Allison's phone number on Josh's caller ID and Zach frantically runs look for her. Meanwhile, Josh, Allison and Meghan smoke weed at Meghan\u2019s house. Josh unwraps the katana from under a towel to show it to them.\n\nZach arrives at Meghan's house and quietly makes his way up the stairs. He hears muffled screams coming from Meghan's bedroom and opens the door to find Josh has murdered Meghan. Allison is tied and gagged in the corner, wounded but still alive. Josh locks Zach out of the room, but Zach climbs up on the roof and breaks the window to get back inside. Zach is attacked by Josh and attempts to escape, but Josh slashes his shoulder and stabs him in the leg. Zach attempts to fight him off, but Josh begins to strangle him. A neighbor intervenes, separates them, and holds Josh down.\n\nPolice and paramedics arrive at the scene.

While the paramedics attend to Zach's wounds, he glances at Josh sitting in the back of a police car.\n\nMonths later, Allison has recovered and returns to school. A camera shot from the back of the classroom reveals the scars she received from the katana: three parallel lines on the back of her neck.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Owen Campbell (actor)|Owen Campbell]] as Zach Taylor \n*[[Charlie Tahan]] as Josh Templeton\n*Elizabeth Cappuccino as Allison Bannister\n*[[Max Talisman]] as Daryl Harper\n*[[Sawyer Barth]] as Charlie Barth\n*[[Amy Hargreaves]] as Karen Taylor\n*Adea Lennox as Meghan\n*Ethan Botwick as John Whitcomb\n*Anni Krueger as Mrs. Barron\n*Kortnee Simmons as Eugene\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Young|first=Neil|title='Super Dark Times': Film Review;

Alicia, a member of the Townwatch, arrests Welkin Gunther at gunpoint on suspicion of espionage, despite his protestations of innocence.

Knowing his failures will be exploited by the Emperor and the Crown Prince, Maximilian declares that he is no longer the Second Prince of the Empire, but the Emperor of his own nation that he will create. Selvaria is still troubled by her failure at Naggiar, but still believes in Maximilian out of devotion and love. Meanwhile, at the Gallian camp, Welkin and Squad 7 are trying to contact Alicia, but are stopped by Regular Army officers. Squad 7 attempts to force the issue, but instead cause a brawl. Cordelia pardons Faldio, and then meets with Alicia who requests that Cordelia ensure the safety of Squad 7 and Faldio until the end of the war.

Selvaria managed to escape from the lab and was taken into the care of Maximilian. During the battle, Selvaria, fighting for Maximilian, begins to gain ground on Alicia. Nearly defeated, Alicia suddenly realizes that she has something precious to fight for as well: Squad 7 and Welkin. With her strength renewed, Alicia defeats Selvaria with one last strike. Selvaria understands that, defeated, she is of no use to Maximilian, and sacrifices herself to create a massive explosion, destroying the Gallian Regular Army and General Damon. Meanwhile, Maximilian attempts to negotiate a peace treaty with Cordelia, demanding that she marry him so that he has access to the Valkyrur bloodline, but Cordelia reveals that she is in fact a Darcsen. Shocked, Maximilian orders the Marmotah to attack Randgriz.

After demonstrating the power of the lance by demolishing a hill, Maximlian calls on the Gallians to surrender or be destroyed. Jaeger confronts Maximilian about his lust for power, but Maximilian replies that power is the only thing one needs. He also tells Jaeger that he executed Karl for standing in his way, and threatens Jaeger with the same fate should he prove disloyal.

He frees Alicia and challenges her and Welkin to a duel to demonstrate the power of his superior technology. Alicia regains her strength and unleashes her Valkyrian flame which overloads the system and injures Maximilian.

The Bruhl Townwatch has to delay the Imperials to allow the evacuation to proceed unhindered and hold out until the Regular Army arrives; however, they are handicapped by their lack of combat experience and poorly maintained equipment and suffer badly. In the Edelweiss, Welkin and Isara attack the invading Imperial troops and tanks to give the remaining Townwatch members the necessary time to escape from Bruhl as the Gallian Regular Army reaches the outskirts of Bruhl. However, even though they arrive in time to rescue the civilians, the Regular Army decides against retaking Bruhl from the superior Imperial force. Due to the capture of Bruhl by the Imperials, Alicia and her friend Susie Evans enlist in the Gallian Militia.

Welkin introduces himself to Squad 7 but his new subordinates treat him with disdain as they believe, correctly, that he is naive and inexperienced. Squad 7 sets off for Vasel Bridge, which connects the main road to the capital city of Randgriz, and is under Imperials control. When certain members of Squad voice objections about the presence of Isara in the group because she is a Darcsen, Welkin makes a bet with them that if he and Squad 7 manages to retake the bridge in two days, they have to accept his command and Isara's continued presence. The following morning, using fog as cover, the Edelweiss dives into the river and reaches the other side in a surprise attack allowing Squad 7 to capture the bridge.

Alicia is troubled by Welkin's quiet acceptance of General Damon's implicit insult, but Faldio seizes the chance to encourage her to have more faith in Welkin.

Advancing aggressively, Alicia is shot during the operation, but Faldio is able to help her to safety. However, she soon resumes fighting as her wound has healed quickly, much to the amazement of Faldio. The Gallian attack proves irresistible and Jaeger arrives with Imperial reinforcements to assist the reluctant Gregor in escaping.

Having completed their repairs, Isara and Ramal sense a large disturbance and hurry to the ruins, only to see a gigantic tank firing upon the ruins and causing the place to collapse with Welkin, Alicia and Faldio still inside. Elsewhere, Imperial forces under Gregor's command seize the mining city of Fouzen and execute the defeated Gallian Regular Army general. Gregor declares himself as dissatisfied with the easy victory, having wanted the Edelweiss as the opponent instead of incompetent Gallian Regulars.

After some time, Alicia and Faldio emerge and rejoin the otherw but Alicia's gratitude to Welkin for being rescued gives way to annoyance when Welkin bombards Alicia with eager scientific questions about the babysitter lizards, leading Faldio to remark that Welkin is an \"amazing guy\".\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 9\n| Title               = Azure Witch\n| TranslitTitle       = Aoki Majo\n| NativeTitle         = \u84bc\u304d\u9b54\u5973\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2009|5|30}}\n| ShortSummary        = With ulterior motives in mind, Imperial Central Command dispatches three junior officers to serve the Generals as aides.

Sensing a plot behind Maximilian's recall and the three aides' sudden appearance, Jaeger suggests that Selvaria should act according to her instincts. However, Selvaria's initial attempt to go after the Prince is thwarted by Karl's insistence on following regulations. An assassin from the Capital attempts to murder Karl, who has succeeded in his mission of keeping Selvaria from Maximillian. Selvaria dispatches the assassin and Karl, in gratitude, confesses his secret orders to her.
