Leela was a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Fourth Doctor]] and a regular in the programme from 1977 to 1978. Writer [[Chris Boucher]] named her after the Palestinian hijacker [[Leila Khaled]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldorcity.com/people/cbinterview_1992.html|title=1992 Interview with Chris Boucher|publisher=}}</ref> Leela appeared in 9 stories (40 episodes).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nLeela was the daughter of Sole. She first appears in the 1977 serial ''[[The Face of Evil]]''. She is a warrior of the savage Sevateem tribe, who were amongst the descendants of the crew of an [[Earth]] starship from The Mordee Expedition that crash-landed on an unnamed planet in the far future. The tribe's name is a corruption of \"survey team\". The Doctor at this point was content to travel alone, but Leela barged into the [[TARDIS]] and continued to accompany him on his journeys.\n\nThough a primitive, Leela was highly intelligent, grasping advanced concepts easily and translating them into terms she could cope with. Despite the Doctor's attempts at \"civilizing\" her, Leela was strong-willed enough to continue in her ways. She usually dressed in animal skins, and was armed with a knife or a set of poisonous Janis thorns, which she did not hesitate to use on people who threatened her, much to the Doctor's disapproval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/companions/page20.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who - Classic Series  - Companions - Leela|publisher=}}</ref> She often demonstrated a highly accurate sense of danger.\n\nIn her travels with the Doctor, Leela faced [[The Robots of Death|killer robots]], [[Talons of Weng-Chiang|murderous homunculi]], [[Horror of Fang Rock|the Rutan Host]], and the [[Sontaran]] invasion of the Doctor's home planet of [[Gallifrey]]. During this final adventure, ''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', she meets and falls in love with Andred, a native Gallifreyan, and decides to stay behind to be with him. The first [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] remains with her.<ref>http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/07/a-companion-to-the-doctors-companions-leela</ref> This exit for her character was created after Jameson announced her intention to leave the show.\n\nFollowing her departure she was mentioned in the series on two subsequent occasions. In [[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]], when the Doctor believes he has returned to Gallifrey, he admits, \"I'm so looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on\". When he finally does arrive on Gallifrey in [[Arc of Infinity]], he asks after her: \"Tell me, what of my former companion Leela?\" The Doctor is told she is \"well and very happy\", to which he responds \"I was so sorry to miss her wedding\".\n\n===Other media===\nLouise Jameson reprised the role of Leela on screen in the 1993 charity special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''.\n\nLeela's life on Gallifrey has been explored in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media. In the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', by Marc Platt, Leela and Andred are expecting a child, the first naturally conceived baby on Gallifrey for millennia. When the Doctor learns this, he asks her to name it after him; Platt explained that this was meant to suggest a [[time loop]] in which the hybrid child goes on to become [[The Other (Doctor Who)|the Other]] and subsequently the Doctor, explaining his half-human parentage in the 1996 TV film.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Benjamin | date=31 May 2001 |title=The Fall of the Gold House of Usher |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=305 |page=30}}</ref>\n\nJameson has voiced the character in six series of [[Big Finish Productions]] audio plays set on Gallifrey, alongside [[Lalla Ward]] as [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] and [[John Leeson]] as K-9. In the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Gallifrey|''Gallifrey'' audio series]], Leela acts as Romana's bodyguard, advisor and friend. Being in the presence of Time Lord biology extends Leela's lifespan, keeping her relatively youthful. However, if she ever left them, she would quickly age to death. In ''Gallifrey'', Leela and Andred separate after Andred fakes his death to infiltrate the Celestial Intervention Agency (he regenerates and impersonates a man who attempted to kill him, not considering how his actions would affect Leela). Andred is subsequently killed and Leela is blinded during a Gallifreyan civil war, which also results in her version of K9 (the original) being destroyed. She is then taken out of time, to avoid her perishing with the rest of Gallifrey. She follows Romana through several alternative universes, regaining vision in one eye by ingesting vampire blood, her unique physiology allowing her to be physically enhanced by it without experiencing the negative mental side effects. She eventually returns to her original universe with Romana in time to save their Gallifrey.\n\nIn 2011, Leela joined the cast of the second series of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Jago .26 Litefoot|Jago & Litefoot]]'', where she is sent by Romana to investigate breaks in time in Victorian London. The same year, Jameson reprised the role of Leela alongside Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor for a series of audio dramas for Big Finish. These dramas began to be released in January 2012 and are adaptations of stories planned for the TV but never produced, as well as original storylines set in the gap between ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' and ''Horror of Fang Rock''. Leela has also appeared in several [[Past Doctor Adventures]], including four novels by [[Chris Boucher]] pairing her with the Fourth Doctor, whom she also appears with in [[Phillip Reeve]]'s 2013 short story \"The Roots of Evil\" (which sees the Fourth Doctor and Leela deal with the aftermath of a situation created by the [[Eleventh Doctor]]).\n\nSeemingly surviving the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], Leela features in a trilogy of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The Companion Chronicles|Companion Chronicles]]'' audio stories in which she ages a year per day without the Time Lords. In ''[[The Catalyst (Doctor Who audio)|The Catalyst]]'', an elderly Leela is interrogated by a Z'Nai warrior to learn what secrets she may know of a legendary \"lost world\" (presumably Gallifrey), and tells stories of her past to a child imprisoned in the room. In her final audio, ''[[The Time Vampire]]'', she recalls how K9 flew into the Time Vortex and she had a vision of an \"ancient\" woman. Once her tale is told and she feels ready to die, K9 suddenly appears before her, frees her and guides her soul to its next stage.\n\nIn 2017, Jameson appeared as Leela alongside [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], the [[Retroactive continuity|retroactive]] 'ninth' Doctor who fought in the Time War, in the [[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|''War Doctor'' audio series]]. In this audio, Leela is stated to have been lost in an early battle in the Time War, but was actually struck by a Disruptor Dalek, intended to erase her from all alternate timelines, only for unspecified factors \u2013 hinted to be Leela's strength of will \u2013 to draw Leela back to this universe, but now forced to endure the memories of every possible alternate path her life might have taken and no way to determine which one is true. After helping Leela seal a dimensional rift, the War Doctor is able to use the TARDIS to bring Leela's memories back into order.<ref>{{cite serial |title=[[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|The War Doctor]]: The Lady of Obsidian |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who: Special Releases |serieslink=List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The War Doctor|first=Andrew (writer) |last=Smith|authorlink=Andrew Smith (Doctor Who writer) |first2=Nicholas (director) |last2=Briggs |authorlink2=Nicholas Briggs |network= |station= |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |city= |date=February 2017 |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}</ref>\n\nLater in 2017, Jameson as Leela appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio ''[[Time in Office]]''; when the Fifth Doctor is recalled to Gallifrey to take on the role as President to stabilize Gallifrey's tenuous political situation after [[Borusa]]'s deceptions (\"[[The Five Doctors]]\"), Leela assists his current companion [[Tegan Jovanka]] in finding a loophole that allows her to stay on Gallifrey with him, essentially acting as the Doctor's bodyguard and advisor until he returns to his travels.\n\n==Characterisation==\n\n===Conception===\nThe character of Leela was first conceived by producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. They wanted a companion in the mould of [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] [[Pygmalion (play)|Eliza Doolittle]]: a bright but unsophisticated primitive who would learn from the Doctor.  Writer [[Chris Boucher]] had submitted a story proposal titled ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' which featured a character named Leela, fitting Hinchcliffe's and Holmes's ideas.\n\nAlthough ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' was not produced, Boucher reused the character of Leela for ''The Day God Went Mad'' (later renamed to ''The Face of Evil''), seeing her as a mixture of [[Emma Peel]] from ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and Leila Khaled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katharine |last=Viner |title='I made the ring from a bullet and the pin of a hand grenade' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,428510,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> Boucher was asked to write two endings to ''Face'', one in which Leela left with the Doctor, and one in which  she stayed behind.  The decision to have Leela become a companion was made soon after. An oft-repeated story (also stated in the DVD commentary to ''[[The Robots of Death]]'') is that Leela's skimpy leather outfits were very popular with the \"dads\", which kept them watching the programme.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to the official DVD release of the story ''The Face of Evil'' in 2012,<ref>Doctor Who: The Face of Evil. BBC DVD/2Entertain. {{ISBN|0-7806-8517-2}}</ref> [[Louise Jameson]] won the role of Leela over 26 other hopeful actresses auditioned between 10 and 25 August 1976. [[Emily Richard]] was producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]'s first choice, but when she proved unavailable, [[Celia Foxe]], [[Colette Gleeson]], [[Elaine Donnelly (actress)|Elaine Donnelly]], [[Gail Grainger]], [[Belinda Sinclair]], [[Ann Pennington (model)|Ann Pennington]], [[Sally Geeson]], [[Pamela Salem]], [[Carol Leader]], [[Heather Tobias]], [[Marilyn Galsworthy]], [[Katherine Fahey]], Deborah Fairfax, [[Irene Gorst]], [[Kay Korda]], Lois Hantz, [[Belinda Low]], [[Gail Harrison]], [[Michelle Newell]], Philippa Vazey, [[Sue Jones-Davies]], [[Lydia Lisel]], [[Janet Edis]], [[Susan Wooldridge]] and [[Carol Drinkwater]] were all seen for the part. The latter five actresses were shortlisted with Louise Jameson and all recalled. Auditions took place in batches of eight actresses, with Jameson amongst the first batch. As [[Tom Baker]] was not available for her audition, director [[Pennant Roberts]] played the part of the Doctor. Jameson was given the role on 26 August 1976. Despite not being on the final shortlist, Pamela Salem won a small voice role in Leela's debut story, ''[[The Face of Evil]]'',<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/doctor-who-the-nearly-leelas/</ref> followed by a substantial part in the next story ''[[The Robots of Death]]''.\n\nAlthough Jameson's eyes are naturally blue, as Leela she initially wore red [[contact lens]]es to make them brown. However, the contact lenses severely limited her vision, and producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] promised her she could stop wearing them. To explain the change in-story, writer [[Terrance Dicks]] wrote a scene in the 1977 serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'' in which Leela's eyes suffer \"pigment dispersal\" and turn blue after viewing the explosion of the [[Rutan Host|Rutan]] ship.\n\n[[Tom Baker]] disliked Leela's character concept because he felt that she was too violent.<ref name=\"30Years\">{{cite book|last=Rigelsford|first=Adrian|title=The Doctors: 30 Years of Time Travel|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|year=1994|chapter=The Vortex of Immensity|isbn=0-7522-0959-0|page=111}}</ref>  Jameson reports that he was cold to her for the first several stories they did together.<ref name=\"FangRock\">{{cite video| people = Jameson, Louise (Episode commentary)| title = Horror of Fang Rock| medium = DVD| publisher = BBC DVD|date = 2005}}</ref> Eventually, during the filming of ''Horror of Fang Rock'', she insisted on multiple takes of a scene in which he repeatedly entered the scene early, thereby upstaging her.

Leela was a [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Fourth Doctor]] and a regular in the programme from 1977 to 1978. Writer [[Chris Boucher]] named her after the Palestinian hijacker [[Leila Khaled]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaldorcity.com/people/cbinterview_1992.html|title=1992 Interview with Chris Boucher|publisher=}}</ref> Leela appeared in 9 stories (40 episodes).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nLeela was the daughter of Sole. She first appears in the 1977 serial ''[[The Face of Evil]]''. She is a warrior of the savage Sevateem tribe, who were amongst the descendants of the crew of an [[Earth]] starship from The Mordee Expedition that crash-landed on an unnamed planet in the far future. The tribe's name is a corruption of \"survey team\". The Doctor at this point was content to travel alone, but Leela barged into the [[TARDIS]] and continued to accompany him on his journeys.\n\nThough a primitive, Leela was highly intelligent, grasping advanced concepts easily and translating them into terms she could cope with. Despite the Doctor's attempts at \"civilizing\" her, Leela was strong-willed enough to continue in her ways. She usually dressed in animal skins, and was armed with a knife or a set of poisonous Janis thorns, which she did not hesitate to use on people who threatened her, much to the Doctor's disapproval.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/companions/page20.shtml|title=BBC - Doctor Who - Classic Series  - Companions - Leela|publisher=}}</ref> She often demonstrated a highly accurate sense of danger.\n\nIn her travels with the Doctor, Leela faced [[The Robots of Death|killer robots]], [[Talons of Weng-Chiang|murderous homunculi]], [[Horror of Fang Rock|the Rutan Host]], and the [[Sontaran]] invasion of the Doctor's home planet of [[Gallifrey]]. During this final adventure, ''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', she meets and falls in love with Andred, a native Gallifreyan, and decides to stay behind to be with him. The first [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] remains with her.<ref>http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2011/07/a-companion-to-the-doctors-companions-leela</ref> This exit for her character was created after Jameson announced her intention to leave the show.\n\nFollowing her departure she was mentioned in the series on two subsequent occasions. In [[Full Circle (Doctor Who)|Full Circle]], when the Doctor believes he has returned to Gallifrey, he admits, \"I'm so looking forward to seeing how Leela and Andred are getting on\". When he finally does arrive on Gallifrey in [[Arc of Infinity]], he asks after her: \"Tell me, what of my former companion Leela?\" The Doctor is told she is \"well and very happy\", to which he responds \"I was so sorry to miss her wedding\".\n\n===Other media===\nLouise Jameson reprised the role of Leela on screen in the 1993 charity special ''[[Dimensions in Time]]''.\n\nLeela's life on Gallifrey has been explored in various [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] media. In the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novel ''[[Lungbarrow]]'', by Marc Platt, Leela and Andred are expecting a child, the first naturally conceived baby on Gallifrey for millennia. When the Doctor learns this, he asks her to name it after him; Platt explained that this was meant to suggest a [[time loop]] in which the hybrid child goes on to become [[The Other (Doctor Who)|the Other]] and subsequently the Doctor, explaining his half-human parentage in the 1996 TV film.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Benjamin | date=31 May 2001 |title=The Fall of the Gold House of Usher |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=305 |page=30}}</ref>\n\nJameson has voiced the character in six series of [[Big Finish Productions]] audio plays set on Gallifrey, alongside [[Lalla Ward]] as [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] and [[John Leeson]] as K-9. In the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Gallifrey|''Gallifrey'' audio series]], Leela acts as Romana's bodyguard, advisor and friend. Being in the presence of Time Lord biology extends Leela's lifespan, keeping her relatively youthful. However, if she ever left them, she would quickly age to death. In ''Gallifrey'', Leela and Andred separate after Andred fakes his death to infiltrate the Celestial Intervention Agency (he regenerates and impersonates a man who attempted to kill him, not considering how his actions would affect Leela). Andred is subsequently killed and Leela is blinded during a Gallifreyan civil war, which also results in her version of K9 (the original) being destroyed. She is then taken out of time, to avoid her perishing with the rest of Gallifrey. She follows Romana through several alternative universes, regaining vision in one eye by ingesting vampire blood, her unique physiology allowing her to be physically enhanced by it without experiencing the negative mental side effects. She eventually returns to her original universe with Romana in time to save their Gallifrey.\n\nIn 2011, Leela joined the cast of the second series of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Jago .26 Litefoot|Jago & Litefoot]]'', where she is sent by Romana to investigate breaks in time in Victorian London. The same year, Jameson reprised the role of Leela alongside Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor for a series of audio dramas for Big Finish. These dramas began to be released in January 2012 and are adaptations of stories planned for the TV but never produced, as well as original storylines set in the gap between ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' and ''Horror of Fang Rock''. Leela has also appeared in several [[Past Doctor Adventures]], including four novels by [[Chris Boucher]] pairing her with the Fourth Doctor, whom she also appears with in [[Phillip Reeve]]'s 2013 short story \"The Roots of Evil\" (which sees the Fourth Doctor and Leela deal with the aftermath of a situation created by the [[Eleventh Doctor]]).\n\nSeemingly surviving the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], Leela features in a trilogy of ''[[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The Companion Chronicles|Companion Chronicles]]'' audio stories in which she ages a year per day without the Time Lords. In ''[[The Catalyst (Doctor Who audio)|The Catalyst]]'', an elderly Leela is interrogated by a Z'Nai warrior to learn what secrets she may know of a legendary \"lost world\" (presumably Gallifrey), and tells stories of her past to a child imprisoned in the room. In her final audio, ''[[The Time Vampire]]'', she recalls how K9 flew into the Time Vortex and she had a vision of an \"ancient\" woman. Once her tale is told and she feels ready to die, K9 suddenly appears before her, frees her and guides her soul to its next stage.\n\nIn 2017, Jameson appeared as Leela alongside [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], the [[Retroactive continuity|retroactive]] 'ninth' Doctor who fought in the Time War, in the [[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|''War Doctor'' audio series]]. In this audio, Leela is stated to have been lost in an early battle in the Time War, but was actually struck by a Disruptor Dalek, intended to erase her from all alternate timelines, only for unspecified factors \u2013 hinted to be Leela's strength of will \u2013 to draw Leela back to this universe, but now forced to endure the memories of every possible alternate path her life might have taken and no way to determine which one is true. After helping Leela seal a dimensional rift, the War Doctor is able to use the TARDIS to bring Leela's memories back into order.<ref>{{cite serial |title=[[The War Doctor (audio drama series)|The War Doctor]]: The Lady of Obsidian |episode= |url= |series=Doctor Who: Special Releases |serieslink=List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#The War Doctor|first=Andrew (writer) |last=Smith|authorlink=Andrew Smith (Doctor Who writer) |first2=Nicholas (director) |last2=Briggs |authorlink2=Nicholas Briggs |network= |station= |publisher=[[Big Finish Productions]] |city= |date=February 2017 |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}</ref>\n\nLater in 2017, Jameson as Leela appeared in the Fifth Doctor audio ''[[Time in Office]]''; when the Fifth Doctor is recalled to Gallifrey to take on the role as President to stabilize Gallifrey's tenuous political situation after [[Borusa]]'s deceptions (\"[[The Five Doctors]]\"), Leela assists his current companion [[Tegan Jovanka]] in finding a loophole that allows her to stay on Gallifrey with him, essentially acting as the Doctor's bodyguard and advisor until he returns to his travels.\n\n==Characterisation==\n\n===Conception===\nThe character of Leela was first conceived by producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] and script editor [[Robert Holmes (scriptwriter)|Robert Holmes]]. They wanted a companion in the mould of [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] [[Pygmalion (play)|Eliza Doolittle]]: a bright but unsophisticated primitive who would learn from the Doctor.  Writer [[Chris Boucher]] had submitted a story proposal titled ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' which featured a character named Leela, fitting Hinchcliffe's and Holmes's ideas.\n\nAlthough ''The Mentor Conspiracy'' was not produced, Boucher reused the character of Leela for ''The Day God Went Mad'' (later renamed to ''The Face of Evil''), seeing her as a mixture of [[Emma Peel]] from ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' and Leila Khaled.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katharine |last=Viner |title='I made the ring from a bullet and the pin of a hand grenade' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,428510,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2001-10-26 |accessdate=2007-03-18 }}</ref> Boucher was asked to write two endings to ''Face'', one in which Leela left with the Doctor, and one in which  she stayed behind.  The decision to have Leela become a companion was made soon after. An oft-repeated story (also stated in the DVD commentary to ''[[The Robots of Death]]'') is that Leela's skimpy leather outfits were very popular with the \"dads\", which kept them watching the programme.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to the official DVD release of the story ''The Face of Evil'' in 2012,<ref>Doctor Who: The Face of Evil. BBC DVD/2Entertain. {{ISBN|0-7806-8517-2}}</ref> [[Louise Jameson]] won the role of Leela over 26 other hopeful actresses auditioned between 10 and 25 August 1976. [[Emily Richard]] was producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]]'s first choice, but when she proved unavailable, [[Celia Foxe]], [[Colette Gleeson]], [[Elaine Donnelly (actress)|Elaine Donnelly]], [[Gail Grainger]], [[Belinda Sinclair]], [[Ann Pennington (model)|Ann Pennington]], [[Sally Geeson]], [[Pamela Salem]], [[Carol Leader]], [[Heather Tobias]], [[Marilyn Galsworthy]], [[Katherine Fahey]], Deborah Fairfax, [[Irene Gorst]], [[Kay Korda]], Lois Hantz, [[Belinda Low]], [[Gail Harrison]], [[Michelle Newell]], Philippa Vazey, [[Sue Jones-Davies]], [[Lydia Lisel]], [[Janet Edis]], [[Susan Wooldridge]] and [[Carol Drinkwater]] were all seen for the part. The latter five actresses were shortlisted with Louise Jameson and all recalled. Auditions took place in batches of eight actresses, with Jameson amongst the first batch. As [[Tom Baker]] was not available for her audition, director [[Pennant Roberts]] played the part of the Doctor. Jameson was given the role on 26 August 1976. Despite not being on the final shortlist, Pamela Salem won a small voice role in Leela's debut story, ''[[The Face of Evil]]'',<ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/doctor-who-the-nearly-leelas/</ref> followed by a substantial part in the next story ''[[The Robots of Death]]''.\n\nAlthough Jameson's eyes are naturally blue, as Leela she initially wore red [[contact lens]]es to make them brown. However, the contact lenses severely limited her vision, and producer [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] promised her she could stop wearing them. To explain the change in-story, writer [[Terrance Dicks]] wrote a scene in the 1977 serial ''[[Horror of Fang Rock]]'' in which Leela's eyes suffer \"pigment dispersal\" and turn blue after viewing the explosion of the [[Rutan Host|Rutan]] ship.\n\n[[Tom Baker]] disliked Leela's character concept because he felt that she was too violent.<ref name=\"30Years\">{{cite book|last=Rigelsford|first=Adrian|title=The Doctors: 30 Years of Time Travel|publisher=Boxtree|location=London|year=1994|chapter=The Vortex of Immensity|isbn=0-7522-0959-0|page=111}}</ref>  Jameson reports that he was cold to her for the first several stories they did together.<ref name=\"FangRock\">{{cite video| people = Jameson, Louise (Episode commentary)| title = Horror of Fang Rock| medium = DVD| publisher = BBC DVD|date = 2005}}</ref> Eventually, during the filming of ''Horror of Fang Rock'', she insisted on multiple takes of a scene in which he repeatedly entered the scene early, thereby upstaging her.

When Danilo was four years old his parents moved to Sydney, where they purchased the Silver Grill caf\u00e9 in Kings Cross, which soon became a favoured meeting and eating place of soprano singer [[Gladys Moncrieff]] and others with artistic and theatrical flair.\n\nJovanovitch's formal schooling began 2 years later at Newtown Infants School, and then at Mona Vale Infants School when his parents moved to Warriewood where they owned a house and farmland. His father George built and operated the first 46 tomato glass-houses in the region, to supply Sydney markets with tomatoes.\n\nJovanovitch was an avid reader from an early age, as his mother had taught him to read prior to him starting school. He was inspired by the NSW state government ''School Magazine'' \u2013 a monthly publication containing Australian poetry by such Australian authors as [[Henry Lawson]], [[A.B. \"Banjo\" Paterson]], and [[Dame Mary Gilmore]]. Jovanovitch's secondary school education was at Manly and Leichhardt Technical schools.\n\n'Dan' Jovanovitch began writing poetry in the mid-1930s. At this time his family bought and managed a caf\u00e9 at New Farm, Queensland and it was from here that Jovanovitch set a record in 1937, by cycling 630 miles (solo) from Brisbane to Sydney in 54 hours. He continued cycle racing and regularly trained and competed in road races, as a member of Muswellbrook Cycle Club in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the 1930s Jovanovitch was an acting student at [[Cinesound Talent School]] and appeared as an extra in the Australian comedy movies ''Ants in His Pants'' and ''Gone to the Dogs''<ref name=\"Gone To The Dogs\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031380/|title=Gone to the Dogs|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> as well as ''40,000 Horsemen''.<ref name=\"40,000 Horsemen\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033307/|title=40,000 Horsemen|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> Leading Australian actor [[Alec Kelleway]] selected Jovanovitch as a featured extra to hold the leash of the 9th greyhound dog in the race scene in the feature film [[Gone to the Dogs (1939 film)|Gone to the Dogs]], and Jovanovitch can be seen onscreen in the part on modern DVDs of the film.

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center.

When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}</ref>\n\nThe exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.<ref name=Lentz>{{vcite book |last=Lentz | first=Gretchen M |last2=Lobo | first2=Rogerio A. |last3=Gershenson | first3=David M |last4=Katz | first4=Vern L. |title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&sid=1291988935&uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.<ref name=Lentz /> This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.

[[Ovarian follicle|Follicles]] in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24\u201336 hours after the [[luteinizing hormone]] (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an [[ovocyte]], in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a [[corpus luteum]]; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of [[progesterone]]. Under the influence of progesterone, the [[endometrium|uterine lining]] changes to prepare for potential [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]] of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation.

The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the [[Ovarian follicle|follicles]] of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the [[Endometrium|endometrial lining]] of the uterus.  Both cycles can be divided into three phases.  The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.<ref name=Silverthorn />\n\n=== Ovarian cycle ===\n\n==== Follicular phase ====\n{{main|Follicular phase}}\nThe follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg.<ref name=Silverthorn /> The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.\n\nThrough the influence of a rise in [[follicle stimulating hormone]] (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few [[ovarian follicle]]s are stimulated.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> These follicles, which were present at birth<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as [[folliculogenesis]], compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n==== Ovulation ====\n{{main|Ovulation}}\n[[File:ovulation.jpg|thumb|An ovary about to release an egg]]\n\nOvulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct.<ref>[http://dukefertilitycenter.org/tests/ovulation-assessment/ Ovulation Test] at Duke Fertility Center.

When the egg has nearly matured, levels of [[estradiol]] reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day&nbsp;12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pregnology.com/ovulate/16/2/10/1/15/2013|title=Ovulation Calendar|publisher=Pregnology}}</ref>\n\nThe exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood.<ref name=Lentz>{{vcite book |last=Lentz | first=Gretchen M |last2=Lobo | first2=Rogerio A. |last3=Gershenson | first3=David M |last4=Katz | first4=Vern L. |title=Comprehensive gynecology.|year=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|location=St. Louis|isbn=978-0-323-06986-1|url=http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195&isbn=978-0-323-06986-1&sid=1291988935&uniqId=327920693-3#4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00004-4--s0195|accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> In animals, a [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone]] (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion.<ref name=Lentz /> This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: [[estrogen receptor alpha]], which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and [[estrogen receptor beta]], which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu L, Gustofson RL, Feng H, Leung PK, Mores N, Krsmanovic LZ, Catt KJ | title = Converse regulatory functions of estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta subtypes expressed in hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons | journal = Mol.

During the luteal phase, the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/> Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.<ref>Weschler (2002), p.47</ref>\n\nThe loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg.  The [[syncytiotrophoblast]], which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the [[blastocyst]]) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy.  Most [[pregnancy test]]s look for the presence of hCG.<ref name=\"isbn0-07-303120-8\"/>\n\n=== Uterine cycle ===\nThe uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.<ref>{{cite book | title =Textbook of Medical Physiology | chapter = Chapter 81 Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones |pages =  1018ff  | edition = 11th |editor=Guyton AC |editor2=Hall JE |publisher = Elsevier Saunders | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780721602400}}</ref>\n\n==== Menstruation ====\n{{main|Menstruation}}\nMenstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle.

Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation.

If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be [[extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive|taken continuously]], although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.\n\n=== Breastfeeding ===\n{{main|Lactational amenorrhea method}}\n[[Breastfeeding]] causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).

These practices are common in parts of South Asia, especially in [[Nepal]]. [[Chhaupadi]] is a social practice that occurs in the western part of Nepal for [[Hindu]] women, which prohibits a woman from participating in everyday activities during menstruation. Women are considered [[Impurity|impure]] during this time, and are kept out of the house and have to live in a shed. Although chhaupadi was outlawed by the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] in 2005, the tradition is slow to change.<ref>http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=publisher&publisher=IRIN&type=&coi=NPL&docid=4e3f7ae82&skip=0</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4250506.stm</ref> Women and girls in cultures which practice such seclusion are often confined to [[menstruation hut]]s, which are places of isolation used by cultures with strong menstrual [[taboo]]s.
