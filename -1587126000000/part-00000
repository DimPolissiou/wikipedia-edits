Season eight originally aired in the United States on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late night programming block, [[Adult Swim]]. Season eight premiered with the two-part episode \"[[Allen (Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1)|Allen]]\" on May 8, 2011, and May 15, 2011, respectively; and ended with \"Last Dance for Napkin Lad\" on July 24, 2011, with a total of ten episodes. The show is about the [[surreal humor|surreal]] adventures and antics of three [[anthropomorphic]] [[fast food]] items: [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]], who live together as roommates and frequently interact with their human next-door neighbor, [[Carl Brutananadilewski]] in a [[suburban]] neighborhood in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which is completely identical to their former [[New Jersey]] home seen in past seasons. In May 2015, this season became available on Hulu Plus.\n\nSeason eight is the first season in which the alternative titles for each season gag was set into place, starting with ''Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1''. Episodes in season eight were written and directed by [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]]. Almost every episode in this season features a special guest appearance, which continues a practice used in past seasons. Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro received [[Annie Award]] nominations for writing in the season eight episode, \"The Creditor\". This season has been made available on [[DVD]], and other forms of home media, including [[Video on demand|on demand]] streaming.\n\n==Production==\nEvery episode in this season was written and directed by series creators [[Dave Willis]] and [[Matt Maiellaro]], who have both written and directed every episode of the series. All episodes originally aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. As with most seasons, several episodes originally aired outside of their production order.\n\nDespite being the eighth season of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', the show itself was renamed ''Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1''. Along with the new name, the season featured a new theme song by [[Josh Homme]] and [[Alain Johannes]] as well as a new opening sequence. Co-creator [[Matt Maiellaro]] announced that for the 2012 season, the show's title would be changed again to ''Aqua Something You Know Whatever'' and that the producer's intention was to change the title every year.<ref>[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=36664] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825200733/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=36664 |date=August 25, 2012 }} Matt Maiellaro On \"Knowbodys\" & \"Aqua Teens\"</ref>\n\nThe song \"Big Foot\" from the [[Chickenfoot]] album ''[[Chickenfoot III]]'' was featured in the season eight episode \"Last Dance For Napkin Lad\".
