Among the horses stolen was \u00c9douard de Rothschild's champion [[Brant\u00f4me (horse)|Brant\u00f4me]] who was sent to the German National Stud. The horse was repatriated at the end of the war in 1945 and became a leading [[Father|sire]].\n\n==Effects of the German occupation, 1940\u201344==\nThe rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s National Socialist party in [[Germany]] and the subsequent [[Anschluss]] of [[Austria]] to [[Germany]] saw a wave of Jews, and others the [[Nazis]] labeled as \"undesirables,\" seek refuge in France. Most of these people escaped with little more than a suitcase of clothes. In March 1939, \u00c9douard's wife Germaine converted an old house near the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res]] into a hostel for some 150 of these displaced persons.  However, with the onset of [[World War II]] and the subsequent [[German occupation of France in World War II|German occupation of France]] in 1940, \u00c9douard de Rothschild and his family themselves chose to flee the country. In 1939, \u00c9douard's son Guy joined the [[French Army]] and his daughter Jacqueline escaped with her husband [[Gregor Piatigorsky]] to the [[United States]].  Before leaving, \u00c9douard de Rothschild tried to hide as much of his valuable art collection as possible, on the grounds of the Haras de Meautry farm and at his [[Ch\u00e2teau de Reux]].

Among the major races his horses won were:\n* [[Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe]] - (2) - ''[[Brantome (horse)|Brant\u00f4me]] (1934), [[Eclair au Chocolat]] (1938)''\n* [[Crit\u00e9rium de Saint-Cloud]] - (3) - ''Rocking Chair (1921), Tonnelle (1936) Tricam\u00e9ron (1938)''\n* [[Prix Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re|Crit\u00e9rium International]] - (4) - ''Flamant (1926), Godiche (1929), Brant\u00f4me (1933) T\u00e9l\u00e9f\u00e9rique (1936)''\n* [[Grand Prix de Paris]] - (2) - ''Sans Souci II (1907) Crudit\u00e9 (1935)''\n* [[Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud]] - (4) - ''Pr\u00e9dicateur (1913), Cadum (1925), Bubbles (1929) Geni\u00e8vre (1939)''\n* [[Poule d'Essai des Poulains]] - (2) ''Mont Blanc (1922) Brant\u00f4me (1934)''\n* [[Poule d'Essai des Pouliches]] - (4) - ''Flowershop (1920), Nephthys (1921), La Dame de Tr\u00e8fle (1925) Ligne de Fond(1932)''\n* [[Prix de Diane]] - (5) - ''Quenouille (1919), Flowershop (1920), Perruche Bleue (1932), Vendange (1933) P\u00e9niche (1935)''\n* [[Prix du Cadran]] - (5) - ''Pr\u00e9dicateur (1913), Cadum (1925), Cacao (1929), Brant\u00f4me (1935) Chaudi\u00e8re (1936)''\n* [[Prix Jacques le Marois]] - (3) - ''Ivain (1924), Vitamine (1927) Aromate (1935)''\n* [[Prix Morny]] - (2) - ''Justitia (1898) Brant\u00f4me (1933)''\n* [[Prix Lupin]] - (7) - ''Sans Souci (1907), Floraison (1912), Le Farina (1914), Bubbles (1928), Brantome (1934), Aromate (1935), Bacchus (1939)''\n* [[Prix Royal-Oak]] - (5) - ''St\u00e9arine (1919), Cacao (1928), Brant\u00f4me (1934), Bokbul (1935) Eclair au Chocolat (1938)''\n* [[Prix Vermeille]] - (2) - ''Stearine (1919) Tonnelle (1937)''\n\nDuring the [[German occupation of France in World War II]], the Nazis seized some of the best racehorses in the country, shipping more than six hundred of them to [[Germany]] for racing and/or breeding. Among the horses stolen was \u00c9douard de Rothschild's champion [[Brant\u00f4me (horse)|Brant\u00f4me]] who was sent to the German National Stud. The horse was repatriated at the end of the war in 1945 and became a leading [[Father|sire]].\n\n==Effects of the German occupation, 1940\u201344==\nThe rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s National Socialist party in [[Germany]] and the subsequent [[Anschluss]] of [[Austria]] to [[Germany]] saw a wave of Jews, and others the [[Nazis]] labeled as \"undesirables,\" seek refuge in France. Most of these people escaped with little more than a suitcase of clothes. In March 1939, \u00c9douard's wife Germaine converted an old house near the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res]] into a hostel for some 150 of these displaced persons.  However, with the onset of [[World War II]] and the subsequent [[German occupation of France in World War II|German occupation of France]] in 1940, \u00c9douard de Rothschild and his family themselves chose to flee the country. In 1939, \u00c9douard's son Guy joined the [[French Army]] and his daughter Jacqueline escaped with her husband [[Gregor Piatigorsky]] to the [[United States]].  Before leaving, \u00c9douard de Rothschild tried to hide as much of his valuable art collection as possible, on the grounds of the Haras de Meautry farm and at his [[Ch\u00e2teau de Reux]]. The Nazis confiscated his collection.<ref>{{cite news |author=[[Sara Houghteling]]  |title=Hunting for Looted Art in Paris  |work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nWith his wife and second daughter [[Bethsab\u00e9e de Rothschild|Bethsab\u00e9e]], he safely left France and they made their way to [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]] from where they were able to go by plane to [[New York City]].

{"title_page": "Stress management", "text_new": "'''Stress management''' iswide spectrum of techniques and [[psychotherapy|psychotherapies]] aimed at controlling a person's level of [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], especially [[chronic stress]], usually for the purpose of and for the motive of improving everyday functioning. In this context, the term 'stress' refers only to a stress with significant negative consequences, or [[distress (medicine)|distress]] in the terminology advocated by [[Hans Selye]], rather than what he calls [[eustress]], a stress whose consequences are helpful or otherwise.\n\nStress produces numerous physical and mental symptoms which vary according to each individual's situational factors. These can include physical health decline as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]].  The process of stress management is named as one of the keys to a happy and successful life in modern society.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | title=Stress Management: What can you do? | publisher=St. Louis Psychologists and Counseling Iwlkdkdjfjfnformation and Farts=Paul Susic MA Licensed Psychologist Candidate | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124092537/http://www.psychtreatment.com/stress_management.htm | archivedate=January 24, 2013 }}</ref> Although life provides numerous demands that can prove difficult to handle, stress management provides a number of ways to manage anxiety and maintain overall well-being.\n\nDespite stress often being thought of as a subjective experience, levels of stress are readily measurable, using various physiological tests, similar to those used in [[polygraph]]s.\n\nMany practical stress management techniques are available, some for use by [[health professional]]s and others, for [[self-help]], which may help an individual reduce their levels of stress, provide positive feelings of control over one's life and promote general [[well-being]]. Other stress reducing techniques involve adding a daily exercise routine, spending quality time with family and pets, meditation, finding a hobby, writing your thoughts, feelings, and moods down and also speaking with a trusted one about what is bothering you. It is very important to keep in mind that not all techniques are going to work the same for everyone, that is why trying different stress managing techniques is crucial in order to find what techniques work best for you. An example of this would be, two people on a roller coaster one can be screaming grabbing on to the bar while the other could be laughing while their hands are up in the air (Nisson). This is a perfect example of how stress effects everyone differently that is why they might need a different treatment. These techniques do not require doctors approval but seeing if a doctors technique works better for you is also very important.\n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in [[psychotherapy]], while others with less evidence favoring them are considered [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]].  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.\n\nThere are several [[Scientific modelling|model]]s of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress.  Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.\n\n==Historical foundations==\n[[Walter Cannon]] and [[Hans Selye]] used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.<ref>Cannon, W. (1939). The Wisdom of the Body, 2nd ed., NY: Norton Pubs.</ref><ref>{{cite journal| author=Selye, H| year=1950| title=Stress and the general adaptation syndrome| journal=Br. Med.

Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.\n\n==Models==\n\nThe generalized models are:\n* [[Fight-or-flight response|The emergency response/fight-or-flight response]] by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)\n* [[Stress (biology)#General adaptation syndrome|General Adaptation Syndrome]] by Hans Selye (1936)\n* Stress Model of Henry and Stephens (1977)\n* Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)\n* [[Conservation of resources theory|Theory of resource conservation]] by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll & Buchwald, 2004)\n\n===Transactional model===\n[[File: Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]\n[[Richard Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman suggested in 1981 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an \"imbalance between demands and resources\" or as occurring when \"pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope\". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.<ref>Lazarus, R.S., & Folkman, S. (1984). Stress, Appraisal, and Coping. New York: Springer.</ref>\n\nAmong the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:\n* Conflicts in company\n* The way employees are treated by their bosses/supervisors or company\n* Lack of job security\n* Company policies\n* Co-workers who don't do their fair share\n* Unclear expectations\n* Poor communication\n* Not enough control over assignments\n* Inadequate pay or benefits\n* Urgent deadlines\n* Too much work\n* Long hours\n* Uncomfortable physical conditions\n* Relationship conflicts\n* Co-workers making careless mistakes\n* Dealing with rude customers\n* Lack of co-operation\n* How the company treats co-workers<ref>Somaz, Wenk Heidi & Tulgan, Bruce (2003). Performance Under Pressure: Managing Stress in the Workplace.Canada. HRD Press Inc.p 7-8. {{ISBN|0-87425-741-7}}</ref>\n\nIn order to develop an effective stress management program, it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate [[coping skills]], then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressor. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressor and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of the types of stressors.\n\n===Health realization/innate health model===\nThe health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of [[Well being|well-being]] results from approaching the world with a \"quiet mind\".<ref>Mills, R.C. (1995). ''Realizing Mental Health: Toward a new Psychology of Resiliency.''

One way is through the use of psychological testing: ''The [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]]'' [two scales of measuring stress] is used to rate stressful life events, while the [[DASS (psychology)|DASS]] [Depression Anxiety Stress Scales] contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in [[blood pressure]] and [[galvanic skin response]] can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A [[digital thermometer]] can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the [[fight-or-flight response]] drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual.  This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.\n\n===Effectiveness===\nStress management has physiological and immune benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bower, J.

This type of stress is often misinterpreted for being a negative connotation. While this is the case in some circumstances, it is also a good thing to have some acute stress in life. Running or any other form of exercise is considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.<ref name=acute>{{cite journal|last=McGonagle|first=Katherine|author2=Ronald Kessler |title=Chronic Stress, Acute Stress, Depressive Symptoms|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=October 1990|volume=18|issue=5|pages=681\u2013706|doi=10.1007/BF00931237|pmid=2075897|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44026/1/10464_2004_Article_BF00931237.pdf|hdl=2027.42/117092}}</ref>\n\n===Chronic stress===\n[[Chronic stress]] is unlike acute stress. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time. [[Effects of stress on memory|Chronic stress can lead to memory loss]], damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. The severity varies from person to person and also gender difference can be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes.

Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress. However, each person is different and some people like the pressure to perform better. Stress in the workplace doesn't always have to be negatively viewed. Stress when delivered or viewed accordingly the performance of the worker can be good. The stressors may vary but stress can as a result of mental stability can be used in a more productive manor instead of a negative one. A stressor or influence of stress in the workplace can be Organization Commitment, which is the degree of a workers psyche mainly being the I.D. (A person's personality that strives to fulfil all needs and desires) being in a state of Affective, Continuance, or Normative. A worker who wants to stay at the company because they enjoy the job this is Affective, the worker who needs to stay at the job because of economic or social issues, this is Continuance, and the worker who feels obligated to stay on the job because of a raise or the boss is a good friend of theirs, this is Normative. Each of these Org. Commitments can cause good or bad stress; that is why managing or strengthening one's mental stability can make stress a positive and not a negative while in the workplace.<ref>[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1202105.pdf]</ref>\n\nSalary can be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems.

Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming the large number of medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.<ref name=caplan>{{cite journal|last=Caplan|first=R.P|title=Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Hospital Consultants, General Practitioners, and Senior Health Managers|journal=BMJ|date=November 1994|volume=309|pages=1261\u20131269|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6964.1261|pmid=7888846|pmc=2541798|issue=6964}}</ref>\n\n===Stress management programs===\nMany businesses today have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipments adapting to stress at the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Anti stress diary with adult coloring pages|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515213919/https://coloringnotebook.com/|archivedate=2017-05-15}}</ref> and stress relieving gadgets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|title=20 Gadgets to Help You Fight Stress - Hongkiat Magazine|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062941/http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|archivedate=2017-02-17|date=2016-07-14}}</ref> Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses today try to alleviate stress on their employees. One way is individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors in the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them in any way. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.\n\n[[Employee assistance programs]] can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individual stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.<ref name=Schultz>{{cite book|last=Schultz&Schultz|first=D|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=374}}</ref>\n\nAnother way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances of lots of stress is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.\n\nIntervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.<ref name=book>{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Sally|title=Occupational Stress: Personal & Professional Approaches|year=1998|publisher=Stanley Thornes ltd.|location=United Kingdom|pages=18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n===Aviation industry===\nAviation is a [[Stress in the aviation industry|high-stress industry]], given that it requires a high level of precision at all times.

Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.\n\nTo evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used.  The major types of measurement tools are:\n# Performance-based measures;\n# [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and\n# [[Physiological]] measures, like measurement of heart rate.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nImplementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====Measurement systems====\nThe most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily [[rating scale]]-based.  These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry.  Different systems may be utilised in different operational specialties.\n\n* The [[Perceived Stress Scale]] (PSS) \u2013 The PSS is a widely used subjective tool for measuring stress levels.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Langan-Fox |first=J |last2=Sankey |first2=M |last3=Canty |first3=JM |date=October 2009 |title=Human factors measurement for future air traffic control systems |journal=Human Factors |volume=51 |issue=5 |pages=595\u2013637 |doi=10.1177/0018720809355278 |pmid=20196289}}</ref>  It consists of 10 questions, and asks participants to rate, on a five-point scale, how stressed they felt after a certain event.

This is another subjective measure, asking participants to rate, on a five-point scale, the extent to which they use eight common coping skills:<ref name=\"auto2\"/> [[Substance abuse]], Emotional support, Instrumental support (help with tangible things, like child care, finances, or task sharing), Positive reframing (changing one's thinking about a negative event, and thinking of it as a positive instead), Self-blame, Planning, Humour and Religion. An individual's total score indicates the extent to which he or she is using effective, positive coping skills (like humor and emotional support); ineffective, negative coping skills (like substance abuse and self-blame); and where the individual could improve.\n* The Subjective Workload Assessment Technique (SWAT) \u2013 SWAT is a rating system used to measure individuals' perceived mental workload while performing a task, like developing instruments in a lab, multitasking aircraft duties, or conducting air defense.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite journal |last=Corwin |first=W.H. |date=1992-04-01 |title=In-flight and post flight assessment of pilot workload in commercial transport aircraft using the subjective workload assessment technique |journal=The International Journal of Aviation Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=77\u201393 |doi=10.1207/s15327108ijap0202_1}}</ref>  SWAT combines measurements and scaling techniques to develop a global rating scale.\n\n====Pilot stress report systems====\nEarly pilot stress report systems were adapted and modified from existing psychological questionnaires and surveys.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{Cite report |author=Young, James |date=December 2008 |title=The Effects of Life-Stress on Pilot Performance |url=http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |publisher=NASA Ames Research Center |pages=1\u20137 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305152852/http://humansystems.arc.nasa.gov/flightcognition/Publications/Young_TM2008_215375_final.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref>  The data from these pilot-specific surveys is then processed and analyzed through an aviation-focused system or scale.  Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress.  The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings. The questionnaire was able to reflect pilots' retroactive perceptions and the accuracy of these perceptions.<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Muller, Ronald |editor2=Andreas Wittmer |editor3=Christopher Drax |date=2014 |title=Aviation Risk and Safety Management: Methods and Applications In Aviation Organizations |url= |location= |publisher=Springer International |page= |isbn=978-3-319-02779-1}}</ref>\n\nAlkov, Borowsky, and Gaynor started a 22-item questionnaire for [[U.S. Naval]] aviators in 1982 to test the [[hypothesis]] that inadequate stress coping strategies contributed to flight mishaps.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The questionnaire consists of items related to lifestyle changes and personality characteristics.

Other stress reducing techniques involve adding a daily exercise routine, spending quality time with family and pets, meditation, finding a hobby, writing your thoughts, feelings, and moods down and also speaking with a trusted one about what is bothering you. It is very important to keep in mind that not all techniques are going to work the same for everyone, that is why trying different stress managing techniques is crucial in order to find what techniques work best for you. An example of this would be, two people on a roller coaster one can be screaming grabbing on to the bar while the other could be laughing while their hands are up in the air (Nisson). This is a perfect example of how stress effects everyone differently that is why they might need a different treatment. These techniques do not require doctors approval but seeing if a doctors technique works better for you is also very important.\n\nEvaluating the effectiveness of various stress management techniques can be difficult, as limited research currently exists. Consequently, the amount and quality of evidence for the various techniques varies widely. Some are accepted as effective treatments for use in [[psychotherapy]], while others with less evidence favoring them are considered [[alternative medicine|alternative therapies]].  Many professional organizations exist to promote and provide training in conventional or alternative therapies.\n\nThere are several [[Scientific modelling|model]]s of stress management, each with distinctive explanations of mechanisms for controlling stress.  Much more research is necessary to provide a better understanding of which mechanisms actually operate and are effective in practice.\n\n==Historical foundations==\n[[Walter Cannon]] and [[Hans Selye]] used animal studies to establish the earliest scientific basis for the study of stress. They measured the physiological responses of animals to external pressures, such as heat and cold, prolonged restraint, and surgical procedures, then extrapolated from these studies to human beings.<ref>Cannon, W.

Thus, stress was traditionally conceptualized to be a result of external insults beyond the control of those experiencing the stress. More recently, however, it has been argued that external circumstances do not have any intrinsic capacity to produce stress, but instead their effect is mediated by the individual's perceptions, capacities, and understanding.\n\n==Models==\n\nThe generalized models are:\n* [[Fight-or-flight response|The emergency response/fight-or-flight response]] by Walter Cannon (1914, 1932)\n* [[Stress (biology)#General adaptation syndrome|General Adaptation Syndrome]] by Hans Selye (1936)\n* Stress Model of Henry and Stephens (1977)\n* Transactional (or cognitive) Stress Model / stress model of Lazarus after Lazarus (1974)\n* [[Conservation of resources theory|Theory of resource conservation]] by Stevan Hobfoll (1988, 1998; Hobfoll & Buchwald, 2004)\n\n===Transactional model===\n[[File: Transactional Model of Stress and Coping - Richard Lazarus.svg|thumb|Transactional Model of Stress and Coping of Richard Lazarus]]\n[[Richard Lazarus]] and Susan Folkman suggested in 1981 that stress can be thought of as resulting from an \"imbalance between demands and resources\" or as occurring when \"pressure exceeds one's perceived ability to cope\". Stress management was developed and premised on the idea that stress is not a direct response to a stressor but rather one's resources and ability to cope mediate the stress response and are amenable to change, thus allowing stress to be controllable.<ref>Lazarus, R.S., & Folkman, S. (1984). Stress, Appraisal, and Coping. New York: Springer.</ref>\n\nAmong the many stressors mentioned by employees, these are the most common:\n* Conflicts in company\n* The way employees are treated by their bosses/supervisors or company\n* Lack of job security\n* Company policies\n* Co-workers who don't do their fair share\n* Unclear expectations\n* Poor communication\n* Not enough control over assignments\n* Inadequate pay or benefits\n* Urgent deadlines\n* Too much work\n* Long hours\n* Uncomfortable physical conditions\n* Relationship conflicts\n* Co-workers making careless mistakes\n* Dealing with rude customers\n* Lack of co-operation\n* How the company treats co-workers<ref>Somaz, Wenk Heidi & Tulgan, Bruce (2003). Performance Under Pressure: Managing Stress in the Workplace.Canada. HRD Press Inc.p 7-8. {{ISBN|0-87425-741-7}}</ref>\n\nIn order to develop an effective stress management program, it is first necessary to identify the factors that are central to a person controlling his/her stress and to identify the intervention methods which effectively target these factors. Lazarus and Folkman's interpretation of stress focuses on the transaction between people and their external environment (known as the Transactional Model). The model contends that stress may not be a stressor if the person does not perceive the stressor as a threat but rather as positive or even challenging. Also, if the person possesses or can use adequate [[coping skills]], then stress may not actually be a result or develop because of the stressor. The model proposes that people can be taught to manage their stress and cope with their stressors. They may learn to change their perspective of the stressor and provide them with the ability and confidence to improve their lives and handle all of the types of stressors.\n\n===Health realization/innate health model===\nThe health realization/innate health model of stress is also founded on the idea that stress does not necessarily follow the presence of a potential stressor. Instead of focusing on the individual's appraisal of so-called stressors in relation to his or her own coping skills (as the transactional model does), the health realization model focuses on the nature of thought, stating that it is ultimately a person's thought processes that determine the response to potentially stressful external circumstances. In this model, stress results from appraising oneself and one's circumstances through a mental filter of insecurity and negativity, whereas a feeling of [[Well being|well-being]] results from approaching the world with a \"quiet mind\".<ref>Mills, R.C.

A new [[time management|time schedule]] is worked up, and until the period of abnormally high, personal demand has passed, the normal frequency and duration of former schedules is limited.\n\nMany techniques [[Coping skill|cope]] with the stresses life brings.

One way is through the use of psychological testing: ''The [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]]'' [two scales of measuring stress] is used to rate stressful life events, while the [[DASS (psychology)|DASS]] [Depression Anxiety Stress Scales] contains a scale for stress based on self-report items. Changes in [[blood pressure]] and [[galvanic skin response]] can also be measured to test stress levels, and changes in stress levels. A [[digital thermometer]] can be used to evaluate changes in skin temperature, which can indicate activation of the [[fight-or-flight response]] drawing blood away from the extremities. Cortisol is the main hormone released during a stress response and measuring cortisol from hair will give a 60- to 90-day baseline stress level of an individual.  This method of measuring stress is currently the most popular method in the clinic.\n\n===Effectiveness===\nStress management has physiological and immune benefits.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Bower, J.

This type of stress is often misinterpreted for being a negative connotation. While this is the case in some circumstances, it is also a good thing to have some acute stress in life. Running or any other form of exercise is considered an acute stressor. Some exciting or exhilarating experiences such as riding a roller coaster is an acute stress but is usually very enjoyable. Acute stress is a short term stress and as a result, does not have enough time to do the damage that long term stress causes.<ref name=acute>{{cite journal|last=McGonagle|first=Katherine|author2=Ronald Kessler |title=Chronic Stress, Acute Stress, Depressive Symptoms|journal=American Journal of Community Psychology|date=October 1990|volume=18|issue=5|pages=681\u2013706|doi=10.1007/BF00931237|pmid=2075897|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/44026/1/10464_2004_Article_BF00931237.pdf|hdl=2027.42/117092}}</ref>\n\n===Chronic stress===\n[[Chronic stress]] is unlike acute stress. It has a wearing effect on people that can become a very serious health risk if it continues over a long period of time. [[Effects of stress on memory|Chronic stress can lead to memory loss]], damage spatial recognition and produce a decreased drive of eating. The severity varies from person to person and also gender difference can be an underlying factor. Women are able to take longer durations of stress than men without showing the same maladaptive changes. Men can deal with shorter stress duration better than women can but once males hit a certain threshold, the chances of them developing mental issues increases drastically.<ref name=hormones>{{cite journal|last=Bowman|first=Rachel|title=Chronic Stress Effects on Memory: Sex differences in performance|journal=Hormones and Behavior|date=January 2003|volume=43|issue=1|pages=48\u201359|doi=10.1016/S0018-506X(02)00022-3|pmid=12614634|last2=Beck|first2=Kevin D|last3=Luine|first3=Victoria N}}</ref>\n\n==Workplace==\nAll of us have some position in society, [[occupational stress|in the workplace]], within the family, economic status and so on. Unfortunately, most of us are unwilling to accept where we are. Instead, we wish we were somewhere else, usually at a higher position. Managing that stress becomes vital in order to keep up [[job performance]] as well as relationship with co-workers and employers.<ref name=Dailybsness.com>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310012706/http://www.dailybsness.com/en-wiki/7_tips_to_prevent_and_reduce_work_stress |archivedate=2016-03-10 }}</ref> For some workers, changing the work environment relieves work stress. Making the environment less competitive between employees decreases some amounts of stress. However, each person is different and some people like the pressure to perform better. Stress in the workplace doesn't always have to be negatively viewed. Stress when delivered or viewed accordingly the performance of the worker can be good. The stressors may vary but stress can as a result of mental stability can be used in a more productive manor instead of a negative one. A stressor or influence of stress in the workplace can be Organization Commitment, which is the degree of a workers psyche mainly being the I.D. (A person's personality that strives to fulfil all needs and desires) being in a state of Affective, Continuance, or Normative. A worker who wants to stay at the company because they enjoy the job this is Affective, the worker who needs to stay at the job because of economic or social issues, this is Continuance, and the worker who feels obligated to stay on the job because of a raise or the boss is a good friend of theirs, this is Normative. Each of these Org. Commitments can cause good or bad stress; that is why managing or strengthening one's mental stability can make stress a positive and not a negative while in the workplace.<ref>[https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1202105.pdf]</ref>\n\nSalary can be an important concern of employees. Salary can affect the way people work because they can aim for promotion and in result, a higher salary. This can lead to chronic stress.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nCultural differences have also shown to have some major effects on stress coping problems. Eastern Asian employees may deal with certain work situations differently from how a Western North American employee would.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn order to manage stress in the workplace, employers can provide stress managing programs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|title=Workplace Stress Management Resource - OFAI|website=www.ofai.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327200411/http://www.ofai.co.uk/office-stress-management.html|archivedate=2016-03-27}}</ref> such as [[therapy]], communication programs, and a more flexible work schedule.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|title=Avoiding change-induced stress in the workplace \u2014 Nordic Labour Journal|last=lars|website=www.nordiclabourjournal.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824145833/http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2013/article.2013-05-22.9197628529|archivedate=2013-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Medical environment===\n\nA study was done on the stress levels in general practitioners and hospital consultants in 1999. Over 500 medical employees participated in this study done by R.P Caplan. These results showed that 47% of the workers scored high on their questionnaire for high levels of stress. 27% of the general practitioners even scored to be very depressed. These numbers came to a surprise to Dr. Caplan and it showed how alarming the large number of medical workers become stressed out because of their jobs. Managers stress levels were not as high as the actual practitioners themselves. An eye opening statistic showed that nearly 54% of workers suffered from anxiety while being in the hospital. Although this was a small sample size for hospitals around the world, Caplan feels this trend is probably fairly accurate across the majority of hospitals.<ref name=caplan>{{cite journal|last=Caplan|first=R.P|title=Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Hospital Consultants, General Practitioners, and Senior Health Managers|journal=BMJ|date=November 1994|volume=309|pages=1261\u20131269|doi=10.1136/bmj.309.6964.1261|pmid=7888846|pmc=2541798|issue=6964}}</ref>\n\n===Stress management programs===\nMany businesses today have begun to use stress management programs for employees who are having trouble adapting to stress at the workplace or at home. Some companies provide special equipments adapting to stress at the workplace to their employees, like coloring diaries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coloringnotebook.com|title=Anti stress diary with adult coloring pages|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515213919/https://coloringnotebook.com/|archivedate=2017-05-15}}</ref> and stress relieving gadgets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|title=20 Gadgets to Help You Fight Stress - Hongkiat Magazine|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062941/http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/fight-stress-gadgets/|archivedate=2017-02-17|date=2016-07-14}}</ref> Many people have spill over stress from home into their working environment. There are a couple of ways businesses today try to alleviate stress on their employees. One way is individual intervention. This starts off by monitoring the stressors in the individual. After monitoring what causes the stress, next is attacking that stressor and trying to figure out ways to alleviate them in any way. Developing social support is vital in individual intervention, being with others to help you cope has proven to be a very effective way to avoid stress. Avoiding the stressors altogether is the best possible way to get rid of stress but that is very difficult to do in the workplace. Changing behavioral patterns, may in turn, help reduce some of the stress that is put on at work as well.\n\n[[Employee assistance programs]] can include in-house counseling programs on managing stress. Evaluative research has been conducted on EAPs that teach individual stress control and inoculation techniques such as relaxation, biofeedback, and cognitive restructuring. Studies show that these programs can reduce the level of physiological arousal associated with high stress. Participants who master behavioral and cognitive stress-relief techniques report less tension, fewer sleep disturbances, and an improved ability to cope with workplace stressors.<ref name=Schultz>{{cite book|last=Schultz&Schultz|first=D|title=Psychology and work today|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|page=374}}</ref>\n\nAnother way of reducing stress at work is by simply changing the workload for an employee. Some may be too overwhelmed that they have so much work to get done, or some also may have such little work that they are not sure what to do with themselves at work. Improving communications between employees also sounds like a simple approach, but it is very effective for helping reduce stress. Sometimes making the employee feel like they are a bigger part of the company, such as giving them a voice in bigger situations shows that you trust them and value their opinion. Having all the employees mesh well together is a very underlying factor which can take away much of workplace stress. If employees fit well together and feed off of each other, the chances of lots of stress is very minimal. Lastly, changing the physical qualities of the workplace may reduce stress. Changing things such as the lighting, air temperature, odor, and up to date technology.\n\nIntervention is broken down into three steps: primary, secondary, tertiary. Primary deals with eliminating the stressors altogether. Secondary deals with detecting stress and figuring out ways to cope with it and improving stress management skills. Finally, tertiary deals with recovery and rehabbing the stress altogether. These three steps are usually the most effective way to deal with stress not just in the workplace, but overall.<ref name=book>{{cite book|last=Hardy|first=Sally|title=Occupational Stress: Personal & Professional Approaches|year=1998|publisher=Stanley Thornes ltd.|location=United Kingdom|pages=18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n===Aviation industry===\nAviation is a [[Stress in the aviation industry|high-stress industry]], given that it requires a high level of precision at all times.

Stress measurement tools can then help aviators identify which stressors are most problematic for them, and help them improve on managing workloads, planning tasks, and coping with stress more effectively.\n\nTo evaluate workload, a number of tools can be used.  The major types of measurement tools are:\n# Performance-based measures;\n# [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] measures, like questionnaires which aviators answer themselves; and\n# [[Physiological]] measures, like measurement of heart rate.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nImplementation of evaluation tools requires time, instruments for measurement, and software for collecting data.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n====Measurement systems====\nThe most commonly used stress measurement systems are primarily [[rating scale]]-based.  These systems tend to be complex, containing multiple levels with a variety of sections, to attempt to capture the many stressors present in the aviation industry.

Pilot-oriented questionnaires are generally designed to study work stress or home stress.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Self-report can also be used to measure a combination of home stress, work stress, and perceived performance. A study conducted by Fiedler, Della Rocco, Schroeder and Nguyen (2000) used Sloan and Cooper's modification of the Alkov questionnaire to explore aviators' perceptions of the relationship between different types of stress.  The results indicated that pilots believed performance was impaired when home stress carried over to the work environment. The degree of home stress that carried over to work environment was significantly and negatively related to flying performance items, such as planning, control, and accuracy of landings.

For any nonzero [[prime ideal]] <math>\\mathfrak p</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, we have <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak p}</math> for all <math>\\alpha</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)</math> is the norm of the [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] <math>\\mathfrak p</math>. (This generalizes Fermat's little theorem, that <math>m^p \\equiv m \\bmod p</math> for all integers ''m'' when ''p'' is prime.) Call a nonzero ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math> Carmichael if it is not a prime ideal and <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak a}</math> for all <math>\\alpha \\in {\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)</math> is the norm of the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math>.  When ''K'' is <math>\\mathbf Q</math>, the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> is [[Principal ideal|principal]], and if we let ''a'' be its positive generator then the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a = (a)</math> is Carmichael exactly when ''a'' is a Carmichael number in the usual sense.\n\nWhen ''K'' is larger than the [[Rational number|rational]]s it is easy to write down Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>: for any prime number ''p'' that splits completely in ''K'', the principal ideal <math>p{\\mathcal O}_K</math> is a Carmichael ideal. Since infinitely many prime numbers split completely in any number field, there are infinitely many Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>. For example, if ''p'' is any prime number that is 1 mod 4, the ideal (''p'') in the [[Gaussian integer]]s '''Z'''[{{space|hair}}''i''{{space|hair}}] is a Carmichael ideal.\n\nBoth prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality:\n:<math>\\gcd \\left(\\sum_{x=1}^{n-1} x^{n-1}, n\\right) = 1.</math>\n\n==Lucas\u2013Carmichael number==\n\n{{main|Lucas\u2013Carmichael number}}\n\nA positive composite integer <math>n</math> is a Lucas\u2013Carmichael number if and only if <math>n</math> is [[square-free integer|square-free]], and for all [[prime divisor]]s <math>p</math> of <math>n</math>, it is true that <math>p + 1 \\mid n + 1</math>.

The identity is the only '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] [[endomorphism]] on '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> so we can restate the definition as asking that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> be an algebra endomorphism of '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>.\nAs above, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfies the same property whenever ''n'' is prime.\n\nThe ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is also defined on any '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra '''A'''. A theorem states that ''n'' is prime if and only if all such functions ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> are algebra endomorphisms.\n\nIn-between these two conditions lies the definition of '''Carmichael number of order m''' for any positive integer ''m'' as any composite number ''n'' such that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is an endomorphism on every '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra that can be generated as '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[module (mathematics)|module]] by ''m'' elements.

For any nonzero [[prime ideal]] <math>\\mathfrak p</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, we have <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak p}</math> for all <math>\\alpha</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak p)</math> is the norm of the [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] <math>\\mathfrak p</math>. (This generalizes Fermat's little theorem, that <math>m^p \\equiv m \\bmod p</math> for all integers ''m'' when ''p'' is prime.) Call a nonzero ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math> Carmichael if it is not a prime ideal and <math>\\alpha^{{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)} \\equiv \\alpha \\bmod {\\mathfrak a}</math> for all <math>\\alpha \\in {\\mathcal O}_K</math>, where <math>{\\rm N}(\\mathfrak a)</math> is the norm of the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math>.  When ''K'' is <math>\\mathbf Q</math>, the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a</math> is [[Principal ideal|principal]], and if we let ''a'' be its positive generator then the ideal <math>\\mathfrak a = (a)</math> is Carmichael exactly when ''a'' is a Carmichael number in the usual sense.\n\nWhen ''K'' is larger than the [[Rational number|rational]]s it is easy to write down Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>: for any prime number ''p'' that splits completely in ''K'', the principal ideal <math>p{\\mathcal O}_K</math> is a Carmichael ideal. Since infinitely many prime numbers split completely in any number field, there are infinitely many Carmichael ideals in <math>{\\mathcal O}_K</math>. For example, if ''p'' is any prime number that is 1 mod 4, the ideal (''p'') in the [[Gaussian integer]]s '''Z'''[{{space|hair}}''i''{{space|hair}}] is a Carmichael ideal.\n\nBoth prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality:\n:<math>\\gcd \\left(\\sum_{x=1}^{n-1} x^{n-1}, n\\right) = 1.</math>\n\n==Lucas\u2013Carmichael number==\n\n{{main|Lucas\u2013Carmichael number}}\n\nA positive composite integer <math>n</math> is a Lucas\u2013Carmichael number if and only if <math>n</math> is [[square-free integer|square-free]], and for all [[prime divisor]]s <math>p</math> of <math>n</math>, it is true that <math>p + 1 \\mid n + 1</math>.

The identity is the only '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-[[algebra over a field|algebra]] [[endomorphism]] on '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> so we can restate the definition as asking that ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> be an algebra endomorphism of '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>.\nAs above, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> satisfies the same property whenever ''n'' is prime.\n\nThe ''n''th-power-raising function ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> is also defined on any '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub>-algebra '''A'''.

The most important part of the structure is the E-ring which interacts from three different positions with the enzyme. The hydroxyl group in position 20 forms hydrogen bond to the side chain on [[aspartic acid]] number [[Peptide sequence|533]] (Asp533) in the enzyme. It is critical that the [[Molecular configuration|configuration]] of the chiral [[carbon]] is (S) because (R) is inactive. The lactone is bonded with two hydrogen bonds to the [[amino]] groups on [[arginine]] 364 (Arg364).\nThe D-ring interacts with the +1 [[cytosine]] on non-cleaved strand and stabilizes the topo I-DNA covalent complex by forming hydrogen bond.

The open ring form is inactive and it must therefore be closed to inhibit topo I. The closed form is favored in acidic condition, as it is in many cancer [[Cell (biology)|cells]] microenvironment.\nCPT is transported into the cell by [[Passive transport|passive diffusion]]. Cellular uptake is favored by [[lipophilicity]], which enhances [[intracellular]] accumulation.\nLipophilicity makes [[Chemical compound|compounds]] more stable because of improved lactone partitioning into [[red blood cells]] and consequently less hydrolysis of the lactone.\nCPT has affinity for human serum albumin (HSA), especially the carboxylate form of CPT. Because of that, the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the lactone ring and the carboxylate form is driven toward the carboxylate. Reduced drug-HSA [[chemical interaction|interactions]] could result in improved activity.<ref name=\" D.J.Adams_2005\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\">{{Cite journal|author1=F. Zunino |author2=S.

Enlargement of the lactone ring by one [[methylene bridge|{{chem|CH|2}} unit]] also enhances its abilities, as in homocamptothecin. Substitution at position 12 and 14 leads to inactive derivative.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\n===A- and B-ring modification===\n\n==== Alkyl substitution ====\n[[Alkyl]] substitution at position 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as [[Ethyl group|ethyl]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) or chloromethyl (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl). These groups are able to react with the DNA in the presence of topo I which leads to more [[tumor]] activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased lipophilicity and consequently greater potency and stability in human [[Blood plasma|plasma]].<ref name=\" D.J.Adams_2005\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\nOther 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent inihibitors on topo I and both have alkylsilyl groups in position 7 which make them lipophilic and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the [[blood brain barrier]]. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and is among the most active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome [[drug resistance]]. Still another route to make CPT\u2019s lipophilic is to introduce lipophilic substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\nBasic [[nitrogen]] in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more [[hydrophilic]] and hence more water-soluble. For example, is a derivate called CKD-602, which is a potent topo I inhibitor and successfully overcomes the poor water solubility and toxicity seen with CPT.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/><ref name=\" M. K. Chung _2006\">{{Cite journal|author1=M. K. Chung |author2=S. S. Han |author3=J. C.

But these compounds are relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions, which causes difficulty in administrations. [[Methoxy]] group at both position 10 and 11 simultaneously leads to inactivity.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\n====Hexacyclic CPT analogues====\nHexacyclic CPT analogues have shown great potency. For example, [[methylenedioxy]] or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 membered ring which leads to more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The reason is the unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\nAdding amino or chloro group at 9th position or chloromethyl group at 7th position to these 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues results in compounds with even greater cytotoxicity but weaker solubility in water. To yield 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues with good water solubility a good way is to introduce a water solubilising substituent at position 7.  Lurtotecan meets those requirements; it\u2019s a 10, 11-ethylenedioxy analogue with a 4-methylpiperazino-methylene at position 7 and has shown a great potency in clinical researches.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/>\n\nA ring can also be formed between position 7 and 9, like position 10 and 11. That gives new opportunities to make water-soluble derivatives [5]. These hexacyclic CPT become more active when electron-withdrawing groups are put in position 11 and methyl or amino groups at 10. Exatecan is an example of hexacyclic CPT that has a 6 membered ring over position 7 and 9, and is 10-methyl, 11-fluoro substituted [4]. It is water-soluble and more potent than topotecan.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/><ref name=\" M. Palumbo _2001\">{{Cite journal|author1=M. Palumbo |author2=C.

Replacement in any position results in much less potent compound than parent compound in other cytotoxicity assay.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/>\n\n[[File:Homocamptothecin.svg|thumb|250 px|Homocamptothecin]]\n\n===E-ring modifications===\nThe E-ring doesn\u2019t allow many structural changes without losing CPT activity. One possible replacement is changing the hydroxyl group to Cl, F or Br because their [[polarizability]] is sufficient to stabilize the enzyme-complex.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\nAnother possible modification is to insert a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven membered \u03b2-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT). The hCPT\u2019s hydroxyl has less [[inductive effect]] on the carboxyl group which makes the lactone very reactive. This enhances the interaction of the free hydroxyl group optimally with topo I and the covalent complex that forms in its presence are more stable.

The open ring form is inactive and it must therefore be closed to inhibit topo I. The closed form is favored in acidic condition, as it is in many cancer [[Cell (biology)|cells]] microenvironment.\nCPT is transported into the cell by [[Passive transport|passive diffusion]]. Cellular uptake is favored by [[lipophilicity]], which enhances [[intracellular]] accumulation.\nLipophilicity makes [[Chemical compound|compounds]] more stable because of improved lactone partitioning into [[red blood cells]] and consequently less hydrolysis of the lactone.\nCPT has affinity for human serum albumin (HSA), especially the carboxylate form of CPT. Because of that, the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the lactone ring and the carboxylate form is driven toward the carboxylate. Reduced drug-HSA [[chemical interaction|interactions]] could result in improved activity.<ref name=\" D.J.Adams_2005\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\">{{Cite journal|author1=F. Zunino |author2=S.

Enlargement of the lactone ring by one [[methylene bridge|{{chem|CH|2}} unit]] also enhances its abilities, as in homocamptothecin. Substitution at position 12 and 14 leads to inactive derivative.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\n===A- and B-ring modification===\n\n==== Alkyl substitution ====\n[[Alkyl]] substitution at position 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as [[Ethyl group|ethyl]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) or chloromethyl (CH<sub>2</sub>Cl). These groups are able to react with the DNA in the presence of topo I which leads to more [[tumor]] activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased lipophilicity and consequently greater potency and stability in human [[Blood plasma|plasma]].<ref name=\" D.J.Adams_2005\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\nOther 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent inihibitors on topo I and both have alkylsilyl groups in position 7 which make them lipophilic and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the [[blood brain barrier]]. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and is among the most active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome [[drug resistance]]. Still another route to make CPT\u2019s lipophilic is to introduce lipophilic substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\nBasic [[nitrogen]] in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more [[hydrophilic]] and hence more water-soluble. For example, is a derivate called CKD-602, which is a potent topo I inhibitor and successfully overcomes the poor water solubility and toxicity seen with CPT.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/><ref name=\" M. K. Chung _2006\">{{Cite journal|author1=M. K. Chung |author2=S. S. Han |author3=J. C.

But these compounds are relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions, which causes difficulty in administrations. [[Methoxy]] group at both position 10 and 11 simultaneously leads to inactivity.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\n====Hexacyclic CPT analogues====\nHexacyclic CPT analogues have shown great potency. For example, [[methylenedioxy]] or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 membered ring which leads to more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The reason is the unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\nAdding amino or chloro group at 9th position or chloromethyl group at 7th position to these 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues results in compounds with even greater cytotoxicity but weaker solubility in water. To yield 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues with good water solubility a good way is to introduce a water solubilising substituent at position 7.  Lurtotecan meets those requirements; it\u2019s a 10, 11-ethylenedioxy analogue with a 4-methylpiperazino-methylene at position 7 and has shown a great potency in clinical researches.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/>\n\nA ring can also be formed between position 7 and 9, like position 10 and 11. That gives new opportunities to make water-soluble derivatives [5]. These hexacyclic CPT become more active when electron-withdrawing groups are put in position 11 and methyl or amino groups at 10. Exatecan is an example of hexacyclic CPT that has a 6 membered ring over position 7 and 9, and is 10-methyl, 11-fluoro substituted [4]. It is water-soluble and more potent than topotecan.<ref name=\" H. Ulukan _2002\"/><ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/><ref name=\" M. Palumbo _2001\">{{Cite journal|author1=M. Palumbo |author2=C.

Replacement in any position results in much less potent compound than parent compound in other cytotoxicity assay.<ref name=\" H.

One possible replacement is changing the hydroxyl group to Cl, F or Br because their [[polarizability]] is sufficient to stabilize the enzyme-complex.<ref name=\" F. Zunino _2002\"/>\n\nAnother possible modification is to insert a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven membered \u03b2-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT). The hCPT\u2019s hydroxyl has less [[inductive effect]] on the carboxyl group which makes the lactone very reactive. This enhances the interaction of the free hydroxyl group optimally with topo I and the covalent complex that forms in its presence are more stable.

Its chief tenant is [[The New York Times Company]], [[publisher]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as well as the ''[[International New York Times]]'', and other newspapers. Construction was by a joint venture of The New York Times Company, [[Forest City Ratner]] ([[Forest City Enterprises]]'s New York subsidiary), and [[ING Group|ING Real Estate]]. {{As of|2018}}, The New York Times Building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|eleventh-tallest building in the city]], tied with the [[Chrysler Building]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/real-estate/tallest-buildings-in-nyc-1.9216740|title=12 tallest skyscrapers in New York City|work=am New York|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Previous sites===\nThe original newspaper headquarters in 1851 were at 113 Nassau Street, then a few years later at 138 Nassau Street. In 1858, the Times moved to a five-story edifice at 41 Park Row; thirty years later, partially in response to a new tower erected by the competing ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', it commissioned a new [[New York Times Building (41 Park Row)|13-story building at the same site]], one that remains in use by [[Pace University]]. In 1904, again partially in response to the [[Herald Square]] headquarters of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', the paper moved to perhaps its most famous location, the [[One Times Square|Times Tower]], on the site of the [[Pabst Hotel]]. The name of the surrounding area changed from [[Longacre Square]] to [[Times Square]]. The paper outgrew the slender tower within a decade and, in 1913, moved into the Times Annex at [[229 West 43rd Street]], where it remained for almost a century.<ref>[[David W.

The project, in conjunction with the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|Hearst Tower]], represented the further westward expansion of Midtown along Eighth Avenue, a corridor that had seen no construction since the 1989 completion of [[One Worldwide Plaza]]. The new building\u2014called by many New Yorkers \"The New Times Tower\"\u2014also kept the paper in the [[Times Square]] area, its namesake.\n\nThe site for the building was obtained by the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] (ESDC) through [[eminent domain]]. With a mandate to acquire and redevelop [[urban decay|blighted]] properties in Times Square, ten buildings were condemned by the ESDC and purchased from their owners. Some owners sued, asserting that the area was no longer blighted, but lost in court.<ref name=\"nyt_20011025\">{{Cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|authorlink=David W.

The rod spacing increases from the base to the top, adding transparency as the building rises. The steel framing and bracing is exposed at the four corner \"notches\" of the building.<ref name=\"gostructural_20040615\">{{Cite news | title=A statement in steel: The New York Times Building | newspaper=GoStructural.com | date=2004-06-15 | url=http://www.gostructural.com/article.asp?id=603 | accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref>\n\n<div align=center><gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"180px\">\nNYTimes Building under construction.jpg|The building under construction in September 2006\nAtrium NY Times Building jeh.JPG|Ground floor atrium\nNew York Times Building 0210.JPG|The main entrance on Eighth Avenue\nNew York Times newsroom.jpg|The New York Times fake newsroom\n</gallery></div>\n\n=== Sustainability ===\nThe new building is promoted as a [[Sustainability|green]] structure. The design incorporates numerous environmentally sustainable features for increased energy efficiency. The double-skin curtain wall, automated louver shading system, dimmable lighting system, [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] and [[cogeneration]] are the main sustainable design features.<ref name=\"sciencebeat_20040217\">{{Cite news | title=The New York Times Building: Designing for Energy Efficiency Through Daylighting Research | newspaper=Science Beat | date=2004-02-17 | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb-EETD-NYT-building.html | accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref><ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\">{{cite journal |last=Jambhekar |first=S.|date=10 October 2004|title=Times Square Skyscrapers: Sustainability Reaching New Heights |url=http://ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Repository/Jambhekar_2004_TimesSquareSkyscrapers.587097b5-3224-45e1-8b38-fb1110b12bf4.pdf|publisher=CTBUH Conference, Seoul|accessdate=10 October 2004}}</ref>\n\n====Double-skin curtain wall====\n\nThe use of floor-to-ceiling glass maximizes light and views for people inside and outside the building. The horizontal white ceramic rods on the building facade, which are spaced to allow occupants to have unobstructed views while both seated and standing, act as an aesthetic veil and a sun shade. They are made of aluminum silicate, an extremely dense and high-quality ceramic chosen for its durability and cost-effectiveness. Glazed with a finish similar to the material used on terra cotta to reflect light, self-clean, and resist weather, the rods change color with the sun and weather. Additionally, the automated louver shades move in response to the position of the sun and inputs from sensors, blocking light to reduce glare or allowing it to enter at times of less direct sunlight. The moveable shades reduce energy consumption about 13% by reducing solar heat gain by 30%.<ref name=\"sciencebeat_20040217\" /><ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\"/>\n\n====Lighting system====\n\nIn a normal office building, lights usually consume about 44% of total energy. The NYT building uses less, because its design, lighting, and shading systems allow the sun to be the main source of light. Each of the more than 18,000 [[electrical ballast]]s in the lighting system contains a computer chip, allowing each room's lights to brighten or dim depending on whether a room is occupied and how bright the sun is.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Times Building Sustainable Systems|url=http://kaitybadlato.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/new-york-times-building-sustainable-systems/}}</ref>\n\n====Underfloor air distribution====\n\nThe New York Times Company utilizes an [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] (UFAD) which strives for better [[indoor air quality]], [[thermal comfort]] as well as energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core and then into the six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a hot water coil. In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense.<ref name=\"POE\" /><ref name=\"UFAD\">{{cite report |title=Underfloor Air Distribution in a Commercial High Rise:The New York Times Headquarters |publisher=National Conference on Building Commissioning |date=May 2007| url=http://www.bcxa.org/ncbc/2007/proceedings/English_NCBC2007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Cogeneration on site====\n\nThe New York Times Building incorporates a [[cogeneration]] plant to supply its 24-7 operation and 40% of the power used. Located in a mechanical room at the far end of the podium\u2019s top floor, the plant consists of two natural gas fired reciprocating engine driven generators with a total generating capacity of 1.5 MW of electrical power. It recovers the heat produced by combustion and converts the heat into usable energy in the form of hot water. The recovered hot water serves as the building\u2019s heating loop to provide warmth during the winter and functions as a refrigeration machine to provide cooling during the summer. The power from the grid is solely used by the building as a backup source.<ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\" />\n\n====Other features====\n\nIn excess of 95% of the structural steel was recycled. The building, like many in [[Midtown Manhattan]], has no on-site parking, with most employees arriving by [[public transit]].<ref name=\"streetsblog_20071206\">{{cite web | title=New York Times Employees Say Renzo Forgot the Bike Parking | date=2007-12-06 | url=http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/12/06/new-york-times-employees-say-renzo-forgot-the-bike-parking/#more-2983 | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Overall performance====\n\nA team of researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley National Lab]] and [[Center for the Built Environment]] monitored the building\u2019s performance for a year and compared the results with buildings that meet with the standard building efficiency codes. They found that the New York Times Building significantly reduced annual electricity, cut heating energy use by more than 50% and decrease the peak electric demand as well. \"It is essential to start with a sound, integrated building design, and then to pay attention to details such as procurement of building equipment, and verifying the proper performance of the equipment after it is installed.

Its chief tenant is [[The New York Times Company]], [[publisher]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as well as the ''[[International New York Times]]'', and other newspapers. Construction was by a joint venture of The New York Times Company, [[Forest City Ratner]] ([[Forest City Enterprises]]'s New York subsidiary), and [[ING Group|ING Real Estate]]. {{As of|2018}}, The New York Times Building is the [[List of tallest buildings in New York City|eleventh-tallest building in the city]], tied with the [[Chrysler Building]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.amny.com/real-estate/tallest-buildings-in-nyc-1.9216740|title=12 tallest skyscrapers in New York City|work=am New York|access-date=February 20, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Previous sites===\nThe original newspaper headquarters in 1851 were at 113 Nassau Street, then a few years later at 138 Nassau Street. In 1858, the Times moved to a five-story edifice at 41 Park Row; thirty years later, partially in response to a new tower erected by the competing ''[[New-York Tribune]]'', it commissioned a new [[New York Times Building (41 Park Row)|13-story building at the same site]], one that remains in use by [[Pace University]]. In 1904, again partially in response to the [[Herald Square]] headquarters of the ''[[New York Herald]]'', the paper moved to perhaps its most famous location, the [[One Times Square|Times Tower]], on the site of the [[Pabst Hotel]]. The name of the surrounding area changed from [[Longacre Square]] to [[Times Square]]. The paper outgrew the slender tower within a decade and, in 1913, moved into the Times Annex at [[229 West 43rd Street]], where it remained for almost a century.<ref>[[David W.

The project, in conjunction with the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|Hearst Tower]], represented the further westward expansion of Midtown along Eighth Avenue, a corridor that had seen no construction since the 1989 completion of [[One Worldwide Plaza]]. The new building\u2014called by many New Yorkers \"The New Times Tower\"\u2014also kept the paper in the [[Times Square]] area, its namesake.\n\nThe site for the building was obtained by the [[Empire State Development Corporation]] (ESDC) through [[eminent domain]]. With a mandate to acquire and redevelop [[urban decay|blighted]] properties in Times Square, ten buildings were condemned by the ESDC and purchased from their owners. Some owners sued, asserting that the area was no longer blighted, but lost in court.<ref name=\"nyt_20011025\">{{Cite news|last=Dunlap|first=David W.|authorlink=David W.

The design incorporates numerous environmentally sustainable features for increased energy efficiency. The double-skin curtain wall, automated louver shading system, dimmable lighting system, [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] and [[cogeneration]] are the main sustainable design features.<ref name=\"sciencebeat_20040217\">{{Cite news | title=The New York Times Building: Designing for Energy Efficiency Through Daylighting Research | newspaper=Science Beat | date=2004-02-17 | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sb-EETD-NYT-building.html | accessdate=2007-11-29}}</ref><ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\">{{cite journal |last=Jambhekar |first=S.|date=10 October 2004|title=Times Square Skyscrapers: Sustainability Reaching New Heights |url=http://ctbuh.org/Portals/0/Repository/Jambhekar_2004_TimesSquareSkyscrapers.587097b5-3224-45e1-8b38-fb1110b12bf4.pdf|publisher=CTBUH Conference, Seoul|accessdate=10 October 2004}}</ref>\n\n====Double-skin curtain wall====\n\nThe use of floor-to-ceiling glass maximizes light and views for people inside and outside the building. The horizontal white ceramic rods on the building facade, which are spaced to allow occupants to have unobstructed views while both seated and standing, act as an aesthetic veil and a sun shade. They are made of aluminum silicate, an extremely dense and high-quality ceramic chosen for its durability and cost-effectiveness. Glazed with a finish similar to the material used on terra cotta to reflect light, self-clean, and resist weather, the rods change color with the sun and weather. Additionally, the automated louver shades move in response to the position of the sun and inputs from sensors, blocking light to reduce glare or allowing it to enter at times of less direct sunlight. The moveable shades reduce energy consumption about 13% by reducing solar heat gain by 30%.<ref name=\"sciencebeat_20040217\" /><ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\"/>\n\n====Lighting system====\n\nIn a normal office building, lights usually consume about 44% of total energy. The NYT building uses less, because its design, lighting, and shading systems allow the sun to be the main source of light. Each of the more than 18,000 [[electrical ballast]]s in the lighting system contains a computer chip, allowing each room's lights to brighten or dim depending on whether a room is occupied and how bright the sun is.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Times Building Sustainable Systems|url=http://kaitybadlato.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/new-york-times-building-sustainable-systems/}}</ref>\n\n====Underfloor air distribution====\n\nThe New York Times Company utilizes an [[Underfloor air distribution|underfloor air distribution system]] (UFAD) which strives for better [[indoor air quality]], [[thermal comfort]] as well as energy saving. The conditioned air from the air handler is delivered through an air highway system that circumnavigates the service core and then into the six zoned off underfloor low pressure zones for distribution across the floor plate to all floor diffusers. Around each perimeter a series of fan power boxes control the temperature in the space. If heating is required then the fans turn on delivering heat via a hot water coil. In cooling mode, the fans operate to give increased ventilation around the perimeter spaces. Fresh air is supplied by two air handling units on the 28th floor sending fresh treated outside air to each floor where a constant volume VAV controls the amount of air entering the system. The air is then conditioned for proper cooling and humidity before being sent to the air highway. The New York Times Building also benefits from other general UFAD advantages. In the open plan office space that was implemented in occupied space from 2nd to 21st floors to enhance daylighting and outdoor views, the system provides flexibility to place the required equipment anywhere on the raised integrated service plenum. When departments or occupants needed to be reconfigured, the raised floor also enables maintenance to carry out changes at relatively lower expense.<ref name=\"POE\" /><ref name=\"UFAD\">{{cite report |title=Underfloor Air Distribution in a Commercial High Rise:The New York Times Headquarters |publisher=National Conference on Building Commissioning |date=May 2007| url=http://www.bcxa.org/ncbc/2007/proceedings/English_NCBC2007.pdf}}</ref>\n\n====Cogeneration on site====\n\nThe New York Times Building incorporates a [[cogeneration]] plant to supply its 24-7 operation and 40% of the power used. Located in a mechanical room at the far end of the podium\u2019s top floor, the plant consists of two natural gas fired reciprocating engine driven generators with a total generating capacity of 1.5 MW of electrical power. It recovers the heat produced by combustion and converts the heat into usable energy in the form of hot water. The recovered hot water serves as the building\u2019s heating loop to provide warmth during the winter and functions as a refrigeration machine to provide cooling during the summer. The power from the grid is solely used by the building as a backup source.<ref name=\"CTBUH Technical Paper\" />\n\n====Other features====\n\nIn excess of 95% of the structural steel was recycled. The building, like many in [[Midtown Manhattan]], has no on-site parking, with most employees arriving by [[public transit]].<ref name=\"streetsblog_20071206\">{{cite web | title=New York Times Employees Say Renzo Forgot the Bike Parking | date=2007-12-06 | url=http://www.streetsblog.org/2007/12/06/new-york-times-employees-say-renzo-forgot-the-bike-parking/#more-2983 | accessdate=2007-12-06 }}</ref>\n\n====Overall performance====\n\nA team of researchers at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|Lawrence Berkeley National Lab]] and [[Center for the Built Environment]] monitored the building\u2019s performance for a year and compared the results with buildings that meet with the standard building efficiency codes. They found that the New York Times Building significantly reduced annual electricity, cut heating energy use by more than 50% and decrease the peak electric demand as well. \"It is essential to start with a sound, integrated building design, and then to pay attention to details such as procurement of building equipment, and verifying the proper performance of the equipment after it is installed.
