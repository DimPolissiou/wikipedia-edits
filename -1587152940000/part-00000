Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.\n\nApart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a [[lapidary]] or [[gemcutter]]; a [[diamond]] cutter is called a [[diamantaire]].\n\n==Characteristics and classification==\n[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the [[emerald]] (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN| 0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. The ideal cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity and beauty of that color that is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone| asteria]] (star effects). Ancient Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which they regarded as powerful [[love charm]]s, and [[Helen of Troy]] was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].<ref name=burnham>{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nAside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]<ref name=church>{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H. | title = Precious Stones considered in their scientific and artistic relations | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office, Wyman & Sons | date = 1905|page = 11|chapter = Definition of Precious Stones |url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092547/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archivedate= 2007-09-29 | via = Farlang.com}}</ref> have also been considered{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to be precious.

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Lapidary|first = Pansy D.|last = Kraus|publisher = Krause Publications|date = 2007|isbn = 9780801972669|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontola00krau}}</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>{{cite book|title = Faceting For Amateurs |first1= Glenn|last1= Vargas|first2= Martha|last2= Vargas|date = 2002 |isbn = 9780917646096}}</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

Most gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in jewelry because of their [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] or other physical properties that have [[aesthetic value]]. Rarity is another characteristic that lends value to a gemstone.\n\nApart from jewelry, from earliest antiquity [[engraved gem]]s and [[hardstone carving]]s, such as cups, were major luxury art forms. A gem maker is called a [[lapidary]] or [[gemcutter]]; a [[diamond]] cutter is called a [[diamantaire]].\n\n==Characteristics and classification==\n[[File:Gem.pebbles.800pix.labelled.jpg|thumb|250px|A selection of gemstone pebbles made by tumbling rough rock with abrasive grit, in a rotating drum. The biggest pebble here is {{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.]]\n\nThe traditional classification in the West, which goes back to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]], begins with a distinction between ''precious'' and ''semi-precious''; similar distinctions are made in other cultures. In modern use the precious stones are [[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] and [[emerald]], with all other gemstones being semi-precious.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crc7ZtRHItgC&pg=PA1 ''Precious Stones''], Max Bauer, p. 2</ref> This distinction reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient times, as well as their quality: all are  [[translucent]] with fine color in their purest forms, except for the colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8 to 10 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]. Other stones are classified by their color, [[translucency]] and hardness. The traditional distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values, for example, while [[garnet]]s are relatively inexpensive, a green garnet called [[tsavorite]] can be far more valuable than a mid-quality emerald.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, pp. 3\u20138 {{ISBN|0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>  Another unscientific term for semi-precious gemstones used in [[art history]] and [[archaeology]] is [[hardstone]]. Use of the terms 'precious' and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is, arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than others, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nIn modern times gemstones are identified by [[gemology|gemologists]], who describe gems and their characteristics using [[technical terminology]] specific to the field of [[gemology]]. The first characteristic a gemologist uses to identify a gemstone is its [[chemical composition]]. For example, [[diamond]]s are made of [[carbon]] (C) and rubies of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}). Many gems are crystals which are classified by their [[crystal system]] such as [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] or [[trigonal]] or [[monoclinic]]. Another term used is [[crystal habit|habit]], the form the gem is usually found in. For example, diamonds, which have a cubic crystal system, are often found as [[octahedron]]s.\n\nGemstones are classified into different ''groups'', ''species'', and ''varieties''.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Az2_CQAAQBAJ&pg=PT11|title=GEM HUNTER|first=George|last=Frangoulis|date=18 April 2015|publisher=Lulu.com}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} For example, ruby is the red variety of the species [[corundum]], while any other color of corundum is considered sapphire. Other examples are the [[emerald]] (green), [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] (blue), [[red beryl]] (red), [[goshenite]] (colorless), [[heliodor]] (yellow) and [[morganite]] (pink), which are all varieties of the mineral species [[beryl]].\n\nGems are characterized in terms of [[refractive index]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], [[specific gravity]], [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]], [[Cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[fracture]] and luster. They may exhibit [[pleochroism]] or [[double refraction]]. They may have [[luminescence]] and a distinctive [[absorption spectrum]].\n\nMaterial or flaws within a stone may be present as [[inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]].\n\nGemstones may also be classified in terms of their \"water\". This is a recognized grading of the gem's luster, transparency, or \"brilliance\".<ref>AskOxford.com Concise Oxford English dictionary online.</ref> Very transparent gems are considered \"[[first water]]\", while \"second\" or \"third water\" gems are those of a lesser transparency.<ref>Desirable diamonds: The world's most famous gem. by Sarah Todd.</ref>\n\n==Value==\n[[File:Spanish jewellery-Gold and emerald pendant at VAM-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Spanish emerald and gold pendant at [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]]] [[File:Pendant.jpg|thumb|upright|Enamelled gold, amethyst and pearl pendant, about 1880, Pasquale Novissimo (1844\u20131914), V&A Museum number M.36-1928]]\nGemstones have no universally accepted grading system. Diamonds are graded{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} using a system developed by the [[Gemological Institute of America]] (GIA) in the early 1950s. Historically, all gemstones were graded using the naked eye. The GIA system included a major innovation: the introduction of 10x magnification as the standard for grading clarity. Other gemstones are still graded using the naked eye (assuming 20/20 vision).<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p.36 {{ISBN| 0-9728223-8-0}}</ref>\n\nA [[mnemonic device]], the \"four Cs\" (color, cut, clarity, and carats), has been introduced{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to help the consumer understand the factors used to grade a diamond.<ref>Wise, R. W., 2006, ''Secrets Of The Gem Trade, The Connoisseur's Guide To Precious Gemstones'', Brunswick House Pr, p. 15</ref> With modification, these categories can be useful in understanding the grading of all gemstones. The four criteria carry different weight depending upon whether they are applied to colored gemstones or to colorless diamonds. In diamonds, cut is the primary determinant of value, followed by clarity and color. The ideal cut diamond will sparkle, to break down light into its constituent rainbow colors (dispersion), chop it up into bright little pieces (scintillation), and deliver it to the eye (brilliance). In its rough crystalline form, a diamond will do none of these things; it requires proper fashioning and this is called \"cut\". In gemstones that have color, including colored diamonds, the purity and beauty of that color that is the primary determinant of quality.\n\nPhysical characteristics that make a colored stone valuable are color, clarity to a lesser extent (emeralds will always have a number of inclusions), cut, unusual [[optical phenomena]] within the stone such as color zoning (the uneven distribution of coloring within a gem) and [[star stone| asteria]] (star effects). Ancient Greeks, for example, greatly valued asteria gemstones, which they regarded as powerful [[love charm]]s, and [[Helen of Troy]] was known to have worn star-[[corundum]].<ref name=burnham>{{cite book | last = Burnham | first = S.M. | title = Precious Stones in Nature, Art and Literature | publisher = Bradlee Whidden | date = 1868}} Page 251 URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 Helen of Troy and star corundum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013073718/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/burnham-precious-stones/page_252 |date=2010-10-13 }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2020}}\n\nAside from the [[diamond]], the [[ruby]], [[sapphire]], [[emerald]], [[pearl]] (not, strictly speaking, a gemstone), and [[opal]]<ref name=church>{{cite book | last = Church | first = A.H. | title = Precious Stones considered in their scientific and artistic relations | publisher = His Majesty's Stationery Office, Wyman & Sons | date = 1905|page = 11|chapter = Definition of Precious Stones |url = http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070929092547/http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/church-precious-stones/page_011 |archivedate= 2007-09-29 | via = Farlang.com}}</ref> have also been considered{{by whom?|date=April 2020}} to be precious.

Amsterdam. 2012.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond cutter in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]] in 2012]]\n\nA few gemstones are used as gems in the crystal or other form in which they are found. Most however, are cut and polished for usage as jewelry. The picture to the left is of a rural, commercial cutting operation in Thailand. This small factory cuts thousands of carats of sapphire annually. The two main classifications are stones cut as smooth, dome shaped stones called [[cabochon]]s, and stones which are cut with a [[faceting machine]] by polishing small flat windows called [[facet]]s at regular intervals at exact angles.\n\nStones which are opaque or semi-opaque such as [[opal]], [[turquoise]], [[variscite]], etc. are commonly cut as cabochons. These gems are designed to show the stone's color or surface properties as in opal and star sapphires. Grinding wheels and polishing agents are used to grind, shape and polish the smooth dome shape of the stones.<ref>{{cite book|title = Introduction to Lapidary|first = Pansy D.|last = Kraus|publisher = Krause Publications|date = 2007|isbn = 9780801972669|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/introductiontola00krau}}</ref>\n\nGems which are transparent are normally faceted, a method which shows the optical properties of the stone's interior to its best advantage by maximizing reflected light which is perceived by the viewer as sparkle. There are many commonly used shapes for [[diamond cut|faceted stones]]. The facets must be cut at the proper angles, which varies depending on the [[optical]] properties of the gem. If the angles are too steep or too shallow, the light will pass through and not be reflected back toward the viewer. The faceting machine is used to hold the stone onto a flat lap for cutting and polishing the flat facets.<ref>{{cite book|title = Faceting For Amateurs |first1= Glenn|last1= Vargas|first2= Martha|last2= Vargas|date = 2002 |isbn = 9780917646096}}</ref> Rarely, some cutters use special curved laps to cut and polish curved facets.\n\n==Colors==\n[[File:Aurora Pyramid of Hope.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Nearly 300 variations of diamond color exhibited at [[Aurora Pyramid of Hope|the Aurora display]] at the Natural History Museum in London.]]\nThe color of any material is due to the nature of light itself. Daylight, often called white light, is all of the colors of the spectrum combined. When light strikes a material, most of the light is absorbed while a smaller amount of a particular frequency or wavelength is reflected. The part that is reflected reaches the eye as the perceived color. A ruby appears red because it absorbs all the other colors of white light, while reflecting the red.\n\nA material which is mostly the same can exhibit different colors. For example, ruby and sapphire have the same primary chemical composition (both are [[corundum]]) but exhibit different colors because of impurities. Even the same named gemstone can occur in many different colors: sapphires show different shades of blue and pink and \"fancy sapphires\" exhibit a whole range of other colors from yellow to orange-pink, the latter called \"[[Padparadscha|padparadscha sapphire]]\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenaturalsapphirecompany.com/blog/padparadscha-sapphires-a-buying-guide|title=Padparadscha Sapphires : 10 Tips On Judging The Rare Gem|date=2015-04-06|work=The Natural Sapphire Company Blog|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThis difference in color is based on the atomic structure of the stone. Although the different stones formally have the same chemical composition and structure, they are not exactly the same. Every now and then an atom is replaced by a completely different atom, sometimes as few as one in a million atoms. These so-called [[impurities]] are sufficient to absorb certain colors and leave the other colors unaffected.\n\nFor example, [[beryl]], which is colorless in its pure mineral form, becomes emerald with chromium impurities. If [[manganese]] is added instead of [[chromium]], beryl becomes pink [[morganite]]. With iron, it becomes [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]].\n\nSome gemstone treatments make use of the fact that these impurities can be \"manipulated\", thus changing the color of the gem.<ref name=\"Gem Hunt\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nGemstones are often treated to enhance the color or clarity of the stone. Depending on the type and extent of treatment, they can affect the value of the stone. Some treatments are used widely because the resulting gem is stable, while others are not accepted most commonly because the gem color is unstable and may revert to the original tone.<ref>Gemstone Enhancement: History, Science and State of the Art by Kurt Nassau</ref>\n\n===Heat===\nHeat can improve gemstone color or clarity. The heating process has been well known to gem miners and cutters for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most [[citrine quartz|citrine]] is made by heating [[amethyst]], and partial heating with a strong gradient results in \u201c[[ametrine]]\u201d \u2013 a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. [[Aquamarine (gemstone)|Aquamarine]] is often heated to remove yellow tones, or to change green colors into the more desirable blue, or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.<ref name=Nassau>{{cite book | last = Nassau | first = Kurt | title = Gem Enhancements | publisher = Butterworth Heineman | date = 1994}}</ref>\n\nNearly all [[tanzanite]] is heated at low temperatures to remove brown undertones and give a more desirable blue / purple color.<ref>[http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx Tanzanite Heating - The Science] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160620222334/http://www.lapigems.com/blog/post/2013/01/17/Tanzanite-Heating-The-Facts.aspx |date=2016-06-20 }}</ref> A considerable portion of all [[sapphire]] and [[ruby]] is treated with a variety of heat treatments to improve both color and clarity.\n\nWhen jewelry containing diamonds is heated (for repairs) the diamond should be protected with [[boric acid]]; otherwise the diamond (which is pure carbon) could be burned on the surface or even burned completely up. When jewelry containing [[sapphires]] or [[rubies]] is heated, those stones should not be coated with boracic acid (which can etch the surface) or any other substance. They do not have to be protected from burning, like a diamond (although the stones ''do'' need to be protected from heat stress fracture by immersing the part of the jewelry with stones in water when metal parts are heated).\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\nVirtually all [[blue topaz]], both the lighter and the darker blue shades such as \"London\" blue, has been [[Irradiation|irradiated]] to change the color from white to blue. Most greened quartz (Oro Verde) is also irradiated to achieve the yellow-green color. Diamonds are [[Artificially irradiated diamond|irradiated]] to produce fancy-color diamonds (which occur naturally, though rarely in gem quality).\n\n===Waxing/oiling===\nEmeralds containing natural fissures are sometimes filled with wax or oil to disguise them. This wax or oil is also colored to make the emerald appear of better color as well as clarity. Turquoise is also commonly treated in a similar manner.\n\n===Fracture filling===\nFracture filling has been in use with different gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and sapphires. In 2006 \"glass filled rubies\" received publicity. Rubies over 10 carats (2&nbsp;g) with large fractures were filled with lead glass, thus dramatically improving the appearance (of larger rubies in particular). Such treatments are fairly easy to detect.\n\n==Synthetic and artificial gemstones==\nSynthetic gemstones are distinct from imitation or simulated gems.\n\nSynthetic gems are physically, optically and chemically identical to the natural stone, but are created in controlled conditions in a laboratory.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HrESAQAAMAAJ|title=Jewelers' Circular-keystone: JCK.|date=1994|publisher=Chilton Company|language=en}}</ref> Imitation or simulated stones are chemically different from the natural stone but may be optically similar to it; they can be glass, plastic, resins or other compounds.\n\nExamples of simulated or imitation stones include [[cubic zirconia]], composed of [[zirconium]] oxide and simulated [[moissanite]], which are both [[diamond simulants]]. The imitations copy the look and color of the real stone but possess neither their chemical nor physical characteristics. Moissanite actually has a higher refractive index than diamond and when presented beside an equivalently sized and cut diamond will have more \"fire\" than the diamond.\n\nSynthetic, cultured or lab-created gemstones are not imitations. For example, [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]], [[sapphire]]s and [[emerald]]s have been manufactured in labs to possess identical chemical and physical characteristics to the naturally occurring variety. Synthetic (lab created) [[corundum]], including ruby and sapphire, is very common and costs much less than the natural stones. Smaller [[synthetic diamond]]s have been manufactured in large quantities as industrial [[abrasive]]s, although larger gem-quality synthetic diamonds are becoming available in multiple carats.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Process Promises Bigger, Better Diamond Crystals|url=http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|accessdate=7 January 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201005848/http://carnegiescience.edu/news/new_process_promises_bigger_better_diamond_crystals|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhether a gemstone is a natural stone or lab-created (synthetic), the physical characteristics are the same. Lab-created stones tend to have a more vivid color to them, as impurities are not present in a lab and do not modify the clarity or color of the stone, unless added intentionally for a specific purpose.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==List of rare gemstones==\n* [[Painite]] was discovered in 1956 in Ohngaing in Myanmar.

The pipes are typically made from [[bamboo]], [[Arundo donax|giant cane]], or local reeds. Other materials include wood, plastic, metal and ivory.\n\n== Structure == \n[[File:panflute1.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Romanian pan flutes]]\nThe pan flute's tubes are stopped at one end, at which the standing wave is reflected giving a note an octave lower than that produced by an open pipe of equal length. In the traditional South American style, pipes are fine-tuned to correct pitch by placing small pebbles or dry corn kernels into the bottom of the pipes. Contemporary makers of curved Romanian-style panpipes use wax (commonly [[beeswax]]) to tune new instruments. Special tools are used to place or remove the wax. Corks and rubber stoppers are also used, and are easier to quickly tune pipes.\n\n=== Acoustics ===\nThe pan flute is an [[end-blown flute]].  Sound is produced by the vibration of an air-stream blowing across an open hole at the end of a resonating tube.  The length of the tube determines the fundamental frequency. An overblown harmonic register is near a 12th above the fundamental in cylindrical tubes, but can approach an octave jump (8th) if a decreasing taper is used.\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Principle for pan flutes, the frequency and the length of the tube are inversely proportional. Every time the pitch goes up one [[octave]], the frequency doubles. Because there are 12 notes in a [[chromatic scale]] or a full octave, every half-step in a chromatic scale is multiplied by the 12th root of 2 to get the note next to it. By this, it is possible to calculate the length of any pipe, given that one knows the length of any one pipe. The formula for calculating the length of a pan flute pipe is '''L&nbsp;=&nbsp;(c / f)&nbsp;/&nbsp;4''' (the \"theoretical length\" L equals the [[speed of sound]] c = 343&nbsp;m/s, divided by the desired frequency in [[hertz]] f, that quantity divided by 4; this simplifies and rearranges to: Length of pipe (in [[centimeters]]) \u00d7 [[Frequency]] (in [[hertz]]) = 8575). Because of a property of compression within the tube, the length must be a little shorter to correct flat pitch. The extra length is helpful for a maker, who can use a cork or plug at the bottom to adjust the pitch. Some instruments use wax or pellets to tune the fundamental pitch of each tube. A tube that has a diameter 1/10 of its length yields a typical tone colour (see [[Timbre]]). An inner diameter range between 1/7 and 1/14 of the length L is acceptable. A narrow tube will sound \"reedy\", while a wide one will sound \"flutey\". A more exact method is to multiply the bore diameter by 0.82 and subtract this value from the tube length. This compensates for internal compression slowing frequency and the lips partially covering the voicing. Only tiny adjustments will be needed then to adjust fundamental pitch for air density and temperature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarahtulga.com/panpipes.htm|title=Panpipes|last=Tulga|first=Sarah}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Harry F|title=Music, Physics, and Engineering}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Price|first=Lew Paxton|title=Secrets of the Flute}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Benade|first=Arthur H|title=Horns, Strings and Harmony|url=https://archive.org/details/hornsstringsharm00bena|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n== Playing ==\n[[File:Zampo\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|A Peruvian-American Airman playing an [[Inca]]n [[zampo\u00f1a]]]]\nThe pan flute is played by blowing horizontally across an open end against the sharp inner edge of the pipes. Each pipe is tuned to a keynote, called the '''fundamental''' frequency. By [[overblowing]], that is, increasing the pressure of breath and tension of lips, [[Harmonic series (music)|odd harmonics]] (notes whose frequencies are odd-number multiples of the fundamental), near a 12th in cylindrical tubes, may also be produced. The Romanian pan flute has the pipes arranged in a curved array, solidly glued together, unlike Andean versions, which are usually tied together. Thus, the player can easily reach all the notes by simply swiveling the head, or by moving the instrument with the hands. These instruments can also play all the sharps and flats, with a special technique of both tilting the pipes and jaw movement, thus reducing the size of the pipe's opening and producing a change in pitch. A very advanced player can play any scale and in any key. There are two styles of vibrato possible, hand vibrato and breath vibrato. In hand vibrato, the pitch is shifted up and down, like a vocal vibrato. The player gently moves one end of the pan flute (usually the high end) somewhat similar to violin vibrato. Breath, or throat vibrato, which is really tremolo, a shift in volume, is the same technique used by players of the flute and other woodwinds by use of the player's diaphragm, or throat muscles.\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:Dom Flemons of the Carolina Chocolate Drops.jpg|thumb|upright|American musician Dom Flemons of the [[Carolina Chocolate Drops]] plays the quills, a traditional African-American pan flute, suspending it in front of his mouth with a [[Harmonica#Rack or holder|harmonica rack]]]]\nThe curved-style pan flute was popularized by the [[Romania]]n [[musician]] [[Gheorghe Zamfir]], who toured extensively and recorded many albums of pan flute music in the 1970s, and by several other artists who began recording at the same time.

In her attempt to escape the affection of god Pan (a creature half he-goat and half he-man), she was transformed into a water-reed or calamos (cane-reed). Then, Pan cut several reeds, placed them in parallel one next to the other, and bound them together to make a melodic musical instrument. Ancient Greeks called this instrument Syrinx, in honour of the Muse, and Pandean, or Pan-pipes and Pan-flute, after Pan. The Syrinx, a predominantly pastoral instrument for the Greeks, was adopted by the Etruscans who played it at their festivals and banquets; the Etruscans called it fistula. The Romans adopted the Syrinx from the Greeks and the Etruscans, and they too played it at their banquets, festivals, as well as in religious and funeral processions.\n\n== Structure == \n[[File:panflute1.jpg|thumb|upright|Two Romanian pan flutes]]\nThe pan flute's tubes are stopped at one end, at which the standing wave is reflected giving a note an octave lower than that produced by an open pipe of equal length.
