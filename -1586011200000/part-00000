Both his parents<ref name=\":0\" /> were ministerial clergy leaders at his father's uncle's church in Philadelphia.

After graduating from high school in 1981, he began preaching against his great-uncle's  stances on Christian sanctification, holiness, and modesty in behavior, and clothing. Saying that the church and those in church leadership need to have stricter and more scripture based standards for such concepts. He also began preaching [[Nontrinitarianism|Nontrinitarian views]], stating that he believed the [[Trinity|Trinity perspective of God]] was false, and began preaching [[Modalistic Monarchianism|a distinct, Non-Trinitarian form of Modalistic Monarchianism.]] He also began preaching against and criticizing the stances and viewpoints that many people were starting to take within the church at the time. His great-uncle then temporarily suspended him of his ministerial duties, and made him take a one-year sabbatical leave of absence from preaching in the church. When he was finally given the opportunity to preach again, he told his great-uncle that he refused to back down from any of his viewpoints and teachings. Finally in 1984, at the age of 21, after going through repetitive cycles of being suspended from his ministerial duties and being forced to take sabbaticals from preaching, Jennings, his parents and his siblings left their great-uncle's church.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHe started the First Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ. (FCOOLJC) on May 21, 1984 in the basement of his family home, starting out with only 15 members, (family not included). Many of his teenage and young adult friends from high school and college, and their families also joined the church in 1984 as well. Between 1984 and 1988, several of the former members of his great-uncle's church began joining, and the congregation steadily grew. As time passed, several rooms of the basement and other areas of the house had to be used as overflow rooms.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1988, many members of his great-uncle's church began to antagonize First Church and taunt Jennings; calling him a false teacher, saying that he was putting too much of a strict emphasis on [[Legalism (theology)|legalism]]. Several church and ministry auxiliaries were formed around this time as well, allowing Jennings to rent out auditoriums of public facilities around Philadelphia to use for First Church worship services and meetings.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBetween 1988 and 1989, Jennings began planting branch churches in other cities in [[Pennsylvania]], and in other states such as [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], [[Tennessee]], [[Maryland]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]]. The Services at the headquarters church in Philadelphia were moved to the auditorium of the former Hunting Park Recreation Center. In April 1989, First Church began having its services in the fellowship hall of an old [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] Church building. Because the fellowship hall of the church was very large, the location provided enough room to accommodate the growing congregation. As the Philadelphia congregation exponentially grew, it was also at this time that Jennings fell in love with Darlene Gayman, a fellow member of the church whom he had been courting with. The two were married on April 15, 1989<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-08-26 | url=https://www.truthofgod.com/about-first-church | title=First Church Of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Inc. | website=truthofgod.com}}</ref> when Jennings was 27. And to not take away from the focus of the ministry he also conducted a revival service after the wedding for the wedding guests as well.\n\nBy March 1990, Jennings and First Church had also set up their own local radio broadcasting equipment within their church and began broadcasting audio tapes and live recordings of their services on local Philadelphia radio stations. First Church was also given a thirty-minute international broadcast on [[WWCR|WWCR Nashville]], and a one-hour broadcast on [[WTMR|WTMR Camden, New Jersey]]. Jennings then named the broadcasts, \"The Truth of God\" claiming that that was the name God gave him to give as a title to the radio broadcast, to help them reach souls and inspire interest in any Christians willing to tune in and listen. By 1991, over 11 radio stations across several states and even international radio stations in other countries in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe were broadcasting Jennings' sermons to international listeners.\n\nMany people of other denominations and churches have criticized Jennings and the FCOOLJC for some of their stricter beliefs and views, such as the rejection of women in church clergy based on [[1 Timothy 2:12|1st Timothy 2:12]], whereby specifically which many Christians have accused them of being \"religiously [[Misogyny|misogynistic]]\",<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20180228/pastor-under-fire-calling-women-hoes-female-church-leaders-say-clergyman%E2%80%99s|title=Pastor under fire for calling women hoes - Female church leaders say clergyman\u2019s comments were degrading|website=jamaica-star.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20180509/pastor-threatens-sue-gino-jennings|title=Pastor threatens to sue Gino Jennings|website=jamaica-star.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Citation|last=Tony Harvin|title=Pastor Gino Jennings - Interview with Fox 29 / 100.3 WRNB K Foxx & Quincy (updated with video)|date=2018-03-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jlbWDXG-uM|access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> and speaking in tongues ([[glossolalia]]) as a required sign of evidence of being baptized with the Holy Spirit.

In February 1992, just after his 30th Birthday, the new headquarters was completed and dedicated. As time passed the ministries grew and flourished, and as of June 25, 2016, Jennings made settlement on a 200,000 square foot church facility on 5105 North 5th Street in the Olney section of Philadelphia, PA. The purchase was made after the building had been  pursued by the church since 2014. The facility covers a whole city block and was previously owned by the Catholic Church. It also consists of two schools, a cafeteria, an  administration building, and an old convent building that was converted into lodging quarters for members that could not afford anywhere to stay during large events held at the church. The main sanctuary can fit approximately 2,300 people and the lower autitorium can fit about 1,200. This building serves as the churches headquarters to this day.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout 1992 to 2016, Jennings also began going to other states around the country including [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Missouri]], [[Colorado]], [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[North Carolina]], establishing branch churches and planting pastors in each state, further incorporating the ministries into its own stand-alone, independent church denomination. Today, the church can be found in over 20 states across the continental United States. Jennings is also continuing to work abroad establishing branch churches in [[Puerto Rico]] (which although it is a U.S. Territory, it is still considered foreign missions), [[England]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Philippines]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], and [[New Zealand]], and many more places around the world. His churches have also been dedicated to philanthropy and community services efforts.\n\nBetween February and March 2018, Jennings entered the media spotlight for his controversial sermons against women wearing excessive [[Cosmetics|makeup]], [[Artificial hair integrations|fake hair]], [[wig]]s, and [[Jewellery|jewelry]] in church ; comparing women who do such things to [[Jezebel]] and [[Delilah]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://newsone.com/3775687/philadelphia-pastor-gino-jennings/|title=Philadelphia Pastor Calls Women With \u2018Lips All Red\u2019 And \u2018Fake Hair\u2019 Nothing \u2018But An Organ Playing Hoe\u2019|date=2018-02-21|work=News One|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Reverend Carla Dunbar called his comments erronous and degrading.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jennings defended his statements by saying not to listen to how he sounded, but to what he said in defense of the teachings of Biblical modesty in dress and clothing.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> Jennings agreed to meet with Jamaican entertainer \"[[Mr. Vegas]]\" to debate him.

As time passed the ministries grew and flourished, and as of June 25, 2016, Jennings made settlement on a 200,000 square foot church facility on 5105 North 5th Street in the Olney section of Philadelphia, PA. The purchase was made after the building had been  pursued by the church since 2014. The facility covers a whole city block and was previously owned by the Catholic Church. It also consists of two schools, a cafeteria, an  administration building, and an old convent building that was converted into lodging quarters for members that could not afford anywhere to stay during large events held at the church. The main sanctuary can fit approximately 2,300 people and the lower autitorium can fit about 1,200. This building serves as the churches headquarters to this day.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout 1992 to 2016, Jennings also began going to other states around the country including [[Florida]], [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Missouri]], [[Colorado]], [[Louisiana]], [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[North Carolina]], establishing branch churches and planting pastors in each state, further incorporating the ministries into its own stand-alone, independent church denomination. Today, the church can be found in over 20 states across the continental United States. Jennings is also continuing to work abroad establishing branch churches in [[Puerto Rico]] (which although it is a U.S. Territory, it is still considered foreign missions), [[England]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Philippines]], [[Jamaica]], [[Haiti]], and [[New Zealand]], and many more places around the world. His churches have also been dedicated to philanthropy and community services efforts.\n\nBetween February and March 2018, Jennings entered the media spotlight for his controversial sermons against women wearing excessive [[Cosmetics|makeup]], [[Artificial hair integrations|fake hair]], [[wig]]s, and [[Jewellery|jewelry]] in church ; comparing women who do such things to [[Jezebel]] and [[Delilah]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite news|url=https://newsone.com/3775687/philadelphia-pastor-gino-jennings/|title=Philadelphia Pastor Calls Women With \u2018Lips All Red\u2019 And \u2018Fake Hair\u2019 Nothing \u2018But An Organ Playing Hoe\u2019|date=2018-02-21|work=News One|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Reverend Carla Dunbar called his comments erronous and degrading.<ref name=\":3\" /> Jennings defended his statements by saying not to listen to how he sounded, but to what he said in defense of the teachings of Biblical modesty in dress and clothing.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":7\" /> Jennings agreed to meet with Jamaican entertainer \"[[Mr. Vegas]]\" to debate him.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the [[Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht]]. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive, and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks, and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the [[resurrection of Jesus]], followed by a liminal period, and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, and a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the [[lunar calendar]]. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] in [[heaven]], and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life.<ref>Erickson, Brad. 2008.

The [[Carnival of Venice]] was, for a long time, the most famous carnival (although [[Napoleon]] abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal, and France, and from France to [[New France]] in North America. From Spain and Portugal, it spread with colonization to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. In the early 19th century in the German [[Rhineland]] and [[Southern Netherlands]], the weakened medieval tradition also revived. Continuously in the 18th and 19th centuries CE, as part of the annual Saturnalia abuse of the carnival in Rome, [[rabbi]]s of the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|ghetto]] were forced to march through the city streets wearing foolish guise, jeered upon and pelted by a variety of missiles from the crowd.

He writes: \"Any new year is a revival of time at its beginning, a repetition of the cosmogony.

Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting, and drinking competitions. Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest, it evolved into a national festival.

Beginning in June, Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale, the Grand Kadooment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCrop Over time for many islanders is one big party. Craft markets, food tents/stalls, street parties, and cavalcades fill every week.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA major feature is the [[calypso music|calypso]] competition. Calypso music, originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of musicians who perform biting social commentaries, political expos\u00e9s or rousing exhortations to \"wuk dah waistline\" and \"roll dat bumper\". The groups compete for the Calypso Monarch Award, while the air is redolent with the smells of [[Barbadian cuisine|Bajan]] cooking during the [[Bridgetown]] Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama, and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the \"Pic-o-de-Crop\" Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned.

Some of the most famous include [[GRES Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Primeira de Mangueira]], [[GRES Portela]], [[GRES Acad\u00eamicos do Salgueiro]], [[GRES Imperatriz Leopoldinense]], [[GRES Beija-Flor de Nil\u00f3polis]], [[GRES Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel]], and recently, [[Unidos da Tijuca]] and [[GRES Uni\u00e3o da Ilha do Governador]]. Local tourists pay $500\u2013950, depending on the costume, to buy a samba costume and dance in the parade. ''Blocos'' are small informal groups with a definite theme in their samba, usually satirizing the political situation. About 30 schools in Rio gather hundreds of thousands of participants. More than 440 ''blocos'' operate in Rio. ''Bandas'' are samba musical bands, also called \"street carnival bands\", usually formed within a single neighborhood or musical background. The Carnival industry chain amassed in 2012 almost US$1&nbsp;billion in revenues.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/rios-carnival-not-just-a-local-party-anymore-2012-02-13?pagenumber=1| title=Rio's Carnival: Not just a local party anymore| author=Sarah de Sainte Croix| work=MarketWatch| access-date=12 March 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629212855/http://www.marketwatch.com/story/rios-carnival-not-just-a-local-party-anymore-2012-02-13?pagenumber=1| archive-date=29 June 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=====Recife, Pernambuco=====\n{{Main|Recife Carnival}}\n[[Recife]] is marked by the parade of the largest carnival block in the world, the [[Galo da Madrugada]].

Festivities include \"jump-up\" parades with beautifully colored costumes, floats, and live bands, as well as [[beauty contests]] and other competitions. Celebrations include a middle-of-the-night [[j'ouvert]] (''juv\u00e9'') parade that ends at sunrise with the burning of a straw [[King Momo]], cleansing sins and bad luck. On Statia, he is called Prince Stupid.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival has been celebrated in Cuba since the 18th century. Participants don costumes from the island's cultural and ethnic variety. After [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuban Revolution|Communist Revolution]], Carnival's religious overtones were suppressed.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The events remained, albeit frowned upon by the state.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Carnival celebrations have been in decline throughout Cuba since then.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Colombia====\n[[File:DIOSESANCESTRALES HUGOMONCAYO2007 4.jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]] in [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]]]]\n{{Main|Carnival in Colombia}}\nCarnival was introduced by the Spaniards and incorporated elements from [[European culture]]s. It has managed to reinterpret traditions that belonged to Colombia's African and [[Amerindian]] cultures. Documentary evidence shows that Carnival existed in Colombia in the 18th century and had already been a cause for concern for colonial authorities, who censored the celebrations, especially in the main political centres such as [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Bogot\u00e1]], and [[Popay\u00e1n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe Carnival continued its evolution in small/unimportant towns out of view of the rulers. The result was the uninterrupted celebration of Carnival festivals in [[Barranquilla]] (see [[Barranquilla's Carnival]]), now recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The Barranquilla Carnival includes several parades on Friday and Saturday nights beginning on 11 January and ending with a six-day non-stop festival, beginning the Wednesday prior to Ash Wednesday and ending Tuesday midnight. Other celebrations occur in villages along the lower [[Magdalena River]] in northern Colombia, and in [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]] and [[Nari\u00f1o]] (see [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]]) in the south of the country. In the early 20th century, attempts to introduce Carnival in Bogot\u00e1 were rejected by the government. The [[Bogot\u00e1 Carnival]] was renewed in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Dominica====\n[[File:Dominicaband2.jpg|alt=Band members performing on drums while in the street; one member is wearing a monkey mask and comic hat.|thumb|right|300px|A Dominican Carnival costume band]]\n\n{{Main|Chant\u00e9 mas}}\nCarnival in [[Dominica]] is held in the capital city of [[Roseau]], and takes elements of Carnival that can be seen in the neighbouring French islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], as well as [[Trinidad]]. Notable events leading up to Carnival include the Opening of Carnival celebrations, the Calypso Monarch music competition, the Queen of Carnival Beauty Pageant, and [[bouyon music]] bands. Celebrations last for the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Dominican Republic====\n{{Main|Carnival in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] Carnival is celebrated in most cities and towns in the main streets during February. Among its main characteristics are its flashy costumes and loud music. The one held in [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]], which is one of the biggest in the country, and the national parade in [[Santo Domingo]] were where the first Carnival of the Americas was held.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival masks are elaborate and colorful. The costumes used on the parades are satires of the Devil and are called \"Diablos Cojuelos\". They dance, and run to the rhythm of [[merengue music]] mixed with techno, hip-hop, and [[reggaeton]]. Additional [[allegorical]] characters represent Dominican traditions such as \"Roba la Gallina\" and \"Calif\u00e9\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOne of the most international parades is in [[San Pedro de Macor\u00eds]]. It exhibits the \"Guloyas\" parade of costumed groups dancing in the streets. Revelers flee from the \"Diablos Cojuelos\" who try to hit them with \"Vejigas\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe timing of the festivals has grown apart from its original religious synchronization with the period of Lent. With National Independence Day on 27 February and the birthday of [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], its founding father, on 26 January, the Carnival celebrations fill February regardless of the [[Lenten calendar]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Ecuador====\n[[File:Desfile de Carnaval en calles de Latacunga.jpg|thumb|Carnival parade in [[Latacunga]] city.]]\n[[File:Comparsa latacungue\u00f1a desfilando.jpg|thumb|Party in Latacunga city.]]\nIn [[Ecuador]], the celebrations began before the arrival of Catholicism. The Huarangas Indians (from the Chimbos nation) used to celebrate the second moon of the year with a festival at which they threw flour, flowers, and perfumed water. This indigenous tradition merged with the Catholic celebration of Carnival.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA common feature of Ecuadorian Carnival is the ''diablitos'' (little devils) who play with water. As with snowball fights, the practice of throwing or dumping water on unsuspecting victims is revered by children and teenagers although feared by some adults. Throwing water balloons, sometimes even eggs and flour both to friends and strangers is fun, but can also upset the uninformed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAlthough the government as well as school authorities forbid such games, they are widely practiced. Historians tell of a bishop in 1867 who threatened [[excommunication]] for the [[sin]] of playing Carnival games.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFestivals differ across the country. Locals wear disguises with colorful masks and dance. Usually, the celebrations begin with the election of ''Taita Carnival'' (Father Carnival) who heads the festivities and leads the parades in each city.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe most famed Carnival festivities are in [[Guaranda]] (Bolivar province) and [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] (Tungurahua province). In Ambato, the festivities are called ''Fiesta de las Flores y las Frutas'' (Festival of the Flowers and Fruits). Other cities have revived Carnival traditions with colorful parades, such as in [[Azogues]] (Ca\u00f1ar Province). In Azogues and the Southern [[Andes]] in general, ''Taita Carnival'' is always an indigenous [[Ca\u00f1ari]]. Recently, a celebration has gained prominence in the northern part of the Andes in the [[Chota Valley]] in [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] which is a zone of a strong [[Afro-Ecuadorian]] population and so the Carnival is celebrated with [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba del chota]] music.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Latacunga]] celebrates Carnival in three manners:<ref>{{cite web| title=Carnival Latacunga| url=http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101464647/-1/Celebraci%C3%B3n_y_fiesta__en_La_Laguna.html#.Vj0nsdIrLcc| accessdate=6 November 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032136/http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101464647/-1/Celebraci%C3%B3n_y_fiesta__en_La_Laguna.html#.Vj0nsdIrLcc| archive-date=17 November 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> Carnival with water where people play with water, religious Carnival where people make religious festivity, and Carnival parade in the city in which people march on the Latacunga streets wearing masks while they dance with music bands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====French Guiana====\n{{Main|Carnival in French Guiana}}\n\nThe Carnival of [[French Guiana]] has roots in [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. Everyone participates \u2013 mainland French, Brazilians (Guiana has a frontier with Brazil), and Chinese as well as Creoles.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIts duration is variable, determined by movable religious festivals: Carnival begins at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and ends on Ash Wednesday, and so typically lasts through most of January and February. During this period, from Friday evening until Monday morning the entire country throbs to the rhythm of masked balls and street parades.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFriday afternoons are for eating ''galette des rois'' (the cake of kings) and drinking champagne. The cake may be flavoured with [[frangipani]], [[guava]], or [[coconut]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOn Sunday afternoons, major parades fill the streets of [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]], and Saint-Laurent du Maroni. Competing groups prepare for months. Dressed to follow the year's agreed theme, they march with Carnival floats, drums, and brass bands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nBrazilian groups are appreciated for their elaborate feathered and sequined costumes. However, they are not eligible for competition since the costumes do not change over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMythical characters appear regularly in the parades:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* ''Karolin'' \u2212 a small person dressed in a [[magpie]] tail and [[top hat]], riding on a [[shrew]].\n* ''Les N\u00e8g'marrons'' \u2212 groups of men dressed in red [[loincloth]]s, bearing ripe tomatoes in their mouths while their bodies are smeared with grease or [[molasses]]. They deliberately try to come in contact with spectators, soiling their clothes.\n* ''Les makoum\u00e9s'' \u2212 [[cross-dressing]] men (out of the Carnival context, ''makoum\u00e9'' is a pejorative term for a [[homosexual]]).\n* ''Soussouris'' (the bat) \u2212 a character dressed in a winged [[leotard]] from head to foot, usually black in colour. Traditionally malevolent, this character is liable to chase spectators and \"sting\" them.\n\n[[File:Toulou.jpg|thumb|right|Four touloulous]]\nA uniquely Creole tradition are the ''touloulous''. These women wear decorative gowns, gloves, masks, and headdresses that cover them completely, making them unrecognisable, even to the colour of their skin. On Friday and Saturday nights of Carnival, touloulou balls are held in so-called \"universities\", large dance halls that open only at Carnival time. Touloulous get in free, and are even given [[condom]]s in the interest of the sexual health of the community. Men attend the balls, but they pay admittance and are not disguised. The touloulous pick their dance partners, who may not refuse. The setup is designed to make it easy for a woman to create a temporary liaison with a man in total anonymity. Undisguised women are not welcomed. By tradition, if such a woman gets up to dance, the orchestra stops playing. Alcohol is served at bars \u2013 the disguised women whisper to the men \"touloulou thirsty\", at which a round of drinks is expected, to be drunk through a straw protect their anonymity.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn more modern times, Guyanais men have attempted to turn the tables by staging ''soir\u00e9es tololo'', in which it is the men who, in disguise, seek partners from undisguised women bystanders.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe final four days of Carnival follow a rigid schedule, and no work is done:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* Sunday \u2212 The Grand Parade, in which the groups compete.\n* Monday \u2212 Marriage burlesque, with men dressed as brides and women as grooms.\n* Tuesday \u2212 Red Devil Day in which everyone wears red or black.\n* (Ash) Wednesday \u2212 Dress is black and white only, for the grand ceremony of burning the effigy of Vaval, King Carnival.\n\n====Guatemala====\nThe most famous Carnival celebration in [[Guatemala]] is in [[Mazatenango]]. During February, Mazatenango is famous for its eight-day Carnival Feast. Days of food, music, parades, and games fill the streets of the [[Suchitep\u00e9quez Department]]. As one Guatemalan website states, \"To mention the Carnival of Mazatenango is to bring to mind moments of a happy and cordial party. In the eight days of this celebration's duration, the local residents have kept alive the traditions of the Department.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Haiti====\n{{Main|Haitian Carnival}}\nCarnival in [[Haiti]] started in 1804 in the capital [[Port-au-Prince]] after the [[Haitian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]. The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America. It is known as Kanaval in the [[Creole language]].

Carnival Week is especially popular because of the opulent [[Las Tablas, Los Santos|Las Tablas]] Carnival as well as the Carnival celebrations in [[Panama City]] and almost all of the [[Azuero Peninsula]]. The Panamanian Carnival is also popular because of the concerts featuring popular artists in the most visited areas.\n\nConcerts are often carried out during the night, and continue until the next morning. Carnival Week is a national holiday in Panama, with most businesses and government offices remaining closed during its duration, and with most Panamanians opting to go to the country's rural areas to participate on the Carnivals and visit their relatives. Carnivals in Panama also feature large repurposed fuel trucks that are used for soaking attendees through the use of firehoses that are controlled and directed by one or more people that stand in a platform that is mounted on top of the truck. This is known as \"culecos\" or \"los culecos\". Trucks get their water from nearby, government-approved rivers, and the water is tested for cleanliness before use. Culecos are often performed from 10 AM to 3 PM, when the sun is at its brightest. Children and pregnant women are banned from participating in the culecos, and the trucks are always sponsored by a well-known Panamanian company or brand. The culecos are also often accompanied by reggaeton concerts.<ref>https://ensegundos.com.pa/2018/02/08/prohiben-ingreso-de-embarazadas-y-ninos-a-culecos/</ref><ref>https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/170214/diez-seran-manana-culecos</ref><ref>https://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/2018/02/05/minsa-verificacion-cisternas-participaran-carnavales/1190582.html</ref><ref>https://ensegundos.com.pa/2017/02/25/miambiente-supervisa-carga-de-agua-a-carros-cisternas-para-los-culecos/</ref>\n\nThe open consumption of large amounts of cold, [[low-alcohol beer]] or [[Smirnoff]], stored in ice-filled coolers, is common among attendees. Just like in Rio de Janeiro, some carnivals also feature floats, but they may have young women with elaborate costumes that stand as the \"Queens\" of \"Calle Arriba\" and \"Calle Abajo\", representing rich and working-class people, respectively. The queens are chosen through a contest and announced on October of the previous year, and are replaced every year. The queens are introduced on the first carnival day, and are always accompanied by a music band, who are present whenever the queens are present. Fireworks are launched on the last carnival night, to signal the end of the carnival.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/carnaval_english.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428054119/http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/carnaval_english.pdf |archive-date=28 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Peru====\n[[File:Carnaval de juliaca.jpg|thumb|200 px|Morenada dance, in the Carnival of [[Juliaca]] \u2013 Peru]]\n\n=====Cajamarca=====\nThe town of [[Cajamarca]] is considered the capital of Carnival in [[Peru]].

Tobago's celebration culminates on Monday and Tuesday on a much smaller scale. Carnival combines costumes, dance, music, competitions, rum, and partying (fete-ing). Music styles include soca, [[calypso music|calypso]], [[rapso]], and more recently [[Chutney music|chutney]] and [[chutney soca]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe annual Carnival [[steel pan]] competition known as the National Panorama competition holds the finals on the Saturday before the main event. Pan players compete in categories such as \"Conventional Steel Band\" or \"Single Pan Band\" by performing renditions of the year's calypsos.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n\"Dimanche Gras\" takes place on the Sunday night before Ash Wednesday. Here the [[Calypso Monarch]] is chosen (after competition) and prize money and a vehicle awarded. The King and Queen of the bands are crowned, where each band parades costumes for two days and submits a king and queen, from which an overall winner is chosen. These usually involve huge, complex, beautiful well-crafted costumes, that includes 'wire-bending'.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nJ'ouvert, or \"Dirty Mas\", takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. It means \"opening of the day\". Revelers dress in costumes embodying puns on current affairs, especially political and social events. \"Clean Mud\" (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J'ouvert. A common character is \"Jab-jabs\" (devils, blue, black, or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J'ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Carnival Costume in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|The Carnival King costume for a particular band]]\nCarnival Monday involves the parade of the mas bands.

There is also the \"Bomb Competition\", a smaller-scaled judging of steel bands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gotrinidadandtobago.com/trinidad-and-tobago/carnival-in-trinidad.html|title=Carnival in Trinidad \u2013 Trinidad & Tobago \u2013 The true caribbean \u2013 Trinidad & Tobago \u2013 The true caribbean|website=gotrinidadandtobago.com|access-date=21 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207043929/http://gotrinidadandtobago.com/trinidad-and-tobago/carnival-in-trinidad.html|archive-date=7 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually \"Mas Boots\" that complement the costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers) that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen's Park Savannah to pass on \"The Stage\" for judging. The singer of the most played song is crowned Road March King or Queen, earning prize money and usually a vehicle.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThis parading and revelry goes on until Tuesday midnight. Ash Wednesday itself, while not an official holiday, sends flocks to local beaches.

Although a pagan holiday, the Carnival was later celebrated on Feast Day in February. In addition to the many carnival-wearing individuals, there were bands with guitars, bows, and butaphoric masks such as animal heads and humans. The Kor\u00e7a Carnival took a big hit after the creation of cultural societies such as the \"Kor\u00e7a Youth\". During this period carnivals were accompanied by mandolins, guitars and humorous songs. Carnival celebrations were discontinued after 60, to resume in other social conditions after 90. Kor\u00e7a is one of the first cities to revive the Carnival tradition by establishing the Carnival Association in 1992 as part of the National Carnival Association of Albania. On April 10, 1994, the first International Carnival Festival in Albania was organized in Kor\u00e7a. The following year, the second International Carnival Festival is even larger. Since this year and until 2008, the Korca Carnival group has been represented at a number of international festivals organized in various European countries.                         -Briana B.\n\n====Belgium====\nMany parts of [[Belgium]] celebrate Carnival, typically with costume parades, partying and fireworks.

Some of the towns and places are Grobnik, Permani, Kastav and many others places near Rijeka. Just before the end of Carnival, every Kvarner town burns a [[effigy|man-like doll]] called a \"Pust\", who is blamed for all the strife of the previous year. The [[Zvon\u010dari]], or bell-ringers push away winter and all the bad things in the past year and calling spring, they wear bells and large head regalia representing their areas of origin (for example, those from Halubje wear regalia in the shape of animal heads).

The towns of [[Cres]], Pag, Novi Vinodolski, and Fu\u017eine also organise Summer Carnivals.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Cyprus====\nCarnival has been celebrated in [[Cyprus]] for centuries. The tradition was likely established under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek traditions, such as festivities for deities such as [[Dionysus]]. The celebration originally involved dressing in costumes and holding masked balls or visiting friends. In the twentieth century, it became an organized event held during the 10 days preceding Lent (according to the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar). The festival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of [[Limassol]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThree main parades take place during Carnival. The first is held on the first day, during which the \"Carnival King\" (either a person in costume or an [[effigy]]) rides through the city on his carriage. The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival, and the participants are mainly children. The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town's longest avenue.

The holiday is sometimes described as a Nordic [[Halloween]], with children dressing in costume and gathering treats for the ''Fastelavn'' feast. One popular custom is the ''fastelavnsris'', a [[switch (corporal punishment)|switch]] that children use to [[flagellation|flog]] their parents to wake them up on Fastelavns Sunday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn [[Norway]], students having seen [[Paris Carnival|celebrations in Paris]] introduced Carnival processions, masked balls, and Carnival balls to [[Oslo|Christiana]] in the 1840s and 1850s. From 1863, the artist federation ''Kunstnerforeningen'' held annual Carnival balls in the old [[Freemasons]] lodge, which inspired [[Johan Svendsen]]'s compositions ''Norsk Kunstnerkarneval'' and ''Karneval in Paris''. The following year, Svendsen's ''Festpolonaise'' was written for the opening procession. [[Edvard Grieg]] attended and wrote \"Aus dem Karneval\" (''Folkelivsbilleder'' Op. 19). Since 1988, the student organization {{ill|T\u00e5rnseilerne|no|vertical-align=sup}} has produced annual masquerade balls in Oslo, with masks, costumes, and processions after attending an opera performance.

A time for [[Confession (religion)|confessing sins]] (\"shriving\"), it had fewer festivities than the Continental Carnivals. Today, [[Shrove Tuesday]] is celebrated as [[Pancake Day]], but little else of the Lent-related Shrovetide survived the 16th-century [[English Reformation]]. The Shrovetide Carnival in the United Kingdom is celebrated in [[Cowes]] and [[East Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].

On Carnival Thursday (called \"Old Women Day\" or \"The Women's Day\" in commemoration of an 1824 revolt by washer-women), women storm city halls, cut men's ties, and are allowed to kiss any passing man. Special acrobatic show dances in mock uniforms are a traditional contribution to most festive balls. They may or may not have been a source of inspiration to American cheerleading.

It is known for its creative designs, displayed in the Carnival Parade, which features troupes with themed costumes and music, ranging from the traditional to pop culture. Along with the Carnival Parade, there are five nights of partying, finishing with the famous 'Magical night' where people come from all over the country, mostly with their handmade costumes, only to have fun with the locals.<ref>http://www.portugalvoyager.com/?q=content/carnival-portugal</ref>\n\n===== Other regions =====\nIn [[Estarreja]], in the Central region of Portugal, the town's first references to Carnival were in the 14th century, with \"Flower Battles\", richly decorated floats that paraded through the streets. At the beginning of the twentieth century, these festivities ended with the deaths of its main promoters, only to reappear again in the 1960s to become one of many important Carnival festivals in Portugal.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn the Northern region of [[Podence e Santa Combinha|Podence]], children appear from Sunday to Tuesday with tin masks and colorful multilayered costumes made from red, green and yellow wool. In the Central Portugal towns of [[Nelas]] and [[Canas de Senhorim]], Carnival is an important tourist event. Nelas and Canas de Senhorim host four festive parades that offer colorful and creative costumes: Bairro da Igreja and Cimo do Povo in Nelas and do Pa\u00e7o and do Rossio in Canas de Senhorim.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn [[Lisbon]], Carnival offers parades, dances and festivities featuring stars from Portugal and Brazil. The [[Loures]] Carnival celebrates the country's folk traditions, including the ''enterro do bacalhau'' or burial of the [[cod]], which marks the end of Carnival and the festivities.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nNorth of Lisbon is the famous [[Torres Vedras]] Carnival, described as the \"most Portuguese in Portugal\".

It celebrates by burning colorful effigies and dressing in home-made costumes. Locally-made wooden masks are worn. The masks are effigies of men and women with horns, but both roles are performed by men. They are distinguished by their clothes, with caricature attributes of both men and women.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe Lazarim Carnaval cycle encompasses two periods, the first starting on the fifth Sunday before Quinquagesima Sunday. Masked figures and people wearing large sculpted heads walk through the town. The locals feast on meats, above all [[pork]]. The second cycle, held on Sundays preceding Ash Wednesday, incorporates the tradition of the Compadres and Comadres, with men and women displaying light-hearted authority over the other.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOver the five weeks, men prepare large masked heads and women raise funds to pay for two [[mannequin]]s that will be sacrificed in a public bonfire. This is a key event and is unique to Portugal. During the bonfire, a girl reads the Compadre's will and a boy reads the Comadre's will. The executors of the will are named, a [[donkey]] is symbolically distributed to both female and male \"heirs\", and then there is the final reckoning in which the Entrudo, or Carnival doll, is burned.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Russia====\n{{Main|Maslenitsa}}\n{{See also|Slavic carnival}}\n\n[[File:Shrovetide.

It is celebrated during the last week before Lent. The essential element is [[bliny]], Russian pancakes, popularly taken to symbolize the sun.

(In the tradition of Orthodox Lent, the consumption of meat ceases one week before that of milk and eggs.){{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMaslenitsa also includes [[Masquerade ball|masquerades]], snowball fights, sledding, swinging on swings, and sleigh rides.

The [[Slovenia]]n countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters, among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent (plural: ''Kurenti''), a monstrous and demon-like, but fluffy figure. The most significant festival is held in [[Ptuj]] (see: [[Kurentovanje]]). Its special feature are the Kurents themselves, magical creatures from another world, who visit major events throughout the country, trying to banish the winter and announce spring's arrival, fertility, and new life with noise and dancing. The origin of the Kurent is a mystery, and not much is known of the times, beliefs, or purposes connected with its first appearance. The origin of the name itself is obscure.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe [[Cerknica]] Carnival is heralded by a figure called \"Poganji\u010d\" carrying a whip. In the procession, organised by the \"Pust society\", a monstrous witch named Ur\u0161ula is driven from the mountain [[Slivnica (mountain)|Slivnica]], to be burned at the stake on Ash Wednesday. Unique to this region is a group of [[dormice]], driven by the Devil and a huge fire-breathing dragon. [[Cerkno]] and its surrounding area are known for the ''Laufarji'', Carnival figures with artistically carved wooden masks.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe ''Ma\u0161kare'' from [[Dobrepolje]] used to represent a triple character: the beautiful, the ugly (among which the most important represented by an old man, an old woman, a hunchback, and a ''Kurent''), and the noble (imitating the urban elite).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe major part of the population, especially the young and children, dress up in ordinary non-ethnic costumes, going to school, work, and organized events, where prizes are given for the best and most original costumes. Costumed children sometimes go from house to house asking for treats.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Spain====\n[[File:El entierro de la sardina, Francisco de Goya.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''[[The Burial of the Sardine]]'', Francisco Goya, c. 1812]]\nArguably the most famous Carnivals in Spain are [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]], [[Las Palmas]], [[Sitges]], [[Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa]], [[Tarragona]], [[\u00c1guilas]], [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[Badajoz]], [[Bielsa]] (an ancestral Carnival celebration), [[Plan, Aragon|Plan]], [[San Juan de Plan]], [[Laza, Spain|Laza]], [[Ver\u00edn]], Viana, and [[Xinzo de Limia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOne of the oldest pre-Indo-European carnival in Europe takes place in [[Ituren]] and [[Zubieta]] in [[Navarre]] in late January/early February.

The feeling of this Carnival is the sharp criticism, the funny play on words and the imagination in the costumes, more than the glamorous dressings. It is traditional to paint the face with [[lipstick]] as a humble substitute of a mask.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.6tour.com/en/2016/01/carnevale-2016-mete-ed-eventi-in-italia/|title=Carnival 2016, celebrations around the world|date=2016-01-19|website=6tour MAGAZINE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous groups are the [[chirigota]]s, choirs, and [[comparsa]]s. The chirigotas are well known witty, satiric popular groups who sing about politics, new times, and household topics, wearing the same costume, which they prepare for the whole year. The Choirs (''coros'') are wider groups that go on open carts through the streets singing with an orchestra of guitars and lutes. Their signature piece is the \"Carnival Tango\", alternating comical and serious repertory. The comparsas are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in C\u00e1diz, and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients.

Festivities are held in the open air, beginning with a ''cercavila'', a ritual procession throughout the town to call everyone to attend. ''Rues'' of masked revelers dance alongside. On Thursday, ''Dijous Gras'' (Fat Thursday) is celebrated, also called 'omelette day' (el ''dia de la truita''), on which ''[[coca (pastry)|coques]]'' (''de llardons, butifarra d'ou, butifarra''), and [[omelette]]s are eaten. The festivities end on Ash Wednesday with elaborate funeral rituals marking the death of King Carnival, who is typically burned on a [[pyre]] in what is called the \"burial of the [[sardine]]\" (''enterrament de la sardina''), or, in Vilanova, as ''l'enterro''.<ref name=\"Erickson, Brad 2008\">Erickson, Brad. 2008.

It adopts an ancient style in which satire, the [[grotesque body]]<ref name=Bakhtin/> (particularly [[cross-dressing]] and displays of exaggerated bellies, noses, and phalli) and above all, active participation are valued over glamorous, media-friendly spectacles that Vilanovins mock as \"thighs and feathers\".<ref>''Diari de Vilanova''. 2006. \"Surten 50 carrosses a rebre un Carnestoltes que no ve\". 24, 22 February.</ref> It is best known for ''Les Comparses'' (held on Sunday), a tumultuous dance in which thousands of dancers in traditional dresses and ''Mantons de Manila'' (Manila shawls), organized into groups of couples march in the street forming lines while throwing tons of hard candies at one another. Vilanovinians organize several rituals during the week. On ''Dijous Gras,'' Vilanovin children are excused from school to participate in the ''Merengada,'' a day-long scene of eating and fighting with sticky, sweet [[meringue]] while adults have a meringue battle at midnight at the historic ''Pla\u00e7a de les Cols''.\n[[File:Merengada.jpg|thumb|Children become covered in meringue during Dijous Gras.]]On Friday citizens are called to a parade for the arrival of King Carnival called ''l'Arrivo'' that changes every year.

On Saturday, the King's procession and his [[concubine]]s scandalize the town with their sexual behavior, the mysterious ''Moixo Foguer'' (Little-Bird-Bonfire) is shown accompanied by the ''Xerraire'' (jabberer) who try to convince the crowd about the wonders of this mighty bird he carries in a box (who is in fact a naked person covered in feathers).<ref>''Diari de Vilanova''. 2006. \"Plomes amb control sanitari per al Moix\u00f3\". 24 February 23.</ref> and other items such as sport acts and barbecues in the streets, the ''talking-dance'' of the Mismatched Couples (''Ball de Malcasats''), the children's King ''Caramel'' whose massive belly, long nose and sausage-like hair hint at his insatiable appetites, or the debauched ''Nit dels Mascarots'' dance.\n[[File:Malcasats.jpg|thumb|The Ball de Malcasats (Dance of the Mismatched Couples) is a satiric talking-dance traditional to Carnaval in Vilanova.]]\nAfter Sunday, vilanovinians continue its Carnival with the children's party''Vidalet'', the satirical chorus of Carnestoltes songs and the last night of revelry, the ''Vidalot.'' For the King's funeral, people dress in elaborate mourning costume, many of them cross-dressing men who carry bouquets of phallic vegetables. In the funeral house, the body of the King is surrounded by weeping concubines, crying over the loss of sexual pleasure brought about by his death. The King's body is carried to the ''Pla\u00e7a de la Vila'' where a satiric eulogy is delivered while the townspeople eat salty grilled sardines with bread and wine, suggesting the symbolic [[cannibalism]] of the communion ritual.

The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell \u2212 because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower. To celebrate this legend, locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that \"pisses\" above the excited crowd using a water pump. This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night.

Many local Carnival customs are claimed to derive from local pre-Christian rituals, such as elaborate rites involving masked figures in the [[Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht]]. However, evidence is insufficient to establish a direct origin from Saturnalia or other ancient festivals. No complete accounts of Saturnalia survive, and the shared features of feasting, role reversals, temporary social equality, masks, and permitted rule-breaking do not necessarily constitute a coherent festival or link these festivals. These similarities may represent a reservoir of cultural resources that can embody multiple meanings and functions. For example, Easter begins with the [[resurrection of Jesus]], followed by a liminal period, and ends with rebirth. Carnival reverses this as King Carnival comes to life, and a liminal period follows before his death. Both feasts are calculated by the [[lunar calendar]]. Both Jesus and King Carnival may be seen as expiatory figures who make a gift to the people with their deaths. In the case of Jesus, the gift is [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] in [[heaven]], and in the case of King Carnival, the acknowledgement that death is a necessary part of the cycle of life.<ref>Erickson, Brad. 2008.

The [[Carnival of Venice]] was, for a long time, the most famous carnival (although [[Napoleon]] abolished it in 1797 and only in 1979 was the tradition restored). From Italy, Carnival traditions spread to Spain, Portugal, and France, and from France to [[New France]] in North America. From Spain and Portugal, it spread with colonization to the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. In the early 19th century in the German [[Rhineland]] and [[Southern Netherlands]], the weakened medieval tradition also revived. Continuously in the 18th and 19th centuries CE, as part of the annual Saturnalia abuse of the carnival in Rome, [[rabbi]]s of the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|ghetto]] were forced to march through the city streets wearing foolish guise, jeered upon and pelted by a variety of missiles from the crowd. A petition of the Jewish community of Rome sent in 1836 to [[Pope Gregory XVI]] to stop the annual anti-semitic Saturnalia abuse got a negation: \"It is not opportune to make any innovation.\"<ref name=\"DIKertzer\"/>{{rp|33,74\u201375}}\n\nIn the Rhineland in 1823, the first modern Carnival parade took place in [[Cologne]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.koelner-karneval.info/Dreigestirn/Dreigestirn.htm| title=Das K\u00f6lner Dreigestirn| work=koelner-karneval.info| access-date=31 May 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325173847/http://www.koelner-karneval.info/Dreigestirn/Dreigestirn.htm| archive-date=25 March 2016| url-status=live}}</ref>  Carnaval (''[[Fasching]]'' or ''Fastnacht'' in Germany) mixed pagan traditions with Christian traditions.

Crop Over began in 1688, and featured singing, dancing, and accompaniment by [[shak-shak]], [[banjo]], [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[fiddle]], guitar, bottles filled with water, and bones. Other traditions included climbing a greased pole, feasting, and drinking competitions. Originally signaling the end of the yearly cane harvest, it evolved into a national festival. In the late 20th century, Crop Over began to closely mirror the Trinidad Carnival. Beginning in June, Crop Over runs until the first Monday in August when it culminates in the finale, the Grand Kadooment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCrop Over time for many islanders is one big party. Craft markets, food tents/stalls, street parties, and cavalcades fill every week.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA major feature is the [[calypso music|calypso]] competition. Calypso music, originating in Trinidad, uses syncopated rhythm and topical lyrics. It offers a medium in which to satirise local politics, amidst the general bacchanal. Calypso tents, also originating in Trinidad, feature cadres of musicians who perform biting social commentaries, political expos\u00e9s or rousing exhortations to \"wuk dah waistline\" and \"roll dat bumper\". The groups compete for the Calypso Monarch Award, while the air is redolent with the smells of [[Barbadian cuisine|Bajan]] cooking during the [[Bridgetown]] Market Street Fair. The Cohobblopot Festival blends dance, drama, and music with the crowning of the King and Queen of costume bands. Every evening the \"Pic-o-de-Crop\" Show is performed after the King of Calypso is finally crowned. The climax of the festival is Kadooment Day, celebrated with a national holiday, when costume bands fill the streets with pulsating Barbadian rhythms and fireworks.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Belize====\n{{Main|Carnival in Belize}}\n\n[[San Pedro Town|San Pedro]] is one of [[Belize]]'s few cities to observe Carnaval before Lent.

The largest and most well-known is in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. [[Antigua]], [[Aruba]], [[Barbados]], [[Bonaire]], [[Cayman Islands]], [[Cuba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Dominica]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Grenada]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Guyana]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]], [[Saba]], [[Sint Eustatius]] (Statia), [[Sint Maarten]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Kitts]], [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands]], [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]], and the [[Grenadines]] hold lengthy carnival seasons and large celebrations.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival is an important cultural event in the [[Dutch Caribbean]]. Festivities include \"jump-up\" parades with beautifully colored costumes, floats, and live bands, as well as [[beauty contests]] and other competitions. Celebrations include a middle-of-the-night [[j'ouvert]] (''juv\u00e9'') parade that ends at sunrise with the burning of a straw [[King Momo]], cleansing sins and bad luck. On Statia, he is called Prince Stupid.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival has been celebrated in Cuba since the 18th century. Participants don costumes from the island's cultural and ethnic variety. After [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Cuban Revolution|Communist Revolution]], Carnival's religious overtones were suppressed.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} The events remained, albeit frowned upon by the state.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} Carnival celebrations have been in decline throughout Cuba since then.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Colombia====\n[[File:DIOSESANCESTRALES HUGOMONCAYO2007 4.jpg|thumb|260px|The [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]] in [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]]]]\n{{Main|Carnival in Colombia}}\nCarnival was introduced by the Spaniards and incorporated elements from [[European culture]]s. It has managed to reinterpret traditions that belonged to Colombia's African and [[Amerindian]] cultures. Documentary evidence shows that Carnival existed in Colombia in the 18th century and had already been a cause for concern for colonial authorities, who censored the celebrations, especially in the main political centres such as [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Bogot\u00e1]], and [[Popay\u00e1n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe Carnival continued its evolution in small/unimportant towns out of view of the rulers. The result was the uninterrupted celebration of Carnival festivals in [[Barranquilla]] (see [[Barranquilla's Carnival]]), now recognized as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. The Barranquilla Carnival includes several parades on Friday and Saturday nights beginning on 11 January and ending with a six-day non-stop festival, beginning the Wednesday prior to Ash Wednesday and ending Tuesday midnight. Other celebrations occur in villages along the lower [[Magdalena River]] in northern Colombia, and in [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]] and [[Nari\u00f1o]] (see [[Blacks and Whites' Carnival]]) in the south of the country. In the early 20th century, attempts to introduce Carnival in Bogot\u00e1 were rejected by the government. The [[Bogot\u00e1 Carnival]] was renewed in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Dominica====\n[[File:Dominicaband2.jpg|alt=Band members performing on drums while in the street; one member is wearing a monkey mask and comic hat.|thumb|right|300px|A Dominican Carnival costume band]]\n\n{{Main|Chant\u00e9 mas}}\nCarnival in [[Dominica]] is held in the capital city of [[Roseau]], and takes elements of Carnival that can be seen in the neighbouring French islands of [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], as well as [[Trinidad]]. Notable events leading up to Carnival include the Opening of Carnival celebrations, the Calypso Monarch music competition, the Queen of Carnival Beauty Pageant, and [[bouyon music]] bands. Celebrations last for the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Dominican Republic====\n{{Main|Carnival in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] Carnival is celebrated in most cities and towns in the main streets during February. Among its main characteristics are its flashy costumes and loud music. The one held in [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]], which is one of the biggest in the country, and the national parade in [[Santo Domingo]] were where the first Carnival of the Americas was held.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival masks are elaborate and colorful. The costumes used on the parades are satires of the Devil and are called \"Diablos Cojuelos\". They dance, and run to the rhythm of [[merengue music]] mixed with techno, hip-hop, and [[reggaeton]]. Additional [[allegorical]] characters represent Dominican traditions such as \"Roba la Gallina\" and \"Calif\u00e9\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOne of the most international parades is in [[San Pedro de Macor\u00eds]]. It exhibits the \"Guloyas\" parade of costumed groups dancing in the streets. Revelers flee from the \"Diablos Cojuelos\" who try to hit them with \"Vejigas\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe timing of the festivals has grown apart from its original religious synchronization with the period of Lent. With National Independence Day on 27 February and the birthday of [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], its founding father, on 26 January, the Carnival celebrations fill February regardless of the [[Lenten calendar]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Ecuador====\n[[File:Desfile de Carnaval en calles de Latacunga.jpg|thumb|Carnival parade in [[Latacunga]] city.]]\n[[File:Comparsa latacungue\u00f1a desfilando.jpg|thumb|Party in Latacunga city.]]\nIn [[Ecuador]], the celebrations began before the arrival of Catholicism. The Huarangas Indians (from the Chimbos nation) used to celebrate the second moon of the year with a festival at which they threw flour, flowers, and perfumed water. This indigenous tradition merged with the Catholic celebration of Carnival.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nA common feature of Ecuadorian Carnival is the ''diablitos'' (little devils) who play with water. As with snowball fights, the practice of throwing or dumping water on unsuspecting victims is revered by children and teenagers although feared by some adults. Throwing water balloons, sometimes even eggs and flour both to friends and strangers is fun, but can also upset the uninformed.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAlthough the government as well as school authorities forbid such games, they are widely practiced. Historians tell of a bishop in 1867 who threatened [[excommunication]] for the [[sin]] of playing Carnival games.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFestivals differ across the country. Locals wear disguises with colorful masks and dance. Usually, the celebrations begin with the election of ''Taita Carnival'' (Father Carnival) who heads the festivities and leads the parades in each city.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe most famed Carnival festivities are in [[Guaranda]] (Bolivar province) and [[Ambato, Ecuador|Ambato]] (Tungurahua province). In Ambato, the festivities are called ''Fiesta de las Flores y las Frutas'' (Festival of the Flowers and Fruits). Other cities have revived Carnival traditions with colorful parades, such as in [[Azogues]] (Ca\u00f1ar Province). In Azogues and the Southern [[Andes]] in general, ''Taita Carnival'' is always an indigenous [[Ca\u00f1ari]]. Recently, a celebration has gained prominence in the northern part of the Andes in the [[Chota Valley]] in [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]] which is a zone of a strong [[Afro-Ecuadorian]] population and so the Carnival is celebrated with [[Bomba (Ecuador)|bomba del chota]] music.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Latacunga]] celebrates Carnival in three manners:<ref>{{cite web| title=Carnival Latacunga| url=http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101464647/-1/Celebraci%C3%B3n_y_fiesta__en_La_Laguna.html#.Vj0nsdIrLcc| accessdate=6 November 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117032136/http://www.lahora.com.ec/index.php/noticias/show/1101464647/-1/Celebraci%C3%B3n_y_fiesta__en_La_Laguna.html#.Vj0nsdIrLcc| archive-date=17 November 2015| url-status=live}}</ref> Carnival with water where people play with water, religious Carnival where people make religious festivity, and Carnival parade in the city in which people march on the Latacunga streets wearing masks while they dance with music bands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====French Guiana====\n{{Main|Carnival in French Guiana}}\n\nThe Carnival of [[French Guiana]] has roots in [[Creole peoples|Creole]] culture. Everyone participates \u2013 mainland French, Brazilians (Guiana has a frontier with Brazil), and Chinese as well as Creoles.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIts duration is variable, determined by movable religious festivals: Carnival begins at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] and ends on Ash Wednesday, and so typically lasts through most of January and February. During this period, from Friday evening until Monday morning the entire country throbs to the rhythm of masked balls and street parades.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFriday afternoons are for eating ''galette des rois'' (the cake of kings) and drinking champagne. The cake may be flavoured with [[frangipani]], [[guava]], or [[coconut]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOn Sunday afternoons, major parades fill the streets of [[Cayenne]], [[Kourou]], and Saint-Laurent du Maroni. Competing groups prepare for months. Dressed to follow the year's agreed theme, they march with Carnival floats, drums, and brass bands.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nBrazilian groups are appreciated for their elaborate feathered and sequined costumes. However, they are not eligible for competition since the costumes do not change over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nMythical characters appear regularly in the parades:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* ''Karolin'' \u2212 a small person dressed in a [[magpie]] tail and [[top hat]], riding on a [[shrew]].\n* ''Les N\u00e8g'marrons'' \u2212 groups of men dressed in red [[loincloth]]s, bearing ripe tomatoes in their mouths while their bodies are smeared with grease or [[molasses]]. They deliberately try to come in contact with spectators, soiling their clothes.\n* ''Les makoum\u00e9s'' \u2212 [[cross-dressing]] men (out of the Carnival context, ''makoum\u00e9'' is a pejorative term for a [[homosexual]]).\n* ''Soussouris'' (the bat) \u2212 a character dressed in a winged [[leotard]] from head to foot, usually black in colour. Traditionally malevolent, this character is liable to chase spectators and \"sting\" them.\n\n[[File:Toulou.jpg|thumb|right|Four touloulous]]\nA uniquely Creole tradition are the ''touloulous''. These women wear decorative gowns, gloves, masks, and headdresses that cover them completely, making them unrecognisable, even to the colour of their skin. On Friday and Saturday nights of Carnival, touloulou balls are held in so-called \"universities\", large dance halls that open only at Carnival time. Touloulous get in free, and are even given [[condom]]s in the interest of the sexual health of the community. Men attend the balls, but they pay admittance and are not disguised. The touloulous pick their dance partners, who may not refuse. The setup is designed to make it easy for a woman to create a temporary liaison with a man in total anonymity. Undisguised women are not welcomed. By tradition, if such a woman gets up to dance, the orchestra stops playing. Alcohol is served at bars \u2013 the disguised women whisper to the men \"touloulou thirsty\", at which a round of drinks is expected, to be drunk through a straw protect their anonymity.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn more modern times, Guyanais men have attempted to turn the tables by staging ''soir\u00e9es tololo'', in which it is the men who, in disguise, seek partners from undisguised women bystanders.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe final four days of Carnival follow a rigid schedule, and no work is done:{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n* Sunday \u2212 The Grand Parade, in which the groups compete.\n* Monday \u2212 Marriage burlesque, with men dressed as brides and women as grooms.\n* Tuesday \u2212 Red Devil Day in which everyone wears red or black.\n* (Ash) Wednesday \u2212 Dress is black and white only, for the grand ceremony of burning the effigy of Vaval, King Carnival.\n\n====Guatemala====\nThe most famous Carnival celebration in [[Guatemala]] is in [[Mazatenango]]. During February, Mazatenango is famous for its eight-day Carnival Feast. Days of food, music, parades, and games fill the streets of the [[Suchitep\u00e9quez Department]]. As one Guatemalan website states, \"To mention the Carnival of Mazatenango is to bring to mind moments of a happy and cordial party. In the eight days of this celebration's duration, the local residents have kept alive the traditions of the Department.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Haiti====\n{{Main|Haitian Carnival}}\nCarnival in [[Haiti]] started in 1804 in the capital [[Port-au-Prince]] after the [[Haitian Declaration of Independence|declaration of independence]]. The Port-au-Prince Carnival is one of the largest in North America. It is known as Kanaval in the [[Creole language]]. It starts in January, known as \"Pre-Kanaval\", while the main carnival activities begin in February. In July 2012, Haiti had another carnival called Kanaval de Fleur.

This festival emphasises religion. Songs are composed each year, and bands play bamboo tubes (''vaksin'') and homemade horns (''kon\u00e8t'').

The larger city Carnavals employ costumes, elected queens, and parades with floats, but Carnaval celebrations in smaller and rural areas vary widely depending on the level of European influence during Mexico's colonial period. The largest of these is in [[Huejotzingo]], [[Puebla]], where most townspeople take part in mock combat with rifles shooting blanks, roughly based on the [[Battle of Puebla]].

Carnival Week is especially popular because of the opulent [[Las Tablas, Los Santos|Las Tablas]] Carnival as well as the Carnival celebrations in [[Panama City]] and almost all of the [[Azuero Peninsula]]. The Panamanian Carnival is also popular because of the concerts featuring popular artists in the most visited areas.\n\nConcerts are often carried out during the night, and continue until the next morning. Carnival Week is a national holiday in Panama, with most businesses and government offices remaining closed during its duration, and with most Panamanians opting to go to the country's rural areas to participate on the Carnivals and visit their relatives. Carnivals in Panama also feature large repurposed fuel trucks that are used for soaking attendees through the use of firehoses that are controlled and directed by one or more people that stand in a platform that is mounted on top of the truck. This is known as \"culecos\" or \"los culecos\". Trucks get their water from nearby, government-approved rivers, and the water is tested for cleanliness before use. Culecos are often performed from 10 AM to 3 PM, when the sun is at its brightest. Children and pregnant women are banned from participating in the culecos, and the trucks are always sponsored by a well-known Panamanian company or brand. The culecos are also often accompanied by reggaeton concerts.<ref>https://ensegundos.com.pa/2018/02/08/prohiben-ingreso-de-embarazadas-y-ninos-a-culecos/</ref><ref>https://www.laestrella.com.pa/nacional/170214/diez-seran-manana-culecos</ref><ref>https://www.telemetro.com/nacionales/2018/02/05/minsa-verificacion-cisternas-participaran-carnavales/1190582.html</ref><ref>https://ensegundos.com.pa/2017/02/25/miambiente-supervisa-carga-de-agua-a-carros-cisternas-para-los-culecos/</ref>\n\nThe open consumption of large amounts of cold, [[low-alcohol beer]] or [[Smirnoff]], stored in ice-filled coolers, is common among attendees. Just like in Rio de Janeiro, some carnivals also feature floats, but they may have young women with elaborate costumes that stand as the \"Queens\" of \"Calle Arriba\" and \"Calle Abajo\", representing rich and working-class people, respectively. The queens are chosen through a contest and announced on October of the previous year, and are replaced every year. The queens are introduced on the first carnival day, and are always accompanied by a music band, who are present whenever the queens are present. Fireworks are launched on the last carnival night, to signal the end of the carnival.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/carnaval_english.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428054119/http://www.amazing-holland.nl/assets/carnaval_english.pdf |archive-date=28 April 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Peru====\n[[File:Carnaval de juliaca.jpg|thumb|200 px|Morenada dance, in the Carnival of [[Juliaca]] \u2013 Peru]]\n\n=====Cajamarca=====\nThe town of [[Cajamarca]] is considered the capital of Carnival in [[Peru]].

Tobago's celebration culminates on Monday and Tuesday on a much smaller scale. Carnival combines costumes, dance, music, competitions, rum, and partying (fete-ing). Music styles include soca, [[calypso music|calypso]], [[rapso]], and more recently [[Chutney music|chutney]] and [[chutney soca]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe annual Carnival [[steel pan]] competition known as the National Panorama competition holds the finals on the Saturday before the main event. Pan players compete in categories such as \"Conventional Steel Band\" or \"Single Pan Band\" by performing renditions of the year's calypsos.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n\"Dimanche Gras\" takes place on the Sunday night before Ash Wednesday. Here the [[Calypso Monarch]] is chosen (after competition) and prize money and a vehicle awarded. The King and Queen of the bands are crowned, where each band parades costumes for two days and submits a king and queen, from which an overall winner is chosen. These usually involve huge, complex, beautiful well-crafted costumes, that includes 'wire-bending'.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nJ'ouvert, or \"Dirty Mas\", takes place before dawn on the Monday (known as Carnival Monday) before Ash Wednesday. It means \"opening of the day\". Revelers dress in costumes embodying puns on current affairs, especially political and social events. \"Clean Mud\" (clay mud), oil paint and body paint are familiar during J'ouvert. A common character is \"Jab-jabs\" (devils, blue, black, or red) complete with pitchfork, pointed horns and tails. A King and Queen of J'ouvert are chosen, based on their witty political/social messages.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Carnival Costume in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|The Carnival King costume for a particular band]]\nCarnival Monday involves the parade of the mas bands. Revelers wear only parts of their costumes, more for fun than display or competition. Monday Night Mas is popular in most towns and especially the capital, where smaller bands compete. There is also the \"Bomb Competition\", a smaller-scaled judging of steel bands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gotrinidadandtobago.com/trinidad-and-tobago/carnival-in-trinidad.html|title=Carnival in Trinidad \u2013 Trinidad & Tobago \u2013 The true caribbean \u2013 Trinidad & Tobago \u2013 The true caribbean|website=gotrinidadandtobago.com|access-date=21 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207043929/http://gotrinidadandtobago.com/trinidad-and-tobago/carnival-in-trinidad.html|archive-date=7 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nCarnival Tuesday hosts the main events. Full costume is worn, complete with make-up and body paint/adornment. Usually \"Mas Boots\" that complement the costumes are worn. Each band has their costume presentation based on a particular theme, and contains various sections (some consisting of thousands of revelers) that reflect these themes. The street parade and band costume competition take place. The mas bands eventually converge on the Queen's Park Savannah to pass on \"The Stage\" for judging. The singer of the most played song is crowned Road March King or Queen, earning prize money and usually a vehicle.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThis parading and revelry goes on until Tuesday midnight. Ash Wednesday itself, while not an official holiday, sends flocks to local beaches. The most popular are [[Maracas Beach]] and [[Manzanilla Beach, Trinidad and Tobago|Manzanilla Beach]], where huge beach parties take place on Ash Wednesday.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====United States====\n{{Main|Mardi Gras in the United States|Mardi Gras in Mobile, Alabama|Mardi Gras in New Orleans|Courir de Mardi Gras}}\n[[File:StAnne06Marigny29.jpg|thumbnail|right|Revelers on [[Frenchmen Street]], New Orleans, 2006]]\n\nCarnival celebrations, usually referred to as [[Mardi Gras]] (\"Fat Tuesday\" in French), were first celebrated in the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] area, but now occur in many states.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/06/the-obscure-origins-of-american-mardi-gras-which-begins-today/|title=The Obscure Origins of American Mardi Gras|last=Andrews|first=Travis|date=January 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419080129/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/01/06/the-obscure-origins-of-american-mardi-gras-which-begins-today/|archive-date=19 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Customs originated in the onetime [[Louisiana (New France)|French colonial]] capitals of [[Mardi Gras in Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] (now in [[Alabama]]), [[New Orleans]] ([[Louisiana]]), and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] ([[Mississippi]]), all of which have celebrated for many years with street parades and masked balls.

In the mid twentieth century, West Indians moved the event from the beginning of Lent to the Labor Day weekend.

Although a pagan holiday, the Carnival was later celebrated on Feast Day in February. In addition to the many carnival-wearing individuals, there were bands with guitars, bows, and butaphoric masks such as animal heads and humans. The Kor\u00e7a Carnival took a big hit after the creation of cultural societies such as the \"Kor\u00e7a Youth\". During this period carnivals were accompanied by mandolins, guitars and humorous songs. Carnival celebrations were discontinued after 60, to resume in other social conditions after 90. Kor\u00e7a is one of the first cities to revive the Carnival tradition by establishing the Carnival Association in 1992 as part of the National Carnival Association of Albania. On April 10, 1994, the first International Carnival Festival in Albania was organized in Kor\u00e7a. The following year, the second International Carnival Festival is even larger.

Some of the towns and places are Grobnik, Permani, Kastav and many others places near Rijeka. Just before the end of Carnival, every Kvarner town burns a [[effigy|man-like doll]] called a \"Pust\", who is blamed for all the strife of the previous year. The [[Zvon\u010dari]], or bell-ringers push away winter and all the bad things in the past year and calling spring, they wear bells and large head regalia representing their areas of origin (for example, those from Halubje wear regalia in the shape of animal heads).

The tradition was likely established under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule around the 16th century. It may have been influenced by Greek traditions, such as festivities for deities such as [[Dionysus]]. The celebration originally involved dressing in costumes and holding masked balls or visiting friends. In the twentieth century, it became an organized event held during the 10 days preceding Lent (according to the [[Greek Orthodox]] calendar). The festival is celebrated almost exclusively in the city of [[Limassol]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThree main parades take place during Carnival. The first is held on the first day, during which the \"Carnival King\" (either a person in costume or an [[effigy]]) rides through the city on his carriage. The second is held on the first Sunday of the festival, and the participants are mainly children. The third and largest takes place on the last day of Carnival and involves hundreds of people walking in costume along the town's longest avenue.

From 1863, the artist federation ''Kunstnerforeningen'' held annual Carnival balls in the old [[Freemasons]] lodge, which inspired [[Johan Svendsen]]'s compositions ''Norsk Kunstnerkarneval'' and ''Karneval in Paris''. The following year, Svendsen's ''Festpolonaise'' was written for the opening procession. [[Edvard Grieg]] attended and wrote \"Aus dem Karneval\" (''Folkelivsbilleder'' Op. 19). Since 1988, the student organization {{ill|T\u00e5rnseilerne|no|vertical-align=sup}} has produced annual masquerade balls in Oslo, with masks, costumes, and processions after attending an opera performance.

On Carnival Thursday (called \"Old Women Day\" or \"The Women's Day\" in commemoration of an 1824 revolt by washer-women), women storm city halls, cut men's ties, and are allowed to kiss any passing man. Special acrobatic show dances in mock uniforms are a traditional contribution to most festive balls. They may or may not have been a source of inspiration to American cheerleading.

The [[Slovenia]]n countryside displays a variety of disguised groups and individual characters, among which the most popular and characteristic is the Kurent (plural: ''Kurenti''), a monstrous and demon-like, but fluffy figure. The most significant festival is held in [[Ptuj]] (see: [[Kurentovanje]]). Its special feature are the Kurents themselves, magical creatures from another world, who visit major events throughout the country, trying to banish the winter and announce spring's arrival, fertility, and new life with noise and dancing. The origin of the Kurent is a mystery, and not much is known of the times, beliefs, or purposes connected with its first appearance. The origin of the name itself is obscure.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe [[Cerknica]] Carnival is heralded by a figure called \"Poganji\u010d\" carrying a whip. In the procession, organised by the \"Pust society\", a monstrous witch named Ur\u0161ula is driven from the mountain [[Slivnica (mountain)|Slivnica]], to be burned at the stake on Ash Wednesday. Unique to this region is a group of [[dormice]], driven by the Devil and a huge fire-breathing dragon. [[Cerkno]] and its surrounding area are known for the ''Laufarji'', Carnival figures with artistically carved wooden masks.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe ''Ma\u0161kare'' from [[Dobrepolje]] used to represent a triple character: the beautiful, the ugly (among which the most important represented by an old man, an old woman, a hunchback, and a ''Kurent''), and the noble (imitating the urban elite).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe major part of the population, especially the young and children, dress up in ordinary non-ethnic costumes, going to school, work, and organized events, where prizes are given for the best and most original costumes. Costumed children sometimes go from house to house asking for treats.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Spain====\n[[File:El entierro de la sardina, Francisco de Goya.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''[[The Burial of the Sardine]]'', Francisco Goya, c. 1812]]\nArguably the most famous Carnivals in Spain are [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Santa Cruz]], [[Las Palmas]], [[Sitges]], [[Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa]], [[Tarragona]], [[\u00c1guilas]], [[Solsona, Lleida|Solsona]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[Badajoz]], [[Bielsa]] (an ancestral Carnival celebration), [[Plan, Aragon|Plan]], [[San Juan de Plan]], [[Laza, Spain|Laza]], [[Ver\u00edn]], Viana, and [[Xinzo de Limia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nOne of the oldest pre-Indo-European carnival in Europe takes place in [[Ituren]] and [[Zubieta]] in [[Navarre]] in late January/early February.

The feeling of this Carnival is the sharp criticism, the funny play on words and the imagination in the costumes, more than the glamorous dressings. It is traditional to paint the face with [[lipstick]] as a humble substitute of a mask.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.6tour.com/en/2016/01/carnevale-2016-mete-ed-eventi-in-italia/|title=Carnival 2016, celebrations around the world|date=2016-01-19|website=6tour MAGAZINE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nThe most famous groups are the [[chirigota]]s, choirs, and [[comparsa]]s. The chirigotas are well known witty, satiric popular groups who sing about politics, new times, and household topics, wearing the same costume, which they prepare for the whole year. The Choirs (''coros'') are wider groups that go on open carts through the streets singing with an orchestra of guitars and lutes. Their signature piece is the \"Carnival Tango\", alternating comical and serious repertory. The comparsas are the serious counterpart of the chirigota in C\u00e1diz, and the poetic lyrics and the criticism are their main ingredients. They have a more elaborated [[polyphony]] that is easily recognizable by the typical [[countertenor]] voice.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n=====Canary Islands=====\n{{See also|Carnival of Las Palmas|Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife}}\n[[File:Contestant Angeles Hern\u00e1ndez Paez performs during the Tenerife Carnival Queen 2009 contest in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.jpg|thumb|Carnival Queen of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], 2009]]\n\nThe Santa Cruz Carnival is, with the Carnival of Cadiz, the most important festival for Spanish tourism and Spain's largest Carnival.<ref>{{cite web| author=Jorge |url=http://fiestas.edreams.es/Carnival/el-Carnival-de-tenerife/ |title=Fiestas de Espa\u00f1a.

Festivities are held in the open air, beginning with a ''cercavila'', a ritual procession throughout the town to call everyone to attend. ''Rues'' of masked revelers dance alongside. On Thursday, ''Dijous Gras'' (Fat Thursday) is celebrated, also called 'omelette day' (el ''dia de la truita''), on which ''[[coca (pastry)|coques]]'' (''de llardons, butifarra d'ou, butifarra''), and [[omelette]]s are eaten. The festivities end on Ash Wednesday with elaborate funeral rituals marking the death of King Carnival, who is typically burned on a [[pyre]] in what is called the \"burial of the [[sardine]]\" (''enterrament de la sardina''), or, in Vilanova, as ''l'enterro''.<ref name=\"Erickson, Brad 2008\">Erickson, Brad. 2008.

''Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa i el seu gran Carnaval''. Barcelona: Editorial P\u00f2rtic.</ref> and is one of the richest in the variety of its acts and rituals. It adopts an ancient style in which satire, the [[grotesque body]]<ref name=Bakhtin/> (particularly [[cross-dressing]] and displays of exaggerated bellies, noses, and phalli) and above all, active participation are valued over glamorous, media-friendly spectacles that Vilanovins mock as \"thighs and feathers\".<ref>''Diari de Vilanova''. 2006. \"Surten 50 carrosses a rebre un Carnestoltes que no ve\". 24, 22 February.</ref> It is best known for ''Les Comparses'' (held on Sunday), a tumultuous dance in which thousands of dancers in traditional dresses and ''Mantons de Manila'' (Manila shawls), organized into groups of couples march in the street forming lines while throwing tons of hard candies at one another. Vilanovinians organize several rituals during the week. On ''Dijous Gras,'' Vilanovin children are excused from school to participate in the ''Merengada,'' a day-long scene of eating and fighting with sticky, sweet [[meringue]] while adults have a meringue battle at midnight at the historic ''Pla\u00e7a de les Cols''.\n[[File:Merengada.jpg|thumb|Children become covered in meringue during Dijous Gras.]]On Friday citizens are called to a parade for the arrival of King Carnival called ''l'Arrivo'' that changes every year. It includes a raucous procession of floats and dancers lampooning current events or public figures and a bitingly satiric sermon (''el sermo'') delivered by the King himself. On Saturday, the King's procession and his [[concubine]]s scandalize the town with their sexual behavior, the mysterious ''Moixo Foguer'' (Little-Bird-Bonfire) is shown accompanied by the ''Xerraire'' (jabberer) who try to convince the crowd about the wonders of this mighty bird he carries in a box (who is in fact a naked person covered in feathers).<ref>''Diari de Vilanova''. 2006. \"Plomes amb control sanitari per al Moix\u00f3\". 24 February 23.</ref> and other items such as sport acts and barbecues in the streets, the ''talking-dance'' of the Mismatched Couples (''Ball de Malcasats''), the children's King ''Caramel'' whose massive belly, long nose and sausage-like hair hint at his insatiable appetites, or the debauched ''Nit dels Mascarots'' dance.\n[[File:Malcasats.jpg|thumb|The Ball de Malcasats (Dance of the Mismatched Couples) is a satiric talking-dance traditional to Carnaval in Vilanova.]]\nAfter Sunday, vilanovinians continue its Carnival with the children's party''Vidalet'', the satirical chorus of Carnestoltes songs and the last night of revelry, the ''Vidalot.'' For the King's funeral, people dress in elaborate mourning costume, many of them cross-dressing men who carry bouquets of phallic vegetables. In the funeral house, the body of the King is surrounded by weeping concubines, crying over the loss of sexual pleasure brought about by his death. The King's body is carried to the ''Pla\u00e7a de la Vila'' where a satiric eulogy is delivered while the townspeople eat salty grilled sardines with bread and wine, suggesting the symbolic [[cannibalism]] of the communion ritual.

It is one of the longest; free events in the streets and nightly concerts run for more than a week. The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell \u2212 because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower. To celebrate this legend, locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that \"pisses\" above the excited crowd using a water pump. This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night. For this reason, the inhabitants are called ''matarrucs'' (\"donkey killers\").<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.onsortir.cat/contents/1027/so/612.jpg |title=OnSortir |work=onsortir.cat |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219004539/http://www.onsortir.cat/contents/1027/so/612.jpg |archivedate=19 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\n\"Comparses\" groups organize free activities.

Around 40 floats draw more than 2,500 participants.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[Tarragona]] has one of the region's most complete ritual sequences. The events start with the building of a huge barrel and ends with its burning with the effigies of the King and Queen. On Saturday, the main parade takes place with masked groups, zoomorphic figures, music, and percussion bands, and groups with [[fireworks]] (the devils, the dragon, the ox, the female dragon). Carnival groups stand out for their clothes full of elegance, showing brilliant examples of fabric crafts, at the Saturday and Sunday parades. About 5,000 people are members of the parade groups.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===== Valencian Community =====\nOne of the most important Spanish Carnival Festivals is celebrated in [[Vinar\u00f2s]], a small town situated in the northern part of the [[province of Castell\u00f3n]], [[Valencian Community]].\n\nThe Carnival Festival in Vinar\u00f2s has been declared of Regional Touristic Interest and in 2017, this outstanding and ancient show celebrates 35 years of History. The Carnival Festival in Vinar\u00f2s became a forbidden celebration during the [[Spanish Civil War]] but after the dictatorship, the party regained importance with the democracy's arrival.\n\nEvery year in February, forty days before the Spanish [[Cuaresma]], thirty-three \"comparsas\" go singing, dancing and walking down the streets in a great costumes\u2019 parade in Vinar\u00f2s. In addition, other many festive, cultural and musical activities of all ages take place, such as an epic battle of confetti and flour, funny karaoke contests or the so-called \"[[Entierro de la Sardina]]\" (Burial of the Sardine).\n\nNevertheless, the most important event is the gala performance of the Carnival's Queen.
