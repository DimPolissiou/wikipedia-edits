Nativism Reconsidered|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\nAn overarching theme in examples provided as evidence for the poverty of the stimulus is that children acquire grammatical rules based on evidence that is consistent with multiple generalizations. And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)</nowiki>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n==== Learning stress systems ====\nBergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85\u201396}}</ref> The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Rejection by the scientific community==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus had been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald_Marchman_2006>{{cite book |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne| last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |editor-last= Traxler and Gernsbacher |title=Handbook of Psycholinguistics |publisher=Academic Press |date=2006 |pages=1027\u20141071 |chapter= 27: Language learning in infancy |isbn= 9780080466415 |url=https://dinus.ac.id/repository/docs/ajar/Handbook-of-Psycho-Linguistics.pdf | access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> This led to the rejection of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref> According to some professionals, five decades of research were wasted between 1964 and 2014 due to Chomsky's influence;

Chomsky illustrates that humans are not exposed to all structures of their language, yet they fully achieve knowledge of these structures.\n\nLinguistic nativism is the theory that humans are born with some knowledge of language. One acquires a language not entirely through experience.

And since children are not instructed in the grammar of their language, the gap must be filled in by properties of the learner.\n\n===Syntax===\n====Binding theory \u2013 Principle C====\n# While he was dancing, the Ninja Turtle ate pizza.\n# He ate pizza while the Ninja Turtle was dancing.\nIn general, pronouns can refer to any prominent individual in the discourse context. However, a pronoun cannot find its antecedent in certain structural positions, as defined by the [[Binding (linguistics)|Binding Theory]]. For example, the pronoun \"he\" can refer to the Ninja Turtle in (1) but not (2), above. Given that speech to children does not indicate what interpretations are impossible, the input is equally consistent with a grammar that allows coreference between \"he\" and \"the Ninja Turtle\" in (2) and one that does not. But, since all speakers of English recognize that (2) does not allow this coreference, this aspect of the grammar must come from some property internal to the learner.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Passives====\n# I believe the dog to be hungry\n# The dog is believed to be hungry\n# I believe the dog's owner to be hungry.\n# The dog's owner is believed to be hungry.\n# * The dog is believed's owner to be hungry.\nThe sentences in (1) and (2) illustrate the [[English passive voice|active-passive alternation in English]]. The Noun Phrase after the verb in the active (1) is the subject in the passive (2). Data like (2) would be compatible with a passive rule stated in terms of linear order (move the 1st NP after the verb) or syntactic structure (move the highest NP after the verb). The data in (3-5) illustrate that the actual rule is formulated in terms of structure. If it were stated in terms of linear order, then (4) would be ungrammatical and (5) would be grammatical. But the opposite is true. However, children may not be exposed to sentences like (3-5) as evidence in favor of the correct grammar. Thus, the fact that all adult speakers agree that (4) is grammatical and (5) is not suggests that the linear rule was never even considered and that children are predisposed to a structure based grammatical system.<ref name=\"Oh Jeffrey Boy\" />\n\n====Anaphoric \"one\"====\nThe English word \"one\" can refer back to a previously mentioned property in the discourse. For example in (1), \"one\" can mean \"ball\". \n# I like this ball and you like that one. \n# I like this red ball and you like that one. \nIn (2), one is interpreted as \"red ball.\" However, even if a speaker intends (2) in this way, it would be difficult to distinguish that interpretation from one in which \"one\" simply meant \"ball\". This is because when a speaker refers to a red ball, they are also referring to a ball since the set of red balls is a subset of balls in general. 18-month-olds, like adults, show that they believe 'one' refers to 'red ball' and not 'ball'.<ref name=\"Infants\">{{cite journal|last1=Lidz|first1=J.|last2=Freedman|first2=J.|last3=Waxman|first3=S.|date=October 2003|title=What infants know about syntax but couldn't have learned: experimental evidence for syntactic structure at 18 months|journal=Cognition|volume=89|pages=295\u2013303|number=3|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(03)00116-1}}</ref> The evidence available to children is systematically ambiguous between a grammar in which \"one\" refers back to Nouns and one in which \"one\" refers back to noun phrases. Despite this ambiguity, children learn the more narrow interpretation, suggesting that some property other than the input is responsible for their interpretations.\n\n====Island effects====\nIn Wh-questions, the Wh-word at the beginning of the sentence (the filler) is related to a position later in the sentence (the gap). This relation can hold over an unbounded distance, as in (1). However, there are restrictions on the gap positions that a filler can be related to. These restrictions are called [[Wh-movement#Extraction islands|syntactic islands]] (2). Because questions with islands are ungrammatical, they are not included in the speech that children hear\u2014but neither are grammatical Wh-questions that span multiple clauses. Because the speech children are exposed to is consistent with grammars which have island constraints and grammars which don't, something internal to the child must contribute this knowledge.\n#What did you claim that Jack bought _ ?\n#<nowiki>*What did you make the claim that Jack bought _ ? (Complex Noun Phrase Island)</nowiki>\n\n=== Phonology ===\n==== Learning stress systems ====\nBergelson & Idsardi (2009) presented adults with words drawn from an artificial language.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Bergelson E|author2=Idsardi WJ|date=2009|title=Structural biases in phonology: infant and adult evidence from artificial language learning.|url=http://174.143.211.73/~idsardi/papers/2009bucld.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd BUCLD|volume=33|pages=85\u201396}}</ref> The words contained 3 CV syllables. If the last vowel was long, then it bore [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. Otherwise, stress fell on the first syllable. This pattern is consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, a long vowel bears stress if it is the last segment in the word. This is a rule based on absolute finality. In the other grammar, a long vowel bears stress only if it is the last vowel in the word (i.e., even if it is not the last segment of the word). This is a rule based on relative finality. In natural languages stress rules make reference to relative finality but not to absolute finality. After being exposed to these words, participants were then tested to see whether they thought that a word with a long vowel in a closed syllable (CVVC) would bear stress. If it did, then that would be consistent with the relative-final grammar, but not with the absolute-final grammar. English-speaking adults (tested through computer software) were more likely to accept the words from the relative-final grammar than from the absolute-final grammar. Since the data they were exposed to was equally consistent with both grammars, and since neither rule is a rule of English, the source of this decision must have come from the participants, not from any aspect of their experience. In addition, eighth-month-old children (tested via the [[Statistical language acquisition#Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)|Headturn Preference Procedure]]) were found to have the same preference as adults. Given that this preference could not have come from their exposure to either the artificial language or to their native language, the researchers concluded that human language acquisition mechanisms are \"hardwired\" to lead infants towards certain generalizations, consistent with the argument for the poverty of the stimulus.\n\n==== English plural marker ====\n\nHalle (1978)<ref name=\"Halle\" /> argues that the morphophonological rule governing the [[English plurals|English plural]] produces forms that are consistent with two grammars. In one grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows one of the sounds [p, t, k, f, \u03b8]; otherwise it is pronounced as [z]. In the other grammar, the plural is pronounced as [s] if it follows a voiceless consonant. These rules are exactly equal in their coverage of English since the set of consonants that triggers the [s] pronunciation is identical in the two cases. However, Halle also observes that English speakers consistently pluralize the German name ''Bach'' (pronounced ''/bax/'') as ''/baxs/'', despite not having any experience with the ''/x/'' sound, which is nonexistent in English. Since there is \"no indication\" that speakers could have acquired this knowledge, Halle argues that the tendency to build rules in terms of natural classes comes from a factor internal to the child and not from their experience.<ref name=\"Halle\">{{Cite book|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262580434_sch_0009.pdf|title=From Memory to Speech and Back: Papers on Phonetics and Phonology|last=Halle|first=Morris|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=294\u2013303}}</ref>\n\n=== Semantics ===\n\n==== Word learning ====\n\nThe poverty of the stimulus also applies in the domain of word learning. When learning a new word, children are exposed to examples of the word's referent, but not to the full extent of the category. For example, in learning the word \"dog\", a child might see a German Shepherd, a Great Dane and a Poodle. How do they know to extend this category to include Dachshunds and Bulldogs? The situations in which the word is used cannot provide the relevant information. Thus, something internal to learners must shape the way that they generalize. This problem is closely related to [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s [[Indeterminacy of translation|gavagai]] problem.\n\n==== Attitude verbs ====\nIn other cases, words refer to aspects of the world that cannot be observed directly. For example [[Lila R. Gleitman|Lila Gleitman]] poses a POS argument with respect to verbs that label mental states. She observes that a learner cannot see inside another person's mind, and so an utterance of \"Kim thinks that it is raining\" is likely to occur in the same kinds of [[context (language use)|context]]s as \"Kim wonders if it is raining\" or even \"Kim wants it to rain\". If no aspect of the context can determine whether a mental state verb refers to thinkings, wanting or wonderings, then some aspect of children's minds must direct their attention to other cues. Thus, our ability to learn these word meanings must be shaped by factors internal to the child and not simply from the conditions of their use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gleitman|first=Lila R.|last2=Cassidy|first2=Kimberly|last3=Nappa|first3=Rebecca|last4=Papafragou|first4=Anna|last5=Trueswell|first5=John C.|date=2005-01-01|title=Hard Words|journal=Language Learning and Development|volume=1|issue=1|pages=23\u201364|doi=10.1207/s15473341lld0101_4|issn=1547-5441}}</ref>\n\n==Rejection by the scientific community==\nCritics demonstrated in the 1980s and 1990s that Chomsky's purported linguistic evidence for Poverty of the Stimulus had been false.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Pullum|first1=GK|last2=Scholz |first2=BC |date=2002|title=Empirical assessment of stimulus poverty arguments |url= http://www.ucd.ie/artspgs/research/pullum.pdf|journal=The Linguistic Review |volume=18|issue=1\u20142|pages= 9\u201450 |doi=10.1515/tlir.19.1-2.9|access-date=2020-02-28 }}</ref> Around the same time there was research in [[applied linguistics]] and [[neuroscience]] that rejected the idea of languages being innate and not learned.<ref name=Fernald_Marchman_2006>{{cite book |last1=Fernald |first1=Anne| last2=Marchman |first2=Virginia A. |editor-last= Traxler and Gernsbacher |title= Handbook of Psycholinguistics |publisher=Routledge |date=2006 |pages=1027\u20141071 |chapter= 27: Language learning in infancy |isbn= 9780080466415}}</ref> This led to the rejection of innatism by the mainstream child [[language acquisition]] community, with [[generative grammar]] being pushed into the margins.<ref name=DeBot_2015>{{cite book |last=de Bot |first=Kees |year=2015| title=A History of Applied Linguistics: From 1980 to the Present |publisher=Routledge |url= |pages= |isbn= 9781138820654 |access-date=}}</ref> According to some professionals, five decades of research were wasted between 1964 and 2014 due to Chomsky's influence;

The lead single from the album was, \"[[Love and Understanding]]\" and the follow-up singles were \"[[Save Up All Your Tears]]\", \"[[Love Hurts]]\", \"[[Could've Been You]]\" and \"[[When Lovers Become Strangers]]\". It peaked at number 48 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top 200]] albums chart with the sales of 19,000. In November 2011, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' stated that ''Love Hurts'' has sold 600,000 copies in the US.<ref name=\"ussales\">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/465290/ask-billboard-twice-is-nice-twice-for-adele?page=0%2C1 Ask Billboard: Twice Is Nice, Twice, for Adele]</ref>\n\n==Album information==\n''Love Hurts'' was released in 1991 and was the third and final studio album released by [[Cher]] for [[Geffen Records]]. The record featured production by [[Bob Rock]] and saw her continue to collaborate with [[John Kalodner]], [[Diane Warren]] and [[Desmond Child]]. The album was recorded in late 1990/early 1991, during the first year of Cher's relationship to [[Bon Jovi|Bon Jovi's]] guitarist [[Richie Sambora]]. She dedicated the album to him and \"every man that ever made me shed a tear\".\n\nThe album contained four covers: \"[[Save Up All Your Tears]]\" recorded in the late 1980s by [[Bonnie Tyler]] and [[Robin Beck]], the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] song \"[[A World Without Heroes]]\" recorded in 1981, \"Fires Of Eden\" recorded by [[Judy Collins]] in 1990, and \"[[Love Hurts]]\" a remake of the 1975 version which Cher had previously recorded for her album ''[[Stars (Cher album)|Stars]]''. This time the song was more [[pop/rock]] rather than a ballad. The original version was released by [[Everly Brothers]] in 1960; however, the most popular version of the song (and the only rendition of \"Love Hurts\" to become a hit single in the United States, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1976) was the one recorded by Scottish [[hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]. In addition, the European version of the album also contains the worldwide hit \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\" (originally recorded by Betty Everett <ref>w</ref> in 1963), which was released as a single in the United States in 1990 (prior to the release of the \"Love Hurts\" album to promote Cher's film ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', on whose soundtrack it first appeared.\n\nEarly releases of the album in the UK had the same cover as the American release, but later European releases had a different cover, showing Cher laying on a white background wearing a red wig. The European release also included the worldwide hit, \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\" which reached number one in over 10 countries. In the United States, \"The Shoop Shoop Song\" was available only through the original soundtrack, ''[[Mermaids (soundtrack)|Mermaids]]'' for the [[Mermaids (1990 film)|film of the same name]].\n\nWhile the album did extremely well in the UK, its singles were only minor hits. \"[[Love and Understanding]]\" was the only big hit in the charts, but the album also produced many fan-favourites including \"[[Could've Been You]]\" and big Cher favourites, \"Save Up All Your Tears\", \"[[Love Hurts]]\", and \"Fires of Eden\". Also \"Love Hurts and \"Could've Been You\" was released only in Europe, while \"[[When Lovers Become Strangers]]\" was released only in North America.\n\nThe [[David Cassidy]] co-written song, \"I'll Never Stop Loving You\", was released a year later on Cassidy's album, ''[[Didn't You Used to be? (album)|Didn't You Used to be?]]''. One year before, it was already recorded by [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and released on a Japanese special edition bonus CD for their album ''[[Brigade (album)|Brigade]]''.\n\n==Promotion==\n{{See also|Love Hurts Tour}}\nTo promote the album, Cher did several performances worldwide. In North America she promoted the album on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. She also made a special appearance on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program ''[[In Concert (TV series)|In Concert]]'' on June 21, 1991<ref>{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |title=Rock-concert show premiers on ABC |publisher=Star-Banner |date=1991-06-07 }}</ref> where she performed \"Love Hurts\", \"Love and Understanding\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\" and \"A World Without Heroes\". This particular performance was highly criticized because Cher lip-synced all songs from the album, veering from the ABC show's premise to showcase \"honest\" live rock.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Gundersen |first=Edna |title=Cher's lip-synced 'live' performance |publisher=USA Today |date=1991-06-25 }}</ref> Later, during an interview, Cher defended her lip-syncing <ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Jeannie |title=Lip-sync criticism sets Cher off |publisher=USA Today |date=1991-06-28 }}</ref> and ''In Concert'' offered her a chance to reappear (with her band plugged in and playing) later in 1991, but the performance never happened.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Michael |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316198,00.html |title=A Little Late-Night Music |publisher=Entertainment Weekly.com |date=1991-11-15 |accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>\n\nCher also promoted the album in some European countries. In the UK she performed \"Love and Understanding\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\" and \"Could've Been You\" on ''[[Top of The Pops]]'', on ''[[Wogan]]'' performed \"Love and Understanding\" and \"Save Up All Your Tears\", and on ''[[Michael Aspel#Aspel and Company|Aspel and Company]]'' performed \"Could've Been You\". Cher also performed \"Save Up All Your Tears\" in [[Australia]] during the ''[[Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch|Dame Edna Show]]'' and with Dame Edna performed \"[[I Got You Babe]]\".\n\nThe album received further promotion from her third headlining [[Love Hurts Tour]], which started on April 15, 1992, in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The tour was set to start on March 21, 1992, in [[Copenhagen]], but due to illness, the European concerts were rescheduled, except for the UK dates. \nLater dates on the North American leg of the tour were also rescheduled twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/28/arts/cher-postpones-opening.html |title=Cher Postpones Opening |publisher=The New York Times |date=1992-05-28|accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/30/arts/cher-postpones-shows.html |title=Cher Postpones Shows |publisher=The New York Times |date=1992-05-30 |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/09/arts/cher-s-shows-rescheduled.html |title=Cher's Shows Rescheduled |publisher=The New York Times |date=1992-06-09|accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> Cher performed \"Love and Understanding\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\", \"Love Hurts\" and \"Fires Of Eden\" on her tour.\n\n==Singles==\n\"[[Love and Understanding]]\" was released as the album's lead single on May 21, 1991.

On one hand, some critics proclaimed that \"Love Hurts\" was the most mature material Cher had tackled in years.

In November 2011, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' stated that ''Love Hurts'' has sold 600,000 copies in the US.<ref name=\"ussales\">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/465290/ask-billboard-twice-is-nice-twice-for-adele?page=0%2C1 Ask Billboard: Twice Is Nice, Twice, for Adele]</ref>\n\n==Album information==\n''Love Hurts'' was released in 1991 and was the third and final studio album released by [[Cher]] for [[Geffen Records]]. The record featured production by [[Bob Rock]] and saw her continue to collaborate with [[John Kalodner]], [[Diane Warren]] and [[Desmond Child]]. The album was recorded in late 1990/early 1991, during the first year of Cher's relationship to [[Bon Jovi|Bon Jovi's]] guitarist [[Richie Sambora]]. She dedicated the album to him and \"every man that ever made me shed a tear\".\n\nThe album contained four covers: \"[[Save Up All Your Tears]]\" recorded in the late 1980s by [[Bonnie Tyler]] and [[Robin Beck]], the [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] song \"[[A World Without Heroes]]\" recorded in 1981, \"Fires Of Eden\" recorded by [[Judy Collins]] in 1990, and \"[[Love Hurts]]\" a remake of the 1975 version which Cher had previously recorded for her album ''[[Stars (Cher album)|Stars]]''. This time the song was more [[pop/rock]] rather than a ballad. The original version was released by [[Everly Brothers]] in 1960; however, the most popular version of the song (and the only rendition of \"Love Hurts\" to become a hit single in the United States, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 1976) was the one recorded by Scottish [[hard rock]] band [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]]. In addition, the European version of the album also contains the worldwide hit \"[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]\" (originally recorded by Betty Everett <ref>w</ref> in 1963), which was released as a single in the United States in 1990 (prior to the release of the \"Love Hurts\" album to promote Cher's film ''[[Mermaids (1990 film)|Mermaids]]'', on whose soundtrack it first appeared.\n\nEarly releases of the album in the UK had the same cover as the American release, but later European releases had a different cover, showing Cher laying on a white background wearing a red wig. The European release also included the worldwide hit, \"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)\" which reached number one in over 10 countries. In the United States, \"The Shoop Shoop Song\" was available only through the original soundtrack, ''[[Mermaids (soundtrack)|Mermaids]]'' for the [[Mermaids (1990 film)|film of the same name]].\n\nWhile the album did extremely well in the UK, its singles were only minor hits. \"[[Love and Understanding]]\" was the only big hit in the charts, but the album also produced many fan-favourites including \"[[Could've Been You]]\" and big Cher favourites, \"Save Up All Your Tears\", \"[[Love Hurts]]\", and \"Fires of Eden\". Also \"Love Hurts and \"Could've Been You\" was released only in Europe, while \"[[When Lovers Become Strangers]]\" was released only in North America.\n\nThe [[David Cassidy]] co-written song, \"I'll Never Stop Loving You\", was released a year later on Cassidy's album, ''[[Didn't You Used to be? (album)|Didn't You Used to be?]]''. One year before, it was already recorded by [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and released on a Japanese special edition bonus CD for their album ''[[Brigade (album)|Brigade]]''.\n\n==Promotion==\n{{See also|Love Hurts Tour}}\nTo promote the album, Cher did several performances worldwide. In North America she promoted the album on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. She also made a special appearance on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] program ''[[In Concert (TV series)|In Concert]]'' on June 21, 1991<ref>{{cite news |last=Burlingame |first=Jon |title=Rock-concert show premiers on ABC |publisher=Star-Banner |date=1991-06-07 }}</ref> where she performed \"Love Hurts\", \"Love and Understanding\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\" and \"A World Without Heroes\". This particular performance was highly criticized because Cher lip-synced all songs from the album, veering from the ABC show's premise to showcase \"honest\" live rock.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Gundersen |first=Edna |title=Cher's lip-synced 'live' performance |publisher=USA Today |date=1991-06-25 }}</ref> Later, during an interview, Cher defended her lip-syncing <ref>{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Jeannie |title=Lip-sync criticism sets Cher off |publisher=USA Today |date=1991-06-28 }}</ref> and ''In Concert'' offered her a chance to reappear (with her band plugged in and playing) later in 1991, but the performance never happened.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web |last=Kaplan |first=Michael |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316198,00.html |title=A Little Late-Night Music |publisher=Entertainment Weekly.com |date=1991-11-15 |accessdate=2009-10-29}}</ref>\n\nCher also promoted the album in some European countries. In the UK she performed \"Love and Understanding\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\" and \"Could've Been You\" on ''[[Top of The Pops]]'', on ''[[Wogan]]'' performed \"Love and Understanding\" and \"Save Up All Your Tears\", and on ''[[Michael Aspel#Aspel and Company|Aspel and Company]]'' performed \"Could've Been You\". Cher also performed \"Save Up All Your Tears\" in [[Australia]] during the ''[[Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch|Dame Edna Show]]'' and with Dame Edna performed \"[[I Got You Babe]]\".\n\nThe album received further promotion from her third headlining [[Love Hurts Tour]], which started on April 15, 1992, in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The tour was set to start on March 21, 1992, in [[Copenhagen]], but due to illness, the European concerts were rescheduled, except for the UK dates. \nLater dates on the North American leg of the tour were also rescheduled twice.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/28/arts/cher-postpones-opening.html |title=Cher Postpones Opening |publisher=The New York Times |date=1992-05-28|accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/30/arts/cher-postpones-shows.html |title=Cher Postpones Shows |publisher=The New York Times |date=1992-05-30 |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/09/arts/cher-s-shows-rescheduled.html |title=Cher's Shows Rescheduled |publisher=The New York Times |date=1992-06-09|accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref> Cher performed \"Love and Understanding\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\", \"Love Hurts\" and \"Fires Of Eden\" on her tour.\n\n==Singles==\n\"[[Love and Understanding]]\" was released as the album's lead single on May 21, 1991.

On one hand, some critics proclaimed that \"Love Hurts\" was the most mature material Cher had tackled in years.

One critic went as far as to claim that \"''The only song worth listening to is A World Without Heroes, on an otherwise uninspired album''\".<ref name=JPC/>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nUnlike ''[[Heart of Stone (Cher album)|Heart of Stone]]'' and ''[[Cher (1987 album)|Cher]]'', Love Hurts received less attention in North America yet it was still certified Gold in the US and Platinum in Canada, for reaching the sales of 500,000 and 100,000 copies in those territories, respectively.\nIn European and [[Oceania]]n countries, as well as in Australia and New Zealand, the album was very successful, and peak at number one in four countries: Austria, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom.

It also gives its name to a short story collection. Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez considered it his best book, saying that he had to write ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' so that people would read ''No One Writes to the Colonel''.<ref>\"Yo creo que es mi mejor libro, sin lugar a dudas.

The colonel lives with his asthmatic wife in a small village under martial law.  The action opens with the colonel preparing to go to the funeral of a town musician whose death is notable because he was the first to die from natural causes in many years. The novel is set during the years of \"[[La Violencia]]\" in Colombia, when [[martial law]] and censorship prevail.\n\n[[Image:writes colonel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Recent US paperback edition cover.]]\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n\nUnlike many other Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez works, the novel mostly does not fall within the [[magic realism]] genre, as it includes only  one magical event.\n\nThe main characters of the novel are not named, adding to the feeling of insignificance of an individual living in Colombia. The colonel and his wife, who have lost their son to political repression, are struggling with poverty and financial instability. The corruption of the local and national officials is evident and this is a topic which Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez explores throughout the novel, by using references to censorship and the impact of government on society.  The colonel desperately tries to sell their inheritance from their only son who is now dead and eventually the only reminder of his existence is a rooster that the colonel trains to take part in a cockfight.\n\nIn his memoir ''Vivir para contarla'' (''[[Living to Tell the Tale]]'', 2002), Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez explained that the novel was inspired by his grandfather, who was also a colonel and who never received the pension he was promised.

The colonel lives with his asthmatic wife in a small village under martial law.  The action opens with the colonel preparing to go to the funeral of a town musician whose death is notable because he was the first to die from natural causes in many years. The novel is set during the years of \"[[La Violencia]]\" in Colombia, when [[martial law]] and censorship prevail.\n\n[[Image:writes colonel.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Recent US paperback edition cover.]]\n\n==Literary significance and criticism==\n\nUnlike many other Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez works, the novel mostly does not fall within the [[magic realism]] genre, as it includes only  one magical event.\n\nThe main characters of the novel are not named, adding to the feeling of insignificance of an individual living in Colombia. The colonel and his wife, who have lost their son to political repression, are struggling with poverty and financial instability. The corruption of the local and national officials is evident and this is a topic which Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez explores throughout the novel, by using references to censorship and the impact of government on society.  The colonel desperately tries to sell their inheritance from their only son who is now dead and eventually the only reminder of his existence is a rooster that the colonel trains to take part in a cockfight.\n\nIn his memoir ''Vivir para contarla'' (''[[Living to Tell the Tale]]'', 2002), Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez explained that the novel was inspired by his grandfather, who was also a colonel and who never received the pension he was promised.  However, there is also speculation that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez took inspiration from his experience of unemployment in 1956 after the newspaper he had been working for shut down. The daily lives he witnessed during this time are said to be one of his inspirations for this novel.\n\n==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==\nA [[No One Writes to the Colonel (film)|motion picture based on the novella]] was made in 1999. Directed by [[Arturo Ripstein]], it stars [[Fernando Luj\u00e1n]] as the colonel.\nA feature film based on the novella and titled ''Only Death Comes for Sure'' was released in 1993.

In 1918, Yaroslavl Demidov State University became a successor university to the '''Demidov Lyceum''', which was founded in 1803.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Higher School of Sciences===\n[[Pavel Grigoryevich Demidov]] established the Demidov Law School by private means in 1803. On June 18, 1803, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander the First]], signed an [[Edict]] to the Senate about opening a higher educational institution in Yaroslavl. At first Demidov has been in contact with the Imperial authorities regarding the foundation of a university in Yaroslavl, even going so far as to promise his own private funding to the new institution; however, when this did not materialise the Imperial government decreed that the school was, upon opening, to have the same status as a university but to carry the title 'higher school of sciences' and thus to be considered junior only to the universities in [[Moscow State University|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg]]. At first, the new institution enrolled only 11 students, but this situation quickly changed and soon the school was able to found a number of new faculties, including, amongst others, law, mathematics, chemistry, political economy and financial science . In 1819 modern French and German were also added to the syllabus.\n\n[[Image:Pavel Grigorievich Demidov.jpg|thumb|right|Pavel Grigorievich Demidov]]\nTwenty graduates from secondary schools could be educated at the school at the expense of its founder, and even these students had to be admitted from the nobility and other major estates of Yaroslavl Province. However, anyone who presented a certificate of general education or passed the school's entrance examination could be educated at their own expense. In the decrees of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], it was often emphasised that diplomas received from the School of Higher Sciences were equal to university degrees. In 1804, the first five students from the University of Moscow were sent to Yaroslavl to be educated. In 1805, a boarding school was opened so that scholars from other provinces could come to Yaroslavl and prepare themselves for the university's entrance exams, thus causing an exponential increase in the number of students.\n\nLater however, the school's fortunes waned and by the mid-19th century the institution seemed to be in decline. For example, the Minister of Public Education Dmitry Tolstoy, who visited Yaroslavl in 1866, found one professor, four acting professors, one lecturer and 39 students at the Lyceum, and thus in the same year the transformation project of the Lyceum with jurisprudence as its special subject was prepared on his initiative. This later gained assent from Alexander II.\n\n===Demidov Judicial Lyceum===\n[[Image:Demid.gif|thumb|left|The main building of the Demidov Judicial Lyceum. This building was eventually demolished in 1931.]]\nAfter its transformation into a Juridical [[Lyceum]] with higher educational, scientific and publishing status, Demidov's school in Yaroslavl enrolled over 900 students. The opening of the Demidov Juridical Lyceum took place on September 11, 1870, after around two years of preparation for the event. The judicial lyceum was from then on funded directly by the Imperial Russian Government, which mandated the institution of a four-year course which, upon successful completion, culminated in the student concerned being awarded the title 'candidate of judicial sciences'. Twenty scholarships which afforded government maintenance funds to their holders were also prepared and awarded each year.\n\nAfter the first students graduated, the judicial lyceum\u2019s interim statute was made permanent, with Alexander II finally approving the new Statute on January 6, 1875. After this the judicial lyceum became very popular and by the late 19th century had such a large number of students that in terms of ranking it was to be found second only to the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Even by 1903, only the [[University of Kiev]]'s faculty of law had successfully surpassed the student numbers of Yaroslavl's institution, so being ranked, along with Moscow and Petersburg's universities, above Demidov's school. In 1905 important changes were then also made to the organisation structure of the judicial lyceum, and resultantly, for the first time ever, the Lyceum\u2019s Council elected the school's director.\n\nThe possibility of transforming the Demidov judicial lyceum into a university began to be discussed in 1906. This initiative came from the Lyceum\u2019s Council and was supported by the larger community of Yaroslavl, the town's authorities and the Ministry of Public Education. Yaroslavl also found support in neighbouring provinces who promised their own material assistance so that a university could be founded close-by and so aid the economic and education development of their own territories. The Yaroslavl town council then states that it was prepared to make a gift of 16 hectares of land and a lump-sum grant of 1 million roubles to go towards the establishment of the university. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Russian Provisional Government at last approved the project of transforming the Lyceum into a university, however the revolutionary events that transpired later in that same year prevented the implementation of these decisions.\n\n===University of 1918===\n[[Image:Gymnasium of P. Antipova.jpg|right|thumb|Girls' school of Praskovya Antipova. The building which first housed the Yaroslavl State University.]]\nOn August 7, 1918, [[Vladimir Lenin]] signed a [[decree]] to change the Demidov Juridical Lyceum into a University. The university had 29 departments, including [[Agronomy|Agronomic]], [[pedagogy|Pedagogical]], [[Medical school|Medical]] and [[Law school|Law]] [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], and an evening school. In 1924, after the death of Vladimir Lenin, the university was closed.\n\nIn accordance with the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of January 21, 1919, signed by Lenin, the Demidov Judicial Lyceum was transformed into Yaroslavl State University. In 1922 its organisation included the Yaroslavl Institute of Education which existed to train teachers, and the Yaroslavl branch of the Moscow Archaeological Institute, which prepared the critics, historians and archaeologists. The university then also had faculties for the social sciences, medicine, agronomy, teaching, and technical education. The university's rectors, during its existence, were Valerian Nikolaevich Shiryaev (1918\u20131922) and Vasily Potemkin (1922\u20131924).\n\nIn 1924, the State University of Yaroslavl was closed due to reorganisation of the new-born USSR's education system, all of which was caused by financial difficulties in the country. The institution's Faculty of Education once again became an independent institution, and for over ten years remained the only institute of higher education in the province - Yaroslavl State Pedagogical Institute. The main building of the Lyceum was set alight and burned on the night of 7 July 1918 (lasting until the next day) during the Yaroslavl Uprising and was finally demolished in 1929 . In 1931, the Demidov pillar was also dismantled.\n\n===Re-establishment===\nOn September 1, 1970, the university was reopened and enrolled 300 students. Since then the university has gone from strength to strength and is now often considered to be one of Russia's premier universities.

In 1918, Yaroslavl Demidov State University became a successor university to the '''Demidov Lyceum''', which was founded in 1803.\n\n==History==\n\n===The Higher School of Sciences===\n[[Pavel Grigoryevich Demidov]] established the Demidov Law School by private means in 1803. On June 18, 1803, [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander the First]], signed an [[Edict]] to the Senate about opening a higher educational institution in Yaroslavl. At first Demidov has been in contact with the Imperial authorities regarding the foundation of a university in Yaroslavl, even going so far as to promise his own private funding to the new institution; however, when this did not materialise the Imperial government decreed that the school was, upon opening, to have the same status as a university but to carry the title 'higher school of sciences' and thus to be considered junior only to the universities in [[Moscow State University|Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg State University|Saint Petersburg]]. At first, the new institution enrolled only 11 students, but this situation quickly changed and soon the school was able to found a number of new faculties, including, amongst others, law, mathematics, chemistry, political economy and financial science . In 1819 modern French and German were also added to the syllabus.\n\n[[Image:Pavel Grigorievich Demidov.jpg|thumb|right|Pavel Grigorievich Demidov]]\nTwenty graduates from secondary schools could be educated at the school at the expense of its founder, and even these students had to be admitted from the nobility and other major estates of Yaroslavl Province. However, anyone who presented a certificate of general education or passed the school's entrance examination could be educated at their own expense. In the decrees of [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], it was often emphasised that diplomas received from the School of Higher Sciences were equal to university degrees. In 1804, the first five students from the University of Moscow were sent to Yaroslavl to be educated. In 1805, a boarding school was opened so that scholars from other provinces could come to Yaroslavl and prepare themselves for the university's entrance exams, thus causing an exponential increase in the number of students.\n\nLater however, the school's fortunes waned and by the mid-19th century the institution seemed to be in decline. For example, the Minister of Public Education Dmitry Tolstoy, who visited Yaroslavl in 1866, found one professor, four acting professors, one lecturer and 39 students at the Lyceum, and thus in the same year the transformation project of the Lyceum with jurisprudence as its special subject was prepared on his initiative. This later gained assent from Alexander II.\n\n===Demidov Judicial Lyceum===\n[[Image:Demid.gif|thumb|left|The main building of the Demidov Judicial Lyceum. This building was eventually demolished in 1931.]]\nAfter its transformation into a Juridical [[Lyceum]] with higher educational, scientific and publishing status, Demidov's school in Yaroslavl enrolled over 900 students. The opening of the Demidov Juridical Lyceum took place on September 11, 1870, after around two years of preparation for the event. The judicial lyceum was from then on funded directly by the Imperial Russian Government, which mandated the institution of a four-year course which, upon successful completion, culminated in the student concerned being awarded the title 'candidate of judicial sciences'. Twenty scholarships which afforded government maintenance funds to their holders were also prepared and awarded each year.\n\nAfter the first students graduated, the judicial lyceum\u2019s interim statute was made permanent, with Alexander II finally approving the new Statute on January 6, 1875. After this the judicial lyceum became very popular and by the late 19th century had such a large number of students that in terms of ranking it was to be found second only to the universities of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Even by 1903, only the [[University of Kiev]]'s faculty of law had successfully surpassed the student numbers of Yaroslavl's institution, so being ranked, along with Moscow and Petersburg's universities, above Demidov's school. In 1905 important changes were then also made to the organisation structure of the judicial lyceum, and resultantly, for the first time ever, the Lyceum\u2019s Council elected the school's director.\n\nThe possibility of transforming the Demidov judicial lyceum into a university began to be discussed in 1906. This initiative came from the Lyceum\u2019s Council and was supported by the larger community of Yaroslavl, the town's authorities and the Ministry of Public Education. Yaroslavl also found support in neighbouring provinces who promised their own material assistance so that a university could be founded close-by and so aid the economic and education development of their own territories. The Yaroslavl town council then states that it was prepared to make a gift of 16 hectares of land and a lump-sum grant of 1 million roubles to go towards the establishment of the university. After the February Revolution of 1917, the Russian Provisional Government at last approved the project of transforming the Lyceum into a university, however the revolutionary events that transpired later in that same year prevented the implementation of these decisions.\n\n===University of 1918===\n[[Image:Gymnasium of P. Antipova.jpg|right|thumb|Girls' school of Praskovya Antipova. The building which first housed the Yaroslavl State University.]]\nOn August 7, 1918, [[Vladimir Lenin]] signed a [[decree]] to change the Demidov Juridical Lyceum into a University. The university had 29 departments, including [[Agronomy|Agronomic]], [[pedagogy|Pedagogical]], [[Medical school|Medical]] and [[Law school|Law]] [[Faculty (division)|faculties]], and an evening school. In 1924, after the death of Vladimir Lenin, the university was closed.\n\nIn accordance with the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of January 21, 1919, signed by Lenin, the Demidov Judicial Lyceum was transformed into Yaroslavl State University. In 1922 its organisation included the Yaroslavl Institute of Education which existed to train teachers, and the Yaroslavl branch of the Moscow Archaeological Institute, which prepared the critics, historians and archaeologists. The university then also had faculties for the social sciences, medicine, agronomy, teaching, and technical education. The university's rectors, during its existence, were Valerian Nikolaevich Shiryaev (1918\u20131922) and Vasily Potemkin (1922\u20131924).\n\nIn 1924, the State University of Yaroslavl was closed due to reorganisation of the new-born USSR's education system, all of which was caused by financial difficulties in the country. The institution's Faculty of Education once again became an independent institution, and for over ten years remained the only institute of higher education in the province - Yaroslavl State Pedagogical Institute. The main building of the Lyceum was set alight and burned on the night of 7 July 1918 (lasting until the next day) during the Yaroslavl Uprising and was finally demolished in 1929 . In 1931, the Demidov pillar was also dismantled.\n\n===Re-establishment===\nOn September 1, 1970, the university was reopened and enrolled 300 students. Since then the university has gone from strength to strength and is now often considered to be one of Russia's premier universities. In the 1990s and 2000s, the university underwent an extensive program of development and has been constantly expanding the number of subject areas it operates in, thus allowing for overall expansion of its academic activities and student population. Every year a number of students from renowned Western universities including, amongst others, the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University College London]], attend Russian language courses at the university. The university also takes place in a number of exchange programs with universities and other higher educational institutions from around the world.\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Faculties===\nYaroslavl Demidov State University has ten faculties.\n\n{| width=\"90%\"\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" width=\"33%\"|\n*[[Biology]] and [[Ecology]]\n*[[Computer science]]\n*[[History]]\n|  valign=\"top\" width=\"33%\"|\n*[[Mathematics]]\n*[[Social studies|Socio-Political Sciences]]\n*[[Psychology]]\n|  valign=\"top\" width=\"33%\"|\n*[[Physics]]\n*[[Economics]]\n*[[Law]]\n|}\n\n*The Center of [[Russian Language]] and Russia Area Studies\n\n===Departments===\n\nYaroslavl Demidov State University has four departments.\n\n*International Relations Office\n*Department of foreign languages\n*Centre of New Information Technologies\n*Internet Centre\n \u2022\" Hostel\"\n\n==Campus==\n{| align=\"center\" class=\"standard\"\n|+\n! |Building \u2116\n! |Address\n! |Department/Faculty\n! |Coordinates\n! |Photograph\n|-----\n| I\n| 14 Sovetskaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 14)\n| Administration and rector's office, Faculty of Physics\n| {{coord|57|37|58|N|39|53|14|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 1 corpus.JPG|150px]]\n|-----\n| II\n| 8/10 Kirova Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u041a\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0434. 8/10)\n| Faculty of Physics, Applications office\n| {{coord|57|37|35|N|39|53|23|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 2 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| III\n| 10 Sovetskaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 10)\n| Faculty of History, Faculty of Social and Political Sciences\n| {{coord|57|37|52|N|39|53|25|E}}\n\n Hostel no 5\n street, Gagarina 16\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 3 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| IV\n| 9 Proezd Matrosova<br>(\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0434. 9)\n| Faculty of Psychology, Faculty of Biology and Ecology\n| {{coord|57|34|27|N|39|51|26|E}}\n| \n|-----\n| V\n| 17d Prospekt Oktyabrya<br>(\u043f\u0440-\u043a\u0442 \u041e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f, \u0434. 17\u0434)\n| Faculty of Physics, laboratories \n| {{coord|57|37|58.5|N|39|52|37|E}}\n|-----\n| VI\n| 3 Komsomolskaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 3)\n| Faculty of Economics\n| {{coord|57|37|30.7|N|39|53|4|E}}\n| [[File:\u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044c, \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f,3.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| VII\n| 144 Soyuznaya Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f, \u0434. 144)\n| Faculty of Mathematics, Faculty of Computer Science\n| {{coord|57|37|18|N|39|55|33|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslval-University-001.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| VIII\n| 36a Sobinova Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0434. 36\u0430)\n| Faculty of Law\n| {{coord|57|37|34.9|N|39|52|51.5|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 8 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|-----\n| IX\n| 14b Slepneva Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u0421\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430, 14\u0431)\n| University college\n|\n|\n|-----\n| X\n| 1 Polushkina Rosha Street<br>(\u0443\u043b. \u041f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u0449\u0430, \u0434. 1)\n| library, sports centre\n| {{coord|57|38|43.5|N|39|52|37|E}}\n| [[File:Yaroslavl State University, 10 corpus.jpg|150px]]\n|+\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Education in Russia]]\n*[[List of universities in Russia]]\n\n==References==\n*[[George Vernadsky]].

The university was established in 1918 by professors evacuated from the [[University of Tartu]] in Estonia. The university has 18 faculties and an enrollment of 22,000 students from Russia, Europe, Africa, [[Americas|the Americas]] and Asia. Besides, the university has 6 research institutes and 16 research laboratories administered by the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. The university is composed of 10 buildings and 7 resident halls situated throughout the city. For over 90 years the University has trained more than 100,000 professionals. Among university graduates there are Nobel laureates, State Prize winners of the USSR and Russia, academicians, ministers, representatives of science and culture. University graduates are working in more than 90 countries worldwide.\n\n==History==\nIn 1802 following a decree of Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] the [[University of Tartu]] in Estonia was re-established. As a result of the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I]] in March 1918, Russian students and professors had to leave the Estonian territory for their own safety. It was decided that a new university would be established in [[European Russia|central Russia]]. In July and September 1918 from Dorpat (now [[Tartu]]),  39 professors, 45 lecturers, 43 staff and about 800 students arrived in Voronezh. The first rector of the university was Basil E. Regel.\n\nOn 12 November 1918 four faculties started working, namely the faculty of Medicine, the faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the faculty of History and Philology and the Law faculty. In the beginning of 1919, the University had an enrollment of 10,000 students. Anyone could study there, only 4 years later in 1923 that entrance exams were introduced. In 1920, after the Treaty of Tartu, the properties of the University of Tartu (libraries, archives, manuals, documents and other objects) were returned to Estonia. However, most of the teachers who have left due to the onset of the army of Imperial Germany and the occupation of Estonia, did not return to Estonia.\n\nIn the early 1920s,  Voronezh Institute of Education was added to the university, which marked the beginning of pedagogical faculties, departments that prepares teachers of mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural science, Russian language and literature, social and economic disciplines for schools. In 1930, the Medical Faculty was transformed into an [[Voronezh State Medical Academy|independent institute]]. During [[World War II]] the university was relocated in [[Yelabuga]] in the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] for a period of two years from 1941 to 1943.\n\n==Faculties==\n*Applied Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics\n*Mathematics\n*Computer Sciences\n*Physics\n*Chemistry\n*Pharmaceutics\n*Biology and soil sciences\n*Economics\n*Geography, Geoecology & Tourism\n*Geology\n*History\n*Institute of International Education\n*International Relations\n*Journalism\n*Law\n*Philology\n*Philosophy and Psychology\n*Romance and Germanic Philology\n*Military education\n\n==Buildings and infrastructures==\n\nVoronezh State University has 10 academic buildings and 7 residence halls located primarily in the city centre. The university also administers [[Galichya Gora]], a nature reserve open to staff and students for research and study.

The university was established in 1918 by professors evacuated from the [[University of Tartu]] in Estonia. The university has 18 faculties and an enrollment of 22,000 students from Russia, Europe, Africa, [[Americas|the Americas]] and Asia. Besides, the university has 6 research institutes and 16 research laboratories administered by the [[Russian Academy of Science]]. The university is composed of 10 buildings and 7 resident halls situated throughout the city. For over 90 years the University has trained more than 100,000 professionals. Among university graduates there are Nobel laureates, State Prize winners of the USSR and Russia, academicians, ministers, representatives of science and culture. University graduates are working in more than 90 countries worldwide.\n\n==History==\nIn 1802 following a decree of Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] the [[University of Tartu]] in Estonia was re-established. As a result of the [[German occupation of Estonia during World War I]] in March 1918, Russian students and professors had to leave the Estonian territory for their own safety. It was decided that a new university would be established in [[European Russia|central Russia]]. In July and September 1918 from Dorpat (now [[Tartu]]),  39 professors, 45 lecturers, 43 staff and about 800 students arrived in Voronezh. The first rector of the university was Basil E. Regel.\n\nOn 12 November 1918 four faculties started working, namely the faculty of Medicine, the faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the faculty of History and Philology and the Law faculty. In the beginning of 1919, the University had an enrollment of 10,000 students. Anyone could study there, only 4 years later in 1923 that entrance exams were introduced. In 1920, after the Treaty of Tartu, the properties of the University of Tartu (libraries, archives, manuals, documents and other objects) were returned to Estonia. However, most of the teachers who have left due to the onset of the army of Imperial Germany and the occupation of Estonia, did not return to Estonia.\n\nIn the early 1920s,  Voronezh Institute of Education was added to the university, which marked the beginning of pedagogical faculties, departments that prepares teachers of mathematics, physics, chemistry, natural science, Russian language and literature, social and economic disciplines for schools. In 1930, the Medical Faculty was transformed into an [[Voronezh State Medical Academy|independent institute]]. During [[World War II]] the university was relocated in [[Yelabuga]] in the [[Republic of Tatarstan]] for a period of two years from 1941 to 1943.\n\n==Faculties==\n*Applied Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics\n*Mathematics\n*Computer Sciences\n*Physics\n*Chemistry\n*Pharmaceutics\n*Biology and soil sciences\n*Economics\n*Geography, Geoecology & Tourism\n*Geology\n*History\n*Institute of International Education\n*International Relations\n*Journalism\n*Law\n*Philology\n*Philosophy and Psychology\n*Romance and Germanic Philology\n*Military education\n\n==Buildings and infrastructures==\n\nVoronezh State University has 10 academic buildings and 7 residence halls located primarily in the city centre. The university also administers [[Galichya Gora]], a nature reserve open to staff and students for research and study. Galichya Gora is the only university-affiliated nature reserve in Europe.\n\n==Fundamental research==\n=== research centres ===\n\n*Wave Processes in Inhomogeneous and Non-Linear Media ( Director: Prof. Aleksandr S.
