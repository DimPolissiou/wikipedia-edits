It was released on June 4, 2002, by [[Arista Records]]. For a year after signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, where she recorded her earlier materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team [[The Matrix (record production team)|The Matrix]], who understood her vision for the album.\n\nThe album was credited as the biggest pop debut of 2002, and was certified seven-times Platinum in the United States. It was released to generally positive reviews, although Lavigne's songwriting received some criticism. It also did extremely well in Canada, receiving a [[Canadian Recording Industry Association#Album certifications|diamond certification]] from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]], as well as reaching multi-platinum in many countries around the world, including the UK in which she became the youngest female solo artist to have a number-one album in the region.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, ''Let Go'' had sold over 16 million copies worldwide,<ref name=\"dailyrecord\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/avril-lavigne-madonna-is-my-idol-1091758|title=Avril Lavigne: Madonna is my idol |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|author=Rick Fulton|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> becoming Lavigne's highest-selling album to date.{{r|twn}} According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the album was the 21st best-selling album of the decade.{{r|billboarddecadeend}} A ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers poll named ''Let Go'' the fourth best album of the 2000s.{{r|fourthbestrolling}} The album is considered as one of the albums that changed the [[pop punk]] music scene, because it helped to bring pop punk music into the mainstream, contributing to the rise of female fronted pop punk bands and female-driven punk-influenced pop music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aux.tv/2016/12/cancon-poppunk/|title=6 Canadian albums that changed pop punk forever|date=5 December 2016|accessdate=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215023911/http://www.aux.tv/2016/12/cancon-poppunk/|archive-date=15 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 18 March 2013, ''Let Go'' was re-released as a [[Double album|double disc-set]] paired with her second studio album, ''[[Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)|Under My Skin]]'', which is released under [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-go-under-my-skin-mw0002491013/releases|title=Let Go/Under My Skin|work=AllMusic}}</ref> The album was further promoted by the [[List of Avril Lavigne tours#Try to Shut Me Up Tour|Try To Shut Me Up Tour]] between December 2002 and June 2003.\n\n==Background==\nLavigne relocated to Los Angeles, where she collaborated with songwriter and producer [[Clif Magness]], who gave her ample creative control in the writing process. Lavigne and Magness wrote \"[[Losing Grip]]\" and \"Unwanted\", songs that she deemed reflective of her vision for the entire album.{{r|EliscuSmells}} However, Arista was not thrilled with the heavy-guitar laden songs that Lavigne was writing, prompting the label to look for other producers to match their demands.{{r|JacksonVocals}}\n\nNow two years since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the attention of the three-piece production team [[The Matrix (record production team)|The Matrix]]. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: \"Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?\"{{r|BuskinMatrix}}  According to member [[Lauren Christy]], they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained \"a [[Faith Hill]] kind of vibe\". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude.{{r|BuskinMatrix}} After talking to Lavigne for an hour, \"we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go\".{{r|BuskinMatrix}} The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was those kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with [[punk rock]] inclinations.{{r|WillmanAnti}} Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band [[System of a Down]]. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" and another song called \"Falling Down\" (Falling Down appears on the ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'' Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.{{r|BuskinMatrix}}\n\nWhen Josh Sarubin, the A&R executive who signed Lavigne to the imprint, heard the song, he knew it was right for her. Lavigne presented the song to Reid, who agreed the musical direction Lavigne and The Matrix were taking, and set \"Complicated\" as the album's [[lead single]].{{r|BuskinMatrix}} Reid sent Lavigne back to The Matrix to work with them, initially for a month.{{r|WillmanAnti|JacksonVocals}} Arista gave the team ''[[wikt:carte blanche|carte blanche]]'' to write and produce 10 songs, which took them two months.{{r|BuskinMatrix}} The album was originally entitled ''Anything But Ordinary'', after the track of the same name that The Matrix produced, but Lavigne asked Reid for the album to be called ''Let Go'' instead,{{r|EliscuSmells}} which is the title of an unreleased demo featured on Lavigne's 2001 ''[[B-Sides (Avril Lavigne album)|B-Sides]]''.\n\nCritics described ''Let Go'' as an [[alternative rock]]<ref name=kilroy-records>{{cite web|url=http://www.kilroy-records.be/details/110758.html |title=Lavigne, Avril - Let Go|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144303/http://www.kilroy-records.be/details/110758.html|publisher=Kilroy Records |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> album with a [[post-grunge]]-oriented sound.<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.boston-theater.com/theaters/xfinity-center/backstreet-boys-avril-lavigne.php|title=Backstreet Boys & Avril Lavigne|publisher=Boston Theater|quote= Let Go was the alt. rock, grungy soundtrack...}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://news.modernrock.com/1466 |title=Avril Lavigne: Simple Truths of A 'Complicated' Girl|publisher=Modern Rock|date=12 June 2002|author=Werde, Bill|via=washingtonpost.com |accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200203/http://news.modernrock.com/1466 |archivedate=10 September 2014 |df=dmy-all|quote=Some of the songs are hard, with grungy metal undertones}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Liss |first1=Sarah |title=Avril Lavigne,  New and Notable Releases |url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/avril-lavigne-2002-06-20/ |newspaper=Now Toronto |date=20 June 2002 |quote=...a proclivity for punk and big, slightly grungy guitars.}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Considine |first1=J.D. |title=Avril and the selling of punk lite |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/avril-and-the-selling-of-punk-lite/article4142979/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=28 December 2002 |quote=Sure, the guitars are loud and a bit grungy}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Alexovich |first1=Ariel |title=The Buddy System |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2009-09-08-0909080037-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=8 September 2009 |quote=Lavigne's grungy angst rock}}\n*{{cite web |title=Album Review: Avril Lavigne\u2019s self-titled album combines old and new |url=http://gcmag.org/album-review-avril-lavignes-self-titled-album-combines-old-and-new/ |publisher=Grand Central Magazine |date=18 November 2013 |quote=Her music was grungy and real}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Maitri |first1=Dyota |title=Avril Lavigne Returns to Jakarta for Another Concert |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/features/avril-lavigne-returns-to-jakarta-for-another-concert/ |newspaper=Jakarta Globe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311061947/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/features/avril-lavigne-returns-to-jakarta-for-another-concert/ |archivedate=11 March 2014 |date=11 March 2014 |quote=Her grungy sound...}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and recording==\nWith The Matrix, Lavigne recorded tracks in Decoy Studios, situated in a Los Angeles suburb known as Valley Village.{{r|JacksonVocals}} She also worked with producer-songwriter [[Curt Frasca]] and [[Peter Zizzo]], whose Manhattan studio Lavigne was checked in prior to securing a record deal with Arista, and where Lavigne also recorded some of the tracks.{{r|PakDeal|WillmanAnti}} The Matrix member Scott Spock was their principal [[audio engineering|engineer]] for the project, while [[Tom Lord-Alge]] was assigned to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] the tracks.{{r|JacksonVocals}} Lavigne recorded complete takes \"against the largely finished [[instrumental]] tracks\". Spocks revealed Lavigne normally recorded each song in five or six takes, \"and probably 90 percent of what was finally used came from the first or second takes\". The Matrix also contributed backing vocals.{{r|JacksonVocals}}\n\nIntroduced as a singer-songwriter, Lavigne's involvement produced significant issues. Lavigne has implied that she is the primary author of the album. In an article published in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Lavigne stated that while working with The Matrix, one member would be in the recording studio while they were writing, but did not write the guitar parts, lyrics, or the [[melody]]. According to Lavigne, she and Christy wrote all the lyrics together. Graham would come up with some guitar parts, \"and I'd be like, 'Yeah, I like that,' or 'No, I don't like that.' None of those songs aren't from me.\"{{r|EliscuSmells}}\n\nThe Matrix, who produced six songs for Lavigne, five of which appear in the album,{{r|JacksonVocals}} had another explanation of how the collaboration went. According to them, they wrote much of the portions in the three singles: \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\", \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\", and \"[[I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)|I'm with You]]\", which were conceived using a guitar and piano. Christy said, \"Avril would come in and sing a few melodies, change a word here or there.\"{{r|EliscuSmells}} Reid complemented the issue over the credits: \"If I'm looking for a single for an artist, I don't care who writes it. Avril had the freedom to do as she really pleased, and the songs show her point of view. ... Avril has always been confident about her ideas.\"{{r|EliscuSmells}}\n\nAlthough she needed pop songs \"to break\" into the industry, Lavigne felt \"Complicated\" does not reflect her and her songwriting skills. Nonetheless, she was grateful for the song as it successfully launched her career. She favors more \"[[Losing Grip]]\", because \"it means so much more when it comes straight from the artist\".{{r|EliscuSmells}}\n\n==Release and promotion==\n[[File:AvrilShow.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Lavigne in concert for the album's promotion]]\nThe album was released on 4 June 2002, in Canada and the United States. Later, on 22 July, ''Let Go'' hit record stores worldwide, and on 26 August in some parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. A [[DataPlay]] version of the album was released in September 2002. Arista had established a deal with DataPlay earlier in 2002, and included ''Let Go'' alongside albums by rock singer [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] and singer [[Whitney Houston]] in the release.{{r|DataPlay}}<ref>{{cite web |author=Techmoan |title=DataPlay: The futuristic optical disc format that time forgot |url=https://youtube.com/uEISYaWgCRg?t=821 |website=Youtube |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Lavigne was targeted to the teen audience, a marketing strategy credited with the successful launch of her career;{{r|EliscuSmells|WillmanBoy}} Lavigne performed on a host of radio-sponsored multi-artist holiday shows throughout the United States,{{r|headlining}} a marketing strategy that induced higher sales of the album during the season. She embarked on her first headlining tour, [[List of Avril Lavigne tours#Try to Shut Me Up Tour|Try To Shut Me Up Tour]], which took place on 23 January 2003, and ended on 4 June 2003. Lavigne toured with her band\u2014drummer Matthew Brann, bassist Mark Spicoluk, and guitarists Jesse Colburn and [[Evan Taubenfeld]]\u2014which she had grouped after signing the deal.{{r|PakDeal}} In the tour, she included all songs off ''Let Go'', [[B-Sides (Avril Lavigne album)|B-sides]], and [[cover (music)|cover versions]] of \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]] and \"[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]\" by [[Green Day]].{{r|covers}}\n\nLavigne filmed her performance in [[Buffalo, New York]], on 18 May 2003, the final date of her five-week headlining North American tour. The tour DVD ''[[My World (video)|My World]]'' was released on 4 November 2003, on joint venture by Arista Records and [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. The DVD features the concert, a behind-the-scenes featurette, five music videos and a six-song bonus audio CD that includes an unreleased track \"Why\".{{r|myworld}}\n\n===Singles===\n\"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" was released by Arista as the album's [[lead single]], which was seen as an across-all-age-groups introduction to Lavigne.{{r|WillmanAnti}} Thought to produce wide cross-[[demography|demographic]] appeal, however, the music video for the single features Lavigne and her band wreaking havoc in a mall, \"the sort of imagery that might have grown-ups thinking 'Clean that mess up!' more than clamoring for the record\".{{r|WillmanBoy}} The song topped the charts in several countries and was nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].\n\nThe second single, \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\", was aimed at pop punk-oriented kids.{{r|WillmanAnti}} The release of \"Sk8er Boi\" created disagreement among many [[radio programming]] directors. However, their impressions were diverted as listeners helped change their minds; early rotation of the single proved successful, showing it was as popular with post-collegiate listeners as with teens. The song reached number one on US mainstream radio.{{r|WillmanBoy}}\n\n\"[[I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)|I'm with You]]\" was released in late November 2002, close to Christmas holidays to remind parents about the album to, if not to buy it themselves, to purchase it for any children in their family.{{r|WillmanAnti|WillmanBoy}} The song became another success for Lavigne reaching number four in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, number one on mainstream radio and the top 10 in the UK and Canada. It was not officially released in Australia but received radio and television airplay. To date, ''Let Go'' is Lavigne's only album to produce multiple top-ten singles in the US. The song was also nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]] the same categories as \"Complicated\". The release arrangement of the album's singles, with \"I'm with You\" being served as the third, was regarded as \"controversial\", given that \"I'm with You\" was \"thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album\", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first.{{r|WillmanBoy}} According to Reid, \"Some people just really didn't get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it's so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers.\"{{r|WillmanBoy}}\n\n\"[[Losing Grip]]\" was released as the fourth single from the album, \"to act as a bridge into her next album\", which Lavigne stated would be \"harder-rocking\" than her debut.{{r|WillmanBoy}} In 2004, it was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]].<ref name=\"radioblog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2011/01/15/top-avril-lavigne-songs/|title=Top 10 Avril Lavigne Songs|last=Cheung|first=Nadine|work=[[AOL Radio]]|accessdate=15 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolradioblog.com%2F2011%2F01%2F15%2Ftop-avril-lavigne-songs%2F&date=2011-01-15|archivedate=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, it was the least successful single on the album.\n\nOther songs were released as regional radio-only singles. \"Things I'll Never Say\" was released as a radio-only single in Italy.\n\n===Promotional singles===\n\"Mobile\" was released in Australia and New Zealand as a promotional single. It was later used in 2003's ''[[The Medallion]]'', the 2004 film ''[[Wimbledon (film)|Wimbledon]]'', and a brief appearance in the film ''[[Just Married]]''. In 2011, a music video for the song leaked onto the Internet made from official footage that was never finished.\n\n\"Unwanted\" was released as a promotional single in the United Kingdom. The song \"Tomorrow\" was played in one episode of the second season of the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', while the song \"Anything But Ordinary\" was played in the third episode of the first season of the television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews |state=plain\n| MC = 68/100\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}{{r|allmusicreview}}\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}{{r|blenderreview}}\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3Score = B\u2212{{r|entertainmentreview}}\n| rev4 = ''[[Melodic (magazine)|Melodic]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}{{r|melodicreview}}\n| rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5Score = 6.6/10{{r|pitchforkreview}}\n| rev6 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{r|metaLetGo}}\n| rev7 = [[Robert Christgau]]\n|rev7Score = {{Rating-Christgau|cut}}{{r|RobertChristgauReview}}\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{r|rollingstonereview}}\n| rev9 = ''[[Slant Magazine]]''\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}{{r|slantreview}}\n| rev10 = ''[[Stylus Magazine]]''\n|rev10Score = B{{r|stylusreview}}\n}}\n''Let Go'' received mostly positive responses from critics, earning a metascore of 68 over 100 on [[Metacritic]], which is based on the collated reviews from 9 publications.{{r|metaLetGo}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's music critic Pat Blashill wrote that the album \"comes fully loaded with another dozen infectious hymns of ''[[Total Request Live|Total Request]]'' angst\". Blashill complimented Lavigne on having a \"great voice\", adding she crafted the album with \"a qualified staff of hitmakers\".{{r|rollingstonereview}}  Christina Saraceno of [[AllMusic]] noted that Lavigne \"handles a variety of styles deftly\", while also complimenting her as \"a capable songwriter with vocal chops\". Nonetheless, Saraceno opined that \"at her age, one imagines, she is still finding her feet, borrowing from the music she's grown up listening to\".{{r|allmusicreview}} John Perry of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine summarized ''Let Go'' into an \"outstanding guitar-pop debut\".{{r|blenderreview}} A review in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine praised Lavigne for displaying \"a musical guile way beyond her years\".{{r|metaLetGo}} Kaj Roth of ''[[Melodic]]'' felt that Lavigne \"sings lovely and some of the songs goes in the [[Alanis Morissette]] {{sic}} vein.\"{{r|melodicreview}} For [[Jon Caramanica]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine (who gave the album a B\u2212), \"Lavigne's monochromatic debut set of unimaginative guitar rock is saved only by the earnestness of her songs.\"{{r|entertainmentreview}}\n\nSome reviewers had similar sentiments toward the quality of the lyrics to some songs in the album. Saraceno said that Lavigne \"still has some growing up to do lyrically\", asserting \"Sk8er Boi\" shows her \"lyrical shortcomings\" and calling the phrasing in \"Too Much to Ask\" \"awkward and sometimes silly\".{{r|allmusicreview}} Perry noted the lyrics to \"Sk8er Boi\" as \"endearingly naive\".{{r|blenderreview}}\n\n===Accolades===\nThe album earned Lavigne numerous awards from organizations around the world. The success of the album's commercial performance led Lavigne to be named Best New Artist at the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]]{{r|2002vma}} as well as winning a [[World Music Award]] for Best-Selling Canadian Singer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} She won three awards\u2014Favorite Female Artist, Favorite Breakthrough Artist, and the Style Award\u2014the most of any performer at the 2003 MTV Asia Awards.{{r|AsiaAwards}} She received five nominations for the album at the [[45th Grammy Awards|2003 Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]].

Weekly]]'' magazine as one of the biggest pop debut albums of 2002.{{r|WillmanBoy}} The album debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 8 on the strength of 62,000 unit sales and later peaked at number 2. Its high debut was fueled by the success of \"Complicated\", which was in [[heavy rotation]] on MTV.{{r|heavyrotation}} Increasing weekly sales allowed the album to stay inside the chart's top 10 for 37 weeks.{{r|top10}} The album sold at least 100,000 copies every week straight until late 2002, easily accumulating over two million unit sales.{{r|WillmanAnti}} In a December 2002 report by ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine, it was stated that the album had sold 3.9 million copies, becoming the third top-selling album of 2002 in the United States.{{r|whiteamerica}} Year-end figures released by Nielsen SoundScan revealed that ''Let Go'' had sold over 4.1 million copies in the United States, accumulated in 30 weeks of the album's release.{{r|30weeks|8mile}} ''Let Go'' was certified [[double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].{{r|doubleplat}} This earned ''Let Go'' the distinction of being the highest-shipped debut of 2002 and best-selling album by a female artist.{{r|highestdebut}} On 30 April 2003, the RIAA certified the album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units.{{r|RIAA}} It remains Lavigne's best-selling album to date, with 6.9 million copies sold in the United States and over 16 million worldwide {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.{{r|US sales}}\n\nChartwise, the album reached higher peak positions notably during and after the holidays. Following her show-opening performance at the 2002 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], ''Let Go'' continued to be one of the holiday's top sellers with sales that week of 272,000.{{r|holidaysales}} It reached its highest sales week on the issue dated 4 January 2003 with 363,000 copies sold. Although it had peaked at number two in September 2002, ''Let Go'' rose from 3 to 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 on the issue dated 1 February 2003.{{r|number2}} The increase of sales was the offshoot to Lavigne's appearance on 11 January in ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as the show's musical guest. There were accusations of lip-synching but in an interview at the time she tells she has never lip-sung or ever plans to. During this time also, Lavigne received much media coverage due to her nominations at the 2003 Grammy Awards and for embarking on her first North American tour.{{r|coverage}} In the United Kingdom, the album took longer to reach the summit of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. In its 18th week of release, reached on the chart year 2003, the album hit number one, rising to the top spot over the holiday. The album's international sales upsurge was attributed to the continuing success of \"Sk8er Boi\".{{r|AvrilSkates}} ''Let Go'' is the 12th best-selling album of 2003 in the United Kingdom.{{r|BestSelling}} The album has been certified six-times platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].<ref name=\"BPI\"/>\n\n''Let Go'' was also selling well in Canada, surpassing sales of over one million unit sales in less than a year. The [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] certified the album [[Music recording sales certification|diamond]] in May 2003.<ref name=\"CRIA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cria.ca/gold/0503_g.php

It was released on June 4, 2002, by [[Arista Records]]. For a year after signing a record deal with Arista, Lavigne struggled due to conflicts in musical direction. She relocated to Los Angeles, where she recorded her earlier materials for the album; the kind of sound to which the label was not amenable. She was paired to the production team [[The Matrix (record production team)|The Matrix]], who understood her vision for the album.\n\nThe album was credited as the biggest pop debut of 2002, and was certified seven-times Platinum in the United States. It was released to generally positive reviews, although Lavigne's songwriting received some criticism. It also did extremely well in Canada, receiving a [[Canadian Recording Industry Association#Album certifications|diamond certification]] from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]], as well as reaching multi-platinum in many countries around the world, including the UK in which she became the youngest female solo artist to have a number-one album in the region.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, ''Let Go'' had sold over 16 million copies worldwide,<ref name=\"dailyrecord\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/avril-lavigne-madonna-is-my-idol-1091758|title=Avril Lavigne: Madonna is my idol |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|author=Rick Fulton|date=January 10, 2011|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> becoming Lavigne's highest-selling album to date.{{r|twn}} According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the album was the 21st best-selling album of the decade.{{r|billboarddecadeend}} A ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers poll named ''Let Go'' the fourth best album of the 2000s.{{r|fourthbestrolling}} The album is considered as one of the albums that changed the [[pop punk]] music scene, because it helped to bring pop punk music into the mainstream, contributing to the rise of female fronted pop punk bands and female-driven punk-influenced pop music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aux.tv/2016/12/cancon-poppunk/|title=6 Canadian albums that changed pop punk forever|date=5 December 2016|accessdate=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215023911/http://www.aux.tv/2016/12/cancon-poppunk/|archive-date=15 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 18 March 2013, ''Let Go'' was re-released as a [[Double album|double disc-set]] paired with her second studio album, ''[[Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)|Under My Skin]]'', which is released under [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/let-go-under-my-skin-mw0002491013/releases|title=Let Go/Under My Skin|work=AllMusic}}</ref> The album was further promoted by the [[List of Avril Lavigne tours#Try to Shut Me Up Tour|Try To Shut Me Up Tour]] between December 2002 and June 2003.\n\n==Background==\nLavigne relocated to Los Angeles, where she collaborated with songwriter and producer [[Clif Magness]], who gave her ample creative control in the writing process. Lavigne and Magness wrote \"[[Losing Grip]]\" and \"Unwanted\", songs that she deemed reflective of her vision for the entire album.{{r|EliscuSmells}} However, Arista was not thrilled with the heavy-guitar laden songs that Lavigne was writing, prompting the label to look for other producers to match their demands.{{r|JacksonVocals}}\n\nNow two years since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the attention of the three-piece production team [[The Matrix (record production team)|The Matrix]]. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: \"Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?\"{{r|BuskinMatrix}}  According to member [[Lauren Christy]], they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained \"a [[Faith Hill]] kind of vibe\". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude.{{r|BuskinMatrix}} After talking to Lavigne for an hour, \"we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go\".{{r|BuskinMatrix}} The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was those kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with [[punk rock]] inclinations.{{r|WillmanAnti}} Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band [[System of a Down]]. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" and another song called \"Falling Down\" (Falling Down appears on the ''[[Sweet Home Alabama (film)|Sweet Home Alabama]]'' Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.{{r|BuskinMatrix}}\n\nWhen Josh Sarubin, the A&R executive who signed Lavigne to the imprint, heard the song, he knew it was right for her. Lavigne presented the song to Reid, who agreed the musical direction Lavigne and The Matrix were taking, and set \"Complicated\" as the album's [[lead single]].{{r|BuskinMatrix}} Reid sent Lavigne back to The Matrix to work with them, initially for a month.{{r|WillmanAnti|JacksonVocals}} Arista gave the team ''[[wikt:carte blanche|carte blanche]]'' to write and produce 10 songs, which took them two months.{{r|BuskinMatrix}} The album was originally entitled ''Anything But Ordinary'', after the track of the same name that The Matrix produced, but Lavigne asked Reid for the album to be called ''Let Go'' instead,{{r|EliscuSmells}} which is the title of an unreleased demo featured on Lavigne's 2001 ''[[B-Sides (Avril Lavigne album)|B-Sides]]''.\n\nCritics described ''Let Go'' as an [[alternative rock]]<ref name=kilroy-records>{{cite web|url=http://www.kilroy-records.be/details/110758.html |title=Lavigne, Avril - Let Go|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144303/http://www.kilroy-records.be/details/110758.html|publisher=Kilroy Records |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> album with a [[post-grunge]]-oriented sound.<ref>\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.boston-theater.com/theaters/xfinity-center/backstreet-boys-avril-lavigne.php|title=Backstreet Boys & Avril Lavigne|publisher=Boston Theater|quote= Let Go was the alt. rock, grungy soundtrack...}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://news.modernrock.com/1466 |title=Avril Lavigne: Simple Truths of A 'Complicated' Girl|publisher=Modern Rock|date=12 June 2002|author=Werde, Bill|via=washingtonpost.com |accessdate=10 September 2014|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200203/http://news.modernrock.com/1466 |archivedate=10 September 2014 |df=dmy-all|quote=Some of the songs are hard, with grungy metal undertones}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Liss |first1=Sarah |title=Avril Lavigne,  New and Notable Releases |url=https://nowtoronto.com/music/album-reviews/avril-lavigne-2002-06-20/ |newspaper=Now Toronto |date=20 June 2002 |quote=...a proclivity for punk and big, slightly grungy guitars.}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Considine |first1=J.D. |title=Avril and the selling of punk lite |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/avril-and-the-selling-of-punk-lite/article4142979/ |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=28 December 2002 |quote=Sure, the guitars are loud and a bit grungy}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Alexovich |first1=Ariel |title=The Buddy System |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2009-09-08-0909080037-story.html |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=8 September 2009 |quote=Lavigne's grungy angst rock}}\n*{{cite web |title=Album Review: Avril Lavigne\u2019s self-titled album combines old and new |url=http://gcmag.org/album-review-avril-lavignes-self-titled-album-combines-old-and-new/ |publisher=Grand Central Magazine |date=18 November 2013 |quote=Her music was grungy and real}}\n*{{cite news |last1=Maitri |first1=Dyota |title=Avril Lavigne Returns to Jakarta for Another Concert |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/features/avril-lavigne-returns-to-jakarta-for-another-concert/ |newspaper=Jakarta Globe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311061947/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/features/avril-lavigne-returns-to-jakarta-for-another-concert/ |archivedate=11 March 2014 |date=11 March 2014 |quote=Her grungy sound...}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and recording==\nWith The Matrix, Lavigne recorded tracks in Decoy Studios, situated in a Los Angeles suburb known as Valley Village.{{r|JacksonVocals}} She also worked with producer-songwriter [[Curt Frasca]] and [[Peter Zizzo]], whose Manhattan studio Lavigne was checked in prior to securing a record deal with Arista, and where Lavigne also recorded some of the tracks.{{r|PakDeal|WillmanAnti}} The Matrix member Scott Spock was their principal [[audio engineering|engineer]] for the project, while [[Tom Lord-Alge]] was assigned to [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] the tracks.{{r|JacksonVocals}} Lavigne recorded complete takes \"against the largely finished [[instrumental]] tracks\". Spocks revealed Lavigne normally recorded each song in five or six takes, \"and probably 90 percent of what was finally used came from the first or second takes\". The Matrix also contributed backing vocals.{{r|JacksonVocals}}\n\nIntroduced as a singer-songwriter, Lavigne's involvement produced significant issues. Lavigne has implied that she is the primary author of the album. In an article published in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, Lavigne stated that while working with The Matrix, one member would be in the recording studio while they were writing, but did not write the guitar parts, lyrics, or the [[melody]]. According to Lavigne, she and Christy wrote all the lyrics together. Graham would come up with some guitar parts, \"and I'd be like, 'Yeah, I like that,' or 'No, I don't like that.' None of those songs aren't from me.\"{{r|EliscuSmells}}\n\nThe Matrix, who produced six songs for Lavigne, five of which appear in the album,{{r|JacksonVocals}} had another explanation of how the collaboration went. According to them, they wrote much of the portions in the three singles: \"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\", \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\", and \"[[I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)|I'm with You]]\", which were conceived using a guitar and piano. Christy said, \"Avril would come in and sing a few melodies, change a word here or there.\"{{r|EliscuSmells}} Reid complemented the issue over the credits: \"If I'm looking for a single for an artist, I don't care who writes it. Avril had the freedom to do as she really pleased, and the songs show her point of view. ... Avril has always been confident about her ideas.\"{{r|EliscuSmells}}\n\nAlthough she needed pop songs \"to break\" into the industry, Lavigne felt \"Complicated\" does not reflect her and her songwriting skills. Nonetheless, she was grateful for the song as it successfully launched her career. She favors more \"[[Losing Grip]]\", because \"it means so much more when it comes straight from the artist\".{{r|EliscuSmells}}\n\n==Release and promotion==\n[[File:AvrilShow.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Lavigne in concert for the album's promotion]]\nThe album was released on 4 June 2002, in Canada and the United States. Later, on 22 July, ''Let Go'' hit record stores worldwide, and on 26 August in some parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom and Ireland. A [[DataPlay]] version of the album was released in September 2002. Arista had established a deal with DataPlay earlier in 2002, and included ''Let Go'' alongside albums by rock singer [[Carlos Santana|Santana]] and singer [[Whitney Houston]] in the release.{{r|DataPlay}}<ref>{{cite web |first1=Techmoan |title=DataPlay: The futuristic optical disc format that time forgot |url=https://youtube.com/uEISYaWgCRg?t=821 |website=Youtube |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Lavigne was targeted to the teen audience, a marketing strategy credited with the successful launch of her career;{{r|EliscuSmells|WillmanBoy}} Lavigne performed on a host of radio-sponsored multi-artist holiday shows throughout the United States,{{r|headlining}} a marketing strategy that induced higher sales of the album during the season. She embarked on her first headlining tour, [[List of Avril Lavigne tours#Try to Shut Me Up Tour|Try To Shut Me Up Tour]], which took place on 23 January 2003, and ended on 4 June 2003. Lavigne toured with her band\u2014drummer Matthew Brann, bassist Mark Spicoluk, and guitarists Jesse Colburn and [[Evan Taubenfeld]]\u2014which she had grouped after signing the deal.{{r|PakDeal}} In the tour, she included all songs off ''Let Go'', [[B-Sides (Avril Lavigne album)|B-sides]], and [[cover (music)|cover versions]] of \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]\" by [[Bob Dylan]] and \"[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]\" by [[Green Day]].{{r|covers}}\n\nLavigne filmed her performance in [[Buffalo, New York]], on 18 May 2003, the final date of her five-week headlining North American tour. The tour DVD ''[[My World (video)|My World]]'' was released on 4 November 2003, on joint venture by Arista Records and [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]. The DVD features the concert, a behind-the-scenes featurette, five music videos and a six-song bonus audio CD that includes an unreleased track \"Why\".{{r|myworld}}\n\n===Singles===\n\"[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]\" was released by Arista as the album's [[lead single]], which was seen as an across-all-age-groups introduction to Lavigne.{{r|WillmanAnti}} Thought to produce wide cross-[[demography|demographic]] appeal, however, the music video for the single features Lavigne and her band wreaking havoc in a mall, \"the sort of imagery that might have grown-ups thinking 'Clean that mess up!' more than clamoring for the record\".{{r|WillmanBoy}} The song topped the charts in several countries and was nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] and [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].\n\nThe second single, \"[[Sk8er Boi]]\", was aimed at pop punk-oriented kids.{{r|WillmanAnti}} The release of \"Sk8er Boi\" created disagreement among many [[radio programming]] directors. However, their impressions were diverted as listeners helped change their minds; early rotation of the single proved successful, showing it was as popular with post-collegiate listeners as with teens. The song reached number one on US mainstream radio.{{r|WillmanBoy}}\n\n\"[[I'm with You (Avril Lavigne song)|I'm with You]]\" was released in late November 2002, close to Christmas holidays to remind parents about the album to, if not to buy it themselves, to purchase it for any children in their family.{{r|WillmanAnti|WillmanBoy}} The song became another success for Lavigne reaching number four in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, number one on mainstream radio and the top 10 in the UK and Canada. It was not officially released in Australia but received radio and television airplay. To date, ''Let Go'' is Lavigne's only album to produce multiple top-ten singles in the US. The song was also nominated for two [[Grammy Awards]] the same categories as \"Complicated\". The release arrangement of the album's singles, with \"I'm with You\" being served as the third, was regarded as \"controversial\", given that \"I'm with You\" was \"thought by some to be the biggest potential smash on the album\", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first.{{r|WillmanBoy}} According to Reid, \"Some people just really didn't get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it's so young and so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers.\"{{r|WillmanBoy}}\n\n\"[[Losing Grip]]\" was released as the fourth single from the album, \"to act as a bridge into her next album\", which Lavigne stated would be \"harder-rocking\" than her debut.{{r|WillmanBoy}} In 2004, it was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]].<ref name=\"radioblog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2011/01/15/top-avril-lavigne-songs/|title=Top 10 Avril Lavigne Songs|last=Cheung|first=Nadine|work=[[AOL Radio]]|accessdate=15 January 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aolradioblog.com%2F2011%2F01%2F15%2Ftop-avril-lavigne-songs%2F&date=2011-01-15|archivedate=15 January 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, it was the least successful single on the album.\n\nOther songs were released as regional radio-only singles. \"Things I'll Never Say\" was released as a radio-only single in Italy.\n\n===Promotional singles===\n\"Mobile\" was released in Australia and New Zealand as a promotional single. It was later used in 2003's ''[[The Medallion]]'', the 2004 film ''[[Wimbledon (film)|Wimbledon]]'', and a brief appearance in the film ''[[Just Married]]''. In 2011, a music video for the song leaked onto the Internet made from official footage that was never finished.\n\n\"Unwanted\" was released as a promotional single in the United Kingdom. The song \"Tomorrow\" was played in one episode of the second season of the television series ''[[Smallville]]'', while the song \"Anything But Ordinary\" was played in the third episode of the first season of the television series ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album reviews |state=plain\n| MC = 68/100\n| rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1Score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}{{r|allmusicreview}}\n| rev2 = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n|rev2Score = {{Rating|4|5}}{{r|blenderreview}}\n| rev3 = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n|rev3Score = B\u2212{{r|entertainmentreview}}\n| rev4 = ''[[Melodic (magazine)|Melodic]]''\n|rev4Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}{{r|melodicreview}}\n| rev5 = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n|rev5Score = 6.6/10{{r|pitchforkreview}}\n| rev6 = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n|rev6Score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{r|metaLetGo}}\n| rev7 = [[Robert Christgau]]\n|rev7Score = {{Rating-Christgau|cut}}{{r|RobertChristgauReview}}\n| rev8 = ''[[Rolling Stone]]''\n|rev8Score = {{Rating|3|5}}{{r|rollingstonereview}}\n| rev9 = ''[[Slant Magazine]]''\n|rev9Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}}{{r|slantreview}}\n| rev10 = ''[[Stylus Magazine]]''\n|rev10Score = B{{r|stylusreview}}\n}}\n''Let Go'' received mostly positive responses from critics, earning a metascore of 68 over 100 on [[Metacritic]], which is based on the collated reviews from 9 publications.{{r|metaLetGo}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's music critic Pat Blashill wrote that the album \"comes fully loaded with another dozen infectious hymns of ''[[Total Request Live|Total Request]]'' angst\". Blashill complimented Lavigne on having a \"great voice\", adding she crafted the album with \"a qualified staff of hitmakers\".{{r|rollingstonereview}}  Christina Saraceno of [[AllMusic]] noted that Lavigne \"handles a variety of styles deftly\", while also complimenting her as \"a capable songwriter with vocal chops\". Nonetheless, Saraceno opined that \"at her age, one imagines, she is still finding her feet, borrowing from the music she's grown up listening to\".{{r|allmusicreview}} John Perry of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine summarized ''Let Go'' into an \"outstanding guitar-pop debut\".{{r|blenderreview}} A review in ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine praised Lavigne for displaying \"a musical guile way beyond her years\".{{r|metaLetGo}} Kaj Roth of ''[[Melodic]]'' felt that Lavigne \"sings lovely and some of the songs goes in the [[Alanis Morissette]] {{sic}} vein.\"{{r|melodicreview}} For [[Jon Caramanica]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine (who gave the album a B\u2212), \"Lavigne's monochromatic debut set of unimaginative guitar rock is saved only by the earnestness of her songs.\"{{r|entertainmentreview}}\n\nSome reviewers had similar sentiments toward the quality of the lyrics to some songs in the album. Saraceno said that Lavigne \"still has some growing up to do lyrically\", asserting \"Sk8er Boi\" shows her \"lyrical shortcomings\" and calling the phrasing in \"Too Much to Ask\" \"awkward and sometimes silly\".{{r|allmusicreview}} Perry noted the lyrics to \"Sk8er Boi\" as \"endearingly naive\".{{r|blenderreview}}\n\n===Accolades===\nThe album earned Lavigne numerous awards from organizations around the world. The success of the album's commercial performance led Lavigne to be named Best New Artist at the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]]{{r|2002vma}} as well as winning a [[World Music Award]] for Best-Selling Canadian Singer.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} She won three awards\u2014Favorite Female Artist, Favorite Breakthrough Artist, and the Style Award\u2014the most of any performer at the 2003 MTV Asia Awards.{{r|AsiaAwards}} She received five nominations for the album at the [[45th Grammy Awards|2003 Grammy Awards]], including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]].

Weekly]]'' magazine as one of the biggest pop debut albums of 2002.{{r|WillmanBoy}} The album debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 8 on the strength of 62,000 unit sales and later peaked at number 2. Its high debut was fueled by the success of \"Complicated\", which was in [[heavy rotation]] on MTV.{{r|heavyrotation}} Increasing weekly sales allowed the album to stay inside the chart's top 10 for 37 weeks.{{r|top10}} The album sold at least 100,000 copies every week straight until late 2002, easily accumulating over two million unit sales.{{r|WillmanAnti}} In a December 2002 report by ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine, it was stated that the album had sold 3.9 million copies, becoming the third top-selling album of 2002 in the United States.{{r|whiteamerica}} Year-end figures released by Nielsen SoundScan revealed that ''Let Go'' had sold over 4.1 million copies in the United States, accumulated in 30 weeks of the album's release.{{r|30weeks|8mile}} ''Let Go'' was certified [[double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].{{r|doubleplat}} This earned ''Let Go'' the distinction of being the highest-shipped debut of 2002 and best-selling album by a female artist.{{r|highestdebut}} On 30 April 2003, the RIAA certified the album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units.{{r|RIAA}} It remains Lavigne's best-selling album to date, with 6.9 million copies sold in the United States and over 16 million worldwide {{as of|2013|lc=y}}.{{r|US sales}}\n\nChartwise, the album reached higher peak positions notably during and after the holidays. Following her show-opening performance at the 2002 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], ''Let Go'' continued to be one of the holiday's top sellers with sales that week of 272,000.{{r|holidaysales}} It reached its highest sales week on the issue dated 4 January 2003 with 363,000 copies sold. Although it had peaked at number two in September 2002, ''Let Go'' rose from 3 to 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 on the issue dated 1 February 2003.{{r|number2}} The increase of sales was the offshoot to Lavigne's appearance on 11 January in ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as the show's musical guest. There were accusations of lip-synching but in an interview at the time she tells she has never lip-sung or ever plans to. During this time also, Lavigne received much media coverage due to her nominations at the 2003 Grammy Awards and for embarking on her first North American tour.{{r|coverage}} In the United Kingdom, the album took longer to reach the summit of the [[UK Albums Chart]]. In its 18th week of release, reached on the chart year 2003, the album hit number one, rising to the top spot over the holiday. The album's international sales upsurge was attributed to the continuing success of \"Sk8er Boi\".{{r|AvrilSkates}} ''Let Go'' is the 12th best-selling album of 2003 in the United Kingdom.{{r|BestSelling}} The album has been certified six-times platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].<ref name=\"BPI\"/>\n\n''Let Go'' was also selling well in Canada, surpassing sales of over one million unit sales in less than a year.

Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k\u031f, \u014b\u031f]}} with no alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}</ref>\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/a\u0272/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}. This results in a three-way contrast between the rimes ''\u0103n'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0308n]}} vs. ''anh'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0308\u0272]}} vs. ''\u0103ng'' {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0308\u014b]}}.

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''n\u1eb7ng'' and ''ng\u00e3''/''h\u1ecfi'' tones.\nThe ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone are pronounced as low rising tone (12) [\u02e9\u02e8] in fast speech or low falling-rising tone (212) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8] in more careful utterance. \nThe ''ng\u00e3'' and ''h\u1ecfi'' tone are merged into a mid falling-rising (214) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] which is somewhat similar ''h\u1ecfi'' tone of non-Hanoi Northern accent mentioned above.\n\n====North-central and Central varieties====\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]] pronounce every tone as a n\u1eb7ng tone.\n\n===Eight-tone analysis===\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=45}}</ref>  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:\n\n:(C<sub>1</sub>)(w)V(G|C<sub>2</sub>)+T\n\nwhere\n:{| cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* C<sub>1</sub> = initial consonant onset\n* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}\n* V = vowel nucleus\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})\n* C<sub>2</sub> = final consonant coda\n* T = tone.\n|}\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;\"\n!

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''\u01a1'' = {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, ''\u00e2'' = {{IPA|/\u025c/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}, ''\u0103'' = {{IPA|/\u0250/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/\u025c/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description. He says that his work is not a \"complete grammar\" but rather a \"descriptive introduction.\"  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Alves, Mark J. 2007. \"A Look At North-Central Vietnamese.\" In ''SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002'', edited by Ratree Wayland et al..

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

From {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}}]]\n\n'''Ngang tone:'''\n\n*The ''ngang'' tone is level at around the mid level (33) and is produced with [[modal voice]] [[phonation]] (i.e. with \"normal\" phonation). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"level\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) level\".\n\n'''Huy\u1ec1n tone:'''\n\n*The ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''n\u1eb7ng'' and ''ng\u00e3''/''h\u1ecfi'' tones.\nThe ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone are pronounced as low rising tone (12) [\u02e9\u02e8] in fast speech or low falling-rising tone (212) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8] in more careful utternce. \nThe ''ng\u00e3'' and ''h\u1ecfi'' tone are merged into a mid falling-rising (214) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] which is somewhat similar ''h\u1ecfi'' tone of non-Hanoi Northern accent mentioned above.\n\n====North-central and Central varieties====\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]] pronounce every tone as a n\u1eb7ng tone.\n\n===Eight-tone analysis===\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=45}}</ref>  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:\n\n:(C<sub>1</sub>)(w)V(G|C<sub>2</sub>)+T\n\nwhere\n:{| cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* C<sub>1</sub> = initial consonant onset\n* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}\n* V = vowel nucleus\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})\n* C<sub>2</sub> = final consonant coda\n* T = tone.\n|}\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;\"\n!

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''\u01a1'' = {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, ''\u00e2'' = {{IPA|/\u025c/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}, ''\u0103'' = {{IPA|/\u0250/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/\u025c/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description.

Suitability for certain applications, or technically a certain [[quality of service]], is often assumed. For instance, low [[round-trip delay time|round trip delay]] (or \"latency\" in milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable for [[Voice over IP]], [[online game|online gaming]], [[financial market|financial trading]] especially [[arbitrage]], [[virtual private network]]s and other latency-sensitive applications. This would rule out [[satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] as inherently high-latency. In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] network) or security (say [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-128]] as required for [[smart grid]] applications in the US) are often also assumed or defined as requirements. There is no single definition of '''broadband''' and official plans may refer to any or none of these criteria.\n\nBeyond broad latency and reliability expectations, term itself is technology neutral; broadband can be delivered by a range of technologies including [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], [[optical fiber cable|fiber optic cable]], [[power line communication|powerline networking]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], [[Ethernet]], [[Wi-Fi]] or [[next-generation access|next generation access]]. Several operators have started to combine two of these technologies to create [[Hybrid Access Networks]]. ''This article presents an overview of official government plans to promote broadband - based on official sources that may be biased due to their promotion of the government plan as effective and positive.''\n\nSuch plans are recommended by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and other development agencies. All [[G7]] countries except [[Canada]] have such a '''national broadband plan''' in place now.\n\n{| <!-- side-by-side -->\n|[[File:FixedBroadbandInternetPenetrationWorldMap.svg|thumb |none |350px |<center>'''[[List of countries by number of broadband Internet subscriptions|Fixed broadband Internet subscriptions in 2012]]<br/>as a percentage of a country's population'''</center>Source: [[International Telecommunication Union]].<ref name=\"FixedBroadbandITUDynamic2012\">[http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ICTEYE/Reporting/DynamicReportWizard.aspx \"Fixed (wired)-broadband subscriptions per 100 inhabitants 2012\"], Dynamic Report, ITU ITC EYE, [[International Telecommunication Union]].

The US plan has ambitious [[energy demand management]] goals (see [[National Broadband Plan (United States)]] for more details on these and their relationship to other US national goals) and its broadband plan is generally considered to be a pre-requisite to its communications-intensive energy strategy. This is also true to some degree of other countries' broadband plans.\n\n== Americas ==\n<!-- [[Broadband Internet access in the Americas]] redirects here -->\n\n=== Northern America ===\n\n==== Canada ====\n{{Main|Internet in Canada}}\n\nAs of early March 2009, colleagues in [[Industry Canada]] confirm that the current national broadband strategy is a short statement in the [[2009 Canadian federal budget|2009 budget]]:\n\n\"Canada was one of the first countries to implement a connectivity agenda geared toward facilitating [[Internet access]] to all of its citizens. To this day, Canada remains one of the most connected nations in the world, with the highest broadband connection rate among the G7 countries. However, gaps in access to broadband remain, particularly in rural and remote communities.\n\"The Government is committed to closing the broadband gap in Canada by encouraging the private development of rural broadband infrastructure. Budget 2009 provides $225 million over three years to Industry Canada to develop and implement a strategy on extending broadband coverage to all currently unserved communities beginning in 2009\u201310.\" The budget specifically includes:<ref>[http://www.budget.gc.ca/2009/plan/bpc3d-eng.asp] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228131136/http://www.budget.gc.ca/2009/plan/bpc3d-eng.asp |date=28 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\n\"Providing $225 million over three years to develop and implement a strategy on extending broadband coverage to unserved communities.\" On 6 March 2009, Mr. [[John Duncan (Canadian politician)|John Duncan]], [[Parliamentary Secretary]] to the Minister of [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs and Northern Development]] and [[Federal Interlocutor for M\u00e9tis and Non-Status Indians|Federal Interlocutor for M\u00e9tis and Non-status Indians]], announced that the Government of Canada will contribute $7.86 million to the First Nations [[Emergency service|Emergency Services]] Society (FNESS) and their partner, the First Nations Technology Council (FNTC) in [[British Columbia]], for the construction and provision of satellite broadband network capacity connecting 21 remote First Nations communities in British Columbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingcanada-chantierscanada.gc.ca/media/news-nouvelles/2009/20090306victoria-eng.html |title=Building Canada \u2013 Government of Canada to Provide Broadband for 21 B.C.

[[CANARIE]] remains Canada's only publicly funded backbone network. Several provinces, especially [[Nova Scotia]], have their own plans for [[broadband universal service]] ''see [[Broadband for Rural Nova Scotia initiative]]'' but these are generally last-mile services using [[fixed wireless]] technologies ([[Motorola Canopy]] in the case of Nova Scotia). No province is covered with public backhaul available to general public & business, though some provinces, regions and municipalities own some fibre.\n\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|National Broadband Plan (United States)}}\n\nIn the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] \u2013 popularly referred to as a post-recession stimulus package \u2013 Congress charged the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] with creating a national broadband plan. The Recovery Act required the plan to explore several key elements of broadband deployment and use, and the commission now seeks comment on these elements, including:\n\n* The most effective and efficient ways to ensure broadband access for all Americans\n* Strategies for achieving affordability and maximum utilization of broadband infrastructure and services\n* Evaluation of the status of broadband deployment, including the progress of related grant programs\n* How to use broadband to advance [[Welfare economics|consumer welfare]], civic participation, public safety and [[homeland security]], [[community development]], [[health care delivery]], [[North American energy independence|energy independence]] and efficiency, education, worker training, private sector investment, entrepreneurial activity, job creation, and economic growth, and other national purposes.\n\nThe plan was published in March 2010, on the same website used to gather public comment during its preparation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadband.gov/ |title=The National Broadband Plan: Connecting America |publisher=Broadband.gov |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe plan is integrated with the US [[smart grid]] policies.

Paulo reports. It is understood the new rules are designed to improve customer service with a specific focus on the delivery of stated broadband connection speeds; around 50% of users are currently thought to receive less than half the speed promised by their [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). New legislation could enter into force in 2010 requiring domestic broadband providers to comply with stricter standards on service quality. Anatel's move comes in the wake of an explosion in demand for broadband internet access which has seen user number swell to around 18 million, but also resulted in major disruptions to services \u2013 such as the recent high-profile outage of Telef\u00f3nica's Speedy service which left millions of customers offline.\n\n==== Chile ====\n{{Main|Internet in Chile}}\n\nIn October 2008, [[Chile]]'s president, [[Michelle Bachelet]], announced this week the countries' most ambitious telecoms subsidy plan ever, in terns of public investment and area of coverage. The project, which is aimed at boosting SMEs competitiveness in rural areas, will provide connectivity to more than three million people in 1,474 rural communities. The development is expected to cost US$100 million, 70% of which will be provided by the government through the Telecoms Development Fund.\n\n*Significance: At 30 March 2008, only 0.8% of the households in rural areas in Chile have internet access. Upon completion of the project, internet network coverage will reach from 71.6% of the population to 92.2%, according to the country's telecoms regulator.\n\nIn January 2008, Chile announced its 2007\u20132012 Strategy for Digital Development that will articulate the efforts of the public and private spheres as to new technologies during the next years. The project was prepared by the Committee of Ministers for Digital Development and seeks to provide further impulse to the ICTs in the Trans-Andean country.\n\nThe goals on which the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]] will place more emphasis are to double the broadband connections to reach 2 million by 2010, to increase SMEs competition, to advance on the digitalization of the public health system, and to implement new technologies in areas deemed key, such as the provisional reform and education.\n\nIn June 2009, Chile launched a new portal in which consumers may compare offers of all internet providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/viewNoticia.aspx?idArticulo=27853 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105039/http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/viewNoticia.aspx?idArticulo=27853 |archivedate=28 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Colombia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Colombia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nIn April 2009, Internet usage has grown to 40 percent of the Colombian population in the last ten years, with internet subscriptions rising at an annual rate of 75 percent. Over 73 percent of internet subscribers use broadband. Despite the growth, [[Colombia]]'s subscription penetration average remains sixth in Latin America, with a majority of internet subscriptions concentrated in Colombia's three largest cities. To promote [[Information technology|information technologies]] (IT) and telecommunications services in rural areas, Colombia's [[Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications]] developed a comprehensive ten-year National IT plan. A US$750 million public-private Communications Fund administers plan implementation, with 60 percent of funds targeted to the Compartel rural and community development program. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) also supports the development of telecommunications networks in rural areas, as well as provides technical assistance to GOC telecommunications authorities.\n\nThe percentage of internet users has grown from 1 to 40 percent of the population\u2014or approximately 17 million people\u2014within the last decade. Permanent internet subscribers have also grown at an annual rate of 75 percent in the last five years, although the actual number of subscriptions remains low at 2 million. Colombia's penetration average (the internet subscription to population ratio) is 4.3, ranking it sixth in Latin America behind Chile, [[Argentina]], Uruguay, [[Mexico]] and Brazil. Likewise, 55 percent of subscriptions remain concentrated in the cities of [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Medell\u00edn]] and [[Cali]].\n\nColombia has 1.45 million internet subscribers with broadband access\u2014approximately 73 percent of total subscriptions.<ref group=\"n\">Colombia's Telecommunications Regulations Commission (CRT) defines broadband as an internet service with a minimum download speed of 512 kbit/s, which is faster than the 128 kbit/s download speed defined as broadband by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).</ref> DSL (63 percent) and cable (32 percent) dominate the broadband market share, with Wimax (5 percent) a distant third. The main providers according to market share are: [[ETB S.A.|Empresa de Telefonos de Bogota]] (25 percent); [[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn|EPM Telecommunications]] (24 percent); [[Telecom Colombia|Colombia Telecommunications]] (20 percent); Telmex Hogar (19 percent); and independent providers (12 percent). These providers focus on triple-play packages combining internet, television and telephone services, which has contributed to the rapid expansion of internet usage. Carlos Forero, the vice-president of the CRT, said that broadband and associated value-added services are now seen as the market differentiator between telecommunications providers.\n\nLast year the Ministry of Communications (MOC) announced a National IT Plan, establishing three main goals to be achieved before 2019: 70 percent of Colombians with internet subscriptions, 100 percent of health and education establishments with internet access, and 100 percent of rural areas with internet access. The MOC plans to achieve these objectives through its flagship community and rural development program Compartel, which is funded by a US$750 million public-private National Communications Fund.<ref group=\"n\">All telecommunications providers are required to assist the Ministry of Communications in financing the Compartel program, with private sector contributions equaling 15 percent of Compartel's total budget in 2008.</ref> Compartel provides subsidies or investment incentives to establish internet networks and telephony services in Colombia's most rural and impoverished areas. Since 2008, the program has invested US$421 million in rural networks, benefiting 16,000 rural educational, health and government institutions.\n\nIn addition to Compartel, the GOC also supports additional programs in the educational, health, entrepreneurial, competitiveness, online-government and research sectors. Activities in 2008 included the distribution of refurbished computers to educational institutions (US$86 million), connectivity financing for small and medium enterprises ($15 million), conversion of all public institutions to online institutions ($70 million), and e-medicine ($5 million).\n\nUSAID also promotes telecommunications connectivity for underserved and rural populations, as well as education and content to support economic and social development, through its Last Mile Initiative. Major contributors to this public-private alliance are [[Avantel]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], Polyvision, regional and local governments, and the MOC. Through the program, USG-provided equipment and training will connect 50 municipalities in the [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] of [[Meta Department|Meta]], [[Huila Department|Huila]] and [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], including 21,000 small businesses and 325,000 institutions such as schools, hospitals, justice houses and local government offices. On the technical side, USAID assisted the MOC with the development of its National Plan and presently advises the CRT on \"unbundling the local loop\" to increase competition in broadband provision.\n\nColombia remains behind Latin American neighbors such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in most IT indicators, but since the GOC privatized its state-owned National Telecommunications Company in 2003, the IT sector has expanded rapidly. The sector contributed a record 3 percent of total GDP in 2008. Local experts agree that IT sector will continue to experience accelerated growth as Colombia's domestic security situation improves and the legal economy strengthens. However, they also emphasize that continued private investment is key to the GOC achieving its lofty goals by 2019.\n\n==== Dominican Republic ====\n{{Main|Internet in the Dominican Republic}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nIn October 2009, the [[Dominican Republic]]'s telecoms regulator, [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic|Instituto Dominicano de las Telecomunicaciones]] (INDOTEL), has said it has plans to roll out fixed line telecoms services to an additional 1,000 rural communities as part of an initiative aimed at providing broadband and home voice services to all towns with more than 300 inhabitants. According to TeleGeography's GlobalComms database, the announcement comes just over a year after fixed line incumbent [[Claro Codetel|CODETEL]] inked a deal with INDOTEL to undertake a rural connectivity project that will see investment of US$100 million.\n\nIn April 2009, this cable presents initial reporting on broadband deployment initiatives in the Dominican Republic (reftel). There is one ongoing government initiative to provide broadband access to 508 rural communities that is scheduled to finish by September. While future incentives are being considered by the regulatory agency, no others currently exist and broadband expansion is further hampered by 28 percent in taxes levied on all telecommunications sales. A Senate committee announced on 30 March it would review and update of the 1998 telecommunications law.\n\nThe Dominican Telecommunications Institute (INDOTEL), the GoDR [[regulatory agency]], launched a tender in 2007 for a Rural Broadband Connectivity Program. At that time, only 30 percent of the country's 383 municipalities had broadband capacity. The tender offered a subsidy of up to US$5 million. The winning bidder was Codetel (Mexican-owned), the largest company in the market, which offered to connect the 508 communities with no cash subsidy but rather in exchange for the rights to a WiMax frequency in the country. INDOTEL Executive Director Joelle Exarhakos told EconOff that the program has proceeded successfully and more than 100 rural communities have already been connected. She said Codetel would complete the broadband deployment plan by September 2009. By that time, every municipality in the country will have broadband access. Under the program, Codetel provides 256 kB/second or faster service to rural communities at prices that match the prices charged in urban centers where Codetel competes with other providers.\n\nExarhakos told EconOff that INDOTEL does not have current plans for a second stage for the rural connectivity program, noting that with the completion of this plan, every municipality in the country will have broadband access. She said that in many of these communities, local entrepreneurs have built connections to the networks servicing even smaller communities nearby. Nonetheless, INDOTEL does not foresee a second stage of the rural program to venture into even smaller villages. But Exarhakos told EconOff that she believes such incentives might not be necessary; part of the goal of the Rural Connectivity Program was to demonstrate rural residents' capacity to pay and it has. In [[Monte Plata]], a national provider, Dijitec, is developing infrastructure without any government incentive to compete with Codetel.\n\nIn many of these communities, INDOTEL has set up Informatics Training Centers (CCI), where schoolchildren and residents can access the Internet and learn how to use computers. These centers are among the 846 centers around the country that INDOTEL has established as part of an information technology promotion program. INDOTEL provides the hardware and software for the centers and community groups, schools, churches or town governments maintain and operate the facilities. EconOff visited one such site in October 2008 at a church in [[Saman\u00e1 (town)|Saman\u00e1]] which was inoperable because there were no funds to pay the electricity bill. Asked about these issues, Exarhakos candidly acknowledged that some of the committees have not succeeded in maintaining the facilities.<ref group=\"n\">Following the meeting with INDOTEL, EconOff learned from the Samana church pastor that the facility remains closed six months later. Although the electricity bill is paid, they have been waiting for two weeks for INDOTEL to provide a needed battery. He said he does not know how to fund the CCI in the future.</ref>\n\nSur Futuro is one of the non-governmental organizations that has taken on the operations of CCIs, and runs three centers in communities where the organization is also otherwise involved. The group's education director told EconOff that while INDOTEL's CCI program provides an excellent service to communities, the lack of long-term funding limits its impact. She said it costs between US$500 and 850 monthly to operate a CCI, funds that are difficult to come across in poor communities. Sur Futuro's president noted that she is aware that the Catholic Church struggles to maintain the CCIs it runs.\n\nCodetel's participation in the rural broadband program has been directed by Ahmed Awad, who said the company's total cost of the program is about US$50 million. He said that while Codetel views it as a social investment, it has also proven relatively commercially successful.\n\nIn addition to installing and maintaining the infrastructure for broadband connectivity in the 508 communities, Codetel is responsible for setting up an entrepreneur program, establishing an [[Web portal|Internet portal]] for the program and providing training in each community participating in the program. In the entrepreneur program, Codetel has helped small businesspeople in many of the communities invest an average of US$1000 to start up [[Internet caf\u00e9|internet cafes]] or international [[Call centre|call centers]]. The Internet portal, which Codetel hired an NGO to construct, features geographic, demographic and other facts about each of the 508 communities. Awad told EconOff he believes it is the only database of information about these forgotten locales. The training provided by Codetel is limited to a one-hour workshop provided to the highest level of school taught in each municipality. Awad said that while the schools have received the trainers positively, he noted that one hour was insufficient to provide much training to the students.\n\nAwad told EconOff that the installed connections are 80 percent wireless, but that despite the fact that this provides the opportunity for cellular-only service in these areas, many customers want wired hardware in their homes despite the higher costs. Because the service is wireless, many locales contiguous to the participating communities have gained broadband access, Awad said. \"In addition to the 508 municipalities, another 150 or so villages will receive service because of the wireless reach,\" he told EconOff.\n\nAwad said he hoped that INDOTEL would launch a sequel to this program, noting that there are another 1500 communities that lack broadband access. However, he lamented the fact that the sector does not have an ongoing focalized subsidy that would reduce costs to rural users, which would make these consumers a more attractive target for private investment. He also commented that the country needs more investment in information technology (IT) education in order to take advantage of the growing broadband penetration and stimulate demand for these services. Perhaps most importantly, though, he cited the lack of reliable electricity as one of the highest hurdles impeding broadband growth both in rural communities and nationwide.\n\nInstead of providing incentives for growth, the GoDR has a policy of discouraging it with high taxes. In a 2 April interview with the newspaper Hoy, Codetel President Oscar Pena complained that the Dominican Republic has the fourth highest taxes on telecommunications of any country in the world, at 28 percent, and a 3 percent municipal tax appears likely to increase this burden even further. Pena said that the implementation of the 3 percent tax would send a strong negative signal to investors.\n\n==== Ecuador ====\n{{Main|Internet in Ecuador}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\nIn August 2009, BNamericas reports that [[Ecuador]]'s telecoms watchdog Senatel aims to end 2010 with 9,000 schools connected to the internet via broadband networks under a national scheme, compared to 1,900 today, with 4,000 of the new connections to be made this year. A further 11,000 schools are to be covered by other public-funded social programmes, universal access fund Fodetel told BNamericas, adding that state-run telco Corporacion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CNT) is currently handling all rollouts, and as yet there had been no plans announced to open up tenders to private sector broadband operators. The news site wrote that telecoms regulator Conatel lists ongoing projects to connect 759 schools at a cost of US$4.56 million, or an average of US$6,000 per school.\n\n==== Mexico ====\n{{Main|Internet in Mexico}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\nAccording to CEO Telecom Briefings, Latin America 2009, [[Telmex]] considers that the goal to connect 15 million to broadband by 2012 is impossible. This is reportedly one of the administration's goals. The Government also hopes that by that date 70 million people will be able to connect to the Internet. According to data from INEGI, 20% of the population had access to the Internet.\n\nMexico presented the AgendaDigital.mx<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.agendadigital.mx/descargas/AgendaDigitalmx.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725034528/http://agendadigital.mx/descargas/AgendaDigitalmx.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2012 establishing goals to increase fixed and mobile broadband penetration to 38% by 2015.\n\nIn June 2013 a reform<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5301941&fecha=11/06/2013 |title = DOF - Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n}}</ref> Telecommunications was adopted establishing access to broadband and Internet as a constitutional right. The Reform also includes connectivity goals such as connecting at least 70% of Mexican households and 85% of SME's with the average OECD countries connection speed at competitive prices. As part of this reform the past regulator, the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (COFETEL) created by presidential decree in 1996 is to be replaced by a newly created organism the Insitituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones<ref>http://www.ift.org.mx/iftweb/</ref> (IFT).\n\nCOFETEL, now IFT, went from being a division of the Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) to become an independent constitutional body, the number of commissioners increased from five to seven and the selection of the commissioners changed. Previously, commissioners were appointed by the president with Senate approval. Under the recent Reform, the commissioners are elected by an Evaluation Committee who proposes a list of candidates that meet specific requirements established by law to the Executive, who selects a candidate(s) to be ratified by the Senate. In terms of financing, COFETEL depended on the allocation of a resources by the Ministry of Finance which limited its independent operation. The new IFT exercises its budget autonomously, according to the law 'the House will ensure the adequacy budget to enable the effective and timely exercise of its powers' (Article 28 LFT, 2013).\n\n== Europe ==\n<!-- [[Broadband internet access in europe]] redirects here -->\n\n=== European Union ===\n{{Main|European Commissioner for Digital Agenda}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe Digital Agenda for [[European Union|Europe]] is one of the [[Europe 2020#Flagship initiatives|seven flagship initiatives]] of the [[Europe 2020]] strategy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/index_en.htm |title = Digital Single Market}}</ref> The objective is to bring \"basic broadband\" to all Europeans by 2013 and also to ensure that, by 2020, all Europeans have access to much higher internet speeds of above 30 Mbit/s and 50% or more of European households subscribe to internet connections above 100 Mbit/s.\n\nOn 20 September 2010 the [[European Commission]] published a Broadband Communication,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/broadband/policy/index_en.htm |title = Digital Single Market}}</ref> which describes measures the commission will take to achieve the targets of the Digital Agenda.\n\n==== Austria ====\n{{Main|Internet in Austria}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn October 2009, the [[European Commission]] called on the Austrian [[List of telecommunications regulatory bodies|telecommunications regulator]], RTR, to suspend the adoption of regulatory measures governing the broadband access market, finding that RTR provided \"insufficient evidence\" that mobile broadband connections can be considered substitutes for fixed-line DSL (digital subscriber line) and cable modem connections. RTR had proposed to define the broadband access market for residential customers as including mobile, DSL, and cable modem connections and to consider that market as competitive. RTR allegedly found that the retail broadband market for business customers was not competitive and that wholesale regulation of the market, including requiring \"bitstream access\", remained necessary. The EC disputed the conclusion that mobile connections are substitutes for fixed-line broadband connections, which would require that all three types of connections can be equally used for downloading music or films or providing sufficiently secure connections for [[Online banking|Internet banking]]. The EC also questioned the definition of the relevant wholesale product market \"as a sufficiently detailed forward-looking analysis of the different wholesale inputs is missing.\"\n\nPreviously, in 2003, the Campaign for Broadband Internet Connection initiative was launched, seeking to achieve blanket broadband by 2007. Information is scarce on whether the campaign was continued since the 2007 has come and passed without their goals being met.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bmvit.gv.at/en/telekommunikation/broadband.html |title = Bmvit - File not found}}</ref>\n\n==== Belgium ====\n{{Main|Internet in Belgium}}\n\nThe [[Government of Belgium|Belgian government]] owns over 50% of the incumbent telco provider [[Belgacom]].\n\nAs of April 2009, at the request of BIPT (the Belgian Institute for Postal service and Telecommunications), the consultancy firms Analysys Mason and [[Hogan Lovells|Hogan & Hartson]] has drawn up a report regarding the development of the broadband market in Belgium and suggested a certain number of possible actions to promote competition on this market.\n\nAt the request of Mr Vincent van Quickenborne, Minister of Enterprise and Simplification, the suggested action items have been submitted to the sector for consultation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipt.be/en/408/ShowDoc/3063/Consultations/Consultation_at_the_request_of_the_Minister_on_the.aspx |title=BIPT \u2013 Consultation at the request of the Minister on the strategic options to promote the development of the broadband market |publisher=Bipt.be |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2017 statistics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibpt.be/public/files/fr/22523/2017_presentatie_fr.pdf |title=Situation secteur de communications \u00e9lectroniques et TV 2017|publisher=Bipt.be |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>, there are still 12% of the houses in Belgium that have broadband services with a bandwidth of less than 30 Mbit/s. \n[[Proximus]] has started to deploy [[Hybrid Access Networks]]] by combining [[XDSL]] and LTE to address this problem <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proximus.com/en/news/tessares-proximus%E2%80%99-access-bonding-offering-faster-internet-large-sparsely-populated-rural-areas|title=Tessares-Proximus' Access Bonding - offering faster Internet in large, sparsely populated rural areas \u2013 now successfully qualified to move to a countrywide deployment phase.|author=Proximus Press release|date=2017-05-16|access-date=7 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705233839/https://www.proximus.com/en/news/tessares-proximus%E2%80%99-access-bonding-offering-faster-internet-large-sparsely-populated-rural-areas|archive-date=5 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>.\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\n{{Main|Internet in Bulgaria}}\n\nIn March 2009, the \u201cNational Program for Development of Broadband Access in Republic of [[Bulgaria]]\u201d, issued by the State Agency for Information Technologies and Communication, set the following targets by the year 2013:<ref>ITU WSIS Stocktaking Report 2012\nhttp://www.itu.int/wsis/stocktaking/docs/reports/S-POL-WSIS.REP-2012-PDF-E.pdf</ref>\n\n* 100% coverage of population at 10 Mbit/s in large cities\n* 90% coverage of population at 6 Mbit/s in medium cities\n* 30% coverage of population at 1 Mbit/s in rural areas (90% mobile broadband)\n\n==== Croatia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Croatia}}\n\nThe [[Politics of Croatia|Government of the Republic of Croatia]] adopted on 13 October 2006 the Strategy for the development of broadband access to the Internet in the [[Republic of Croatia]] until 2008. The Strategy aims to reduce the gap between Croatia and [[European Union]] member states concerning the density level (penetration) of broadband Internet connections. Therefore, an ambitious goal has been set to achieve the density level of at least 12 percent, i.e. to number at least 500,000 broadband connections until the end of 2008. In January 2009, the government declared success. However, accepting the fact that in the area of the development of broadband Internet, new challenges stand before the Republic of Croatia. The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure and the Central State Administrative Office for e-Croatia have initiated the drafting of the new Strategy for the development of broadband access to the Internet which would define strategic goals for the forthcoming period.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120730222131/http://www.e-hrvatska.hr/sdu/en/e-hrv/vijest.html?h=/en/e-hrv/contentParagraph/011111111111]</ref>\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n{{Main|Internet in the Czech Republic}}\n\nTo speed up the broadband network development and stimulate its use mainly by households and individuals, the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Government]] adopted the \"National Broadband Access Policy\" in January 2005. The Policy is based on the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Council recommendations on promoting broadband development. Its main goal for the CR is to achieve a level of about 50% of the population to use broadband by 2010{{When|date=December 2010}} at the latest.<ref> https://technicalowner.blogspot.com/2020/04/Bsnl-new-plans-broadband.html {{|date=april 2020 |bot=technical owner |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[https://technicalowner.blogspot.com/]{{|date=april 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Denmark ====\n{{Main|Internet in Denmark}}\n\nThe existing strategy for the rollout and use of broadband in [[Denmark]] is based on the 2001 broadband plan 'From hardware to content'. The [[Politics of Denmark|Danish Government]] follows up this strategy annually. According to a hearing in 2005, Denmark will continue to follow the main principles of the strategy.\n\nThe political objective of the Danish Government is high transmission capacity for all, and strategies such as a national infrastructure that is rapid, inexpensive and secure, are needed to achieve this objective. The rollout of the IT infrastructure shall be developed by the private market with the Danish [[public sector]] serving as the driving force. For example, own IT investments by the public sector are intended to boost the demand for a digital infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ficora.fi/attachments/englantiav/5m4R6KvqC/Broadband_Prices_in_the_Nordic_Countries_2006.pdf|title=Viestint\u00e4virasto - Etusivu|author=Viestint\u00e4virasto|work=ficora.fi}}</ref>\n\n==== Estonia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Estonia}}\n\nThe [[EGovernment in Estonia|Estonian Information Society Strategy 2013]] and the Estonian Electronic Communications Act reflect the basic principles of encouraging infrastructure investment, practicing technologically neutral policy and regulation and the primary role of the private sector in the expansion of broadband.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | title   = EE: Estonian Information Society Strategy 2013\n | url    = http://www.epractice.eu/node/280994\n | accessdate =3 December 2010\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{Main|Internet in Finland}}\n\nOn 8 May 2008, Ms Suvi Lind\u00e9n, Minister of Communications, appointed Mr Harri Pursiainen, permanent secretary, to study the means of ensuring a comprehensive broadband supply throughout the country and of organising its funding especially in non-built-up areas. The first part of the study includes a proposal for a government resolution and the second part examines the reasoning behind the proposal topic by topic. The report proposes that the public sector introduce business subsidies to enterprises that upgrade the public telecommunications network into a condition that makes available to most all citizens by 2015 an optical fibre or cable network supporting 100 Mbit connections. Prior to this goal, the speed of the broadband connection included in the universal service obligation must be raised to an average of 1 Mbit/s by 31 December 2010 at the latest.\n\nIn order to finance the State contribution required for the target for 2015, it is proposed that certain radio frequencies coming up for allocation be auctioned. In the event that auction revenues are insufficient to cover the State's public aid for telecommunications infrastructure construction, the shortfall would be made up with a telecommunications network compensatory payment to be collected from telecommunications operators. The auction revenues and the compensatory payments could be entered as income and decisions on their use made either through the Budget or by means of a fund outside the Budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lvm.fi/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=57092&name=DLFE-4311.pdf |title=Making broadband available to everyone |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004235002/http://www.lvm.fi/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=57092&name=DLFE-4311.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Finland]] has passed a law making access to broadband a legal right for Finnish citizens.

The projects were implemented and co-financed by local governments and the [[Government of Latvia|central government]], with the majority of the funding provided by EU structural funds. Latvia has listed internet access and availability promotion as an activity eligible for EU structural funds for the 2007\u20132013 EU budgetary period, but this activity is not designed to target rural areas or specifically increase broadband deployment. However, given Latvia's severe economic decline and the associated budgetary issues, the outlook for additional projects in the future is grim.\n\nFalling budget revenues have significantly limited Latvia's ability to co-finance any EU projects. There are bureaucratic obstacles as well, since Latvia has not yet adopted guidelines and evaluation criteria necessary to launch this program. One reason behind this delay is the GOL plan to reprioritize the national list of activities eligible for EU money in response to the crisis, increasing funding to the export sector. Internet access is not viewed by Latvian authorities as a significant problem; therefore, an increase in funding to communication infrastructure projects is unlikely. Furthermore, Latvia has decided to divert the funds the European Commission allocated to expansion of broadband networks, as part of the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|European Economic Recovery Plan]], to projects in the dairy sector.\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n{{Main|Internet in Lithuania}}\n\n;Rural Area Information Technology (RAIN) project\n;002 project\nThe Development Strategy of the Broadband Infrastructure of [[Lithuania]] for 2005\u20132010 was published in the official gazette on 31 December 2002.

Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]] announced the funding, saying he hoped the country's main telecoms operators would invest one billion euro to build NGNs during 2009. The credit line forms part of an agreement between the government and the operators [[Portugal Telecom]], [[ZON Multim\u00e9dia]], [[Sonae]]com, and ONI on the roll-out of fibre networks, and is the first step in a 2.18-billion-euro plan announced in December 2008 to boost the country's economy.\n\nPrime Minister Socrates said the credit line would pave the way for improvements in high-speed internet, television and voice services, adding: \"This is the launch of the first measure of the stimulus plan to combat the economic crisis.\"\n\n;Development Through Fibre\nPortugal's PM said he hoped the investment would allow up to 1.5 million homes and businesses to be connected to the new fibre networks. He added that the government has no preference regarding how the networks are rolled out by the operators, leaving them to reach a decision among themselves on whether single or multiple networks are constructed. Although the terms of the credit line have not been disclosed, they are likely to be highly favourable to the operators, and may represent a timely cash injection\u2014as the global economic crisis bites, operator spending in reined in and private investment sources dry up. Portugal's broadband market showed strong growth, not least due to widespread cable and DSL networks. ADSL2+ services are also available from alternative operators such as [[Vodafone]] and cable data speeds at up to 100 Mbit/s were trialled in 2007. The Portuguese government had set a goal of 50% home broadband penetration by 2010, and this latest investment should allow the operators to significantly surpass this target.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.communicationsdirectnews.com/do.php/140/33928?199 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120070527/http://www.communicationsdirectnews.com/do.php/140/33928?199 |archive-date=20 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Romania ====\n{{Main|Internet in Romania}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn May 2009, while broadband Internet access increased by 30 percent last year, [[Romania]]'s penetration rate is still half that of the EU average. Both the newly reorganized National Authority for Administration and Regulations in Communications (ANCOM) and the renamed [[Ministry of Communications and Information Society (Romania)|Ministry of Communication and Information Society]] (MCIS) have repeatedly expressed interest in further expanding broadband access. To this end, MCIS issued a new broadband strategy for 2009 to 2015, but has yet to identify how to implement or fund the strategy. This cable responds to Department's reftel{{typo help inline|reason=similar to reflet|date=November 2019}} request for information on country broadband deployment initiatives.\n\nIn his first press conference on 9 April, new ANCOM President Catalin Marinescu stated his main goal would be to increase the number of broadband Internet connections. Due to the expansion of the 3G network, mobile access connections to the Internet reached 2.7 million users in 2008, which is almost double the number in 2007. Despite a 30 percent increase in access in 2008, Romania's broadband penetration is still only about 11.7 percent, which is less than half of the EU average of 22.9 percent.\n\nANCOM suggestions for increasing broadband deployment in Romania include:\n\n# Review local loop access conditions that were unsuccessfully regulated in 2003;\n# stimulate operators with existing 3G licenses to expand services and/or reorganize the 3G band in order to grant one or two additional licenses to companies (there are currently four 3G licensed operators in Romania);\n# reissue a WiMax tender for the 3.5\u20133.7&nbsp;GHz band. A 2008 attempt to grant WiMax licenses failed due to the high cost. ANCOM hopes the Government will lower the cost in order to increase commercial interest in the coming year.\n\nA precondition for accessing EU structural funds in this area is the adoption of a national broadband strategy. The MCIS's 2009\u20132015 strategy for broadband wireless access establishes an inter-ministerial working group responsible for implementation of infrastructure projects for broadband service expansion. Additionally, Minister of Communication [[Gabriel Sandu]] claims he will identify other financing sources, such as crisis funds, governmental funds and private funds to increase broadband deployment to rural areas.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Slovenia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 2004, [[Slovenia]] issued the Strategy for Development of Broadband Networks, effective 2004\u20132006.

Additionally, the program operative requirements consisted on:\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-latin\">\n# Technological neutrality so that any type of broadband technology could be deployed and to avoid technology obsolescence;\n# the duty of the beneficiaries to open up the financed networks to competition;\n# infrastructure investments in well-defined and not serviced areas in order to avoid duplicative investments.\n</ol>\nTaking into account cabled technologies such as DSL are distance sensitive, and generally only feasible within a few miles of the nearest central office switch, PEBA projects were not limited to a single technology. At present, several technological solutions (ADSL, WiMAX, Satellite and [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|HFC]]) are being used to provide broadband access to the PEBA population centres, depending on their geographic features, roll\u2013out dates and available technology.\n\nFollowing Peba achievements and within the Avanza Infrastructures Program, the Ministry has continued working to increase broadband coverage in very small population centres. Additionally and taken into account advances in technology and the need not only to provide broadband access but also to improve the service quality and speed, the objective was also to improve bandwidth and network capacity provided by telcos at rural areas. Two action lines compose the broadband strategy under this funding program:\n\n:F1: Projects intended to deploy access infrastructures in order to satisfy the demand for broadband connection from population in isolated and rural areas.\n:F2: Projects intended to improve speed and capacity of rural backbone networks\n\nF1 action line projects will be based mainly on wireless broadband access technologies such as: [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]], WIMAX and Satellite although some of the beneficiary operators are already planning to provide ADSL connection at some population centres. F2 projects will mostly improve transport networks by means of fibre optics and WiMAX radio links.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, [[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Spain's Ministry of Industry]] has opened a public consultation on extending the concept of universal service to cover broadband access. The consultation concerns topics such as the minimum speed, the use of wireless technologies for broadband provision, related pricing models, and the schedule for service implementation.\n\n;Significance\nAt the moment, the mandate for universal service covers narrowband internet access, but as speeds of such services have become increasingly inadequate for responding to typical user needs, the government is now assessing whether connection over broadband should be defined as a legal right. As of end-June this year, according to regulator CMT, accesses defined as narrowband accounted for 2.4% of all 9.547 million internet subscriptions, against 5.2% a year earlier; in meanwhile, of the broadband accesses those at speeds below 1 Mbit/s accounted represented 0.4% of the total. [[Global Insight|IHS Global Insight]]'s view is that the allocation of lower frequency bands such as 800 and 900&nbsp;MHz for data services will be in the main role if the Spanish government wants to bring broadband to every citizen. Thus far, incumbent Telef\u00f3nica has used WiMAX and satellite connections to live up its universal service mandate in some of the more remote areas of the country, yet we believe that by expanding its mobile broadband network by using the lower frequencies it could achieve the same more cost-efficiently.\n\n==== Sweden ====\n{{Main|Internet in Sweden}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe goal of [[Sweden]]'s Information Technology Policy is that Sweden should be a sustainable information society for all. This implies an accessible information society with a modern infrastructure and IT services of public benefit, so as to simplify everyday life and give people in every part of the country a better [[quality of life]].\n\nIT should contribute to a better quality of life and help improve and simplify everyday life for people and companies, but it should also be used to promote sustainable growth. An effective and secure physical infrastructure for IT, with high transmission capacity, should be available in all parts of the country so as to give people access to, among other things, interactive public e-services.\n\nFor broadband, the Swedish and European IT policy aims to increase accessibility to an infrastructure with capacity for broadband transmission. Broadband among other things, promotes economic growth by creating new services and opening up new investment and employment opportunities. The objective is broadband for all households (permanent housing) and business and public operations. According to the [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority]], 'broadband' in this objective, refers to connections that can be upgraded to a transmission rate downstream of at least 2 Mb per second.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2007, Sweden's broadband support program included:\n\n* Total state governmental funding 817 million $ (5.25 billion SEK)\n* Total investment: Government 51%; Municipalities 11%; Operators 30%; EU structural funds 7%; Regional policy funds 1%\n* Concentrating on rural and other areas where the market will not supply infrastructure\n* Open procurement process\n* Requirement that networks should be operator-neutral\n* 85% of investments used for new infrastructure\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{Main|Internet in the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe United Kingdom issued its \"Digital Britain\" report in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/6216.aspx |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512203732/http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/6216.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 May 2010 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Department for Culture Media and Sport \u2013 the report |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>'''The Universal Service Commitment.''' More than one in 10 households today cannot enjoy a 2Mbps connection. We will correct this by providing universal service by 2012. It has a measure of future-proofing so that, as the market deploys next-generation broadband, we do not immediately face another problem of exclusion. The USC is also a necessary step if we are to move towards digital switchover in the delivery of more and more of our public services. The Universal Service Commitment will be delivered by a mix of technologies:\nDSL, fibre to the street cabinet, wireless and possibly satellite infill. It will be funded from \u00a3200m from direct public funding,2 enhanced by five other sources: commercial gain through tender contract and design, contributions in kind from private partners, contributions from other public sector organisations in the nations and regions who benefit from the increased connectivity, the consumer directly for in-home upgrading, and the value of wider coverage obligations on mobile operators arising from the wider mobile spectrum package. The Commitment will be delivered through the Network Design and Procurement Group, with a CEO appointed in the Autumn. We will also discuss with the BBC Trust the structure which gives them appropriate visibility in the delivery process of the use being made of the Digital Switchover Help Scheme underspend, which will be realised in full by 2012.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>'''The Next Generation Final Third project.''' Next generation broadband networks offer not just conventional high definition video entertainment and games (which because of this country's successful satellite platform are less significant drivers here than in some other markets) but also more revolutionary applications. These will include tele-presence, allowing for much more flexible working patterns, e-healthcare in the home and for small businesses the increasing benefits of access to cloud computing which substantially cuts costs and allows much more rapid product and service innovation. Next-generation broadband will enable innovation and economic benefits we cannot today predict. First generation broadband provided a boost to GDP of some 0.5%\u20131.0% a year. In recent months the UK has seen an energetic, market-led roll-out of next generation fixed broadband. By this Summer speeds of 50Mbps and above will be available to all households covered by the Virgin Media Ltd's national cable network: some 50% of UK homes. Following decisions by the regulator, Ofcom, which have enhanced regulatory certainty, BT Group plc has been encouraged by the first year capital allowances measures in Budget 2009 and the need to respond competitively to accelerate their plans for the mix of fibre to the cabinet and fibre to the home. BT's enhanced network will cover the first 1,000,000 homes in their network. The \u00a3100m Yorkshire Digital Region programme approved in Budget 2009 will also provide a useful regional testbed for next generation digital networks.</blockquote>\n\nIn August 2009 the UK Government published its Digital Britain Implementation Plan setting out the government's roadmap for the rollout of its plans mentioned above.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512151247/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/6310.aspx Read Article] or [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512160421/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/DB_ImplementationPlanv6_Aug09.pdf Download PDF].</ref>\n\n=== Other European countries ===\n\n==== Norway ====\n{{Main|Internet in Norway}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nAccording to the statement of the [[Party platform|political platform]] for the parties in Government7 dated 13 October 2005, the level of ambition for broadband rollout is to rise. The rollout of broadband throughout the entire country offers great potential to the business sector in the form of development and the setting up of more businesses, while reducing the difficulties of great distances. The tangible objectives of Government policy include:\n\n* Broadband should be available throughout Norway by the end of 2007\n* Unreasonable geographical price differences for broadband connection should not exist\n* Government funding will contribute to broadband rollout in those areas where rollout is not ensured by market players.\n\n==== Russia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Russia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 17 September 2009, Deputy Prime Minister [[Sergey Sobyanin]] has indicated that a special government commission will meet in October{{When|date=December 2010}} to discuss the development of broadband services in Russia, reports Prime-Tass. Issues to be considered will include the enhancement of broadband access quality and the increase of data-transfer speeds. Sobyanin also stated that the government would allocate 10 billion roubles (US$326.7 million) towards the development of various high-tech projects in 2010, aimed at carrying out technological upgrades in various sectors of the Russian economy. Earlier in the week Communications and Mass Media Minister [[Igor Shchyogolev]] stated that the government viewed the construction of main communications lines and the development of broadband and digital TV services as the top priorities of the telecoms industry.\n\n;Significance\nThe words of the deputy prime minister and communications minister highlight the importance with which the development of broadband services in the country is viewed. Broadband has taken over from mobile as the sector of highest growth potential in Russia, with the Communications Ministry reporting a fourfold increase in internet traffic in 2008. The market is heterogeneous, with no single dominant operator, but instead a number of players employing a variety of technologies. Although uptake has typically been centred on the economic hubs of the capital Moscow and [[St Petersburg]], operators are increasingly expanding towards the regions for further opportunities. With operators continuing to invest in the broadband sector, subscriber uptake growing, and now increasing signals of interest from the government, IHS Global Insight expects the sector to continue to grow healthily in the short and medium terms.\n\n==== Switzerland ====\n{{Main|Internet in Switzerland}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Federal Office of Communications (ComCom) has revealed that round table discussions on the deployment of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks are producing concrete results. According to the regulator the major players are now in agreement on uniform technical standards, meaning that there are no technical barriers to the rapid expansion of the fibre network. A consensus has also been reached on coordination, which will prevent the parallel construction of new networks by laying multiple fibres in every building (known as the multiple fibre model). At the same time the participants at the round table have agreed that all providers must have access to the fibre-optic network under the same conditions, so as to protect end-users' freedom of choice. The participants drew up further recommendations for standardised network access by services. Thanks to an open interface, service providers will enjoy network access to customers at all times via network operators. If, at a later date, the customer opts for a different service provider on the same fibre-optic network, the switch will be possible without any technical complications.\n\nThe roundtable discussions involve cable network operators, telecoms companies and electricity utilities. Further roundtables and working groups will be held to clarify points. ComCom will also examine whether new regulatory measures are needed to govern FTTH deployment, with the aim of reporting to parliament by mid-2010 at the latest.\n\n== Africa ==\n<!-- [[Broadband Internet access in Africa]] and [[Broadband internet access in africa]] redirect here -->\n\n=== Botswana ===\n{{Main|Internet in Botswana}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nFollowing the further liberalization of the [[Botswana]] telecommunications sector in 2004, the Government embarked on a new licensing structure in 2006. That action was designed to move the country from the pre-existing licensing framework, which made the distinction between the various telecoms services, to a service-neutral structure with the view of accommodating technological convergence.\n\nCurrently, the only operator offering fixed-line broadband services is state-owned [[Botswana Telecommunications Corporation]] (BTC),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btc.bw/ |title=Botswana Telecommunications Corporations |publisher=Btc.bw |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> which has launched ADSL services. However, the larger ISPs are also rolling out broadband wireless networks, mainly in [[Gaborone]] (the capital), to serve corporate customers in particular. Mobile operator [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]] launched its [[Orange Livebox|broadband wireless service]] in June 2008 using a WiMAX network in Gaborone. The total number of broadband subscribers increased to an estimated 3,500 in 2007, up from 1,800 in 2006 and 1,600 in 2005, with broadband comprising a growing proportion of total internet accounts.\n\nBTC offers a range of data services including Frame Relay, ISDN, ADSL, MPLS and a broadband wireless service known as Wireless FastConnect. The data market has been liberalized, with ISPs now holding value-added network service (VANS) provider licenses. BTC enjoyed a monopoly over international bandwidth until February 2001 when the regulator began issuing international data gateway licenses. BTC's international bandwidth reached the 200-Mbit/s mark during 2008, some 90% of which (180 Mbit/s) was supplied via cross-border fiber networks to neighboring countries and 10% (20 Mbit/s) by satellite.\n\nDuring 2004, BTC began the deployment of ADSL and a domestic two-way VSAT network for areas beyond the reach of terrestrial infrastructure.\n\nDuring September 2008, BTC completed the roll-out of the [[A2 highway (Botswana)|Trans-Kalahari]] fiber-optic project, connecting Botswana to the neighboring countries of [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]]. The 2,000-kilometre system was built in three parts: phase 1 runs from [[Jwaneng]] through [[Ghanzi]] to Mamuno (the border with Namibia); phase 2 runs from Ghanzi via [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]] to [[Orapa]]; and the phase 3 runs from Sebina via [[Nata, Botswana|Nata]], [[Kasane]] [[Ngoma, Zambia|to Ngoma]] (the border with Zambia). The network is designed to provide onward connectivity to submarine cables, removing the dependence on transiting through South Africa to reach the [[SAT-3/WASC (cable system)|Sat-3/WASC]] and S.A.F.E (Southern Africa Far East) [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cable systems]].\n\nBTC is a signatory to three submarine cable projects ([[EASSy (cable system)|EASSy]], WAFS and AWCC) and the government is in tripartite discussions with [[Angola]] and Namibia to assist each other in realizing the most effective means of achieving connectivity to these cable systems:\n\n* East Africa Submarine System (EASSy), which will run along the eastern coast of Africa from [[Port Sudan]] ([[Sudan]]) to [[Mtunzini]] (South Africa) via [[Mombasa]] ([[Kenya]]), [[Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]) and [[Maputo]] ([[Mozambique]]).\n* West Africa Festoon System (WAFS), the planned cable that will run along the western coast of Africa from Nigeria through [[Gabon]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[Angola]] and possibly Namibia.\n* Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC), planned to run along the western coast of Africa from South Africa and Namibia to the United Kingdom. The proposed AWCC was replaced by the West Africa Submarine Cable (WASC), which awarded a supply contract to [[Alcatel-Lucent]] in April 2009.\n\n=== Egypt ===\n{{Main|Internet in Egypt}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nBroadband access, mainly the DSL variety, is still in its infancy. Local loop unbundling for DSL access was introduced in April 2002 to kick-start broadband uptake, but real growth occurred only after a [[Politics of Egypt|government]] initiative in May 2004 that mandated a 50% tariff cut for unbundling. As part of the government's e-Readiness initiative, a strategy of public-private partnership is being aggressively pursued in the Internet sector to accelerate Internet and broadband uptake.\n\n=== Ghana ===\n{{Main|Internet in Ghana}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 23 July 2009, the [[Politics of Ghana|government of Ghana]] has signed a US$150 million contract with Chinese equipment manufacturer [[Huawei|Huawei Technologies]] for the supply of advanced telecoms infrastructure to ensure broadband internet access countrywide within the next two years. The Minister of Communications, [[Haruna Iddrisu]], told delegates at a conference on [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) that the infrastructure would link internet [[Point of Presence]] (POP) in all district capitals under the government's ICT Backbone Development Programme. The minister added that the government was committed to ensuring it developed the human resources needed to promote the country as a prospect for BPO companies, and said Ghana was working hard to ensure the legislative regime was right encourage inward investment under the e-legislation programme. 'During the year the Ministry of Communications will also facilitate the development of additional legislations in the area of data protection and intellectual property for investors in the area of data capturing and management to operate within the confines of international guidelines and rules,' he said. His words were echoed by Vice President [[John Dramani Mahama]] who stressed Ghana's commitment to developing the nation's ICT backbone capabilities. 'In addition to the SAT3 connectivity, [[GLO-1 (cable system)|GLO-1]] and MaiOne will commence the construction of two additional landing stations by the end of this year to take care of the issues of bandwidth redundancy,' he said.\n\nIn May 2007, the government of Ghana launched the \"Wiring Ghana\" project, a $250 million nationwide 4,000 kilometer fiber-optic backbone project that promises to dramatically increase Ghana's broadband bandwidth supply, reportedly to a capacity of STM-16 nationwide. The government's goal is to provide an open-access, nationwide broadband connectivity to boost economic development. As of May 2008, Phase I of the project that covers the south and mid-country had been completed. Rollout of the second and final phase is underway and is slated to be completed by December 2009.\n\nGhana's project will also provide fiber-optic connections with the neighboring countries of Burkina Faso to the north and Togo to the east.\n\nGhana's broadband market, divided between ADSL and wireless broadband services, was small at the end of 2008, a total of about 26,500 subscribers, ADSL 53% and wireless WiFi/WiMax 47%.\n\n=== Kenya ===\n{{Main|Internet in Kenya}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn May 2009,{{When|date=December 2010}} [[Kenya]] will revolutionize its telecom industry when it initiates its first fiber optic internet connection on 27 June. This broadband connection will vastly improve the quality of internet access to Kenya and contiguous landlocked countries. With increased internet capacity, the fiber will improve local bandwidth quality and potentially decrease communication costs, as it complements the existing and widely used satellite communication networks. The increased bandwidth capabilities will improve the competitiveness of existing businesses, create growth in new industries such as knowledge-based businesses and business process outsourcing, and significantly increase access to information for end-users, schools, and universities. The [[Politics of Kenya|Government of Kenya]] (GOK) expects foreign investment in the sector to hit $10 billion in 2009. Septel will report how this connection and other broadband initiatives will affect rural and underserved areas.\n\nFrom Patrick Boateng's June 2009 report: on broadband, the Kenyan government has recently taken several steps to boost the country's future international bandwidth by committing to several planned submarine cable projects. As an example, in September 2006, Kenya's cabinet decided, after further delays to the proposed East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy), to proceed with its plan to build its own submarine cable, the [[TEAMS (cable system)|East Africa Marine System]] (TEAMS) Ltd. In November 2006, the government signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) with [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]'s fixed-line incumbent, [[Emirates Telecommunications Corporation|Etisalat]], to build a submarine cable from Mombasa to [[Fujairah|Al Fujairah]] in the UAE. In a February 2007 Kenyan government contract award to U.S. Company, [[Tyco International|Tyco Telecommunications]], the company conducted an undersea survey for the project. In October 2007, after the completion of the marine survey, Alcatel-Lucent won the bid to build the cable, and service is expected to begin at the end of the third quarter 2009.{{When|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 2008, Kenya adopted a National ICT Policy and enacted the Kenya Communications Amendment Act. Backed by a new ICT Sector Master Plan (2008\u20132012) and a projected budget of $812.5 million, the main goals of this move are to develop regulations that will provide an enabling environment for leveraging the new broadband capacity, and to improve the ICT sector in general.\n\nMeanwhile, a third submarine cable funded by South African and other investors, [[SEACOM (African cable system)|Sea Cable System]] (SEACOM), landed in Mombasa in May 2009 and is expected to be operational by July 2009. EASSy is slowly in progress and is expected to land in Mombasa in 2010. Also on the horizon are two additional submarine cables, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]]'s Lion which will run from Mombasa to [[Madagascar]] to [[Mauritius]] and [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]]; and FLAG Telecom NGN System II cable.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n{{Main|Internet in Nigeria}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 6 March 2009, the [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] (NCC) has partnered with Nigerian WiMAX operator ipNX to bring broadband access to all 36 states in the country through the 'State Accelerated Bandwidth Initiative' (SABI). Ifeanyi Amah, executive director of ipNX, commented: 'The move to empower Nigerians with broadband internet access started almost two years ago. Our intention is to take our products and services to other regions. Our commitment in that direction can be seen through our partnership with NCC on SABI'.\n\nThe project has been long-delayed, having been postponed because of government red tape and a lack of budget. According to TeleGeography's GlobalComms database, at the start of 2009 three companies were given letters of intent from the NCC: ipNX, MTN and a Wi-Fi alliance of several ISPs. The first phase of the project will cover the 36 state capitals, before being extended to government buildings.\n\nNigeria as a whole can be classified as unserved. The Project arm of SABI consisted of a reverse bid process where broadband providers were invited to state the minimum subsidy each provider required to deploy broadband coverage to all 37 state capital cities in the Country and the three lowest bidders would be appointed.\n\nThe subsidies were limited to:\n\n# [[Customer-premises equipment|CPE]]s for the first 3,000 subscribers per city. (to enable a critical mass for each city sustainable network)\n# Bandwidth supply for the first one year.\n\nThe process is complete and three providers have been selected and approved by the [[Politics of Nigeria|Federal Government]] and they are IPNX, MTN, and NAIJA-WIFI (The latter being a consortium of about 15\u201320 ISPs.) One of the providers has started deployment and completed [[Kano]] (capital of [[Kano State]] in Northern Nigeria) which was launched in May. They are scheduled to launch in [[Ibadan]], capital of [[Oyo State]] next month.{{When|date=December 2010}}\n\nCurrently, the broadband market in Nigeria is in its infancy and is predominantly wireless, rather than wireline, and is dominated by the fixed wireless access operators. Consequently, the market structure has been determined more by the licensing and regulation of the radio spectrum space rather than by unbundling of the local loop. [[Very small aperture terminal|VSAT]] remains the predominant form of broadband Internet access. It is estimated that 51.1% of Internet users are connected by VSAT, 24% by broadband wireless, 3.4% by DSL, 9.3% via dial-up, 8.7% by cable/satellite and the remainder by Wi-Fi and leased lines.\n\nThe introduction of a unified licensing regime from February 2006 is having far-reaching consequences by increasing the scope of the operating licenses of different fixed-line and mobile operators.\n\nAt least two Nigerian ISPs have expanded services into other countries in West Africa. Intercellular, one of the [[Public Telecommunications Operator|PTO]]s, has been granted a license to operate in [[Sierra Leone]]. It has also applied for licenses in [[Benin]], Chad, [[Guinea]], Liberia, and [[Mali]]. Meanwhile, Hyperia, a leading Nigerian ISP, has announced the launch of two new wireless broadband services: a new WiMAX service in [[Port Harcourt]] and a two-way broadband VSAT service. Hyperia awarded a contract to Navini Networks, and has now launched the 3.5&nbsp;GHz WiMAX service in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe ISP also awarded a contract to [[Gilat Satellite Networks]], to provide a SkyEdge broadband satellite hub and several hundred VSAT terminals. The VSAT network uses both [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and {{Ku band}}, and its hub and will be deployed at Hyperia's network operations center in London (U.K.). The VSAT network will enable Hyperia to expand its services in West Africa and to provide multiple services including broadband IP, telephony, and [[videoconferencing]].\n\nTransmission networks are the crux for the whole Nigerian telecommunications sector. New mobile operators, fixed-wireless access (FWA) operators, and ISPs require a robust national transmission backbone to link base stations, mobile switches, and POPs together with long-haul upstream bandwidth. In the absence of a reliable backbone, satellite has provided transmission and backhaul capacity, as well as international connectivity. [[NITEL]] has access to Sat-3/WASC and is gradually upgrading its national transmission capacity. [[Globacom]] launched its \"Glo Xpress\" long-distance transmission service in July 2005, and private operators continue to invest heavily in the roll-out of their own microwave and wireless networks.\n\nThe regulator Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has liberalized the long-distance market, and in addition to the two national carriers, there are now seven national [[long-distance operator]] (NLDOs) that are investing in the roll-out of fiber backbones in different regions of the country. The mobile operators have also deployed their own independent national fiber and microwave backbones, and the unified access license granted to the mobile operators would allow them to commercialize these backbones. A key factor has been the entry of foreign operators into this market, through the acquisition of Nigerian operators.\n\nNigeria has several Gbit/s of international bandwidth, of which NITEL was only serving some 310 Mbit/s using the Sat-3/WASC cable, even though this only represents a fraction of the capacity that it owns on the cable. The balance of Nigeria's international bandwidth is provided entirely by satellite. Of up to six new submarine cables that would land in Nigeria, contracts have been awarded for two: Glo-1, and Main-1 (the others include AWCC, WAFS, Infinity, and Uhurunet). Glo-1 is expected to enter into service in 2009 and Main-1 from May 2010. In the medium term, the introduction of new submarine cables and national backbones linking Lagos to inland cities and towns will squeeze satellite operators, which have met the demand for services and filled the vacuum for data infrastructure.\n\nFollowing is a list of key broadband networks underway:\n\n* '''National Carriers:''' Both national fixed-line operators NITEL and Globacom, and leading national mobile operators, MTN and Zain, are all rolling out their own fiber-optic network infrastructure.\n* '''Alheri Engineering Co Ltd:''' Alheri Engineering, which was awarded one of the 3G licenses, has a two-pronged strategy. First, it will provide a carriers' carrier service to other operators, and plans to roll out a fiber transmission network in three phases. The first phase runs from Benin to Warri, the second from Benin to Port Harcourt, and the third from Aba to Jos. The second prong is to offer 3G services, and in May 2007 the company submitted a bid for the fourth mobile operator M-Tel.\n* '''Backbone Connectivity Network Ltd (BCN):''' BCN began the roll-out of fiber backbone in the northern states of Nigeria in July 2006. The first phase involves the roll-out of 700 kilometers of fiber from Abuja (the federal capital) to Kano via Kaduna and Zaria. The second phase will form a ring running from Kano via Katsina, Malumfashi, Funtua, Zaria, Abuja, Akwanga, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Biu, Yola, Bamboa, Maiduguri, Damaturu, Potaskum, Azare, and Dutse back to Kano. The third phase will run from Sokoto to Abuja via Birnin Kebbi, Kamba, Yelwa Yauri, Kontagora, Bida, and Minna.\n* '''Multi-Links Telecommunications Co Ltd (MLTC):''' Multi-Links, which was acquired by South African incumbent Telkom SA in March 2007, is deploying a fiber network in the south-west of the country, and has a fiber backbone running from Lagos to Abuja. Multi-links had deployed some 2,500 kilometers of fiber-optic network by mid-2008, completed a metro Ethernet ring in Lagos, and will roll out Ethernet rings in Kano, Kaduna and the Niger Delta region.\n* '''Phase3 Telecom:''' Phase3 Telecom won a 15-year concession in March 2006 to operate the fiber-optic cables strung over the high-voltage electricity transmission network of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) in the west of the country. The current fiber network included in the concession is some 1,500 kilometers in length, including a 900-kilometre stretch from Lagos to the federal capital, Abuja (via Ibadan, Oshogbo, Jebba, Shiriro, and Minna), and the operator plans to expand this to 3,000 kilometers over an 18-month period. Phase3 Telecom plans to wholesale service and provide long-distance carrier services to other licensed operators, including mobile operators, private telecommunication operators, ISPs, and others. In December 2008, Phase 3 entered into a deal facilitated by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) to extend its carrier network to Benin, Togo, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Senegal using the high-voltage power transmission lines in these ECOWAS states. According to the Phase 3 Telecom's CEO [[Stanley Jegede]], the project is part of ECOWAS' Intelcom II program to interconnect West African countries by fiber-optic networks.\n* '''Suburban Telecoms:''' Suburban Telecoms has formed a joint venture with Ocean and Oil Holdings (OOH) Ltd to deploy a fiber MAN along a gas pipeline currently being deployed in Lagos by Gaslink. Suburban awarded a contract to Huawei and ATC that covers the deployment of 3,500 kilometers of fiber-optic cable. Suburban Telecoms has ambitions to become not just an MAN in Lagos, but also in other major Nigerian cities. The operator has a three-phased approach: in the first phase, it will connect major cities including Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Kano, Kaduna, Benin, Makurdi, Enugu, Onitsha, and Port Harcourt; in the second and third phases it will connect secondary population centers between these cities, and then extensions to other cities after that.\n* '''Victoria Garden City Communications Ltd (VGC Communications):''' VGC had a customer base of 20,000 in 2007, and operates a fiber MAN in Lagos, where it has laid some 120 kilometers of fiber-optic cables connecting the suburb of Victoria Garden City with Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Ikeja, Marina, Costain, and MayfairGardens.\n* '''Submarine Cables:''' In addition to the Sat-3/WASC submarine cable that lands at Lagos, contracts have been awarded for at least two more cables. NITEL retains exclusivity on access to Sat-3/WASC, and so the introduction of competition is expected to increase capacity dramatically and drive down prices.\n* '''Glo-1:''' Globacom, the SNO and mobile operator, announced in August 2008 that its Glo-1 submarine cable, which will run from the United Kingdom to Lagos and Port Harcourt (Nigeria), was \"nearing completion\" and would be finished by May 2009. Alcatel-Lucent began laying the Glo-1 cable from Bude in May 2007 and by October 2007 it had been deployed as far as Senegal. In August 2008, Globacom said that the final phase is due to begin shortly and will see the remaining section of cable laid from Lagos northwards to reach the other half of the cable in Senegal. The 9,330&nbsp;km submarine cable will have a capacity of 32 STM-64 circuits (totaling 318.4 Gbit/s). A dedicated link will also be leased through the trans-Atlantic Apollo 2 cable from Cornwall (U.K.) to the United States. Globacom had initially secured access to Sat-3/WASC through a leasing agreement with NITEL, but abandoned this and in August 2004 unveiled a plan to build its own private submarine cable, called Glo-1, from Lagos to the United Kingdom.\n* '''Main-1:''' Main Street Technologies, a Nigerian company, announced in April 2008 that it had awarded a supply contract to Tyco Telecommunications to build its Main One submarine cable. The 14,000-kilometre cable has a capacity of 1.28 Tbit/s and will be built in two phases that are both scheduled to be completed in May 2010: phase 1 will connect Nigeria, Ghana, and Portugal, and phase 2 will connect to Angola and South Africa. The Main One Cable is a private system that will provide open access to regional telecom operators and ISPs.\n* '''Other submarine cables:''' At least five other cables are planned to land in Nigeria. The Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC) would run from South Africa to Europe via Nigeria, the West African Festoon System (WAFS) would run from Angola to Nigeria, connecting those countries that do not have Sat-3 landing points, the Infinity Worldwide Group of Companies plans a West African cable that would include Nigeria, NEPAD plans a cable, called Uhurunet, which would encircle the whole continent and have a landing point in Nigeria, and the proposed ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) cable would run from Gabon to France via Nigeria and 19 other African countries.\n\n=== South Africa ===\n{{Main|Internet in South Africa}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe [[Politics of South Africa|government]] passed the Electronic Communications Act in 2006 and is dramatically restructuring the sector towards a converged framework, converting vertically integrated licenses previously granted to PSTN, mobile, USAL, PTN and VANS operators into new Electronic Communications Network Services (ECNS), Electronic Communications Services (ECS), or broadcasting licenses. In January 2009, the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA) granted ECS and ECNS licenses to over 500 VANS operators.\n\nThe South African market is in the process of being dramatically restructured, moving away from old-style, vertically integrated segments under the 1996 Telecommunications Act and 2001 Telecommunications Amendment Act towards horizontal service layers, and the new-style licensing regime is being converted to accommodate this. This process involves the conversion of pre-existing licenses into new Individual or Class Electronic Communications Network Services (ECNS), Electronic Communications Services (ECS), or broadcasting licenses. Licenses are also required for radio frequency spectrum, except for very low power devices.\n\nICASA granted ECNS licenses during December 2007 to seven new under-serviced area licenses (USAL) operators. The new licensees include PlatiTel, Ilembe Communications, Metsweding Telex, Dinaka Telecoms, Mitjodi Telecoms, and Nyakatho Telecoms.\n\nSouth Africa had an estimated 6 million internet users in 2008 and the number of fixed (wireless and wireline) broadband subscribers is estimated at 750,000. [[Telkom SA|Telkom]] reported 491,774 ADSL subscribers (Q3 2008), with the remainder using wireless broadband networks.\n\nSouth Africa's total international bandwidth reached the 10 Gbit/s mark during 2008, and its continued increase is being driven primarily by the uptake of broadband and lowering of tariffs. Three new submarine cable projects will soon bring more capacity to South Africa from 2009\u2014the SEACOM cable is expected to enter service in June 2009 and supply contracts have been awarded for both the EASSy and WACS cables.\n\nWhile the internet user base increased to an estimated 6 million in 2008, the growth curve of paying internet accounts is recognized to be flattening. Meanwhile, the number of broadband subscribers is estimated to have grown quickly to reach about 750,000, split between Telkom's ADSL service (491,774 subscribers by 30 September 2008), and broadband wireless services provided by WBS, [[Sentech]] and others. Dial-up subscribers are migrating to broadband, and then escalating to higher-bandwidth packages as they become available.\n\nThe South African market is split into two main tiers: top-tier internet access providers; and downstream retail ISPs. ISPs are licensed as value-added network service (VANS) providers, although under the Electronic Communications Act of 2006, these licenses were converted in January 2009 to individual or class electronic communication service (ECS) licenses. All domestic ISPs gain international connectivity through one of the internet access providers: SAIX (Telkom), Neotel, Verizon Business, The Internet Solution, MTN Network Solutions, DataPro and Posix Systems.\n\nFollowing the deregulation of the VANS industry in South Africa, a number of leading operators have diversified from being a top-tier ISP to becoming a converged communications service provider offering a range of voice and data services, particularly [[voice over IP]], through the conversion of VANS licenses into ECS licenses.\n\nThe total number of wireless broadband subscribers overtook that of fixed broadband subscribers in South Africa during 2007. The total number of broadband subscribers is estimated at 750,000 by late 2007, of which Telkom reported 335,112 ADSL subscribers. Wireless Business Solutions (WBS) launched the iBurst system in South Africa in late 2004, and had a subscriber base of 45,000 by July 2007, up from 2,500 subscribers by February 2005. Sentech had about 4,000 MyWireless subscribers in 2007, up from 2,500 in 2006. With delays to local loop unbundling (LLU), which would give ISPs access to exchanges, operators are deploying a range of broadband wireless networks. While the mobile operators are deploying HSDPA, W-CDMA and EDGE networks and entering the broadband space, operators are also deploying WiMAX, iBurst, and CDMA systems. Telkom, Sentech, Neotel, WBS and the under-serviced areas licensees (USALs) have currently been given commercial WiMAX licenses. Telkom launched full commercial WiMAX services in June 2007, first at 14 sites in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban, and a further 57 sites are planned for 2007/8. Another 10 operators, including M-Web and Vodacom, were granted temporary test licenses and are awaiting spectrum to be allocated by ICASA. In May 2008, WBS partnered with Vodacom and Intel Corporation to roll out an 802.16e WiMAX network.\n\nThe key upcoming development is that supply contracts have been awarded for three submarine cables that will land in South Arica\u2014SEACOM, EASSy, and WACS. The data sector is a key area for growth in both the corporate data and residential data markets.\n\nSouth Africa is currently served by two submarine cables: SAT-2 and the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE system. Contracts have been awarded for the following three additional submarine cables that will land in South Africa from June 2009:\n\n* '''SEACOM:''' The SEACOM submarine cable landing at Mombasa is due to enter commercial service in June 2009. The cable runs from South Africa to Egypt via Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia, connecting eastwards through to India and westwards through the Mediterranean.\n* '''East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy):''' The planned EASSy will run from South Africa (Mtunzini) to Egypt via Mombasa (Kenya) and other East African countries. The cable will run as far north as Djibouti and Port Sudan, with onward connectivity to Europe provide by the Europe India Gateway (EIG) cable. In March 2007, a 23-member consortium behind EASSy signed a supply contract with Alcatel-Lucent.\n* '''West African Cable System (WACS).''' In April 2009, the WACS consortium signed a construction and maintenance agreement, and awarded a supply contract to Alcatel-Lucent for a 14,000-kilometre cable to provide connectivity between South Africa, Portugal and the United Kingdom via 11 other African countries. With a minimum design capacity of 3.84 Terabit/s, WACS will connect South Africa to the United Kingdom with landings in 12 countries: Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, and Portugal. The WACS consortium comprises 11 parties: Angola Telecom, Broadband Infraco (see below), Cable & Wireless, MTN, Portugal Telecom, Sotelco, Tata Communications, Telecom Namibia, Telkom SA, Togo Telecom and Vodacom. The cable is expected to be ready for service during 2011.\n\n=== Uganda ===\n{{Main|Internet in Uganda}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 13 October 2009, [[Uganda]]'s ICT Minister [[Aggrey Awori]] announces the establishment of the Uganda Broadband Infrastructure Strategy Team (UBIST). The team he said comprises representatives from [[Politics of Uganda|Government]], Regulator, Operators, Internet Service Providers, Other investors/consumers, Civil Society and academia. UBIST will provide government with a well informed position for enabling it to access International Broadband Infrastructure. The government is also studying a number of policies for the effective implementation of the National Broadband strategy.\n\n== Asia ==\n<!-- [[Broadband Internet access in Asia]] and [[Broadband internet access in asia]] redirect here -->\n\n=== Hong Kong, S.A.R. of China ===\n{{Main|Internet in Hong Kong}}\n\nThe Digital 21 Strategy was first published in 1998 by the [[Politics of Hong Kong|Government]] of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] to set out the government's vision of developing Hong Kong into a leading digital city. As a living document, updated in 2001 and 2004, it has taken into account the evolving needs of the community and technological advancements. The 2008 edition notes that Hong Kong offers the world's most affordable [[Internetworking|Internet connection]] and mobile phone services with penetration rates among the highest in the world. [[Cyberport]] and [[Hong Kong Science Park]] have been developed as strategic hubs bringing together clusters of high-tech [[Information technology|information and communications technology]] (ICT) companies and professional talent from all over the world. The Government is pursuing a vigorous [[EGovernment|e-government]] program that has achieved good progress over the years. The Digital 21 Strategy sets out a vision of building on Hong Kong's position as a world digital city through advancing our achievements and seizing new opportunities. The realization of the Digital 21 Strategy vision requires the participation of the entire community including the ICT industry, business sectors, academia and the general public. As an integral part of the Strategy, key indicators of Hong Kong's ICT development will be measured and tracked over time for public reference. The Office of the Government [[Chief information officer|Chief Information Officer]] (OGCIO) is the focal point in the Government for dialogue with the public on the Strategy, for coordinating with all parties within the Government on its implementation and for tracking progress on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/index.htm |title=Digital 21 Strategy |publisher=Info.gov.hk |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219222227/http://info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/index.htm |archive-date=19 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main |Internet in India |National Optical Fibre Network}}\n\nThe typical speeds for consumer broadband connections in [[India]] vary from 512 kbit/s to 12 Mbit/s, with speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s available in a few areas (mostly on university campuses), though plans of 8\u201316 Mbit/s and above are becoming more common from [[BSNL]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]], Beam Telecom, Reliance and [[MTNL]], but they are very expensive & out of reach of most Indians. The demand in India is for affordable 1Mbit/s plans with no download limit.\n\nThe price of Broadband in India is very high compared to Europe or other parts of Asia, with a 1 Mbit/s connection costing between US$20<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mumbai.mtnl.net.in/triband/htm/tariff.htm#tariff |accessdate=13 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419003611/http://mumbai.mtnl.net.in/triband/htm/tariff.htm |archivedate=19 April 2010 }}</ref> and $30 per month.<ref>http://bsnl.co.in/service/new_BB/BB_home_only_unlim.htm</ref> Because of this, broadband is yet to filter down to the masses, with a penetration rate of 8.03 million (December 2009), or about 9.9% of the estimated 81 million total Internet subscribers.\n\nIn addition to the high prices, many providers have introduced a [[Fair Usage Policy]] on \"Unlimited\" plans, while data plans still have very low data transfer limits (typically 100 GB) after which speed is reduced. For example, Airtel offers 100Mbit/s, 200Mbit/s plans, & 300Mbit/s plans, which fall to 512kbit/s due to FUP.<ref>http://www.airtelchennai.in</ref>\n{{See also|Telecommunications in India}}\n\n;Domestic Fiber\nThe National Internet Backbone (NIB), owned and operated by the government, is the largest backbone in the country. [[Bharti Airtel|Bharti]] (Airtel), [[GAIL]]Tel, [[Railtel Corporation of India|Railtel]], [[Reliance Communications]] and [[Tata Communications]] also own and operate large amounts of backbone fiber throughout the country.\n\n;International Connectivity\n{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Main|Internet_in_India#Submarine_cables}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n{{Main|Internet in Indonesia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn April 2009, [[Indonesia]]n telecommunication officials announced the start of an auction process for 2.3&nbsp;GHz radio frequency for broadband wireless access. Only companies or their subsidiaries that are majority Indonesian-owned are able to compete per the 2007 Investment Law and accompanying Negative List.\n\nThe Department of Communications and Information (DEPKOMINFO)laid out the following process for interested bidders:\n\n* 29 April \u2013 5 May Pick-up bidding document;\n* 6 May Submit written questions;\n* 11\u201320 May Submit pre-qualification documents;\n* 29 May Announce prequalification results;\n* 1\u20135 June Prequalification appeal period;\n* 3\u20139 June Pre-auction clarifying\n* 10\u201312 June Implement three round auction;\n* 12 June Announce auction results;\n* 15\u201316 June Auction appeal period;\n* 17 June Confirmation of auction results.\n\nIndonesian officials plan to hold future auctions for the 3.3 and 3.5&nbsp;GHz frequencies. No date is set for these future auctions. Earlier this year, DEPKOMINFO issued a Ministerial decree instructing operators using those frequencies to migrate to other frequencies.\n\nBecause of the Indonesian Negative List on Foreign Investment, U.S. firms will not be able to participate in the auction unless they partner with local companies to create a subsidiary that is majority Indonesian-owned. DEPKOMINFO officials said [[Indosat]] may not be able to compete because they are majority owned by a [[Qatar]] firm. The official added that a majority Indonesian-owned subsidiary of Indosat could still participate in the auction.\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{Main|Internet in Japan}}\n\nIn 2001, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Japanese Cabinet]] released the e-Japan Priority Policy Programme. It stated that the private sector is to play the leading role in information technology, and the [[Politics of Japan|government]]'s role is to implement an environment in which markets function smoothly through the promotion of fair competition and removal of unnecessary regulations. It also stated that government must play an active role in areas in which the private sector's activities do not fulfill the goals of facilitating e-government, closing the [[digital divide]] and promoting [[research and development]]. The e-Japan program extended [[Tax exemption|tax incentives]] and budgetary support for carriers building fiber optic networks.\n\nTo implement this program, the Ministry of [[Public management|Public Management]], [[Interior minister|Home Affairs]], Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT; it later changed its name to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, or MIC) pursued two policies: the National Broadband Initiative, which mandates that federal and local governments deploy fiber to underserved areas; and the e-Japan Strategy, which set forth the goal of providing access at affordable rates by 2005 to high speed Internet networks for at least 30 million households, and to ultra-high speed Internet networks for 10 million households. Japan reached this goal with a broadband household penetration rate of 41.7 percent in 2004.\n\nThese policies provided $60 million to municipalities investing in local public [[Broadband Networks|broadband networks]], as well as low-interest loans to carriers to encourage them to build other broadband networks, including DSL, wireless, and cable systems. The loans were made through the [[Development Bank of Japan]] and the Telecommunications Advancement Organisation, both of which were largely funded by the government of Japan. In 2004, MIC issued its \"Ubiquitous Japan\" (u-Japan) policy. Its goal is to achieve a ubiquitous [[network society]] in which anything and anyone can easily [[access network]]s and freely transmit information from anywhere at any time by 2010. MIC is reviewing its regulations regarding broadband as part of its work towards achieving that goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soumu.go.jp/menu_seisaku/ict/u-japan_en/new_pckg01_menu.html |title=u-Japan Policy Package (1): Development of Ubiquitous Networks |publisher=Soumu.go.jp |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== South Korea ===\n{{Main|Internet in South Korea}}\n\nIn February 2009, the [[Korea Communications Commission]] (KCC) announced plans to upgrade the national network to offer 1 Gbit/s service by 2012.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2009/02/01/by-2012-koreans-will-get-a-gigabit-per-second-broadband-connection/ |title=By 2012 Koreans Will Get 1Gbps Broadband Connections \u2013 Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> an upgrade from the prior 100 Mbit/s guarantee. The plan was intended to cost 34.1 trillion won (US$24.6 billion) over the next five years. The central government will put up 1.3 trillion won, with the remainder coming from private telecom operators. The project is also expected to create more than 120,000 jobs \u2013 a win for the Korean economy. In November 2006, the [[Politics of South Korea|government]] had announced it would invest 26.6 trillion won (US$28.3 billion) to upgrade networks\u2014including [[Fiber to the x|fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH), optical LAN and hyper fiber [[Coaxial cable|co-axial cable]]\u2014in the country over the next four years. The government aims to upgrade a total of 20 million subscriber lines\u201410 million lines for fixed and wireless services each. The government is expecting industry to contribute funds toward the national upgrading project.\n\nThe decision to focus on broadband began in the mid-1990s and intensified after South Korea's economy was crippled by the collapse of the Asian [[financial market]]s in 1997, when policy makers targeted technology as a key sector for restoring the country's economic health. Korean regulators set a path for the industry with well-publicized national goals. All big office and [[apartment building]]s would be given a fiber connection by 1997. By 2000, 30 percent of households would have broadband access through DSL or cable lines. By 2005, more than 80 percent of households would have access to fast connections of 20 Mbit/s or more\u2014about the rate needed for high-definition television.\n\nMost of the country's consumers were already served by the [[Dominant gene|dominant carrier]] [[Korea Telecom]], but the government encouraged competitors with a low-interest loan program for companies that built their own broadband facilities. The program offered $77 million in two years alone, with a particular focus on rural areas. The government offered other incentives for Korea Telecom. Once a [[Public ownership|state-owned]] monopoly, the company began the transition to private hands in 1993. But the government, which retained some shares until 2002, allowed the process to become final only on the condition that Korea Telecom bring broadband to all the villages in the country.\n\nThe government also offered Internet training for the portion of the population deemed likely to be left behind in the digital age. About 10 million people fell into this category in the first round of the government's initiative, including stay-at-home wives, [[Soldier|military personnel]], disabled citizens, and even prison inmates. That program was ultimately expanded to anyone who wanted it.\n\nIn 2004 a consortium that included the now defunct Ministry of Information and Communication, and private sector telecommunication and cable firms including KT, Hanaro Telecommunications, and others started to build a major infrastructure project called the Broadband Convergence Network (BcN). This infrastructure has been launched as a three-phase project. The first phase of the BcN extended from 2004 through 2005, the second phase extended from 2006 through 2007, and the third phase extended from 2008 through 2010. The timeline for the project has since been extended.\n\nA major focus of the South Korean program is [[WiBro]] to offer seamless 100 Mbit/s hybrid networking.<ref name=\"stopthecap1\">{{cite web|url=http://stopthecap.com/2012/01/05/south-korea-set-to-launch-100mbps-wireless-seamlessly-combines-mobile-broadband-wi-fi/ |title=South Korea Set to Launch 100Mbps Wireless, Seamlessly Combines Mobile Broadband & Wi-Fi |publisher=Stop the Cap! |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> It's \"Heterogeneous Network Integration Solution (HNIS) technology... weds 3G/4G service with any open Wi-Fi network to deliver speeds many times faster than North Americans can get from their wireless providers.

The Broadband plan would bring larger, high speed communication pipes that would allow Lebanese citizens to have faster access to information and change the way they live, work, play, and learn. Lebanon's outdated communications infrastructure puts Lebanese industry at a competitive disadvantage, costing jobs, decreasing revenue, and slowing economic growth. The Partnership for Lebanon is working with the [[Politics of Lebanon|Lebanese government]] and business leaders to modernize Lebanon's communications infrastructure through innovation and investment. In so doing, the Partnership is helping Lebanon update technology, reduce connectivity costs, and improve ICT quality across the board.\n\nThe Partnership is working specifically with the Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (TRA) to develop a national broadband strategy designed to bring broadband to Lebanon's urban and rural communities. As part of this effort, the Partnership is conducting broadband business analysis, developing network architecture options, and crafting a regulatory framework to facilitate the successful implementation of a modern communications infrastructure. The Partnership is also working with the government owned telecom operator, [[Ogero]], to increase Lebanon's international bandwidth capacity. The Partnership has provided Ogero with an Internet Exchange Point and is assembling the equipment needed to install two state of the art International Internet Gateways. To help educate local stakeholders about the benefits of a modern communications infrastructure, the Partnership and in coordination with the LBSG Committee which represents economic councils, private sector leaders and professional assiociations, launched a recent Advertising Campaign. The objective of this campaign is to raise awareness and educate the Lebanese public on the need of a True Broadband Infrastructure in Lebanon. The True Broadband Infrastructure will encourage economic growth and social development. The campaign second objective is to drive people to sign the manifesto.<ref>http://www.escwa.un.org/wsis/reports/docs/Lebanon-07-E.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n{{Main|Internet in Malaysia}}\n\nHigh Speed Broadband (HSBB) is a broadband service that offers bandwidth delivered at network speeds of 10 Mbit/s and above when compared to normal broadband (Broadband to the General Population (BBGP)) which delivers bandwidth through wired and wireless technologies at network speeds ranging between 256 kbit/s and 4 Mbit/s. Eventually [[Malaysia]] will see basic HSBB packages offering network speeds between 20\u201350 Mbit/s and up to 100 Mbit/s for consumers while businesses will have maximum network speeds available up to 1Gbit/s.\n\nTo understand the deployment of HSBB, the role HSBB plays in the larger world of broadband deployment in Malaysia must first be understood. Broadband deployment in Malaysia is carried out using two approaches \u2013 normal broadband, known as Broadband to the General Population (BBGP) delivered via wired (DSL) and wireless technologies (WiMax, WiFi, 3G/HSDPA) while the other will be through HSBB.\n\nBBGP (via both wired and wireless modes) is deployed nationwide while HSBB ( available only through the wired mode) will only initially be concentrated in the Klang Valley, Iskandar Malaysia and key industrial zones throughout the country. It is expected that 1.3 million premises will have the ability to access HSBB coverage by end 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tm.com.my/connecting-you/digital-lifestyle/hsbb/Pages/HSBBHome.aspx |title=Connecting You \u2013 UniFi |publisher=TM |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Singapore ===\n{{Main|Internet in Singapore}}\n\nThe [[Singapore]]an [[Politics of Singapore|government]] will provide up to S$750 million (US$520 million) in grants to build the Next Generation National Broadband Network.

The authorities expanded E-Government to include \"E-Society,\" \"E-Industry,\" and \"E-Opportunity\" initiatives under 2002's \"E-Taiwan\" plan. According to James Lo, Section Chief in the National Communications Commission (NCC) Department of Planning, from 2003 to 2007, the [[Taiwan]] authorities and private sector partners spent over US$10 billion on the broadband development. By the end of 2007, there were six million broadband internet accounts in Taiwan.\n\n=== Thailand ===\n{{Main|Internet in Thailand}}\n\nSome of the nation's most powerful telecommunications executives and the regulatory agency, Nation Telecommunications Union (NTC), met for the first time on 2 July 2009 to formulate a plan for Meaningful Broadband. The plan calls for interacting with prime minister, and a spectrum of Thai ministries to establish the role of broadband in achieving public-policy reforms in the [[Politics of Thailand|Abhisit government]].\n\nThe event, held at the [[Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok|Oriental Hotel]], was the first meeting of the Meaningful Broadband Working Group, led by Craig Warren Smith, a visiting professor of [[Chulalongkorn University]]'s Center for Ethics of Science and Technology. Sponsored by NTC, the event released a white paper on Meaningful Broadband.\n\nThe report rejects the path to broadband favored by [[Singapore]] and other advanced nations which serves affluent citizens who can afford high speed internet. Instead, it calls for a new \"broadband ecosystem\" for [[Thailand]], that is focused primarily on the Middle of the Pyramid (MOP), a middle-income group of Thais who make from $2 to $7 per day. By bringing 28 million of these MOP Thais into subsidized meaningful mobile broadband applications, Smith predicts a \"wealth effect\" that could bring equity and sustainability to the Thai economy.\n\nResponding to the framework, Khun Supachai called was one of several members of the group that advocated a follow up study that would prepare for a meeting with Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva|Abhisit]] along with ministers of Finance, Education, ICT and other relevant parties. \"We need to figure out the roles of government, the regulator and the telecommunications operators in establishing broadband that brings optimal benefits to Thailand.\" Supachai, agreed to be host and sponsor of further research in preparation of the next meeting of the Working Group to be held in September.\n\n\"Along with painting the big picture of how broadband could serve the nation, we should focus specifically how it can serve education and human resources development,\" said Montchai Noosong, executive vice president of TOT.\n\n\"Central to the 'meaningful' idea is a new approach to Ethics, said Chulalongkorn University Soraj Hongladarom. \"We want Thailand to develop a way to help users choose broadband applications that will lead them to happiness not addiction,\" he said.<ref>http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/19860/working-group-vows-broadband-net-for-all{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Oceania ==\n<!-- [[Broadband internet access in Oceania]] and [[Broadband internet access in oceania]] redirect here -->\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=March 2014}}\n{{Main|Internet in Australia|National Broadband Network}}\nOn 15 September 2009, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator [[Stephen Conroy]], announced fundamental reforms to Australian's telecommunications landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/088 |title=Historic reforms to telecommunications regulation &#124; Senator Stephen Conroy &#124; Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy |publisher=Minister.dbcde.gov.au |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429161358/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/088 |archive-date=29 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, the [[Politics of Australia|Australian Government]] announced that it would establish a new company that will invest up to $43 billion over 8 years to build and operate a wholesale-only, [[open access (publishing)|open access]] [[National Broadband Network]].

Suitability for certain applications, or technically a certain [[quality of service]], is often assumed. For instance, low [[round-trip delay time|round trip delay]] (or \"latency\" in milliseconds) would normally be assumed to be well under 150ms and suitable for [[Voice over IP]], [[online game|online gaming]], [[financial market|financial trading]] especially [[arbitrage]], [[virtual private network]]s and other latency-sensitive applications. This would rule out [[satellite Internet access|satellite Internet]] as inherently high-latency. In some applications, utility-grade reliability (measured for example in seconds per 30 years outage time as in the [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] network) or security (say [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES-128]] as required for [[smart grid]] applications in the US) are often also assumed or defined as requirements. There is no single definition of '''broadband''' and official plans may refer to any or none of these criteria.\n\nBeyond broad latency and reliability expectations, term itself is technology neutral; broadband can be delivered by a range of technologies including [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]], [[optical fiber cable|fiber optic cable]], [[power line communication|powerline networking]], [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]], [[Ethernet]], [[Wi-Fi]] or [[next-generation access|next generation access]]. Several operators have started to combine two of these technologies to create [[Hybrid Access Networks]]. ''This article presents an overview of official government plans to promote broadband - based on official sources that may be biased due to their promotion of the government plan as effective and positive.''\n\nSuch plans are recommended by [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] and other development agencies.

Paulo reports. It is understood the new rules are designed to improve customer service with a specific focus on the delivery of stated broadband connection speeds; around 50% of users are currently thought to receive less than half the speed promised by their [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). New legislation could enter into force in 2010 requiring domestic broadband providers to comply with stricter standards on service quality. Anatel's move comes in the wake of an explosion in demand for broadband internet access which has seen user number swell to around 18 million, but also resulted in major disruptions to services \u2013 such as the recent high-profile outage of Telef\u00f3nica's Speedy service which left millions of customers offline.\n\n==== Chile ====\n{{Main|Internet in Chile}}\n\nIn October 2008, [[Chile]]'s president, [[Michelle Bachelet]], announced this week the countries' most ambitious telecoms subsidy plan ever, in terns of public investment and area of coverage. The project, which is aimed at boosting SMEs competitiveness in rural areas, will provide connectivity to more than three million people in 1,474 rural communities. The development is expected to cost US$100 million, 70% of which will be provided by the government through the Telecoms Development Fund.\n\n*Significance: At 30 March 2008, only 0.8% of the households in rural areas in Chile have internet access. Upon completion of the project, internet network coverage will reach from 71.6% of the population to 92.2%, according to the country's telecoms regulator.\n\nIn January 2008, Chile announced its 2007\u20132012 Strategy for Digital Development that will articulate the efforts of the public and private spheres as to new technologies during the next years. The project was prepared by the Committee of Ministers for Digital Development and seeks to provide further impulse to the ICTs in the Trans-Andean country.\n\nThe goals on which the [[Politics of Chile|Chilean government]] will place more emphasis are to double the broadband connections to reach 2 million by 2010, to increase SMEs competition, to advance on the digitalization of the public health system, and to implement new technologies in areas deemed key, such as the provisional reform and education.\n\nIn June 2009, Chile launched a new portal in which consumers may compare offers of all internet providers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/viewNoticia.aspx?idArticulo=27853 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728105039/http://www.gobiernodechile.cl/viewNoticia.aspx?idArticulo=27853 |archivedate=28 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==== Colombia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Colombia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nIn April 2009, Internet usage has grown to 40 percent of the Colombian population in the last ten years, with internet subscriptions rising at an annual rate of 75 percent.

Despite the growth, [[Colombia]]'s subscription penetration average remains sixth in Latin America, with a majority of internet subscriptions concentrated in Colombia's three largest cities. To promote [[Information technology|information technologies]] (IT) and telecommunications services in rural areas, Colombia's [[Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications]] developed a comprehensive ten-year National IT plan. A US$750 million public-private Communications Fund administers plan implementation, with 60 percent of funds targeted to the Compartel rural and community development program. [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) also supports the development of telecommunications networks in rural areas, as well as provides technical assistance to GOC telecommunications authorities.\n\nThe percentage of internet users has grown from 1 to 40 percent of the population\u2014or approximately 17 million people\u2014within the last decade. Permanent internet subscribers have also grown at an annual rate of 75 percent in the last five years, although the actual number of subscriptions remains low at 2 million. Colombia's penetration average (the internet subscription to population ratio) is 4.3, ranking it sixth in Latin America behind Chile, [[Argentina]], Uruguay, [[Mexico]] and Brazil. Likewise, 55 percent of subscriptions remain concentrated in the cities of [[Bogot\u00e1]], [[Medell\u00edn]] and [[Cali]].\n\nColombia has 1.45 million internet subscribers with broadband access\u2014approximately 73 percent of total subscriptions.<ref group=\"n\">Colombia's Telecommunications Regulations Commission (CRT) defines broadband as an internet service with a minimum download speed of 512 kbit/s, which is faster than the 128 kbit/s download speed defined as broadband by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).</ref> DSL (63 percent) and cable (32 percent) dominate the broadband market share, with Wimax (5 percent) a distant third. The main providers according to market share are: [[ETB S.A.|Empresa de Telefonos de Bogota]] (25 percent); [[Empresas P\u00fablicas de Medell\u00edn|EPM Telecommunications]] (24 percent); [[Telecom Colombia|Colombia Telecommunications]] (20 percent); Telmex Hogar (19 percent); and independent providers (12 percent). These providers focus on triple-play packages combining internet, television and telephone services, which has contributed to the rapid expansion of internet usage. Carlos Forero, the vice-president of the CRT, said that broadband and associated value-added services are now seen as the market differentiator between telecommunications providers.\n\nLast year the Ministry of Communications (MOC) announced a National IT Plan, establishing three main goals to be achieved before 2019: 70 percent of Colombians with internet subscriptions, 100 percent of health and education establishments with internet access, and 100 percent of rural areas with internet access. The MOC plans to achieve these objectives through its flagship community and rural development program Compartel, which is funded by a US$750 million public-private National Communications Fund.<ref group=\"n\">All telecommunications providers are required to assist the Ministry of Communications in financing the Compartel program, with private sector contributions equaling 15 percent of Compartel's total budget in 2008.</ref> Compartel provides subsidies or investment incentives to establish internet networks and telephony services in Colombia's most rural and impoverished areas. Since 2008, the program has invested US$421 million in rural networks, benefiting 16,000 rural educational, health and government institutions.\n\nIn addition to Compartel, the GOC also supports additional programs in the educational, health, entrepreneurial, competitiveness, online-government and research sectors. Activities in 2008 included the distribution of refurbished computers to educational institutions (US$86 million), connectivity financing for small and medium enterprises ($15 million), conversion of all public institutions to online institutions ($70 million), and e-medicine ($5 million).\n\nUSAID also promotes telecommunications connectivity for underserved and rural populations, as well as education and content to support economic and social development, through its Last Mile Initiative. Major contributors to this public-private alliance are [[Avantel]], [[Intel Corporation|Intel]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[Microsoft]], [[Google]], Polyvision, regional and local governments, and the MOC. Through the program, USG-provided equipment and training will connect 50 municipalities in the [[Departments of Colombia|departments]] of [[Meta Department|Meta]], [[Huila Department|Huila]] and [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]], including 21,000 small businesses and 325,000 institutions such as schools, hospitals, justice houses and local government offices. On the technical side, USAID assisted the MOC with the development of its National Plan and presently advises the CRT on \"unbundling the local loop\" to increase competition in broadband provision.\n\nColombia remains behind Latin American neighbors such as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina in most IT indicators, but since the GOC privatized its state-owned National Telecommunications Company in 2003, the IT sector has expanded rapidly. The sector contributed a record 3 percent of total GDP in 2008. Local experts agree that IT sector will continue to experience accelerated growth as Colombia's domestic security situation improves and the legal economy strengthens. However, they also emphasize that continued private investment is key to the GOC achieving its lofty goals by 2019.\n\n==== Dominican Republic ====\n{{Main|Internet in the Dominican Republic}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nIn October 2009, the [[Dominican Republic]]'s telecoms regulator, [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic|Instituto Dominicano de las Telecomunicaciones]] (INDOTEL), has said it has plans to roll out fixed line telecoms services to an additional 1,000 rural communities as part of an initiative aimed at providing broadband and home voice services to all towns with more than 300 inhabitants. According to TeleGeography's GlobalComms database, the announcement comes just over a year after fixed line incumbent [[Claro Codetel|CODETEL]] inked a deal with INDOTEL to undertake a rural connectivity project that will see investment of US$100 million.\n\nIn April 2009, this cable presents initial reporting on broadband deployment initiatives in the Dominican Republic (reftel). There is one ongoing government initiative to provide broadband access to 508 rural communities that is scheduled to finish by September. While future incentives are being considered by the regulatory agency, no others currently exist and broadband expansion is further hampered by 28 percent in taxes levied on all telecommunications sales. A Senate committee announced on 30 March it would review and update of the 1998 telecommunications law.\n\nThe Dominican Telecommunications Institute (INDOTEL), the GoDR [[regulatory agency]], launched a tender in 2007 for a Rural Broadband Connectivity Program. At that time, only 30 percent of the country's 383 municipalities had broadband capacity. The tender offered a subsidy of up to US$5 million. The winning bidder was Codetel (Mexican-owned), the largest company in the market, which offered to connect the 508 communities with no cash subsidy but rather in exchange for the rights to a WiMax frequency in the country. INDOTEL Executive Director Joelle Exarhakos told EconOff that the program has proceeded successfully and more than 100 rural communities have already been connected. She said Codetel would complete the broadband deployment plan by September 2009. By that time, every municipality in the country will have broadband access. Under the program, Codetel provides 256 kB/second or faster service to rural communities at prices that match the prices charged in urban centers where Codetel competes with other providers.\n\nExarhakos told EconOff that INDOTEL does not have current plans for a second stage for the rural connectivity program, noting that with the completion of this plan, every municipality in the country will have broadband access. She said that in many of these communities, local entrepreneurs have built connections to the networks servicing even smaller communities nearby. Nonetheless, INDOTEL does not foresee a second stage of the rural program to venture into even smaller villages. But Exarhakos told EconOff that she believes such incentives might not be necessary; part of the goal of the Rural Connectivity Program was to demonstrate rural residents' capacity to pay and it has. In [[Monte Plata]], a national provider, Dijitec, is developing infrastructure without any government incentive to compete with Codetel.\n\nIn many of these communities, INDOTEL has set up Informatics Training Centers (CCI), where schoolchildren and residents can access the Internet and learn how to use computers. These centers are among the 846 centers around the country that INDOTEL has established as part of an information technology promotion program. INDOTEL provides the hardware and software for the centers and community groups, schools, churches or town governments maintain and operate the facilities. EconOff visited one such site in October 2008 at a church in [[Saman\u00e1 (town)|Saman\u00e1]] which was inoperable because there were no funds to pay the electricity bill. Asked about these issues, Exarhakos candidly acknowledged that some of the committees have not succeeded in maintaining the facilities.<ref group=\"n\">Following the meeting with INDOTEL, EconOff learned from the Samana church pastor that the facility remains closed six months later. Although the electricity bill is paid, they have been waiting for two weeks for INDOTEL to provide a needed battery. He said he does not know how to fund the CCI in the future.</ref>\n\nSur Futuro is one of the non-governmental organizations that has taken on the operations of CCIs, and runs three centers in communities where the organization is also otherwise involved. The group's education director told EconOff that while INDOTEL's CCI program provides an excellent service to communities, the lack of long-term funding limits its impact. She said it costs between US$500 and 850 monthly to operate a CCI, funds that are difficult to come across in poor communities. Sur Futuro's president noted that she is aware that the Catholic Church struggles to maintain the CCIs it runs.\n\nCodetel's participation in the rural broadband program has been directed by Ahmed Awad, who said the company's total cost of the program is about US$50 million. He said that while Codetel views it as a social investment, it has also proven relatively commercially successful.\n\nIn addition to installing and maintaining the infrastructure for broadband connectivity in the 508 communities, Codetel is responsible for setting up an entrepreneur program, establishing an [[Web portal|Internet portal]] for the program and providing training in each community participating in the program. In the entrepreneur program, Codetel has helped small businesspeople in many of the communities invest an average of US$1000 to start up [[Internet caf\u00e9|internet cafes]] or international [[Call centre|call centers]]. The Internet portal, which Codetel hired an NGO to construct, features geographic, demographic and other facts about each of the 508 communities. Awad told EconOff he believes it is the only database of information about these forgotten locales. The training provided by Codetel is limited to a one-hour workshop provided to the highest level of school taught in each municipality. Awad said that while the schools have received the trainers positively, he noted that one hour was insufficient to provide much training to the students.\n\nAwad told EconOff that the installed connections are 80 percent wireless, but that despite the fact that this provides the opportunity for cellular-only service in these areas, many customers want wired hardware in their homes despite the higher costs. Because the service is wireless, many locales contiguous to the participating communities have gained broadband access, Awad said. \"In addition to the 508 municipalities, another 150 or so villages will receive service because of the wireless reach,\" he told EconOff.\n\nAwad said he hoped that INDOTEL would launch a sequel to this program, noting that there are another 1500 communities that lack broadband access. However, he lamented the fact that the sector does not have an ongoing focalized subsidy that would reduce costs to rural users, which would make these consumers a more attractive target for private investment. He also commented that the country needs more investment in information technology (IT) education in order to take advantage of the growing broadband penetration and stimulate demand for these services. Perhaps most importantly, though, he cited the lack of reliable electricity as one of the highest hurdles impeding broadband growth both in rural communities and nationwide.\n\nInstead of providing incentives for growth, the GoDR has a policy of discouraging it with high taxes. In a 2 April interview with the newspaper Hoy, Codetel President Oscar Pena complained that the Dominican Republic has the fourth highest taxes on telecommunications of any country in the world, at 28 percent, and a 3 percent municipal tax appears likely to increase this burden even further. Pena said that the implementation of the 3 percent tax would send a strong negative signal to investors.\n\n==== Ecuador ====\n{{Main|Internet in Ecuador}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\nIn August 2009, BNamericas reports that [[Ecuador]]'s telecoms watchdog Senatel aims to end 2010 with 9,000 schools connected to the internet via broadband networks under a national scheme, compared to 1,900 today, with 4,000 of the new connections to be made this year. A further 11,000 schools are to be covered by other public-funded social programmes, universal access fund Fodetel told BNamericas, adding that state-run telco Corporacion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (CNT) is currently handling all rollouts, and as yet there had been no plans announced to open up tenders to private sector broadband operators. The news site wrote that telecoms regulator Conatel lists ongoing projects to connect 759 schools at a cost of US$4.56 million, or an average of US$6,000 per school.\n\n==== Mexico ====\n{{Main|Internet in Mexico}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\nAccording to CEO Telecom Briefings, Latin America 2009, [[Telmex]] considers that the goal to connect 15 million to broadband by 2012 is impossible. This is reportedly one of the administration's goals. The Government also hopes that by that date 70 million people will be able to connect to the Internet. According to data from INEGI, 20% of the population had access to the Internet.\n\nMexico presented the AgendaDigital.mx<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.agendadigital.mx/descargas/AgendaDigitalmx.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725034528/http://agendadigital.mx/descargas/AgendaDigitalmx.pdf |archive-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2012 establishing goals to increase fixed and mobile broadband penetration to 38% by 2015.\n\nIn June 2013 a reform<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5301941&fecha=11/06/2013 |title = DOF - Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n}}</ref> Telecommunications was adopted establishing access to broadband and Internet as a constitutional right. The Reform also includes connectivity goals such as connecting at least 70% of Mexican households and 85% of SME's with the average OECD countries connection speed at competitive prices. As part of this reform the past regulator, the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Telecomunicaciones (COFETEL) created by presidential decree in 1996 is to be replaced by a newly created organism the Insitituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones<ref>http://www.ift.org.mx/iftweb/</ref> (IFT).\n\nCOFETEL, now IFT, went from being a division of the Ministry of Communications and Transport (SCT) to become an independent constitutional body, the number of commissioners increased from five to seven and the selection of the commissioners changed. Previously, commissioners were appointed by the president with Senate approval. Under the recent Reform, the commissioners are elected by an Evaluation Committee who proposes a list of candidates that meet specific requirements established by law to the Executive, who selects a candidate(s) to be ratified by the Senate. In terms of financing, COFETEL depended on the allocation of a resources by the Ministry of Finance which limited its independent operation. The new IFT exercises its budget autonomously, according to the law 'the House will ensure the adequacy budget to enable the effective and timely exercise of its powers' (Article 28 LFT, 2013).\n\n== Europe ==\n<!-- [[Broadband internet access in europe]] redirects here -->\n\n=== European Union ===\n{{Main|European Commissioner for Digital Agenda}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe Digital Agenda for [[European Union|Europe]] is one of the [[Europe 2020#Flagship initiatives|seven flagship initiatives]] of the [[Europe 2020]] strategy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/index_en.htm |title = Digital Single Market}}</ref> The objective is to bring \"basic broadband\" to all Europeans by 2013 and also to ensure that, by 2020, all Europeans have access to much higher internet speeds of above 30 Mbit/s and 50% or more of European households subscribe to internet connections above 100 Mbit/s.\n\nOn 20 September 2010 the [[European Commission]] published a Broadband Communication,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/broadband/policy/index_en.htm |title = Digital Single Market}}</ref> which describes measures the commission will take to achieve the targets of the Digital Agenda.\n\n==== Austria ====\n{{Main|Internet in Austria}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn October 2009, the [[European Commission]] called on the Austrian [[List of telecommunications regulatory bodies|telecommunications regulator]], RTR, to suspend the adoption of regulatory measures governing the broadband access market, finding that RTR provided \"insufficient evidence\" that mobile broadband connections can be considered substitutes for fixed-line DSL (digital subscriber line) and cable modem connections. RTR had proposed to define the broadband access market for residential customers as including mobile, DSL, and cable modem connections and to consider that market as competitive. RTR allegedly found that the retail broadband market for business customers was not competitive and that wholesale regulation of the market, including requiring \"bitstream access\", remained necessary. The EC disputed the conclusion that mobile connections are substitutes for fixed-line broadband connections, which would require that all three types of connections can be equally used for downloading music or films or providing sufficiently secure connections for [[Online banking|Internet banking]]. The EC also questioned the definition of the relevant wholesale product market \"as a sufficiently detailed forward-looking analysis of the different wholesale inputs is missing.\"\n\nPreviously, in 2003, the Campaign for Broadband Internet Connection initiative was launched, seeking to achieve blanket broadband by 2007. Information is scarce on whether the campaign was continued since the 2007 has come and passed without their goals being met.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bmvit.gv.at/en/telekommunikation/broadband.html |title = Bmvit - File not found}}</ref>\n\n==== Belgium ====\n{{Main|Internet in Belgium}}\n\nThe [[Government of Belgium|Belgian government]] owns over 50% of the incumbent telco provider [[Belgacom]].\n\nAs of April 2009, at the request of BIPT (the Belgian Institute for Postal service and Telecommunications), the consultancy firms Analysys Mason and [[Hogan Lovells|Hogan & Hartson]] has drawn up a report regarding the development of the broadband market in Belgium and suggested a certain number of possible actions to promote competition on this market.\n\nAt the request of Mr Vincent van Quickenborne, Minister of Enterprise and Simplification, the suggested action items have been submitted to the sector for consultation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bipt.be/en/408/ShowDoc/3063/Consultations/Consultation_at_the_request_of_the_Minister_on_the.aspx |title=BIPT \u2013 Consultation at the request of the Minister on the strategic options to promote the development of the broadband market |publisher=Bipt.be |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2017 statistics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibpt.be/public/files/fr/22523/2017_presentatie_fr.pdf |title=Situation secteur de communications \u00e9lectroniques et TV 2017|publisher=Bipt.be |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref>, there are still 12% of the houses in Belgium that have broadband services with a bandwidth of less than 30 Mbit/s. \n[[Proximus]] has started to deploy [[Hybrid Access Networks]]] by combining [[XDSL]] and LTE to address this problem <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proximus.com/en/news/tessares-proximus%E2%80%99-access-bonding-offering-faster-internet-large-sparsely-populated-rural-areas|title=Tessares-Proximus' Access Bonding - offering faster Internet in large, sparsely populated rural areas \u2013 now successfully qualified to move to a countrywide deployment phase.|author=Proximus Press release|date=2017-05-16|access-date=7 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705233839/https://www.proximus.com/en/news/tessares-proximus%E2%80%99-access-bonding-offering-faster-internet-large-sparsely-populated-rural-areas|archive-date=5 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>.\n\n==== Bulgaria ====\n{{Main|Internet in Bulgaria}}\n\nIn March 2009, the \u201cNational Program for Development of Broadband Access in Republic of [[Bulgaria]]\u201d, issued by the State Agency for Information Technologies and Communication, set the following targets by the year 2013:<ref>ITU WSIS Stocktaking Report 2012\nhttp://www.itu.int/wsis/stocktaking/docs/reports/S-POL-WSIS.REP-2012-PDF-E.pdf</ref>\n\n* 100% coverage of population at 10 Mbit/s in large cities\n* 90% coverage of population at 6 Mbit/s in medium cities\n* 30% coverage of population at 1 Mbit/s in rural areas (90% mobile broadband)\n\n==== Croatia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Croatia}}\n\nThe [[Politics of Croatia|Government of the Republic of Croatia]] adopted on 13 October 2006 the Strategy for the development of broadband access to the Internet in the [[Republic of Croatia]] until 2008.

Therefore, an ambitious goal has been set to achieve the density level of at least 12 percent, i.e. to number at least 500,000 broadband connections until the end of 2008. In January 2009, the government declared success. However, accepting the fact that in the area of the development of broadband Internet, new challenges stand before the Republic of Croatia. The Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure and the Central State Administrative Office for e-Croatia have initiated the drafting of the new Strategy for the development of broadband access to the Internet which would define strategic goals for the forthcoming period.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120730222131/http://www.e-hrvatska.hr/sdu/en/e-hrv/vijest.html?h=/en/e-hrv/contentParagraph/011111111111]</ref>\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\n{{Main|Internet in the Czech Republic}}\n\nTo speed up the broadband network development and stimulate its use mainly by households and individuals, the [[Politics of the Czech Republic|Government]] adopted the \"National Broadband Access Policy\" in January 2005.

The first part of the study includes a proposal for a government resolution and the second part examines the reasoning behind the proposal topic by topic. The report proposes that the public sector introduce business subsidies to enterprises that upgrade the public telecommunications network into a condition that makes available to most all citizens by 2015 an optical fibre or cable network supporting 100 Mbit connections. Prior to this goal, the speed of the broadband connection included in the universal service obligation must be raised to an average of 1 Mbit/s by 31 December 2010 at the latest.\n\nIn order to finance the State contribution required for the target for 2015, it is proposed that certain radio frequencies coming up for allocation be auctioned. In the event that auction revenues are insufficient to cover the State's public aid for telecommunications infrastructure construction, the shortfall would be made up with a telecommunications network compensatory payment to be collected from telecommunications operators. The auction revenues and the compensatory payments could be entered as income and decisions on their use made either through the Budget or by means of a fund outside the Budget.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lvm.fi/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=57092&name=DLFE-4311.pdf |title=Making broadband available to everyone |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004235002/http://www.lvm.fi/c/document_library/get_file?folderId=57092&name=DLFE-4311.pdf |archive-date=4 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Finland]] has passed a law making access to broadband a legal right for Finnish citizens.

Following a broadband coverage mapping exercise to identify underserved areas and a competitive tendering process, a contract was awarded to \"[[Hutchison 3G|3]]\" (a [[Hutchison Whampoa]] company) in December 2008, to implement and operate the NBS. Under the contract, 3 will be required to provide services to all premises in the NBS area that want service.

The projects were implemented and co-financed by local governments and the [[Government of Latvia|central government]], with the majority of the funding provided by EU structural funds. Latvia has listed internet access and availability promotion as an activity eligible for EU structural funds for the 2007\u20132013 EU budgetary period, but this activity is not designed to target rural areas or specifically increase broadband deployment. However, given Latvia's severe economic decline and the associated budgetary issues, the outlook for additional projects in the future is grim.\n\nFalling budget revenues have significantly limited Latvia's ability to co-finance any EU projects. There are bureaucratic obstacles as well, since Latvia has not yet adopted guidelines and evaluation criteria necessary to launch this program. One reason behind this delay is the GOL plan to reprioritize the national list of activities eligible for EU money in response to the crisis, increasing funding to the export sector. Internet access is not viewed by Latvian authorities as a significant problem; therefore, an increase in funding to communication infrastructure projects is unlikely. Furthermore, Latvia has decided to divert the funds the European Commission allocated to expansion of broadband networks, as part of the [[2008 European Union stimulus plan|European Economic Recovery Plan]], to projects in the dairy sector.\n\n==== Lithuania ====\n{{Main|Internet in Lithuania}}\n\n;Rural Area Information Technology (RAIN) project\n;002 project\nThe Development Strategy of the Broadband Infrastructure of [[Lithuania]] for 2005\u20132010 was published in the official gazette on 31 December 2002. The Strategy goals are as follows: to create conditions for public administration institutions, bodies and individuals to obtain broadband access; to promote competition in the field of the Internet access provision on the market using public and private capital investments; to seek that the national social and economic growth would be influenced; to reduce the exclusion of the population in the territory of the country.\n\nWhen connecting public administration institutions and bodies to the broadband networks and creating an opportunity for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the population to use the broadband infrastructure and e-services all over the country's territory (especially in peripheral/uncompetitive locations where the level of use and development of wideband connection services is low), the following assessment criteria are important:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transp.lt/Default.aspx?Element=ViewArticle&Lang=EN&TopicID=215&ArticleID=1936 |title=Susisiekimo ministerija |publisher=Transp.lt |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n# By 1 January 2007{{When|date=December 2010}} in 50% of the country's territory to create an opportunity to connect to the available broadband networks for all small and medium-sized enterprises willing to do so as well as the population and to connect at least 40% of public administration institutions and bodies (i.e. educational institutions, libraries, health care institutions and bodies, etc.) to the broadband networks.\n# By 1 January 2008{{When|date=December 2010}} in 50% of the country's territory to create an opportunity to connect to the available broadband networks for all small and medium-sized enterprises willing to do so as well as the population and to connect at least 60% of public administration institutions and bodies to the wideband connection networks.\n# By 1 January 2009{{When|date=December 2010}} to connect 100% of public administration institutions and bodies (except for some diplomatic representations of the RepublicofLithuania abroad) to the broadband networks.\n# By 1 January 2010{{When|date=December 2010}} in 98% of the country's territory to create an opportunity to connect to the available broadband networks for all small and medium-sized enterprises willing to do so as well as the population.{{When|date=December 2010}}\n\n==== Netherlands ====\n{{Main|Internet in the Netherlands}}\n\nNederland BreedbandLand (NBL) is the independent national platform for the provision of aid and incentives to the social sectors for the 'better and smarter' use of broadband.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nederlandbreedbandland.nl/page/ |title=http://www.hollandtrade.com/vko/zoeken/ShowBouwsteen.asp?bstnum=685 |publisher=Nederlandbreedbandland.nl |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315173935/http://www.nederlandbreedbandland.nl/page/ |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main|Internet in Poland}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nNewspaper [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] writes that the [[Politics of Poland|Polish government]] has drafted a new law regulating broadband network deployments and will put it to a parliamentary vote in late October or early November.{{When|date=December 2010}} The law would, for example, require every multiresidential house in the country from 2010{{When|date=December 2010}} to be connected with fibre, define rules for local governments to invest in broadband in areas that are not viable for commercial roll-outs, as well as set a framework for using utility infrastructure to accommodate network equipment.

In order to boost the investment, the UKE has softened some of its policies upon the incumbent, most significantly in regard with vertical separation, which it has put on hold for the time being, and wholesale access fees, which it has reportedly offered to freeze for the next couple of years.\n\n==== Portugal ====\n{{Main|Internet in Portugal}}\n\nIn January 2009, [[Politics of Portugal|Portugal's government]] announced an 800-million-euro credit line for the roll-out of next-generation broadband networks in the country. Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]] announced the funding, saying he hoped the country's main telecoms operators would invest one billion euro to build NGNs during 2009. The credit line forms part of an agreement between the government and the operators [[Portugal Telecom]], [[ZON Multim\u00e9dia]], [[Sonae]]com, and ONI on the roll-out of fibre networks, and is the first step in a 2.18-billion-euro plan announced in December 2008 to boost the country's economy.\n\nPrime Minister Socrates said the credit line would pave the way for improvements in high-speed internet, television and voice services, adding: \"This is the launch of the first measure of the stimulus plan to combat the economic crisis.\"\n\n;Development Through Fibre\nPortugal's PM said he hoped the investment would allow up to 1.5 million homes and businesses to be connected to the new fibre networks. He added that the government has no preference regarding how the networks are rolled out by the operators, leaving them to reach a decision among themselves on whether single or multiple networks are constructed. Although the terms of the credit line have not been disclosed, they are likely to be highly favourable to the operators, and may represent a timely cash injection\u2014as the global economic crisis bites, operator spending in reined in and private investment sources dry up. Portugal's broadband market showed strong growth, not least due to widespread cable and DSL networks. ADSL2+ services are also available from alternative operators such as [[Vodafone]] and cable data speeds at up to 100 Mbit/s were trialled in 2007. The Portuguese government had set a goal of 50% home broadband penetration by 2010, and this latest investment should allow the operators to significantly surpass this target.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.communicationsdirectnews.com/do.php/140/33928?199 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090120070527/http://www.communicationsdirectnews.com/do.php/140/33928?199 |archive-date=20 January 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Romania ====\n{{Main|Internet in Romania}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn May 2009, while broadband Internet access increased by 30 percent last year, [[Romania]]'s penetration rate is still half that of the EU average. Both the newly reorganized National Authority for Administration and Regulations in Communications (ANCOM) and the renamed [[Ministry of Communications and Information Society (Romania)|Ministry of Communication and Information Society]] (MCIS) have repeatedly expressed interest in further expanding broadband access. To this end, MCIS issued a new broadband strategy for 2009 to 2015, but has yet to identify how to implement or fund the strategy. This cable responds to Department's reftel{{typo help inline|reason=similar to reflet|date=November 2019}} request for information on country broadband deployment initiatives.\n\nIn his first press conference on 9 April, new ANCOM President Catalin Marinescu stated his main goal would be to increase the number of broadband Internet connections. Due to the expansion of the 3G network, mobile access connections to the Internet reached 2.7 million users in 2008, which is almost double the number in 2007. Despite a 30 percent increase in access in 2008, Romania's broadband penetration is still only about 11.7 percent, which is less than half of the EU average of 22.9 percent.\n\nANCOM suggestions for increasing broadband deployment in Romania include:\n\n# Review local loop access conditions that were unsuccessfully regulated in 2003;\n# stimulate operators with existing 3G licenses to expand services and/or reorganize the 3G band in order to grant one or two additional licenses to companies (there are currently four 3G licensed operators in Romania);\n# reissue a WiMax tender for the 3.5\u20133.7&nbsp;GHz band. A 2008 attempt to grant WiMax licenses failed due to the high cost. ANCOM hopes the Government will lower the cost in order to increase commercial interest in the coming year.\n\nA precondition for accessing EU structural funds in this area is the adoption of a national broadband strategy. The MCIS's 2009\u20132015 strategy for broadband wireless access establishes an inter-ministerial working group responsible for implementation of infrastructure projects for broadband service expansion. Additionally, Minister of Communication [[Gabriel Sandu]] claims he will identify other financing sources, such as crisis funds, governmental funds and private funds to increase broadband deployment to rural areas.\n\n==== Slovenia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Slovenia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 2004, [[Slovenia]] issued the Strategy for Development of Broadband Networks, effective 2004\u20132006. The main principles included:\n\n# The primary role of the market and competition in broadband development;\n# formulating measures to activate the public sector, especially where private sector interest is lacking;\n# expanding broadband connections in public administration and stimulating e-government services;\n# stimulating competition between different types of infrastructure and services.\n\nSlovenia is preparing a new strategy for development of broadband networks, which will focus on simulating of private sector development of rural and scarcely populated areas.\n\n==== Spain ====\n{{Main|Internet in Spain}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nSince 2005, the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade has granted financial aids to operators in order to encourage their investments in areas where there would unlikely have been any broadband deployment. Two main programmes compose the Spanish strategy to provide broadband Internet access to rural and isolated areas:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandaancha.es/Englishinformation/Paginas/BroadbandEnglish.aspx |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220204844/http://www.bandaancha.es/Englishinformation/Paginas/BroadbandEnglish.aspx |archivedate=20 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n* National Programme for Broadband roll-out in rural and remote areas: PEBA (2005\u20132008)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandaancha.es/Englishinformation/Paginas/PEBAInformation.aspx |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220205235/http://www.bandaancha.es/Englishinformation/Paginas/PEBAInformation.aspx |archivedate=20 December 2009 }}</ref>\n* Avanza Infrastructures Programme (2008\u20132012)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bandaancha.es/Englishinformation/Paginas/Avanzainformation.aspx |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220204129/http://www.bandaancha.es/Englishinformation/Paginas/Avanzainformation.aspx |archivedate=20 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to ensure consecution of the programme objectives, not duplication of investments and not distortion of competition, specific service and operative requirements were required to both projects and beneficiary operators.\n\nService requirements consisted on providing broadband access with a minimum download speed and a maximum monthly fee. Additionally, the program operative requirements consisted on:\n\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-latin\">\n# Technological neutrality so that any type of broadband technology could be deployed and to avoid technology obsolescence;\n# the duty of the beneficiaries to open up the financed networks to competition;\n# infrastructure investments in well-defined and not serviced areas in order to avoid duplicative investments.\n</ol>\nTaking into account cabled technologies such as DSL are distance sensitive, and generally only feasible within a few miles of the nearest central office switch, PEBA projects were not limited to a single technology. At present, several technological solutions (ADSL, WiMAX, Satellite and [[Hybrid fibre-coaxial|HFC]]) are being used to provide broadband access to the PEBA population centres, depending on their geographic features, roll\u2013out dates and available technology.\n\nFollowing Peba achievements and within the Avanza Infrastructures Program, the Ministry has continued working to increase broadband coverage in very small population centres. Additionally and taken into account advances in technology and the need not only to provide broadband access but also to improve the service quality and speed, the objective was also to improve bandwidth and network capacity provided by telcos at rural areas. Two action lines compose the broadband strategy under this funding program:\n\n:F1: Projects intended to deploy access infrastructures in order to satisfy the demand for broadband connection from population in isolated and rural areas.\n:F2: Projects intended to improve speed and capacity of rural backbone networks\n\nF1 action line projects will be based mainly on wireless broadband access technologies such as: [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]], WIMAX and Satellite although some of the beneficiary operators are already planning to provide ADSL connection at some population centres. F2 projects will mostly improve transport networks by means of fibre optics and WiMAX radio links.\n\nOn 15 October 2009, [[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Spain's Ministry of Industry]] has opened a public consultation on extending the concept of universal service to cover broadband access. The consultation concerns topics such as the minimum speed, the use of wireless technologies for broadband provision, related pricing models, and the schedule for service implementation.\n\n;Significance\nAt the moment, the mandate for universal service covers narrowband internet access, but as speeds of such services have become increasingly inadequate for responding to typical user needs, the government is now assessing whether connection over broadband should be defined as a legal right. As of end-June this year, according to regulator CMT, accesses defined as narrowband accounted for 2.4% of all 9.547 million internet subscriptions, against 5.2% a year earlier; in meanwhile, of the broadband accesses those at speeds below 1 Mbit/s accounted represented 0.4% of the total. [[Global Insight|IHS Global Insight]]'s view is that the allocation of lower frequency bands such as 800 and 900&nbsp;MHz for data services will be in the main role if the Spanish government wants to bring broadband to every citizen. Thus far, incumbent Telef\u00f3nica has used WiMAX and satellite connections to live up its universal service mandate in some of the more remote areas of the country, yet we believe that by expanding its mobile broadband network by using the lower frequencies it could achieve the same more cost-efficiently.\n\n==== Sweden ====\n{{Main|Internet in Sweden}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe goal of [[Sweden]]'s Information Technology Policy is that Sweden should be a sustainable information society for all. This implies an accessible information society with a modern infrastructure and IT services of public benefit, so as to simplify everyday life and give people in every part of the country a better [[quality of life]].\n\nIT should contribute to a better quality of life and help improve and simplify everyday life for people and companies, but it should also be used to promote sustainable growth. An effective and secure physical infrastructure for IT, with high transmission capacity, should be available in all parts of the country so as to give people access to, among other things, interactive public e-services.\n\nFor broadband, the Swedish and European IT policy aims to increase accessibility to an infrastructure with capacity for broadband transmission. Broadband among other things, promotes economic growth by creating new services and opening up new investment and employment opportunities. The objective is broadband for all households (permanent housing) and business and public operations. According to the [[Swedish Post and Telecom Authority]], 'broadband' in this objective, refers to connections that can be upgraded to a transmission rate downstream of at least 2 Mb per second.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2007, Sweden's broadband support program included:\n\n* Total state governmental funding 817 million $ (5.25 billion SEK)\n* Total investment: Government 51%; Municipalities 11%; Operators 30%; EU structural funds 7%; Regional policy funds 1%\n* Concentrating on rural and other areas where the market will not supply infrastructure\n* Open procurement process\n* Requirement that networks should be operator-neutral\n* 85% of investments used for new infrastructure\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{Main|Internet in the United Kingdom}}\n\nThe United Kingdom issued its \"Digital Britain\" report in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/6216.aspx |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512203732/http://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/6216.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 May 2010 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; Department for Culture Media and Sport \u2013 the report |publisher=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>'''The Universal Service Commitment.''' More than one in 10 households today cannot enjoy a 2Mbps connection. We will correct this by providing universal service by 2012. It has a measure of future-proofing so that, as the market deploys next-generation broadband, we do not immediately face another problem of exclusion. The USC is also a necessary step if we are to move towards digital switchover in the delivery of more and more of our public services. The Universal Service Commitment will be delivered by a mix of technologies:\nDSL, fibre to the street cabinet, wireless and possibly satellite infill. It will be funded from \u00a3200m from direct public funding,2 enhanced by five other sources: commercial gain through tender contract and design, contributions in kind from private partners, contributions from other public sector organisations in the nations and regions who benefit from the increased connectivity, the consumer directly for in-home upgrading, and the value of wider coverage obligations on mobile operators arising from the wider mobile spectrum package. The Commitment will be delivered through the Network Design and Procurement Group, with a CEO appointed in the Autumn. We will also discuss with the BBC Trust the structure which gives them appropriate visibility in the delivery process of the use being made of the Digital Switchover Help Scheme underspend, which will be realised in full by 2012.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>'''The Next Generation Final Third project.''' Next generation broadband networks offer not just conventional high definition video entertainment and games (which because of this country's successful satellite platform are less significant drivers here than in some other markets) but also more revolutionary applications. These will include tele-presence, allowing for much more flexible working patterns, e-healthcare in the home and for small businesses the increasing benefits of access to cloud computing which substantially cuts costs and allows much more rapid product and service innovation. Next-generation broadband will enable innovation and economic benefits we cannot today predict. First generation broadband provided a boost to GDP of some 0.5%\u20131.0% a year. In recent months the UK has seen an energetic, market-led roll-out of next generation fixed broadband. By this Summer speeds of 50Mbps and above will be available to all households covered by the Virgin Media Ltd's national cable network: some 50% of UK homes. Following decisions by the regulator, Ofcom, which have enhanced regulatory certainty, BT Group plc has been encouraged by the first year capital allowances measures in Budget 2009 and the need to respond competitively to accelerate their plans for the mix of fibre to the cabinet and fibre to the home. BT's enhanced network will cover the first 1,000,000 homes in their network. The \u00a3100m Yorkshire Digital Region programme approved in Budget 2009 will also provide a useful regional testbed for next generation digital networks.</blockquote>\n\nIn August 2009 the UK Government published its Digital Britain Implementation Plan setting out the government's roadmap for the rollout of its plans mentioned above.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512151247/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/publications/6310.aspx Read Article] or [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512160421/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/DB_ImplementationPlanv6_Aug09.pdf Download PDF].</ref>\n\n=== Other European countries ===\n\n==== Norway ====\n{{Main|Internet in Norway}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nAccording to the statement of the [[Party platform|political platform]] for the parties in Government7 dated 13 October 2005, the level of ambition for broadband rollout is to rise. The rollout of broadband throughout the entire country offers great potential to the business sector in the form of development and the setting up of more businesses, while reducing the difficulties of great distances. The tangible objectives of Government policy include:\n\n* Broadband should be available throughout Norway by the end of 2007\n* Unreasonable geographical price differences for broadband connection should not exist\n* Government funding will contribute to broadband rollout in those areas where rollout is not ensured by market players.\n\n==== Russia ====\n{{Main|Internet in Russia}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 17 September 2009, Deputy Prime Minister [[Sergey Sobyanin]] has indicated that a special government commission will meet in October{{When|date=December 2010}} to discuss the development of broadband services in Russia, reports Prime-Tass. Issues to be considered will include the enhancement of broadband access quality and the increase of data-transfer speeds. Sobyanin also stated that the government would allocate 10 billion roubles (US$326.7 million) towards the development of various high-tech projects in 2010, aimed at carrying out technological upgrades in various sectors of the Russian economy. Earlier in the week Communications and Mass Media Minister [[Igor Shchyogolev]] stated that the government viewed the construction of main communications lines and the development of broadband and digital TV services as the top priorities of the telecoms industry.\n\n;Significance\nThe words of the deputy prime minister and communications minister highlight the importance with which the development of broadband services in the country is viewed. Broadband has taken over from mobile as the sector of highest growth potential in Russia, with the Communications Ministry reporting a fourfold increase in internet traffic in 2008. The market is heterogeneous, with no single dominant operator, but instead a number of players employing a variety of technologies. Although uptake has typically been centred on the economic hubs of the capital Moscow and [[St Petersburg]], operators are increasingly expanding towards the regions for further opportunities. With operators continuing to invest in the broadband sector, subscriber uptake growing, and now increasing signals of interest from the government, IHS Global Insight expects the sector to continue to grow healthily in the short and medium terms.\n\n==== Switzerland ====\n{{Main|Internet in Switzerland}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] Federal Office of Communications (ComCom) has revealed that round table discussions on the deployment of fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) networks are producing concrete results. According to the regulator the major players are now in agreement on uniform technical standards, meaning that there are no technical barriers to the rapid expansion of the fibre network. A consensus has also been reached on coordination, which will prevent the parallel construction of new networks by laying multiple fibres in every building (known as the multiple fibre model). At the same time the participants at the round table have agreed that all providers must have access to the fibre-optic network under the same conditions, so as to protect end-users' freedom of choice. The participants drew up further recommendations for standardised network access by services. Thanks to an open interface, service providers will enjoy network access to customers at all times via network operators. If, at a later date, the customer opts for a different service provider on the same fibre-optic network, the switch will be possible without any technical complications.\n\nThe roundtable discussions involve cable network operators, telecoms companies and electricity utilities. Further roundtables and working groups will be held to clarify points. ComCom will also examine whether new regulatory measures are needed to govern FTTH deployment, with the aim of reporting to parliament by mid-2010 at the latest.\n\n== Africa ==\n<!-- [[Broadband Internet access in Africa]] and [[Broadband internet access in africa]] redirect here -->\n\n=== Botswana ===\n{{Main|Internet in Botswana}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nFollowing the further liberalization of the [[Botswana]] telecommunications sector in 2004, the Government embarked on a new licensing structure in 2006. That action was designed to move the country from the pre-existing licensing framework, which made the distinction between the various telecoms services, to a service-neutral structure with the view of accommodating technological convergence.\n\nCurrently, the only operator offering fixed-line broadband services is state-owned [[Botswana Telecommunications Corporation]] (BTC),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btc.bw/ |title=Botswana Telecommunications Corporations |publisher=Btc.bw |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> which has launched ADSL services. However, the larger ISPs are also rolling out broadband wireless networks, mainly in [[Gaborone]] (the capital), to serve corporate customers in particular. Mobile operator [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]] launched its [[Orange Livebox|broadband wireless service]] in June 2008 using a WiMAX network in Gaborone. The total number of broadband subscribers increased to an estimated 3,500 in 2007, up from 1,800 in 2006 and 1,600 in 2005, with broadband comprising a growing proportion of total internet accounts.\n\nBTC offers a range of data services including Frame Relay, ISDN, ADSL, MPLS and a broadband wireless service known as Wireless FastConnect. The data market has been liberalized, with ISPs now holding value-added network service (VANS) provider licenses. BTC enjoyed a monopoly over international bandwidth until February 2001 when the regulator began issuing international data gateway licenses. BTC's international bandwidth reached the 200-Mbit/s mark during 2008, some 90% of which (180 Mbit/s) was supplied via cross-border fiber networks to neighboring countries and 10% (20 Mbit/s) by satellite.\n\nDuring 2004, BTC began the deployment of ADSL and a domestic two-way VSAT network for areas beyond the reach of terrestrial infrastructure.\n\nDuring September 2008, BTC completed the roll-out of the [[A2 highway (Botswana)|Trans-Kalahari]] fiber-optic project, connecting Botswana to the neighboring countries of [[Namibia]] and [[Zambia]]. The 2,000-kilometre system was built in three parts: phase 1 runs from [[Jwaneng]] through [[Ghanzi]] to Mamuno (the border with Namibia); phase 2 runs from Ghanzi via [[Maun, Botswana|Maun]] to [[Orapa]]; and the phase 3 runs from Sebina via [[Nata, Botswana|Nata]], [[Kasane]] [[Ngoma, Zambia|to Ngoma]] (the border with Zambia). The network is designed to provide onward connectivity to submarine cables, removing the dependence on transiting through South Africa to reach the [[SAT-3/WASC (cable system)|Sat-3/WASC]] and S.A.F.E (Southern Africa Far East) [[Submarine communications cable|submarine cable systems]].\n\nBTC is a signatory to three submarine cable projects ([[EASSy (cable system)|EASSy]], WAFS and AWCC) and the government is in tripartite discussions with [[Angola]] and Namibia to assist each other in realizing the most effective means of achieving connectivity to these cable systems:\n\n* East Africa Submarine System (EASSy), which will run along the eastern coast of Africa from [[Port Sudan]] ([[Sudan]]) to [[Mtunzini]] (South Africa) via [[Mombasa]] ([[Kenya]]), [[Dar es Salaam]] ([[Tanzania]]) and [[Maputo]] ([[Mozambique]]).\n* West Africa Festoon System (WAFS), the planned cable that will run along the western coast of Africa from Nigeria through [[Gabon]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, [[Angola]] and possibly Namibia.\n* Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC), planned to run along the western coast of Africa from South Africa and Namibia to the United Kingdom. The proposed AWCC was replaced by the West Africa Submarine Cable (WASC), which awarded a supply contract to [[Alcatel-Lucent]] in April 2009.\n\n=== Egypt ===\n{{Main|Internet in Egypt}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nBroadband access, mainly the DSL variety, is still in its infancy. Local loop unbundling for DSL access was introduced in April 2002 to kick-start broadband uptake, but real growth occurred only after a [[Politics of Egypt|government]] initiative in May 2004 that mandated a 50% tariff cut for unbundling. As part of the government's e-Readiness initiative, a strategy of public-private partnership is being aggressively pursued in the Internet sector to accelerate Internet and broadband uptake.\n\n=== Ghana ===\n{{Main|Internet in Ghana}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 23 July 2009, the [[Politics of Ghana|government of Ghana]] has signed a US$150 million contract with Chinese equipment manufacturer [[Huawei|Huawei Technologies]] for the supply of advanced telecoms infrastructure to ensure broadband internet access countrywide within the next two years. The Minister of Communications, [[Haruna Iddrisu]], told delegates at a conference on [[Business process outsourcing]] (BPO) that the infrastructure would link internet [[Point of Presence]] (POP) in all district capitals under the government's ICT Backbone Development Programme. The minister added that the government was committed to ensuring it developed the human resources needed to promote the country as a prospect for BPO companies, and said Ghana was working hard to ensure the legislative regime was right encourage inward investment under the e-legislation programme. 'During the year the Ministry of Communications will also facilitate the development of additional legislations in the area of data protection and intellectual property for investors in the area of data capturing and management to operate within the confines of international guidelines and rules,' he said. His words were echoed by Vice President [[John Dramani Mahama]] who stressed Ghana's commitment to developing the nation's ICT backbone capabilities. 'In addition to the SAT3 connectivity, [[GLO-1 (cable system)|GLO-1]] and MaiOne will commence the construction of two additional landing stations by the end of this year to take care of the issues of bandwidth redundancy,' he said.\n\nIn May 2007, the government of Ghana launched the \"Wiring Ghana\" project, a $250 million nationwide 4,000 kilometer fiber-optic backbone project that promises to dramatically increase Ghana's broadband bandwidth supply, reportedly to a capacity of STM-16 nationwide. The government's goal is to provide an open-access, nationwide broadband connectivity to boost economic development. As of May 2008, Phase I of the project that covers the south and mid-country had been completed. Rollout of the second and final phase is underway and is slated to be completed by December 2009.\n\nGhana's project will also provide fiber-optic connections with the neighboring countries of Burkina Faso to the north and Togo to the east.\n\nGhana's broadband market, divided between ADSL and wireless broadband services, was small at the end of 2008, a total of about 26,500 subscribers, ADSL 53% and wireless WiFi/WiMax 47%.\n\n=== Kenya ===\n{{Main|Internet in Kenya}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn May 2009,{{When|date=December 2010}} [[Kenya]] will revolutionize its telecom industry when it initiates its first fiber optic internet connection on 27 June. This broadband connection will vastly improve the quality of internet access to Kenya and contiguous landlocked countries. With increased internet capacity, the fiber will improve local bandwidth quality and potentially decrease communication costs, as it complements the existing and widely used satellite communication networks. The increased bandwidth capabilities will improve the competitiveness of existing businesses, create growth in new industries such as knowledge-based businesses and business process outsourcing, and significantly increase access to information for end-users, schools, and universities. The [[Politics of Kenya|Government of Kenya]] (GOK) expects foreign investment in the sector to hit $10 billion in 2009. Septel will report how this connection and other broadband initiatives will affect rural and underserved areas.\n\nFrom Patrick Boateng's June 2009 report: on broadband, the Kenyan government has recently taken several steps to boost the country's future international bandwidth by committing to several planned submarine cable projects. As an example, in September 2006, Kenya's cabinet decided, after further delays to the proposed East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy), to proceed with its plan to build its own submarine cable, the [[TEAMS (cable system)|East Africa Marine System]] (TEAMS) Ltd. In November 2006, the government signed a [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) with [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]'s fixed-line incumbent, [[Emirates Telecommunications Corporation|Etisalat]], to build a submarine cable from Mombasa to [[Fujairah|Al Fujairah]] in the UAE. In a February 2007 Kenyan government contract award to U.S. Company, [[Tyco International|Tyco Telecommunications]], the company conducted an undersea survey for the project. In October 2007, after the completion of the marine survey, Alcatel-Lucent won the bid to build the cable, and service is expected to begin at the end of the third quarter 2009.{{When|date=December 2010}}\n\nIn 2008, Kenya adopted a National ICT Policy and enacted the Kenya Communications Amendment Act. Backed by a new ICT Sector Master Plan (2008\u20132012) and a projected budget of $812.5 million, the main goals of this move are to develop regulations that will provide an enabling environment for leveraging the new broadband capacity, and to improve the ICT sector in general.\n\nMeanwhile, a third submarine cable funded by South African and other investors, [[SEACOM (African cable system)|Sea Cable System]] (SEACOM), landed in Mombasa in May 2009 and is expected to be operational by July 2009. EASSy is slowly in progress and is expected to land in Mombasa in 2010. Also on the horizon are two additional submarine cables, [[Orange S.A.|Orange]]'s Lion which will run from Mombasa to [[Madagascar]] to [[Mauritius]] and [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]]; and FLAG Telecom NGN System II cable.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\n{{Main|Internet in Nigeria}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 6 March 2009, the [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] (NCC) has partnered with Nigerian WiMAX operator ipNX to bring broadband access to all 36 states in the country through the 'State Accelerated Bandwidth Initiative' (SABI). Ifeanyi Amah, executive director of ipNX, commented: 'The move to empower Nigerians with broadband internet access started almost two years ago. Our intention is to take our products and services to other regions. Our commitment in that direction can be seen through our partnership with NCC on SABI'.\n\nThe project has been long-delayed, having been postponed because of government red tape and a lack of budget. According to TeleGeography's GlobalComms database, at the start of 2009 three companies were given letters of intent from the NCC: ipNX, MTN and a Wi-Fi alliance of several ISPs. The first phase of the project will cover the 36 state capitals, before being extended to government buildings.\n\nNigeria as a whole can be classified as unserved. The Project arm of SABI consisted of a reverse bid process where broadband providers were invited to state the minimum subsidy each provider required to deploy broadband coverage to all 37 state capital cities in the Country and the three lowest bidders would be appointed.\n\nThe subsidies were limited to:\n\n# [[Customer-premises equipment|CPE]]s for the first 3,000 subscribers per city. (to enable a critical mass for each city sustainable network)\n# Bandwidth supply for the first one year.\n\nThe process is complete and three providers have been selected and approved by the [[Politics of Nigeria|Federal Government]] and they are IPNX, MTN, and NAIJA-WIFI (The latter being a consortium of about 15\u201320 ISPs.) One of the providers has started deployment and completed [[Kano]] (capital of [[Kano State]] in Northern Nigeria) which was launched in May. They are scheduled to launch in [[Ibadan]], capital of [[Oyo State]] next month.{{When|date=December 2010}}\n\nCurrently, the broadband market in Nigeria is in its infancy and is predominantly wireless, rather than wireline, and is dominated by the fixed wireless access operators. Consequently, the market structure has been determined more by the licensing and regulation of the radio spectrum space rather than by unbundling of the local loop. [[Very small aperture terminal|VSAT]] remains the predominant form of broadband Internet access. It is estimated that 51.1% of Internet users are connected by VSAT, 24% by broadband wireless, 3.4% by DSL, 9.3% via dial-up, 8.7% by cable/satellite and the remainder by Wi-Fi and leased lines.\n\nThe introduction of a unified licensing regime from February 2006 is having far-reaching consequences by increasing the scope of the operating licenses of different fixed-line and mobile operators.\n\nAt least two Nigerian ISPs have expanded services into other countries in West Africa. Intercellular, one of the [[Public Telecommunications Operator|PTO]]s, has been granted a license to operate in [[Sierra Leone]]. It has also applied for licenses in [[Benin]], Chad, [[Guinea]], Liberia, and [[Mali]]. Meanwhile, Hyperia, a leading Nigerian ISP, has announced the launch of two new wireless broadband services: a new WiMAX service in [[Port Harcourt]] and a two-way broadband VSAT service. Hyperia awarded a contract to Navini Networks, and has now launched the 3.5&nbsp;GHz WiMAX service in Port Harcourt.\n\nThe ISP also awarded a contract to [[Gilat Satellite Networks]], to provide a SkyEdge broadband satellite hub and several hundred VSAT terminals. The VSAT network uses both [[C band (IEEE)|C band]] and {{Ku band}}, and its hub and will be deployed at Hyperia's network operations center in London (U.K.). The VSAT network will enable Hyperia to expand its services in West Africa and to provide multiple services including broadband IP, telephony, and [[videoconferencing]].\n\nTransmission networks are the crux for the whole Nigerian telecommunications sector. New mobile operators, fixed-wireless access (FWA) operators, and ISPs require a robust national transmission backbone to link base stations, mobile switches, and POPs together with long-haul upstream bandwidth. In the absence of a reliable backbone, satellite has provided transmission and backhaul capacity, as well as international connectivity. [[NITEL]] has access to Sat-3/WASC and is gradually upgrading its national transmission capacity. [[Globacom]] launched its \"Glo Xpress\" long-distance transmission service in July 2005, and private operators continue to invest heavily in the roll-out of their own microwave and wireless networks.\n\nThe regulator Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has liberalized the long-distance market, and in addition to the two national carriers, there are now seven national [[long-distance operator]] (NLDOs) that are investing in the roll-out of fiber backbones in different regions of the country. The mobile operators have also deployed their own independent national fiber and microwave backbones, and the unified access license granted to the mobile operators would allow them to commercialize these backbones. A key factor has been the entry of foreign operators into this market, through the acquisition of Nigerian operators.\n\nNigeria has several Gbit/s of international bandwidth, of which NITEL was only serving some 310 Mbit/s using the Sat-3/WASC cable, even though this only represents a fraction of the capacity that it owns on the cable. The balance of Nigeria's international bandwidth is provided entirely by satellite. Of up to six new submarine cables that would land in Nigeria, contracts have been awarded for two: Glo-1, and Main-1 (the others include AWCC, WAFS, Infinity, and Uhurunet). Glo-1 is expected to enter into service in 2009 and Main-1 from May 2010. In the medium term, the introduction of new submarine cables and national backbones linking Lagos to inland cities and towns will squeeze satellite operators, which have met the demand for services and filled the vacuum for data infrastructure.\n\nFollowing is a list of key broadband networks underway:\n\n* '''National Carriers:''' Both national fixed-line operators NITEL and Globacom, and leading national mobile operators, MTN and Zain, are all rolling out their own fiber-optic network infrastructure.\n* '''Alheri Engineering Co Ltd:''' Alheri Engineering, which was awarded one of the 3G licenses, has a two-pronged strategy. First, it will provide a carriers' carrier service to other operators, and plans to roll out a fiber transmission network in three phases. The first phase runs from Benin to Warri, the second from Benin to Port Harcourt, and the third from Aba to Jos. The second prong is to offer 3G services, and in May 2007 the company submitted a bid for the fourth mobile operator M-Tel.\n* '''Backbone Connectivity Network Ltd (BCN):''' BCN began the roll-out of fiber backbone in the northern states of Nigeria in July 2006. The first phase involves the roll-out of 700 kilometers of fiber from Abuja (the federal capital) to Kano via Kaduna and Zaria. The second phase will form a ring running from Kano via Katsina, Malumfashi, Funtua, Zaria, Abuja, Akwanga, Jos, Bauchi, Gombe, Biu, Yola, Bamboa, Maiduguri, Damaturu, Potaskum, Azare, and Dutse back to Kano. The third phase will run from Sokoto to Abuja via Birnin Kebbi, Kamba, Yelwa Yauri, Kontagora, Bida, and Minna.\n* '''Multi-Links Telecommunications Co Ltd (MLTC):''' Multi-Links, which was acquired by South African incumbent Telkom SA in March 2007, is deploying a fiber network in the south-west of the country, and has a fiber backbone running from Lagos to Abuja. Multi-links had deployed some 2,500 kilometers of fiber-optic network by mid-2008, completed a metro Ethernet ring in Lagos, and will roll out Ethernet rings in Kano, Kaduna and the Niger Delta region.\n* '''Phase3 Telecom:''' Phase3 Telecom won a 15-year concession in March 2006 to operate the fiber-optic cables strung over the high-voltage electricity transmission network of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) in the west of the country. The current fiber network included in the concession is some 1,500 kilometers in length, including a 900-kilometre stretch from Lagos to the federal capital, Abuja (via Ibadan, Oshogbo, Jebba, Shiriro, and Minna), and the operator plans to expand this to 3,000 kilometers over an 18-month period. Phase3 Telecom plans to wholesale service and provide long-distance carrier services to other licensed operators, including mobile operators, private telecommunication operators, ISPs, and others. In December 2008, Phase 3 entered into a deal facilitated by the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) to extend its carrier network to Benin, Togo, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, and Senegal using the high-voltage power transmission lines in these ECOWAS states. According to the Phase 3 Telecom's CEO [[Stanley Jegede]], the project is part of ECOWAS' Intelcom II program to interconnect West African countries by fiber-optic networks.\n* '''Suburban Telecoms:''' Suburban Telecoms has formed a joint venture with Ocean and Oil Holdings (OOH) Ltd to deploy a fiber MAN along a gas pipeline currently being deployed in Lagos by Gaslink. Suburban awarded a contract to Huawei and ATC that covers the deployment of 3,500 kilometers of fiber-optic cable. Suburban Telecoms has ambitions to become not just an MAN in Lagos, but also in other major Nigerian cities. The operator has a three-phased approach: in the first phase, it will connect major cities including Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja, Kano, Kaduna, Benin, Makurdi, Enugu, Onitsha, and Port Harcourt; in the second and third phases it will connect secondary population centers between these cities, and then extensions to other cities after that.\n* '''Victoria Garden City Communications Ltd (VGC Communications):''' VGC had a customer base of 20,000 in 2007, and operates a fiber MAN in Lagos, where it has laid some 120 kilometers of fiber-optic cables connecting the suburb of Victoria Garden City with Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Ikeja, Marina, Costain, and MayfairGardens.\n* '''Submarine Cables:''' In addition to the Sat-3/WASC submarine cable that lands at Lagos, contracts have been awarded for at least two more cables. NITEL retains exclusivity on access to Sat-3/WASC, and so the introduction of competition is expected to increase capacity dramatically and drive down prices.\n* '''Glo-1:''' Globacom, the SNO and mobile operator, announced in August 2008 that its Glo-1 submarine cable, which will run from the United Kingdom to Lagos and Port Harcourt (Nigeria), was \"nearing completion\" and would be finished by May 2009. Alcatel-Lucent began laying the Glo-1 cable from Bude in May 2007 and by October 2007 it had been deployed as far as Senegal. In August 2008, Globacom said that the final phase is due to begin shortly and will see the remaining section of cable laid from Lagos northwards to reach the other half of the cable in Senegal. The 9,330&nbsp;km submarine cable will have a capacity of 32 STM-64 circuits (totaling 318.4 Gbit/s). A dedicated link will also be leased through the trans-Atlantic Apollo 2 cable from Cornwall (U.K.) to the United States. Globacom had initially secured access to Sat-3/WASC through a leasing agreement with NITEL, but abandoned this and in August 2004 unveiled a plan to build its own private submarine cable, called Glo-1, from Lagos to the United Kingdom.\n* '''Main-1:''' Main Street Technologies, a Nigerian company, announced in April 2008 that it had awarded a supply contract to Tyco Telecommunications to build its Main One submarine cable. The 14,000-kilometre cable has a capacity of 1.28 Tbit/s and will be built in two phases that are both scheduled to be completed in May 2010: phase 1 will connect Nigeria, Ghana, and Portugal, and phase 2 will connect to Angola and South Africa. The Main One Cable is a private system that will provide open access to regional telecom operators and ISPs.\n* '''Other submarine cables:''' At least five other cables are planned to land in Nigeria. The Africa West Coast Cable (AWCC) would run from South Africa to Europe via Nigeria, the West African Festoon System (WAFS) would run from Angola to Nigeria, connecting those countries that do not have Sat-3 landing points, the Infinity Worldwide Group of Companies plans a West African cable that would include Nigeria, NEPAD plans a cable, called Uhurunet, which would encircle the whole continent and have a landing point in Nigeria, and the proposed ACE (Africa Coast to Europe) cable would run from Gabon to France via Nigeria and 19 other African countries.\n\n=== South Africa ===\n{{Main|Internet in South Africa}}\n{{Very long|section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe [[Politics of South Africa|government]] passed the Electronic Communications Act in 2006 and is dramatically restructuring the sector towards a converged framework, converting vertically integrated licenses previously granted to PSTN, mobile, USAL, PTN and VANS operators into new Electronic Communications Network Services (ECNS), Electronic Communications Services (ECS), or broadcasting licenses. In January 2009, the [[Independent Communications Authority of South Africa]] (ICASA) granted ECS and ECNS licenses to over 500 VANS operators.\n\nThe South African market is in the process of being dramatically restructured, moving away from old-style, vertically integrated segments under the 1996 Telecommunications Act and 2001 Telecommunications Amendment Act towards horizontal service layers, and the new-style licensing regime is being converted to accommodate this. This process involves the conversion of pre-existing licenses into new Individual or Class Electronic Communications Network Services (ECNS), Electronic Communications Services (ECS), or broadcasting licenses. Licenses are also required for radio frequency spectrum, except for very low power devices.\n\nICASA granted ECNS licenses during December 2007 to seven new under-serviced area licenses (USAL) operators. The new licensees include PlatiTel, Ilembe Communications, Metsweding Telex, Dinaka Telecoms, Mitjodi Telecoms, and Nyakatho Telecoms.\n\nSouth Africa had an estimated 6 million internet users in 2008 and the number of fixed (wireless and wireline) broadband subscribers is estimated at 750,000. [[Telkom SA|Telkom]] reported 491,774 ADSL subscribers (Q3 2008), with the remainder using wireless broadband networks.\n\nSouth Africa's total international bandwidth reached the 10 Gbit/s mark during 2008, and its continued increase is being driven primarily by the uptake of broadband and lowering of tariffs. Three new submarine cable projects will soon bring more capacity to South Africa from 2009\u2014the SEACOM cable is expected to enter service in June 2009 and supply contracts have been awarded for both the EASSy and WACS cables.\n\nWhile the internet user base increased to an estimated 6 million in 2008, the growth curve of paying internet accounts is recognized to be flattening. Meanwhile, the number of broadband subscribers is estimated to have grown quickly to reach about 750,000, split between Telkom's ADSL service (491,774 subscribers by 30 September 2008), and broadband wireless services provided by WBS, [[Sentech]] and others. Dial-up subscribers are migrating to broadband, and then escalating to higher-bandwidth packages as they become available.\n\nThe South African market is split into two main tiers: top-tier internet access providers; and downstream retail ISPs. ISPs are licensed as value-added network service (VANS) providers, although under the Electronic Communications Act of 2006, these licenses were converted in January 2009 to individual or class electronic communication service (ECS) licenses. All domestic ISPs gain international connectivity through one of the internet access providers: SAIX (Telkom), Neotel, Verizon Business, The Internet Solution, MTN Network Solutions, DataPro and Posix Systems.\n\nFollowing the deregulation of the VANS industry in South Africa, a number of leading operators have diversified from being a top-tier ISP to becoming a converged communications service provider offering a range of voice and data services, particularly [[voice over IP]], through the conversion of VANS licenses into ECS licenses.\n\nThe total number of wireless broadband subscribers overtook that of fixed broadband subscribers in South Africa during 2007. The total number of broadband subscribers is estimated at 750,000 by late 2007, of which Telkom reported 335,112 ADSL subscribers. Wireless Business Solutions (WBS) launched the iBurst system in South Africa in late 2004, and had a subscriber base of 45,000 by July 2007, up from 2,500 subscribers by February 2005. Sentech had about 4,000 MyWireless subscribers in 2007, up from 2,500 in 2006. With delays to local loop unbundling (LLU), which would give ISPs access to exchanges, operators are deploying a range of broadband wireless networks. While the mobile operators are deploying HSDPA, W-CDMA and EDGE networks and entering the broadband space, operators are also deploying WiMAX, iBurst, and CDMA systems. Telkom, Sentech, Neotel, WBS and the under-serviced areas licensees (USALs) have currently been given commercial WiMAX licenses. Telkom launched full commercial WiMAX services in June 2007, first at 14 sites in Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban, and a further 57 sites are planned for 2007/8. Another 10 operators, including M-Web and Vodacom, were granted temporary test licenses and are awaiting spectrum to be allocated by ICASA. In May 2008, WBS partnered with Vodacom and Intel Corporation to roll out an 802.16e WiMAX network.\n\nThe key upcoming development is that supply contracts have been awarded for three submarine cables that will land in South Arica\u2014SEACOM, EASSy, and WACS. The data sector is a key area for growth in both the corporate data and residential data markets.\n\nSouth Africa is currently served by two submarine cables: SAT-2 and the SAT-3/WASC/SAFE system. Contracts have been awarded for the following three additional submarine cables that will land in South Africa from June 2009:\n\n* '''SEACOM:''' The SEACOM submarine cable landing at Mombasa is due to enter commercial service in June 2009. The cable runs from South Africa to Egypt via Mozambique, Madagascar, Tanzania, Kenya, Djibouti and Saudi Arabia, connecting eastwards through to India and westwards through the Mediterranean.\n* '''East African Submarine Cable System (EASSy):''' The planned EASSy will run from South Africa (Mtunzini) to Egypt via Mombasa (Kenya) and other East African countries. The cable will run as far north as Djibouti and Port Sudan, with onward connectivity to Europe provide by the Europe India Gateway (EIG) cable. In March 2007, a 23-member consortium behind EASSy signed a supply contract with Alcatel-Lucent.\n* '''West African Cable System (WACS).''' In April 2009, the WACS consortium signed a construction and maintenance agreement, and awarded a supply contract to Alcatel-Lucent for a 14,000-kilometre cable to provide connectivity between South Africa, Portugal and the United Kingdom via 11 other African countries. With a minimum design capacity of 3.84 Terabit/s, WACS will connect South Africa to the United Kingdom with landings in 12 countries: Namibia, Angola, DRC, Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria, Togo, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Cape Verde, the Canary Islands, and Portugal. The WACS consortium comprises 11 parties: Angola Telecom, Broadband Infraco (see below), Cable & Wireless, MTN, Portugal Telecom, Sotelco, Tata Communications, Telecom Namibia, Telkom SA, Togo Telecom and Vodacom. The cable is expected to be ready for service during 2011.\n\n=== Uganda ===\n{{Main|Internet in Uganda}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n\nOn 13 October 2009, [[Uganda]]'s ICT Minister [[Aggrey Awori]] announces the establishment of the Uganda Broadband Infrastructure Strategy Team (UBIST). The team he said comprises representatives from [[Politics of Uganda|Government]], Regulator, Operators, Internet Service Providers, Other investors/consumers, Civil Society and academia. UBIST will provide government with a well informed position for enabling it to access International Broadband Infrastructure. The government is also studying a number of policies for the effective implementation of the National Broadband strategy.\n\n== Asia ==\n<!-- [[Broadband Internet access in Asia]] and [[Broadband internet access in asia]] redirect here -->\n\n=== Hong Kong, S.A.R. of China ===\n{{Main|Internet in Hong Kong}}\n\nThe Digital 21 Strategy was first published in 1998 by the [[Politics of Hong Kong|Government]] of the [[Hong Kong|Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]] to set out the government's vision of developing Hong Kong into a leading digital city. As a living document, updated in 2001 and 2004, it has taken into account the evolving needs of the community and technological advancements. The 2008 edition notes that Hong Kong offers the world's most affordable [[Internetworking|Internet connection]] and mobile phone services with penetration rates among the highest in the world. [[Cyberport]] and [[Hong Kong Science Park]] have been developed as strategic hubs bringing together clusters of high-tech [[Information technology|information and communications technology]] (ICT) companies and professional talent from all over the world. The Government is pursuing a vigorous [[EGovernment|e-government]] program that has achieved good progress over the years. The Digital 21 Strategy sets out a vision of building on Hong Kong's position as a world digital city through advancing our achievements and seizing new opportunities. The realization of the Digital 21 Strategy vision requires the participation of the entire community including the ICT industry, business sectors, academia and the general public. As an integral part of the Strategy, key indicators of Hong Kong's ICT development will be measured and tracked over time for public reference. The Office of the Government [[Chief information officer|Chief Information Officer]] (OGCIO) is the focal point in the Government for dialogue with the public on the Strategy, for coordinating with all parties within the Government on its implementation and for tracking progress on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/index.htm |title=Digital 21 Strategy |publisher=Info.gov.hk |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219222227/http://info.gov.hk/digital21/eng/index.htm |archive-date=19 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main |Internet in India |National Optical Fibre Network}}\n\nThe typical speeds for consumer broadband connections in [[India]] vary from 512 kbit/s to 12 Mbit/s, with speeds of up to 100 Mbit/s available in a few areas (mostly on university campuses), though plans of 8\u201316 Mbit/s and above are becoming more common from [[BSNL]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]], Beam Telecom, Reliance and [[MTNL]], but they are very expensive & out of reach of most Indians. The demand in India is for affordable 1Mbit/s plans with no download limit.\n\nThe price of Broadband in India is very high compared to Europe or other parts of Asia, with a 1 Mbit/s connection costing between US$20<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mumbai.mtnl.net.in/triband/htm/tariff.htm#tariff |accessdate=13 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419003611/http://mumbai.mtnl.net.in/triband/htm/tariff.htm |archivedate=19 April 2010 }}</ref> and $30 per month.<ref>http://bsnl.co.in/service/new_BB/BB_home_only_unlim.htm</ref> Because of this, broadband is yet to filter down to the masses, with a penetration rate of 8.03 million (December 2009), or about 9.9% of the estimated 81 million total Internet subscribers.\n\nIn addition to the high prices, many providers have introduced a [[Fair Usage Policy]] on \"Unlimited\" plans, while data plans still have very low data transfer limits (typically 100 GB) after which speed is reduced. For example, Airtel offers 100Mbit/s, 200Mbit/s plans, & 300Mbit/s plans, which fall to 512kbit/s due to FUP.<ref>http://www.airtelchennai.in</ref>\n{{See also|Telecommunications in India}}\n\n;Domestic Fiber\nThe National Internet Backbone (NIB), owned and operated by the government, is the largest backbone in the country.

Only companies or their subsidiaries that are majority Indonesian-owned are able to compete per the 2007 Investment Law and accompanying Negative List.\n\nThe Department of Communications and Information (DEPKOMINFO)laid out the following process for interested bidders:\n\n* 29 April \u2013 5 May Pick-up bidding document;\n* 6 May Submit written questions;\n* 11\u201320 May Submit pre-qualification documents;\n* 29 May Announce prequalification results;\n* 1\u20135 June Prequalification appeal period;\n* 3\u20139 June Pre-auction clarifying\n* 10\u201312 June Implement three round auction;\n* 12 June Announce auction results;\n* 15\u201316 June Auction appeal period;\n* 17 June Confirmation of auction results.\n\nIndonesian officials plan to hold future auctions for the 3.3 and 3.5&nbsp;GHz frequencies. No date is set for these future auctions. Earlier this year, DEPKOMINFO issued a Ministerial decree instructing operators using those frequencies to migrate to other frequencies.\n\nBecause of the Indonesian Negative List on Foreign Investment, U.S. firms will not be able to participate in the auction unless they partner with local companies to create a subsidiary that is majority Indonesian-owned. DEPKOMINFO officials said [[Indosat]] may not be able to compete because they are majority owned by a [[Qatar]] firm. The official added that a majority Indonesian-owned subsidiary of Indosat could still participate in the auction.\n\n=== Japan ===\n{{Main|Internet in Japan}}\n\nIn 2001, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Japanese Cabinet]] released the e-Japan Priority Policy Programme. It stated that the private sector is to play the leading role in information technology, and the [[Politics of Japan|government]]'s role is to implement an environment in which markets function smoothly through the promotion of fair competition and removal of unnecessary regulations. It also stated that government must play an active role in areas in which the private sector's activities do not fulfill the goals of facilitating e-government, closing the [[digital divide]] and promoting [[research and development]]. The e-Japan program extended [[Tax exemption|tax incentives]] and budgetary support for carriers building fiber optic networks.\n\nTo implement this program, the Ministry of [[Public management|Public Management]], [[Interior minister|Home Affairs]], Posts and Telecommunications (MPHPT; it later changed its name to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, or MIC) pursued two policies: the National Broadband Initiative, which mandates that federal and local governments deploy fiber to underserved areas; and the e-Japan Strategy, which set forth the goal of providing access at affordable rates by 2005 to high speed Internet networks for at least 30 million households, and to ultra-high speed Internet networks for 10 million households. Japan reached this goal with a broadband household penetration rate of 41.7 percent in 2004.\n\nThese policies provided $60 million to municipalities investing in local public [[Broadband Networks|broadband networks]], as well as low-interest loans to carriers to encourage them to build other broadband networks, including DSL, wireless, and cable systems. The loans were made through the [[Development Bank of Japan]] and the Telecommunications Advancement Organisation, both of which were largely funded by the government of Japan. In 2004, MIC issued its \"Ubiquitous Japan\" (u-Japan) policy. Its goal is to achieve a ubiquitous [[network society]] in which anything and anyone can easily [[access network]]s and freely transmit information from anywhere at any time by 2010. MIC is reviewing its regulations regarding broadband as part of its work towards achieving that goal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soumu.go.jp/menu_seisaku/ict/u-japan_en/new_pckg01_menu.html |title=u-Japan Policy Package (1): Development of Ubiquitous Networks |publisher=Soumu.go.jp |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== South Korea ===\n{{Main|Internet in South Korea}}\n\nIn February 2009, the [[Korea Communications Commission]] (KCC) announced plans to upgrade the national network to offer 1 Gbit/s service by 2012.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2009/02/01/by-2012-koreans-will-get-a-gigabit-per-second-broadband-connection/ |title=By 2012 Koreans Will Get 1Gbps Broadband Connections \u2013 Tech News and Analysis |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> an upgrade from the prior 100 Mbit/s guarantee. The plan was intended to cost 34.1 trillion won (US$24.6 billion) over the next five years. The central government will put up 1.3 trillion won, with the remainder coming from private telecom operators. The project is also expected to create more than 120,000 jobs \u2013 a win for the Korean economy. In November 2006, the [[Politics of South Korea|government]] had announced it would invest 26.6 trillion won (US$28.3 billion) to upgrade networks\u2014including [[Fiber to the x|fiber-to-the-home]] (FTTH), optical LAN and hyper fiber [[Coaxial cable|co-axial cable]]\u2014in the country over the next four years. The government aims to upgrade a total of 20 million subscriber lines\u201410 million lines for fixed and wireless services each. The government is expecting industry to contribute funds toward the national upgrading project.\n\nThe decision to focus on broadband began in the mid-1990s and intensified after South Korea's economy was crippled by the collapse of the Asian [[financial market]]s in 1997, when policy makers targeted technology as a key sector for restoring the country's economic health. Korean regulators set a path for the industry with well-publicized national goals. All big office and [[apartment building]]s would be given a fiber connection by 1997. By 2000, 30 percent of households would have broadband access through DSL or cable lines. By 2005, more than 80 percent of households would have access to fast connections of 20 Mbit/s or more\u2014about the rate needed for high-definition television.\n\nMost of the country's consumers were already served by the [[Dominant gene|dominant carrier]] [[Korea Telecom]], but the government encouraged competitors with a low-interest loan program for companies that built their own broadband facilities. The program offered $77 million in two years alone, with a particular focus on rural areas. The government offered other incentives for Korea Telecom. Once a [[Public ownership|state-owned]] monopoly, the company began the transition to private hands in 1993. But the government, which retained some shares until 2002, allowed the process to become final only on the condition that Korea Telecom bring broadband to all the villages in the country.\n\nThe government also offered Internet training for the portion of the population deemed likely to be left behind in the digital age. About 10 million people fell into this category in the first round of the government's initiative, including stay-at-home wives, [[Soldier|military personnel]], disabled citizens, and even prison inmates. That program was ultimately expanded to anyone who wanted it.\n\nIn 2004 a consortium that included the now defunct Ministry of Information and Communication, and private sector telecommunication and cable firms including KT, Hanaro Telecommunications, and others started to build a major infrastructure project called the Broadband Convergence Network (BcN). This infrastructure has been launched as a three-phase project. The first phase of the BcN extended from 2004 through 2005, the second phase extended from 2006 through 2007, and the third phase extended from 2008 through 2010. The timeline for the project has since been extended.\n\nA major focus of the South Korean program is [[WiBro]] to offer seamless 100 Mbit/s hybrid networking.<ref name=\"stopthecap1\">{{cite web|url=http://stopthecap.com/2012/01/05/south-korea-set-to-launch-100mbps-wireless-seamlessly-combines-mobile-broadband-wi-fi/ |title=South Korea Set to Launch 100Mbps Wireless, Seamlessly Combines Mobile Broadband & Wi-Fi |publisher=Stop the Cap! |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> It's \"Heterogeneous Network Integration Solution (HNIS) technology... weds 3G/4G service with any open Wi-Fi network to deliver speeds many times faster than North Americans can get from their wireless providers.

The combination of mobile broadband with Wi-Fi works seamlessly as well. Currently, smartphones can use Wi-Fi or mobile data, but not both at the same time... While mobile operators cope with spectrum and capacity issues, HNIS can reduce the load on wireless networks, without creating a hassle for wireless customers who used to register with every Wi-Fi service they encountered. The theoretical speed of an HNIS-enhanced 3G and Wi-Fi connection in South Korea will be 60Mbps when SK Telecom fully deploys the technology this year. As SK expands the technology to its 4G networks, theoretical maximum speeds will increase to 100Mbps.\".<ref name=\"stopthecap1\"/> SK plans to equip all of its smartphones with the new technology starting in 2013.

The Broadband plan would bring larger, high speed communication pipes that would allow Lebanese citizens to have faster access to information and change the way they live, work, play, and learn. Lebanon's outdated communications infrastructure puts Lebanese industry at a competitive disadvantage, costing jobs, decreasing revenue, and slowing economic growth. The Partnership for Lebanon is working with the [[Politics of Lebanon|Lebanese government]] and business leaders to modernize Lebanon's communications infrastructure through innovation and investment. In so doing, the Partnership is helping Lebanon update technology, reduce connectivity costs, and improve ICT quality across the board.\n\nThe Partnership is working specifically with the Telecommunications Regulatory Agency (TRA) to develop a national broadband strategy designed to bring broadband to Lebanon's urban and rural communities. As part of this effort, the Partnership is conducting broadband business analysis, developing network architecture options, and crafting a regulatory framework to facilitate the successful implementation of a modern communications infrastructure. The Partnership is also working with the government owned telecom operator, [[Ogero]], to increase Lebanon's international bandwidth capacity. The Partnership has provided Ogero with an Internet Exchange Point and is assembling the equipment needed to install two state of the art International Internet Gateways. To help educate local stakeholders about the benefits of a modern communications infrastructure, the Partnership and in coordination with the LBSG Committee which represents economic councils, private sector leaders and professional assiociations, launched a recent Advertising Campaign. The objective of this campaign is to raise awareness and educate the Lebanese public on the need of a True Broadband Infrastructure in Lebanon. The True Broadband Infrastructure will encourage economic growth and social development. The campaign second objective is to drive people to sign the manifesto.<ref>http://www.escwa.un.org/wsis/reports/docs/Lebanon-07-E.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Malaysia ===\n{{Main|Internet in Malaysia}}\n\nHigh Speed Broadband (HSBB) is a broadband service that offers bandwidth delivered at network speeds of 10 Mbit/s and above when compared to normal broadband (Broadband to the General Population (BBGP)) which delivers bandwidth through wired and wireless technologies at network speeds ranging between 256 kbit/s and 4 Mbit/s. Eventually [[Malaysia]] will see basic HSBB packages offering network speeds between 20\u201350 Mbit/s and up to 100 Mbit/s for consumers while businesses will have maximum network speeds available up to 1Gbit/s.\n\nTo understand the deployment of HSBB, the role HSBB plays in the larger world of broadband deployment in Malaysia must first be understood. Broadband deployment in Malaysia is carried out using two approaches \u2013 normal broadband, known as Broadband to the General Population (BBGP) delivered via wired (DSL) and wireless technologies (WiMax, WiFi, 3G/HSDPA) while the other will be through HSBB.\n\nBBGP (via both wired and wireless modes) is deployed nationwide while HSBB ( available only through the wired mode) will only initially be concentrated in the Klang Valley, Iskandar Malaysia and key industrial zones throughout the country. It is expected that 1.3 million premises will have the ability to access HSBB coverage by end 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tm.com.my/connecting-you/digital-lifestyle/hsbb/Pages/HSBBHome.aspx |title=Connecting You \u2013 UniFi |publisher=TM |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Singapore ===\n{{Main|Internet in Singapore}}\n\nThe [[Singapore]]an [[Politics of Singapore|government]] will provide up to S$750 million (US$520 million) in grants to build the Next Generation National Broadband Network.

The network will be open to all [[service provider]]s, threatening [[Singapore Telecommunications|SingTel]] and StarHub's market dominance. The government will not prevent companies from building their own networks, however. Bidding is taking place in two stages \u2013 first, for the passive infrastructure, and then for the active infrastructure. In September 2008, IDA selected OpenNet, in which SingTel has a 30 percent stake, to design, build, and operate the passive infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ida.gov.sg/Infrastructure/20060919190208.aspx |title=IDA Singapore \u2013 Infrastructure \u2013 Wired |publisher=Ida.gov.sg |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Wireless@SG]], which is launched on 1 December 2006, is a [[Wireless LAN|wireless broadband]] programme developed by [[IDA Singapore]] as part of its Next Generation National Infocomm Infrastructure initiative.

The authorities expanded E-Government to include \"E-Society,\" \"E-Industry,\" and \"E-Opportunity\" initiatives under 2002's \"E-Taiwan\" plan. According to James Lo, Section Chief in the National Communications Commission (NCC) Department of Planning, from 2003 to 2007, the [[Taiwan]] authorities and private sector partners spent over US$10 billion on the broadband development. By the end of 2007, there were six million broadband internet accounts in Taiwan.\n\n=== Thailand ===\n{{Main|Internet in Thailand}}\n\nSome of the nation's most powerful telecommunications executives and the regulatory agency, Nation Telecommunications Union (NTC), met for the first time on 2 July 2009 to formulate a plan for Meaningful Broadband. The plan calls for interacting with prime minister, and a spectrum of Thai ministries to establish the role of broadband in achieving public-policy reforms in the [[Politics of Thailand|Abhisit government]].\n\nThe event, held at the [[Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok|Oriental Hotel]], was the first meeting of the Meaningful Broadband Working Group, led by Craig Warren Smith, a visiting professor of [[Chulalongkorn University]]'s Center for Ethics of Science and Technology. Sponsored by NTC, the event released a white paper on Meaningful Broadband.\n\nThe report rejects the path to broadband favored by [[Singapore]] and other advanced nations which serves affluent citizens who can afford high speed internet. Instead, it calls for a new \"broadband ecosystem\" for [[Thailand]], that is focused primarily on the Middle of the Pyramid (MOP), a middle-income group of Thais who make from $2 to $7 per day. By bringing 28 million of these MOP Thais into subsidized meaningful mobile broadband applications, Smith predicts a \"wealth effect\" that could bring equity and sustainability to the Thai economy.\n\nResponding to the framework, Khun Supachai called was one of several members of the group that advocated a follow up study that would prepare for a meeting with Prime Minister [[Abhisit Vejjajiva|Abhisit]] along with ministers of Finance, Education, ICT and other relevant parties. \"We need to figure out the roles of government, the regulator and the telecommunications operators in establishing broadband that brings optimal benefits to Thailand.\" Supachai, agreed to be host and sponsor of further research in preparation of the next meeting of the Working Group to be held in September.\n\n\"Along with painting the big picture of how broadband could serve the nation, we should focus specifically how it can serve education and human resources development,\" said Montchai Noosong, executive vice president of TOT.\n\n\"Central to the 'meaningful' idea is a new approach to Ethics, said Chulalongkorn University Soraj Hongladarom. \"We want Thailand to develop a way to help users choose broadband applications that will lead them to happiness not addiction,\" he said.<ref>http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/19860/working-group-vows-broadband-net-for-all{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n== Oceania ==\n<!-- [[Broadband internet access in Oceania]] and [[Broadband internet access in oceania]] redirect here -->\n\n=== Australia ===\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=March 2014}}\n{{Main|Internet in Australia|National Broadband Network}}\nOn 15 September 2009, the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator [[Stephen Conroy]], announced fundamental reforms to Australian's telecommunications landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/088 |title=Historic reforms to telecommunications regulation &#124; Senator Stephen Conroy &#124; Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy |publisher=Minister.dbcde.gov.au |accessdate=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429161358/http://www.minister.dbcde.gov.au/media/media_releases/2009/088 |archive-date=29 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, the [[Politics of Australia|Australian Government]] announced that it would establish a new company that will invest up to $43 billion over 8 years to build and operate a wholesale-only, [[open access (publishing)|open access]] [[National Broadband Network]].
