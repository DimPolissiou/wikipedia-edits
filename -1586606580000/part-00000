After the 1997 season, in which the [[Australian Rugby League]] and [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] organisations ran separate competitions parallel to each other, they joined to create a reunited competition in the NRL. The first professional rugby league club to be based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Melbourne Storm]] was introduced into the League, and with the closure of the [[Hunter Mariners]], [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and [[South Queensland Crushers]], twenty teams competed for the premiership, which culminated in the [[1998 NRL grand final]] between the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury Bulldogs]].\n\n==Pre-season==\n{{See also|History of the National Rugby League}}\n\nThe [[National Rugby League]] was formed after an agreement was reached between the two rivaling competitions from 1997, the [[Australian Rugby League]] and the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]]. In December 1997, the two parties formed a joint board to run the new Australian rugby league club competition. The vast majority of the 22 clubs that contested in 1997 across the split competitions also contested the first season of the National Rugby League, with the exception of the [[Hunter Mariners]], the [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and [[South Queensland Crushers|South Queensland]].\n\nThe National Rugby League imposed a $3M salary cap on each of the clubs.<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Toby Miller |author2=Geoffrey A.

The 1998&nbsp;ad featured the song \"[[Tubthumping]]\" by [[Chumbawamba]] with its theme of rising against adversity:\n:''I get knocked down! But I get up again; you're never gonna keep me down''.\n\nThere was no visual performance of the song in the ad which returned to the standard rugby league imagery of big hits and crunching tackles to accompany the track.\n\n==Teams==\nThe closure of the [[Hunter Mariners]], [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and [[South Queensland Crushers]], and the introduction of the [[Melbourne Storm]] meant that a total of twenty clubs contested the 1998 Premiership. Eleven of these clubs were from [[Sydney]], but an agreement between the Australian Rugby League and Super League meant that many of these clubs were in danger of being cut from the competition by the [[National Rugby League season 2000|2000 season]] when, it was decided, only 14 clubs would be invited to contest the premiership.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:auto; text-valign:center;\"

After the 1997 season, in which the [[Australian Rugby League]] and [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] organisations ran separate competitions parallel to each other, they joined to create a reunited competition in the NRL. The first professional rugby league club to be based in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the [[Melbourne Storm]] was introduced into the League, and with the closure of the [[Hunter Mariners]], [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and [[South Queensland Crushers]], twenty teams competed for the premiership, which culminated in the [[1998 NRL grand final]] between the [[Brisbane Broncos]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury Bulldogs]].\n\n==Pre-season==\n{{See also|History of the National Rugby League}}\n\nThe [[National Rugby League]] was formed after an agreement was reached between the two rivaling competitions from 1997, the [[Australian Rugby League]] and the [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]]. In December 1997, the two parties formed a joint board to run the new Australian rugby league club competition. The vast majority of the 22 clubs that contested in 1997 across the split competitions also contested the first season of the National Rugby League, with the exception of the [[Hunter Mariners]], the [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and [[South Queensland Crushers|South Queensland]].\n\nThe National Rugby League imposed a $3M salary cap on each of the clubs.<ref>{{cite book\n|author1=Toby Miller |author2=Geoffrey A.

The 1998&nbsp;ad featured the song \"[[Tubthumping]]\" by [[Chumbawamba]] with its theme of rising against adversity:\n:''I get knocked down! But I get up again; you're never gonna keep me down''.\n\nThere was no visual performance of the song in the ad which returned to the standard rugby league imagery of big hits and crunching tackles to accompany the track.\n\n==Teams==\nThe closure of the [[Hunter Mariners]], [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] and [[South Queensland Crushers]], and the introduction of the [[Melbourne Storm]] meant that a total of twenty clubs contested the 1998 Premiership. Eleven of these clubs were from [[Sydney]], but an agreement between the Australian Rugby League and Super League meant that many of these clubs were in danger of being cut from the competition by the [[National Rugby League season 2000|2000 season]] when, it was decided, only 14 clubs would be invited to contest the premiership.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:auto; text-valign:center;\"

Ghana produces a variety of crops in various climatic zones which range from dry [[savanna]] to wet forest and which run in east\u2013west bands across Ghana. Agricultural crops, including [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], grains, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[oil palm]]s, [[kola nut]]s, and timber, form the base of agriculture in [[Economy of Ghana|Ghana's economy]].

The labor force needed for the labor-intensive production of cocoa in Ghana's fertile south was mainly constituted of migrant workers from the savannah of northern Ghana.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=325|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>\nThis development was facilitated by the traditional Ghanaian system of communal purchase of land, which gave individual farmers the security of planting a cocoa tree that would take several years until being ready to harvest. Among other factors, this enabled Ghana to grow from zero in 1891 to the world's largest cocoa exporter in the world by 1911.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 2018 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=340\u2013341|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>\n\nThe first president of Ghana, [[Kwame Nkrumah]] attempted to use agricultural wealth as a springboard for the country's overall [[economic development]], Ghanaian agricultural output has consistently fallen since the 1960s. Beginning with the drop in commodity prices in the late 1960s, farmers were faced with fewer incentives to produce as well as with a general deterioration of necessary infrastructure and services. Farmers have also had to deal with increasingly expensive inputs, such as fertilizer, because of overvaluation of the [[cedi]]. Food production has fallen as well, with a decline in the food self-sufficiency ratio from 83 percent in 1965\u201366 to 71 percent in 1900\u201380, coupled with a fourfold increase in food imports in the decade prior to 1982. By 1983, when drought hit the region, food shortages were widespread, and export crop production reached an all-time low.<ref name=cs/>\n\nWhen the [[Jerry Rawlings|Rawlings]] government initiated the first phase of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1984, agriculture was identified as the economic sector that could rescue Ghana from a financial ruin. Accordingly, since that time, the government has invested significant funds in the rehabilitation of agriculture. The government had directed capital toward repairing and improving the transportation and distribution infrastructure serving export crops. In addition, specific projects aimed at increasing cocoa yields and at developing the timber industry had been initiated. Except for specific development programs, however, the government had tried to allow the [[free market]] to promote higher producer prices and to increase efficiency.<ref name=cs/>\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-34-22-2-001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Harvesting]] and agriculture in Ghana in the 20th century]]\n\nAlthough the government was criticized for focusing on exports rather than on food crops under the ERP, by the early 1990s the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] had begun to address the need to increase local production of food. In early 1991, the government announced that one goal of the Medium Term agricultural Development Program 1991\u20132000 was to attain food self-sufficiency and security by the year 2000. To this end, the government sought to improve extension services for farmers and to improve crop-disease research. Despite the statements concerning the importance of food crops, however, the plan was still heavily oriented toward market production, improvement of Ghana's balance-of-payments position, and provision of materials for local industrial production. Furthermore, the government planned to rely more heavily on the private sector for needed services and to reduce the role of the public sector, a clear disadvantage for subsistence producers. In particular, industrial tree crops such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, and oil palm seedlings were singled out for assistance. Clearly, agricultural sectors that could not produce foreign exchange earnings were assigned a lower priority under the ERP.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe north people attempted to reduce its role in marketing and assistance to farmers in several ways. In particular, the Cocoa Marketing Board steadily relinquished its powers over pricing and marketing. The government, furthermore, established a new farmers' organization, the Ghana National Association of Farmers and Fishermen, in early 1991 to replace the Ghana Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives. The new organization was to be funded by the farmers themselves to operate as a cooperative venture at the district, regional, and national levels. Although the government argued that it did not want to be accused of manipulating farmers, the lack of government financial support again put subsistence producers at a disadvantage.<ref name=cs/>\n\n== Agricultural products ==\n===Cocoa===\n{{main|Cocoa production in Ghana}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-5.jpg|thumb|[[Cocoa bean#Harvest processing|Harvest processing]] of [[Cocoa bean]]s in Ghana in the 20th century]]\n\nFor over 81 years Agriculture in Ghana has been regulated by one of its highest yielding exports-Cocoa.<ref>https://cocobod.gh/the_ghana_cocostory.php</ref> [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] is Ghana's principal agricultural export.<ref name=\"Ghana Statistical Service\">{{cite web|title=Ghana's Economic Performance in 2010|url=http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/news/gh_eco_performance_2010_in_figures.pdf|website=www.statsghana.gov|publisher=Ghana Statistical Service|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref> Cocoa production occurs in the forested areas of Ghana: [[Ashanti Region]], [[Brong-Ahafo Region]], [[Central Region, Ghana|Central Region]], [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]], [[Western Region, Ghana|Western Region]], and [[Volta Region]]. The crop year begins in October while the smaller mid-crop cycle starts in July. All cocoa, except that which is smuggled out of the country, is sold at fixed prices. Although most cocoa production is carried out by peasant farmers, a small number of farmers appear to dominate the trade.<ref name=cs/> The government controls the industry through the [[Ghana Cocoa Board]] (Cocobod). {{As of|2010}}, Ghana's cocoa bean exports were valued at $2,219.5&nbsp;million (US).<ref name=\"Ghana Statistical Service\"/>\n\nAs of 2017 Ghana is ranked number two for Cocoa exports behind C\u00f4te d'Ivoire bringing in a $1,914 per metric ton (2204.6&nbsp;lbs. \u2022 ~$.868/lbs) received; Cocoa is slated to exceed the national average supply by 97,500 metric tons. This massive increase, in turn, will cause \"supply and demand\" issues for larger and smaller farmers sharing a 1.3-billion-dollar syndicated loan disbursed by the government for the 2017\u20132018 season.<ref>http://cocobod.gh/</ref>\n\n=== Sweet Potato ===\nThe [[sweet potato]] is a viable resource, because it can be used for many things.

Northern Ghana has not been able to take full advantage of this food source, in every part of the country, because some of the land is not fertile, and a complex socioeconomic limitation such as many farm owners not being able to come together.<ref name=\":0\" /> This causes a disruption in the market. There is this mistrust among the local farmers because most of the farmers have different opinions on how the product should be marketed. There are five groups of people that help get the Sweet potato to market, the Farmers, traders, commission agents the processors and final the consumers. They all deal with each other in a private and individuals basis.<ref name=\":0\" /> Transportation of the sweet potato is mostly done by outside source such as hired transportation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Nyamah|first=E.Y.|last2=Jiang|first2=Y|date=2017|others=Feng, Y & Enchill, E|title=Agri-food supply chain performance: An empirical impact of risk|journal=Management Decision|volume=55|issue=5|pages=872\u2013891|doi=10.1108/md-01-2016-0049}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial crops===\n[[File:Maize farmer.jpg|thumb|A Maize farmer in Ghana]]\nThe main industrial crops are [[oil palm]], cotton, rubber, [[sugar cane]], tobacco, and [[kenaf]], the latter used in the production of fiber bags. None is of strategic economic importance, and all, apart from oil palms. Despite claims that such crops could assist local industrialization efforts, the government has not focused the same attention on this sector as on export crops. For example, sugar cane output has diminished with the closure of the country's two sugar mills, which produced 237,000 tons per year in 1974\u201376, but only 110,000 tons in 1989.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe government has actually encouraged the export rather than the local processing of rubber, rehabilitating more than 3,000 hectares of plantations specifically for export production rather than revitalizing the local Bonsa Tire Company, which could produce only 400 tires per day in 1988 despite its installed capacity for 1,500 per day.<ref name=cs/>\n\nBy the 1990s, the tobacco sector was expanding and moving toward higher export production. Ghana's dark-fired leaf probably grew too fast and required rich soil to compete effectively with rival crops, but the potential for flue-cured and Burley varieties is good. Pricing difficulties had reduced tobacco production from 3,400 tons in the early 1970s to an estimated 1,433 tons in 1989. Output began to improve in 1990, reaching 2,080 tons. In 2006\u20132007 BAT (British America Tobacco) shut down their Torikawa plant amid a social movement against tobacco smoking which resulted from high taxes caused by heavy tobacco smuggling.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe Leaf Development Company was established in 1988 to produce tobacco leaf for the local market and to lay the basis for a future export industry. In 1991, the company's first commercial crop amounted to 300 tons of flue-cured, 50 tons of Burley, and 50 tons of dark-fired tobacco (all green leaf weights), of which 250 tons were exported, earning US$380,000. In 1991 Rothmans, the British tobacco company, acquired a 49.5 percent stake in the company and took over management of the Meridian Tobacco Company in partnership with the state-owned Social Security and National Insurance Trust. Another firm, the Pioneer Tobacco Company, announced a 92 percent increase in post-tax profits of more than \u00a21&nbsp;billion for 1991. The company declared dividends worth \u00a2360&nbsp;million, double the amount paid out in 1990.<ref name=cs/>\n\nCotton production expanded rapidly in the early and mid-1970s, reaching 24,000 tons in 1977, but it fell back to one-third of this figure in 1989. Since the reorganization of the Ghana Cotton Development Board into the Ghana Cotton Company, cotton production steadily increased from 4 percent of the country's national requirement to 50 percent in 1990. Between 1986 and 1989, Ghana saved US$6&nbsp;million through local lint cotton production. The company expected that between 1991 and 1995, about 20,000 hectares of land would be put under cotton cultivation, enabling Ghana to produce 95 percent of the national requirement.<ref name=cs/>\n\n===Food crops and livestock===\n{{Main|Economy of Ashanti}}\n\nThe main food crops are corn, [[Sweet potato|yams]], [[cassava]] and other root crops.

The labor force needed for the labor-intensive production of cocoa in Ghana's fertile south was mainly constituted of migrant workers from the savannah of northern Ghana.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

Beginning with the drop in commodity prices in the late 1960s, farmers were faced with fewer incentives to produce as well as with a general deterioration of necessary infrastructure and services. Farmers have also had to deal with increasingly expensive inputs, such as fertilizer, because of overvaluation of the [[cedi]]. Food production has fallen as well, with a decline in the food self-sufficiency ratio from 83 percent in 1965\u201366 to 71 percent in 1900\u201380, coupled with a fourfold increase in food imports in the decade prior to 1982. By 1983, when drought hit the region, food shortages were widespread, and export crop production reached an all-time low.<ref name=cs/>\n\nWhen the [[Jerry Rawlings|Rawlings]] government initiated the first phase of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) in 1984, agriculture was identified as the economic sector that could rescue Ghana from a financial ruin. Accordingly, since that time, the government has invested significant funds in the rehabilitation of agriculture. The government had directed capital toward repairing and improving the transportation and distribution infrastructure serving export crops. In addition, specific projects aimed at increasing cocoa yields and at developing the timber industry had been initiated. Except for specific development programs, however, the government had tried to allow the [[free market]] to promote higher producer prices and to increase efficiency.<ref name=cs/>\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-34-22-2-001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Harvesting]] and agriculture in Ghana in the 20th century]]\n\nAlthough the government was criticized for focusing on exports rather than on food crops under the ERP, by the early 1990s the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] had begun to address the need to increase local production of food. In early 1991, the government announced that one goal of the Medium Term agricultural Development Program 1991\u20132000 was to attain food self-sufficiency and security by the year 2000. To this end, the government sought to improve extension services for farmers and to improve crop-disease research. Despite the statements concerning the importance of food crops, however, the plan was still heavily oriented toward market production, improvement of Ghana's balance-of-payments position, and provision of materials for local industrial production. Furthermore, the government planned to rely more heavily on the private sector for needed services and to reduce the role of the public sector, a clear disadvantage for subsistence producers. In particular, industrial tree crops such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], coffee, and oil palm seedlings were singled out for assistance. Clearly, agricultural sectors that could not produce foreign exchange earnings were assigned a lower priority under the ERP.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe north people attempted to reduce its role in marketing and assistance to farmers in several ways. In particular, the Cocoa Marketing Board steadily relinquished its powers over pricing and marketing. The government, furthermore, established a new farmers' organization, the Ghana National Association of Farmers and Fishermen, in early 1991 to replace the Ghana Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives. The new organization was to be funded by the farmers themselves to operate as a cooperative venture at the district, regional, and national levels. Although the government argued that it did not want to be accused of manipulating farmers, the lack of government financial support again put subsistence producers at a disadvantage.<ref name=cs/>\n\n== Agricultural products ==\n===Cocoa===\n{{main|Cocoa production in Ghana}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-46-5.jpg|thumb|[[Cocoa bean#Harvest processing|Harvest processing]] of [[Cocoa bean]]s in Ghana in the 20th century]]\n\nFor over 81 years Agriculture in Ghana has been regulated by one of its highest yielding exports-Cocoa.<ref>https://cocobod.gh/the_ghana_cocostory.php</ref> [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] is Ghana's principal agricultural export.<ref name=\"Ghana Statistical Service\">{{cite web|title=Ghana's Economic Performance in 2010|url=http://www.statsghana.gov.gh/docfiles/news/gh_eco_performance_2010_in_figures.pdf|website=www.statsghana.gov|publisher=Ghana Statistical Service|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref> Cocoa production occurs in the forested areas of Ghana: [[Ashanti Region]], [[Brong-Ahafo Region]], [[Central Region, Ghana|Central Region]], [[Eastern Region, Ghana|Eastern Region]], [[Western Region, Ghana|Western Region]], and [[Volta Region]].

None is of strategic economic importance, and all, apart from oil palms. Despite claims that such crops could assist local industrialization efforts, the government has not focused the same attention on this sector as on export crops. For example, sugar cane output has diminished with the closure of the country's two sugar mills, which produced 237,000 tons per year in 1974\u201376, but only 110,000 tons in 1989.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe government has actually encouraged the export rather than the local processing of rubber, rehabilitating more than 3,000 hectares of plantations specifically for export production rather than revitalizing the local Bonsa Tire Company, which could produce only 400 tires per day in 1988 despite its installed capacity for 1,500 per day.<ref name=cs/>\n\nBy the 1990s, the tobacco sector was expanding and moving toward higher export production. Ghana's dark-fired leaf probably grew too fast and required rich soil to compete effectively with rival crops, but the potential for flue-cured and Burley varieties is good. Pricing difficulties had reduced tobacco production from 3,400 tons in the early 1970s to an estimated 1,433 tons in 1989. Output began to improve in 1990, reaching 2,080 tons. In 2006\u20132007 BAT (British America Tobacco) shut down their Torikawa plant amid a social movement against tobacco smoking which resulted from high taxes caused by heavy tobacco smuggling.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe Leaf Development Company was established in 1988 to produce tobacco leaf for the local market and to lay the basis for a future export industry. In 1991, the company's first commercial crop amounted to 300 tons of flue-cured, 50 tons of Burley, and 50 tons of dark-fired tobacco (all green leaf weights), of which 250 tons were exported, earning US$380,000. In 1991 Rothmans, the British tobacco company, acquired a 49.5 percent stake in the company and took over management of the Meridian Tobacco Company in partnership with the state-owned Social Security and National Insurance Trust. Another firm, the Pioneer Tobacco Company, announced a 92 percent increase in post-tax profits of more than \u00a21&nbsp;billion for 1991. The company declared dividends worth \u00a2360&nbsp;million, double the amount paid out in 1990.<ref name=cs/>\n\nCotton production expanded rapidly in the early and mid-1970s, reaching 24,000 tons in 1977, but it fell back to one-third of this figure in 1989. Since the reorganization of the Ghana Cotton Development Board into the Ghana Cotton Company, cotton production steadily increased from 4 percent of the country's national requirement to 50 percent in 1990. Between 1986 and 1989, Ghana saved US$6&nbsp;million through local lint cotton production. The company expected that between 1991 and 1995, about 20,000 hectares of land would be put under cotton cultivation, enabling Ghana to produce 95 percent of the national requirement.<ref name=cs/>\n\n===Food crops and livestock===\n{{Main|Economy of Ashanti}}\n\nThe main food crops are corn, [[Sweet potato|yams]], [[cassava]] and other root crops.

With the exclusion of the [[Adelaide Rams]] and [[Gold Coast Chargers]], and the merger of the [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Illawarra Steelers]], seventeen teams competed for the NRL Premiership during the 1999 season, which culminated in the first [[grand final]] to be played at [[Stadium Australia]]. The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], the first joint-venture club to appear in the grand final, played against the [[Melbourne Storm]], who won the premiership in only their second season.\n\n==Season summary==\nThe 1999 National Rugby League season was historic for many reasons. The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] played their inaugural game after forming the League's first joint venture, losing 10-20 to the [[Parramatta Eels]]. That game was the second of a double header, which was the first event to be held at Sydney's [[Telstra Stadium|Stadium Australia]], the central venue for the [[Olympic Games]] the following year. That game attracted a rugby league world record of 104,583 spectators.\n\nDuring the season, the members of the [[Balmain Tigers]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] voted to form another joint venture, to be named the [[Wests Tigers]]. After the conclusion of the season, the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and [[North Sydney Bears]] were excluded from the premiership. The Bears would later form the game's third joint venture with the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], whilst South Sydney would fight a two-year legal battle for reinclusion.\n\nIn August the NRL's CEO [[Neil Whittaker]] announced that he would resign at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news| title = NRL boss Neil Whittaker quits| work = CNN Sports Illustrated| place =Australia| pages = | language = | publisher = Reuters| date = 1999-08-13| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/rugby/news/1999/08/13/nrl_boss_quits/| accessdate = 2009-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThe defending premiers, Brisbane endured their worst ever start to a season, with just one win and a draw from their first ten games, however they would miraculously recover and record 11 wins in a row before hitting a few hurdles along the way, including a draw against Manly in round 24 and a loss against then-bogey team [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] at home in round 25. Their champion [[Rugby league positions#Scrum half|halfback]] and captain [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season as a result. The [[Newcastle Knights]] also lost an iconic player when 1997 premiership captain [[Paul Harragon]] retired mid-season due to a chronic knee injury. The [[Melbourne Storm]]'s premiership victory saw their captain [[Glenn Lazarus]] become the only player to ever win grand finals for three clubs.\n\n[[Cliff Lyons]], making a comeback from retirement for the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], was the oldest player in the NRL in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|last = Toohey| first = Barry| title = Still some bite in old Mad Dog| work = [[The Daily Telegraph

[[Gold Coast Chargers]], and the merger of the [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Illawarra Steelers]], saw a reduction in the League's teams from twenty to seventeen: the largest reduction in the number of teams in premiership history and the first reduction since the exclusion of Sydney's [[Newtown Jets]] at the end of the [[1983 NSWRL season|1983 season]]. \n{| align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\"

some fans, the NRL in its 1999 promotional campaign focussed on the game's grass roots supporters who perhaps had been overlooked and pained in the trauma of the [[Super League war]].  Sydney advertising agency VCD, in the third year of their four-year tenure with the NRL, produced an advertisement featuring [[Thomas Keneally]] reading his poem, \"Ode to Rugby League\", which had been commissioned by the NRL. It speaks of the innocent excitement that begins each season. The ad was used at season launch and there was minimal media budget to support it throughout the year. Keneally is a longtime supporter of the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n{{cquote\n|\nWe go to the cupboard, we take out club colours.\n<br />And the air sings. The season's close.\n<br />Our boys are running up sandhills, their legs pump.\n<br />This season, this season, this is our season.\n<br />This year we all start equal.\n<br />Kids paint signs, and I am seven again.\n<br />I know I will see heroes soon.\n<br />I feel the excitement.\n<br />I have hope in March, and I might share in the glory of September.\n<br />Blow that whistle, ref.\n<br />Send

[[National Rugby League]]. With the exclusion of the [[Adelaide Rams]] and [[Gold Coast Chargers]], and the merger of the [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Illawarra Steelers]], seventeen teams competed for the NRL Premiership during the 1999 season, which culminated in the first [[grand final]] to be played at [[Stadium Australia]]. The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], the first joint-venture club to appear in the grand final, played against the [[Melbourne Storm]], who won the premiership in only their second season.\n\n==Season summary==\nThe 1999 National Rugby League season was historic for many reasons. The [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] played their inaugural game after forming the League's first joint venture, losing 10-20 to the [[Parramatta Eels]]. That game was the second of a double header, which was the first event to be held at Sydney's [[Telstra Stadium|Stadium Australia]], the central venue for the [[Olympic Games]] the following year. That game attracted a rugby league world record of 104,583 spectators.\n\nDuring the season, the members of the [[Balmain Tigers]] and [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] voted to form another joint venture, to be named the [[Wests Tigers]]. After the conclusion of the season, the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and [[North Sydney Bears]] were excluded from the premiership. The Bears would later form the game's third joint venture with the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], whilst South Sydney would fight a two-year legal battle for reinclusion.\n\nIn August the NRL's CEO [[Neil Whittaker]] announced that he would resign at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news| title = NRL boss Neil Whittaker quits| work = CNN Sports Illustrated| place =Australia| pages = | language = | publisher = Reuters| date = 1999-08-13| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/rugby/news/1999/08/13/nrl_boss_quits/| accessdate = 2009-12-24}}</ref>\n\nThe defending premiers, Brisbane endured their worst ever start to a season, with just one win and a draw from their first ten games, however they would miraculously recover and record 11 wins in a row before hitting a few hurdles along the way, including a draw against Manly in round 24 and a loss against then-bogey team [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] at home in round 25. Their champion [[Rugby league positions#Scrum half|halfback]] and captain [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season as a result. The [[Newcastle Knights]] also lost an iconic player when 1997 premiership captain [[Paul Harragon]] retired mid-season due to a chronic knee injury. The [[Melbourne Storm]]'s premiership victory saw their captain [[Glenn Lazarus]] become the only player to ever win grand finals for three clubs.\n\n[[Cliff Lyons]], making a comeback from retirement for the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], was the oldest player in the NRL in 1999.<ref>{{Cite news|last = Toohey| first = Barry| title = Still some bite in old Mad Dog| work = [[The Daily Telegraph

[[Gold Coast Chargers]], and the merger of the [[St. George Dragons]] and [[Illawarra Steelers]], saw a reduction in the League's teams from twenty to seventeen: the largest reduction in the number of teams in premiership history and the first reduction since the exclusion of Sydney's [[Newtown Jets]] at the end of the [[1983 NSWRL season|1983 season]]. \n{| align=\"center\" class=\"toccolours\"

promotional campaign focussed on the game's grass roots supporters who perhaps had been overlooked and pained in the trauma of the [[Super League war]].  Sydney advertising agency VCD, in the third year of their four-year tenure with the NRL, produced an advertisement featuring [[Thomas Keneally]] reading his poem, \"Ode to Rugby League\", which had been commissioned by the NRL. It speaks of the innocent excitement that begins each season. The ad was used at season launch and there was minimal media budget to support it throughout the year. Keneally is a longtime supporter of the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]].\n{{cquote\n|\nWe go to the cupboard, we take out club colours.\n<br />And the air sings.

He was also previously the head coach of the [[Parramatta Eels]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and [[Wests Tigers]] clubs in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL). A [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] representative goal-kicking halfback of the 1990s and early 2000s, Taylor set a number of point-scoring and appearance records in the [[National Rugby League]] during a twelve-year career with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]], [[North Sydney Bears]], [[Northern Eagles]] and [[Parramatta Eels]].\n\n==Background==\nTaylor was born in [[Sydney, New South Wales, Australia]].\n\nHe spent his junior years at Green Valley JRLFC and the Ashcroft Stallions JRLFC, in Sydney's south-western suburbs. He first attended Ashcroft High School before spending his late teenage years [[St Gregory's College, Campbelltown]].\n\n==Playing career==\nTaylor played for Sydney's [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] from 1990 to 1993. Starting from the bench for the first 2 games of the 1990 season, Taylor spent most of the season playing five-eighth outside [[Ivan Henjak]]. Still a teenager, he was often called \"baby-faced\". In what was a poor season for the Magpies, Taylor was described as \"the best of the babies\" in the NSWRL for the season.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Why the baby-faced Magpie ignores the fancy words| author=John McDonald|date=26 May 1990|page=69}}</ref>\n\n1991 saw the arrival of coach [[Warren Ryan]] and big-name players [[Andrew Farrar]], [[David Gillespie]] and [[Paul Langmack]] at the Magpies. Taylor, now playing halfback, lead the team to its first semi-finals in nine years after starring in a play-off for fifth spot.<ref>{{cite news| work = [[Canberra Times]]| author=\n| title = Magpies survive shootout\n| url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page13009945?zoomLevel=3&&searchTerm=%22trevor%20cogger%22&searchLimits=\n| accessdate = 27 March 2014|date=28 August 1991}}</ref>\n\nWests made the semis again in 1992, but Taylor was temporarily benched mid-season. Ongoing conflict with [[Warren Ryan]] saw Taylor seeking an early release from his contract. The release was not granted and Taylor remained for the 1993 season.<ref>{{cite news| work = [[Canberra Times]]| author=\n| title = Gillespie leads Magpie attack for $200,000\n| url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126975048?searchTerm=%22warren%20ryan%22%20%22jason%20Taylor%22&searchLimits=\n| accessdate = 27 March 2014|date=10 February 1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| work = Rugby League Project| author=Alan Whiticker\n| title = Jason Taylor\n| url = http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/jason-taylor/summary.html\n| accessdate = 27 March 2014}}</ref> Taylor said, \"The press came up with some interesting reasons why I wanted to leave, but I prefer to keep most of them to myself because they have been pretty well resolved. One reason, however, was I thought our style of play was too restrictive, too structured and by the end of the year, very predictable. I wasn't the only player to think that way.<ref>{{cite magazine| title = Magpies At War| last = Gillis| first = Steve|magazine= Rugby League Week|page =13| date = 7 July 1993| publisher = ACP Publishing| location = Sydney, NSW}}</ref>\n\nRyan stated in 1993, \"I've made every effort to rectify the things that were buggering him up last year. I did the same thing with [[Benny Elias]] when I was at Balmain. Jason is very, very talented mentally. We've rectified the problem we had and taken every step to resurrect his game. And to his credit when we told him he wouldn't be released he wasn't negative at all. He's done a lot of sprint work and he's worked hard.\"<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Taylor's second chance| author=Paul Kent|date=21 March 1993|page=64}}</ref> Later that season, Ryan suspended Taylor from first grade after an \"outburst\" aimed at teammate [[Paul Langmack]] at half-time in a match. The Wests Magpies board later overturned the suspension.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Wests deny push is on for Ryan's scalp| author=Daniel Williams|date=1 July 1993|page=48}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Taylor made his representative debut with [[City New South Wales rugby league team|City Origin]], playing from the bench. Described as, \"the form player of the premiership\" in 1994, Country Rugby League general manager David Barnhill claimed that Taylor should be eligible to play for the Country team due to his time spent at St. Gregorys. He ended up playing halfback for City for the next two years.<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=COUNTRY ORIGIN'S POACH BID FOR TAYLOR| first = Steve| last = Mascord| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news940419_0103_9095|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=19 April 1994}}</ref>\n\nTaylor was also selected to play for the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales team]] in the [[1993 State of Origin series]]. He was chosen on the bench for all three games, but did not take the field in the first game of the series. Coach [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]] said, \"if anything happened to [[Ricky Stuart|Ricky]] we needed a capable and experienced halfback to go in with a similar game-type to Ricky. Jason's kicking and passing game is along the same lines and would allow fellows like [[Laurie Daley|Daley]] and [[Brad Fittler|Fittler]] the same room as if they were playing with Ricky.\"<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=BLUES UNVEIL THEIR LETHAL WEAPONS| first = John| last = MacDonald| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news930426_0101_9715|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=26 April 1993}}</ref>\n\nTaylor played with the [[North Sydney Bears]] from 1994 to 1999, While at North Sydney, Taylor played a pivotal role in the team and set numerous records.  Taylor also won The Rothmans medal in 1996 as being the game's best and fairest player.  Taylor has scored more points for the [[North Sydney Bears]] than any other player to have been at the club with 1274 points.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/taylor-made-coachs-career-highs-and-lows/2009/09/17/1252780409410.html</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/jason-taylor/summary.html</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/north-sydney-bears/players.html?pos=&ord=points</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Taylor was escorted from the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] following unruly behavior at an Australian Cricket match. It was alleged that Taylor and some of his North Sydney teammates had been backing up from a bucks party the night before when they proceeded to urinate in plastic cups and throw it over patrons during a Mexican wave.  Taylor was then axed as an Australia Day ambassador by Central Coast organisers.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/taylor-made-coachs-career-highs-and-lows/2009/09/17/1252780409410.html</ref>\n\nIn the 1997 preliminary final against the [[Newcastle Knights]], Taylor missed 3 out of 5 conversions in North Sydney's 17-12 defeat.  The most crucial when scores were locked at 12-12 after Taylor set up [[Michael Buettner]] for a try moments before.  With 3 minutes remaining, Norths had a chance to play in their first grand final in 54 years if Taylor could kick that goal.  The normally reliable Taylor missed the conversion and Newcastle player [[Matthew Johns]] went down the other end of the field and kicked a field goal to make it 13-12.  With seconds remaining Norths frantically threw the ball around the field, [[Owen Craigie]] swooped on a loose pass and raced away to score the match winning try to make it 17-12.  This was North Sydney's 4th preliminary final defeat in 6 years.<ref>http://www.weststigersforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=26739</ref>\n\nIn the [[1998 NRL season]], Taylor made 26 appearances as Norths finished 5th on the table.  Taylor played in both finals matches against [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]] which ended in defeat.  \n\nTaylor captained Norths in what would be the club's last season in the top grade.  He played in North Sydney's last game in the [[NRL]] which came against [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] at the [[Willows Sports Complex]].  Taylor scored 2 tries and kicked 3 goals in a 28-18 victory.\n\nTaylor remained with North Sydney for their merger with the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] to form the [[Northern Eagles]] in 2000, but was released by the club at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/nrl-manly-sea-eagles-north-sydney-bears-brad-fittler/1qighpy90kgzs14n64i43a8xar/|title=Manly Sea Eagles and North Sydney Bears must merge into a 'behemoth' club, says Brad Fittler|website=Sporting News}}</ref>\n\nWithout a club for the next year, Taylor wrote a letter to [[Parramatta Eels]] coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] and joined the club for the 2001 season.<ref>{{cite news| work= The Sun-Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=Freeze It Right There| author=[[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]]| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SHD010930ESP8H69P1RQl|accessdate=28 April 2014|date=30 September 2001}}</ref> His performance that year was described as, \"close to the greatest comeback ever in big-time rugby league.\"<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=STEVE MASCORD'S GUIDE TO THE NRL GRAND FINAL| first = Steve| last = Mascord| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SMH010928A16UH7SJMNA|accessdate=28 April 2015|date=28 September 2001}}</ref> Taylor's last ever match was for Parramatta at {{rlp|hb}} in their [[2001 NRL grand final]] loss to the [[Newcastle Knights]].\n\nWhilst at Parramatta Taylor set a new point-scoring record, breaking [[Daryl Halligan]]'s mark of 2,034.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aubrey|first=Jane|title=2001: Bennett's Coup - 'Operation Alfie'|url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=925222|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=wwos.ninemsn.com.au|date=10 October 2001|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307024803/http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=925222|archivedate=7 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Between 1992 and 2000 (and across three clubs) Taylor played 194 games in succession, also a standing record, 20 games clear of [[Hazem El Masri]]'s 174.\n\nTaylor retired with the record for [[List of NSWRL/ARL/SL/NRL records#Most career points|most career points]] in the [[National Rugby League]] and its predecessors. He scored  2,107 first grade career points, a mark later surpassed by Newcastle Knights halfback [[Andrew Johns]] in July 2006, then again by [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] winger [[Hazem El Masri]] in March 2009. He retired holding the record for most first grade career goals at 942 and was the [[Australian Rugby League]]'s top point-scorer in seasons 1996 and 1997.\n[[File:Jason taylor Not looking happy after 4 Wks of the nrl.jpg|thumb|right|Taylor as coach of the Rabbitohs]]\n\n==Coaching career==\nPreviously the assistant coach at the [[Parramatta Eels]], he was appointed as head coach in May 2006 for the remainder of the season after [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] left the club following the announcement of his sacking for season 2007.  When Taylor took over as Parramatta coach, the club had only won 2 of its first 8 games.  Taylor then guided Parramatta on a 9 game winning streak as the club finished in 8th place on the table and qualified for the finals.  Parramatta were eliminated in the first week of the finals losing to minor premiers Melbourne 12-6.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/eels-set-to-appoint-jason-taylor-as-coach/5017076/|title=Parramatta Eels set to appoint Jason Taylor as coach, chairman Steve Sharp considers standing down|website=www.abc.net.au}}</ref> \n\nIt was already planned that from 2007 Taylor was to join the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] as an assistant coach. In August 2006, it was announced he would replace [[Shaun McRae]] as head coach of the struggling South Sydney club. In his first year at Souths he took them to a top eight finish qualifying them for the finals. It was the first time since 1989 that Souths reached the finals.\n\nOn 17 September 2009 it was announced that Taylor had been sacked as coach by the club due to an altercation with [[rugby league positions#the back row|second-rower]] [[David Fa'alogo]] during end-of-season celebrations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/why-taylor-got-the-top-job/2006/08/30/1156816966936.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| title=Why Taylor got the top job at Souths| date=31 August 2006}}</ref>  A visibly upset Taylor appeared on the [[NRL Footy Show]] later that evening and on a number of sport programs on Sydney radio in the following days to explain his conduct and subsequent dismay at his sacking.<ref>[http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=864625 Taylor at a loss to explain sacking - League - Sport - news.ninemsn.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922220459/http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=864625 |date=22 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Taylor returned to coaching with the [[Sydney Roosters]] [[NRL Under-20s|Toyota Cup (Under-20s)]] team.<ref>{{cite news|author=|work=Courier Mail|title=Former South Sydney coach Jason Taylor to coach Sydney Roosters' Toyota Cup side|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/former-south-sydney-coach-jason-taylor-to-coach-sydney-roosters-toyota-cup-side/story-e6frep5x-1225940769990|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=19 October 2010}}</ref> His team made the semis in both 2011 and 2012.

He was also previously the head coach of the [[Parramatta Eels]], [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] and [[Wests Tigers]] clubs in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL). A [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] representative goal-kicking halfback of the 1990s and early 2000s, Taylor set a number of point-scoring and appearance records in the [[National Rugby League]] during a twelve-year career with the [[Western Suburbs Magpies]], [[North Sydney Bears]], [[Northern Eagles]] and [[Parramatta Eels]].\n\n==Background==\nTaylor was born in [[Sydney, New South Wales, Australia]].\n\nHe spent his junior years at Green Valley JRLFC and the Ashcroft Stallions JRLFC, in Sydney's south-western suburbs. He first attended Ashcroft High School before spending his late teenage years [[St Gregory's College, Campbelltown]].\n\n==Playing career==\nTaylor played for Sydney's [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] from 1990 to 1993. Starting from the bench for the first 2 games of the 1990 season, Taylor spent most of the season playing five-eighth outside [[Ivan Henjak]]. Still a teenager, he was often called \"baby-faced\". In what was a poor season for the Magpies, Taylor was described as \"the best of the babies\" in the NSWRL for the season.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Why the baby-faced Magpie ignores the fancy words| author=John McDonald|date=26 May 1990|page=69}}</ref>\n\n1991 saw the arrival of coach [[Warren Ryan]] and big-name players [[Andrew Farrar]], [[David Gillespie]] and [[Paul Langmack]] at the Magpies. Taylor, now playing halfback, lead the team to its first semi-finals in nine years after starring in a play-off for fifth spot.<ref>{{cite news| work = [[Canberra Times]]| author=\n| title = Magpies survive shootout\n| url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page13009945?zoomLevel=3&&searchTerm=%22trevor%20cogger%22&searchLimits=\n| accessdate = 27 March 2014|date=28 August 1991}}</ref>\n\nWests made the semis again in 1992, but Taylor was temporarily benched mid-season. Ongoing conflict with [[Warren Ryan]] saw Taylor seeking an early release from his contract. The release was not granted and Taylor remained for the 1993 season.<ref>{{cite news| work = [[Canberra Times]]| author=\n| title = Gillespie leads Magpie attack for $200,000\n| url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126975048?searchTerm=%22warren%20ryan%22%20%22jason%20Taylor%22&searchLimits=\n| accessdate = 27 March 2014|date=10 February 1993}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| work = Rugby League Project| author=Alan Whiticker\n| title = Jason Taylor\n| url = http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/jason-taylor/summary.html\n| accessdate = 27 March 2014}}</ref> Taylor said, \"The press came up with some interesting reasons why I wanted to leave, but I prefer to keep most of them to myself because they have been pretty well resolved. One reason, however, was I thought our style of play was too restrictive, too structured and by the end of the year, very predictable. I wasn't the only player to think that way.<ref>{{cite magazine| title = Magpies At War| last = Gillis| first = Steve|magazine= Rugby League Week|page =13| date = 7 July 1993| publisher = ACP Publishing| location = Sydney, NSW}}</ref>\n\nRyan stated in 1993, \"I've made every effort to rectify the things that were buggering him up last year. I did the same thing with [[Benny Elias]] when I was at Balmain. Jason is very, very talented mentally. We've rectified the problem we had and taken every step to resurrect his game. And to his credit when we told him he wouldn't be released he wasn't negative at all. He's done a lot of sprint work and he's worked hard.\"<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Taylor's second chance| author=Paul Kent|date=21 March 1993|page=64}}</ref> Later that season, Ryan suspended Taylor from first grade after an \"outburst\" aimed at teammate [[Paul Langmack]] at half-time in a match. The Wests Magpies board later overturned the suspension.<ref>{{cite news| work= [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | title=Wests deny push is on for Ryan's scalp| author=Daniel Williams|date=1 July 1993|page=48}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Taylor made his representative debut with [[City New South Wales rugby league team|City Origin]], playing from the bench. Described as, \"the form player of the premiership\" in 1994, Country Rugby League general manager David Barnhill claimed that Taylor should be eligible to play for the Country team due to his time spent at St. Gregorys. He ended up playing halfback for City for the next two years.<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=COUNTRY ORIGIN'S POACH BID FOR TAYLOR| first = Steve| last = Mascord| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news940419_0103_9095|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=19 April 1994}}</ref>\n\nTaylor was also selected to play for the [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales team]] in the [[1993 State of Origin series]]. He was chosen on the bench for all three games, but did not take the field in the first game of the series. Coach [[Phil Gould]] said, \"if anything happened to [[Ricky Stuart|Ricky]] we needed a capable and experienced halfback to go in with a similar game-type to Ricky. Jason's kicking and passing game is along the same lines and would allow fellows like [[Laurie Daley|Daley]] and [[Brad Fittler|Fittler]] the same room as if they were playing with Ricky.\"<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=BLUES UNVEIL THEIR LETHAL WEAPONS| first = John| last = MacDonald| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=news930426_0101_9715|accessdate=29 April 2015|date=26 April 1993}}</ref>\n\nTaylor played with the [[North Sydney Bears]] from 1994 to 1999, While at North Sydney, Taylor played a pivotal role in the team and set numerous records.  Taylor also won The Rothmans medal in 1996 as being the game's best and fairest player.  Taylor has scored more points for the [[North Sydney Bears]] than any other player to have been at the club with 1274 points.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/taylor-made-coachs-career-highs-and-lows/2009/09/17/1252780409410.html</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/jason-taylor/summary.html</ref><ref>http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/teams/north-sydney-bears/players.html?pos=&ord=points</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Taylor was escorted from the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] following unruly behavior at an Australian Cricket match. It was alleged that Taylor and some of his North Sydney teammates had been backing up from a bucks party the night before when they proceeded to urinate in plastic cups and throw it over patrons during a Mexican wave.  Taylor was then axed as an Australia Day ambassador by Central Coast organisers.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/news/lhqnews/taylor-made-coachs-career-highs-and-lows/2009/09/17/1252780409410.html</ref>\n\nIn the 1997 preliminary final against the [[Newcastle Knights]], Taylor missed 3 out of 5 conversions in North Sydney's 17-12 defeat.  The most crucial when scores were locked at 12-12 after Taylor set up [[Michael Buettner]] for a try moments before.  With 3 minutes remaining, Norths had a chance to play in their first grand final in 54 years if Taylor could kick that goal.  The normally reliable Taylor missed the conversion and Newcastle player [[Matthew Johns]] went down the other end of the field and kicked a field goal to make it 13-12.  With seconds remaining Norths frantically threw the ball around the field, [[Owen Craigie]] swooped on a loose pass and raced away to score the match winning try to make it 17-12.  This was North Sydney's 4th preliminary final defeat in 6 years.<ref>http://www.weststigersforum.com/viewtopic.php?t=26739</ref>\n\nIn the [[1998 NRL season]], Taylor made 26 appearances as Norths finished 5th on the table.  Taylor played in both finals matches against [[Parramatta Eels|Parramatta]] and [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs|Canterbury-Bankstown]] which ended in defeat.  \n\nTaylor captained Norths in what would be the club's last season in the top grade.  He played in North Sydney's last game in the [[NRL]] which came against [[North Queensland Cowboys|North Queensland]] at the [[Willows Sports Complex]].  Taylor scored 2 tries and kicked 3 goals in a 28-18 victory.\n\nTaylor remained with North Sydney for their merger with the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] to form the [[Northern Eagles]] in 2000, but was released by the club at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/nrl-manly-sea-eagles-north-sydney-bears-brad-fittler/1qighpy90kgzs14n64i43a8xar/|title=Manly Sea Eagles and North Sydney Bears must merge into a 'behemoth' club, says Brad Fittler|website=Sporting News}}</ref>\n\nWithout a club for the next year, Taylor wrote a letter to [[Parramatta Eels]] coach [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] and joined the club for the 2001 season.<ref>{{cite news| work= The Sun-Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=Freeze It Right There| author=[[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]]| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SHD010930ESP8H69P1RQl|accessdate=28 April 2014|date=30 September 2001}}</ref> His performance that year was described as, \"close to the greatest comeback ever in big-time rugby league.\"<ref>{{cite news| work= Sydney Morning Herald| publisher = Fairfax| title=STEVE MASCORD'S GUIDE TO THE NRL GRAND FINAL| first = Steve| last = Mascord| url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&sy=nstore&kw=%22jason+taylor%22&pb=all_ffx&dt=selectRange&dr=entire&so=relevance&sf=text&sf=headline&rc=200&rm=200&sp=nrm&clsPage=1&docID=SMH010928A16UH7SJMNA|accessdate=28 April 2015|date=28 September 2001}}</ref> Taylor's last ever match was for Parramatta at {{rlp|hb}} in their [[2001 NRL grand final]] loss to the [[Newcastle Knights]].\n\nWhilst at Parramatta Taylor set a new point-scoring record, breaking [[Daryl Halligan]]'s mark of 2,034.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aubrey|first=Jane|title=2001: Bennett's Coup - 'Operation Alfie'|url=http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=925222|accessdate=7 March 2014|newspaper=wwos.ninemsn.com.au|date=10 October 2001|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307024803/http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=925222|archivedate=7 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Between 1992 and 2000 (and across three clubs) Taylor played 194 games in succession, also a standing record, 20 games clear of [[Hazem El Masri]]'s 174.\n\nTaylor retired with the record for [[List of NSWRL/ARL/SL/NRL records#Most career points|most career points]] in the [[National Rugby League]] and its predecessors. He scored  2,107 first grade career points, a mark later surpassed by Newcastle Knights halfback [[Andrew Johns]] in July 2006, then again by [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]] winger [[Hazem El Masri]] in March 2009.

When Taylor took over as Parramatta coach, the club had only won 2 of its first 8 games.

It was the first time since 1989 that Souths reached the finals.\n\nOn 17 September 2009 it was announced that Taylor had been sacked as coach by the club due to an altercation with [[rugby league positions#the back row|second-rower]] [[David Fa'alogo]] during end-of-season celebrations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/why-taylor-got-the-top-job/2006/08/30/1156816966936.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| title=Why Taylor got the top job at Souths| date=31 August 2006}}</ref>  A visibly upset Taylor appeared on the [[NRL Footy Show]] later that evening and on a number of sport programs on Sydney radio in the following days to explain his conduct and subsequent dismay at his sacking.<ref>[http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=864625 Taylor at a loss to explain sacking - League - Sport - news.ninemsn.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922220459/http://wwos.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=864625 |date=22 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, Taylor returned to coaching with the [[Sydney Roosters]] [[NRL Under-20s|Toyota Cup (Under-20s)]] team.<ref>{{cite news|author=|work=Courier Mail|title=Former South Sydney coach Jason Taylor to coach Sydney Roosters' Toyota Cup side|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/sport/nrl/former-south-sydney-coach-jason-taylor-to-coach-sydney-roosters-toyota-cup-side/story-e6frep5x-1225940769990|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=19 October 2010}}</ref> His team made the semis in both 2011 and 2012.

He represented both [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]]\n\n==Playing career==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nFolkes, who was Captain of Punchbowl Boys' High School, came from the Bankstown Sports Junior Rugby League Club. He played 245 first grade games and 308 grade games for the Bulldogs between 1978 and 1991, as well as 24 games for [[Hull F.C.]] in England.\n\nHe also represented [[New South Wales state rugby league team|New South Wales]] on nine occasions in [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] football. At the end of the [[1986 NSWRL season]], he went on the [[1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. He played a total of five Tests between 1986 and 1988. As a player, Folkes played in 6 Grand Finals (1979, 80, 84, 85, 86 and 88) winning on four occasions.\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter serving as reserve grade coach of the Bulldogs between 1996 and 1997, Folkes was appointed coach of the Bulldogs to succeed [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]]. In his first year as coach, the Bulldogs made the [[1998 NRL grand final]], where they lost to [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]]'s [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe Bulldogs appeared poised to claim the [[2002 NRL premiership]] but were disqualified and stripped 37 premiership points after a major salary cap breach was uncovered. Folkes claimed his premiership two seasons later with a 16&ndash;13 victory over the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the grand final.\n\nSteve Folkes was awarded [[Dally M Medal|Dally M]] ''Coach of the Year'' in 2004.\n\nThe [[National Rugby League season 2004#Grand final|2004 grand final]] victory continued a unique tradition at the Bulldogs: Every coach appointed by the club since 1978 ([[Ted Glossop]], [[Warren Ryan]], [[Phil Gould (rugby league)|Phil Gould]], [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] and Folkes) has won a premiership. At the end of the 2007 season, Folkes' win record with the Bulldogs was 60%. \nOn 7 April 2008, the Bulldogs announced that Folkes tenure as would end with the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=News Limited|title=Folkes to call it quits|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,,23498064-23209,00.html|accessdate=2008-10-04|date=2008-04-07}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his departure from the Bulldogs, Folkes took up a position as strength and conditioning coach for the West Indies cricket team.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/cricket/steve-folkes-joins-west-indies/2008/10/30/1224956181300.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| title=Steve Folkes joins West Indies| date=2008-10-30}}</ref> In October 2009, Folkes returned to rugby league, accepting the role of strength and conditioning coach for the [[Wests Tigers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/folkes-set-to-return-with-tigers/story-e6frg7mo-1225773260491| first=Brent| last=Read| title=Folkes set to return with Tigers| date=2009-09-15| work=The Australian}}</ref> In 2011, he was an assistant coach with the club.\n\nIt was announced in May 2011 that Folkes would join the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] as the assistant coach to Steve Price from 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theleader.com.au/news/national/national/sport/folkes-leaves-tigers-for-dragons/2160033.aspx| work=The Leader| title=Folkes leaves Tigers for Dragons| date=2011-05-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Folkes was appointed head coach for the [[Australia women's national rugby league team]].<ref>http://www.nrl.com/folkes-appointed-as-jillaroos-head-coach/tabid/10874/newsid/80753/default.aspx</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nFolkes was married to Karen, the daughter of Bulldogs 'godfather', [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]].

As a player, Folkes played in 6 Grand Finals (1979, 80, 84, 85, 86 and 88) winning on four occasions.\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter serving as reserve grade coach of the Bulldogs between 1996 and 1997, Folkes was appointed coach of the Bulldogs to succeed [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]]. In his first year as coach, the Bulldogs made the [[1998 NRL grand final]], where they lost to [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]]'s [[Brisbane Broncos]].\n\nThe Bulldogs appeared poised to claim the [[2002 NRL premiership]] but were disqualified and stripped 37 premiership points after a major salary cap breach was uncovered. Folkes claimed his premiership two seasons later with a 16&ndash;13 victory over the [[Sydney Roosters]] in the grand final.\n\nSteve Folkes was awarded [[Dally M Medal|Dally M]] ''Coach of the Year'' in 2004.\n\nThe [[National Rugby League season 2004#Grand final|2004 grand final]] victory continued a unique tradition at the Bulldogs: Every coach appointed by the club since 1978 ([[Ted Glossop]], [[Warren Ryan]], [[Phil Gould]], [[Chris Anderson (rugby league)|Chris Anderson]] and Folkes) has won a premiership. At the end of the 2007 season, Folkes' win record with the Bulldogs was 60%. \nOn 7 April 2008, the Bulldogs announced that Folkes tenure as would end with the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=News Limited|title=Folkes to call it quits|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,,23498064-23209,00.html|accessdate=2008-10-04|date=2008-04-07}}</ref>\n\nFollowing his departure from the Bulldogs, Folkes took up a position as strength and conditioning coach for the West Indies cricket team.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/sport/cricket/steve-folkes-joins-west-indies/2008/10/30/1224956181300.html| work=The Sydney Morning Herald| title=Steve Folkes joins West Indies| date=2008-10-30}}</ref> In October 2009, Folkes returned to rugby league, accepting the role of strength and conditioning coach for the [[Wests Tigers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/folkes-set-to-return-with-tigers/story-e6frg7mo-1225773260491| first=Brent| last=Read| title=Folkes set to return with Tigers| date=2009-09-15| work=The Australian}}</ref> In 2011, he was an assistant coach with the club.\n\nIt was announced in May 2011 that Folkes would join the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]] as the assistant coach to Steve Price from 2012.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theleader.com.au/news/national/national/sport/folkes-leaves-tigers-for-dragons/2160033.aspx| work=The Leader| title=Folkes leaves Tigers for Dragons| date=2011-05-11}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Folkes was appointed head coach for the [[Australia women's national rugby league team]].<ref>http://www.nrl.com/folkes-appointed-as-jillaroos-head-coach/tabid/10874/newsid/80753/default.aspx</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nFolkes was married to Karen, the daughter of Bulldogs 'godfather', [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]].
