The present administrative centre is [[Keylong]] in Lahaul. Before the two districts were merged, [[Kardang]] was the capital of Lahaul, and [[Dhankar Gompa|Dhankar]] the capital of Spiti. The district was formed in 1960, and is the fourth least populous district in India (out of [[List of districts in India by population|640]]).<ref name=\"districtcensus\">{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref>\n\n''Kunzum la'' or the [[Kunzum Pass]] (altitude {{convert|4551|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is the entrance pass to the [[Spiti Valley]] from Lahaul. It is {{convert|21|km|mile|abbr=on}} from [[Chandra Tal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.india9.com/i9show/Kunzum-Pass-18725.htm|title=Kunzum Pass|work=india9.com}}</ref> This district is connected to [[Manali, Himachal Pradesh|Manali]] through the [[Rohtang Pass]]. To the south, Spiti ends {{convert|24|km|mile|abbr=on}} from [[Tabo, Himachal Pradesh|Tabo]], at the Sumdo where the road enters [[Kinnaur]] and joins with National Highway No. 5.<ref>{{Cite book|last=[[#BiblioKapadia99|Kapadia (1999)]]|title=pp. 215-216}}</ref>\n\nThe two valleys are quite different in character. Spiti is more barren and difficult to cross, with an average elevation of the valley floor of {{convert|4270|m|ft|abbr=on}}. It is enclosed between lofty ranges, with the Spiti river rushing out of a gorge in the southeast to meet the Sutlej River. It is a typical mountain desert area with an average annual rainfall of only {{convert|170|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book|last=[[#BiblioKapadia99|Kapadia (1999)]]|title=pp. 26-27}}</ref>\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nThe harsh conditions of Lahaul permit only scattered tufts of hardy grasses and shrubs to grow, even below {{convert|4|km|ft|abbr=on}}. Glacier lines are usually found at {{convert|5|km|ft|abbr=on}}. Due to certain changes in climate, nowadays people are being able to grow some vegetables in the Lahaul valley e.g. cabbage, potato, green peas, radish, tomato, carrot and all types of leafy vegetables. The main cash crops are potatoes, cabbage, and green peas.\n\nThe valley has [[snow leopard]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raachotrekkers.com/spiti-snow-leopard-trail-winter-in-kinnaur-spiti/|title=Snow Leopard Sightings Rising in Spiti valley|last=|first=|date=|website=Raacho Trekkers|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, [[fox]]es [[ibex]], [[Himalayan brown bear]], [[Musk Deer]], and Himalayan blue sheep. There are two important protected areas in the region that are home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Animals such as [[yaks]] and [[dzo]]s roam across the wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a decrease in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the [[Tibetan antelope]], [[argali]], [[kiang]]s, [[musk deer]], and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, the locals of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.\n\nApart from the exotic wildlife, the Valley of Spiti is also known for its wealth of flora and the profusion of wild flowers. Some of the most common species found here include ''Causinia thomsonii'', ''Seseli trilobum'', ''Crepis flexuosa'', ''Caragana brevifolia'' and ''Krascheninikovia ceratoides''. Then there are more than 62 species of medicinal plants found here.\n\n== People ==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}{{historical populations|11=1901|12=12,392|13=1911|14=12,981|15=1921|16=12,836|17=1931|18=13,733|19=1941|20=14,594|21=1951|22=15,338|23=1961|24=23,682|25=1971|26=27,568|27=1981|28=32,100|29=1991|30=31,294|31=2001|32=33,224|33=2011|34=31,564|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}[[File:Gandhala- mother & child 28-6-04.jpg|thumb|left|180 px|Mother and child near [[Gandhola Monastery]], 2004]]\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Lahaul and Spiti district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 31,564.

Generally, the Lahaulis are of [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]], while the Spiti [[Bhot]] are more similar to the Tibetans, owing to their proximity to Tibet. The district has a Himachal Pradesh state legislative law in place to curb antique loot, by suspecting travellers given past incidences. In pre-independence era, the ethnic tribal belt was into the British lahaul and the chamba lahaul, which was merged with Punjab post 1947. This is the second largest district in the Indian union.\n\nThe language spoken by both the Lahauli and Spiti is [[Spiti Bhoti]], a [[Tibetic languages|Tibetic]] language of the [[Lahuli\u2013Spiti languages|Western Innovative subgroup]]. They are very similar to the [[Ladakh]]i and [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] culturally, as they had been placed under the rule of the [[Guge]] and [[Ladakh]] kingdoms at occasional intervals.\n\nAmong the Lahaulis, the family acts as the basic unit of kinship. The extended family system is common, evolved from the [[polyandry|polyandric]] system of the past. The family is headed by a senior male member, known as the Yunda, while his wife, known as the Yundamo, attains authority by being the oldest member in the generation. The [[clan]] system, also known as Rhus, plays another major role in the Lahauli society.\n\nThe Spiti [[Bhot]] community has an inheritance system that is otherwise unique to the Tibetans. Upon the death of both parents, only the eldest son will inherit the family property, while the eldest daughter inherits the mother's jewellery, and the younger siblings inherit nothing. Men usually fall back on the social security system of the [[Himalayas|Trans-Himalayan]] Gompas.\n\n=== Lifestyle ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nThe lifestyles of the Lahauli and Spiti Bhot are similar, owing to their proximity. [[Polyandry]] was widely practiced by the Lahaulis in the past, although this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot do not generally practice polyandry any more, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions.\n\nDivorces are accomplished by a simple ceremony performed in the presence of village elders. Divorce can be sought by either partner. The husband has to pay compensation to his ex-wife if she does not remarry. However, this is uncommon among the Lahaulis.\n\nAgriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato farming is common. Occupations include animal husbandry, working in government programs, government services, and other businesses and crafts that include weaving. Houses are constructed in the Tibetan architectural style, as the land in Lahul and Spiti is mountainous and quite prone to earthquakes. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lahaulspititravel.com/references/|title=References - Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|work=Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Ki-Gompa Spiti.jpg|right|thumb|[[Key Monastery|Ki-Gompa]], [[Spiti]]]]\n\nMost of the Lahaulis follow a combination of [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Gelugpa]] order. Within Lahoul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul towards Ladhakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti. This bas-relief, of marble, depicts the Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of the Buddha's compassion) in a stylized seated position; Hindu devotees take it to be Shiva Nataraj, Shiva dancing. This image appears to be of sixteenth-century Chamba craftsmanship. It was created to replace the original black stone image of the deity, which became damaged by art looters. This original image is kept beneath the plinth of the shrine. It appears to be of 12th century Kashmiri provenance. Much of the art thieves are active in this remote belt because of neglected gompas and temples. Raja Ghepan, one of the major deities is greatly worshipped by almost all Lahauli.\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Lahaul and Spiti\n| titlebar = #Fcd116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|gold|62.01}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|orange|36.91}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christians|Christian]]|dodgerblue|0.67}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.41}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br />\n\u2020{{small|Includes [[Muslim]]s (0.23%).}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |title=Census of India: District Profile |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113144353/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\nBefore the spread of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the people were adherents of the religion 'Lung Pe Chhoi', an animistic religion that had some affinities with the [[B\u00f6n]] religion of [[Tibet]].  While the religion flourished, animal and human sacrifices were regularly offered up to the 'Iha', a term that refers to evil spirits residing in the natural world, notably in the old pencil-cedar trees, rocks, and caves. Vestiges of the Lung Pe Chhoi religion can be seen in the behaviour of the [[Lama]]s, who are believed to possess certain supernatural powers.\n\nThe [[Losar]] festival (also known as Halda in Lahauli) is celebrated between the months of January and February. The date of celebration is decided by the [[Lama]]s. It has the same significance as the [[Diwali]] festival of [[Hinduism]], but is celebrated in a Tibetan fashion.\n\nAt the start of the festival, two or three persons from every household will come holding burning incense. The burning sticks are then piled into a bonfire. The people will then pray to Shiskar Apa, the goddess of wealth (other name [[Vasudhara]]) in the Buddhist religion.\n\n== Tourism ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Ki gompa-3.jpg|thumb|[[Key Monastery]], is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery located on top of a hill at an altitude of {{Convert|4166|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Sarina Singh|display-authors=etal|year=2007|title=??correct title??

This monastery rose to prominence when it celebrated its thousandth year of existence in 1996. It houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist statues and [[Thangka]]s. The ancient gompa is finished with mud plaster, and contains several scriptures and documents. Lama Dzangpo heads the gompa here. There is a modern guest house with a dining hall and all facilities are available.\n\nAnother gompa, [[Kardang Monastery]], is located at an elevation of 3,500 metres across the river, about 8&nbsp;km from [[Keylong]]. Kardang is well connected by the road via the Tandi bridge which is about 14&nbsp;km from Keylong.  Built in the 12th century, this monastery houses a large library of Buddhist literature including the main [[Kangyur]] and [[Tangyur]] scriptures.\n\nThe treacherous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors to tour only between the months of June to October, when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from [[Kinnaur]] (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.\n\n=== Buddhist monasteries ===\nSpiti is one of the important centers of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh. It is popularly known as the 'land of lamas'. The valley is dotted by numerous Buddhist Monasteries or Gompas.\n\n'''Kye Monastery:'''\n[[Kye Monastery]] is one of the main learning centres of Buddhist studies in Spiti. The monastery is house to some 100 odd monks who receive education here. It is the oldest and biggest monastery in Spiti. It houses rare paintings and scriptures of Buddha and other gods and goddess. There are also rare 'Thangka' paintings and ancient musical instruments 'trumpets, cymbals, and drums in the monastery.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Tabo Monastery:'''\nPerched at an altitude of 3050 meters, Tabo Monastery is often referred to as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas'. The 10th century Tabo Monastery was founded by the great scholar, Richen Zangpo. The monastery houses more than 60 lamas and contains the rare collection of scriptures, pieces of art, wall paintings -Thankas and Stucco.\n\n=== Adventure activities ===\n\n'''To-do-Trails:'''\nFor trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, offering challenging treks to explore the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks take people to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also where you have to cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name.{{tone-inline|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Skiing:'''\nSkiing is the popular adventure sports in Spiti.\n\n'''Yak Safari:'''\n[[Yak]] can be used to see the flora and fauna of trans-Himalayan desert.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nAerail view of Lahaul valley in winter.JPG|Lahaul Valley in winter\nLahaul Valley,Himachal Pradesh,India.jpg|Waterfall near Udaipur town in Lahaul Valley\nMountain peaks, Lahul.jpg|Mountain peak\nKunzum Pass between Lahaul & Spiti.jpg|[[Kunzum Pass]] between Lahul and Spiti\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of highest towns by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Ciliberto, Jonathan.

The present administrative centre is [[Keylong]] in Lahaul. Before the two districts were merged, [[Kardang]] was the capital of Lahaul, and [[Dhankar Gompa|Dhankar]] the capital of Spiti. The district was formed in 1960, and is the fourth least populous district in India (out of [[List of districts in India by population|640]]).<ref name=\"districtcensus\">{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref>\n\n''Kunzum la'' or the [[Kunzum Pass]] (altitude {{convert|4551|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is the entrance pass to the [[Spiti Valley]] from Lahaul.

Due to certain changes in climate, nowadays people are being able to grow some vegetables in the Lahaul valley e.g. cabbage, potato, green peas, radish, tomato, carrot and all types of leafy vegetables.

There are two important protected areas in the region that are home to snow leopard and its prey including the Pin Valley National Park and Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary. Animals such as [[yaks]] and [[dzo]]s roam across the wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a decrease in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the [[Tibetan antelope]], [[argali]], [[kiang]]s, [[musk deer]], and snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. Surprisingly, due to ardent religious beliefs, the locals of Spiti do not hunt these wild animals.\n\nApart from the exotic wildlife, the Valley of Spiti is also known for its wealth of flora and the profusion of wild flowers. Some of the most common species found here include ''Causinia thomsonii'', ''Seseli trilobum'', ''Crepis flexuosa'', ''Caragana brevifolia'' and ''Krascheninikovia ceratoides''.

[[Polyandry]] was widely practiced by the Lahaulis in the past, although this practice has been dying out. The Spiti Bhot do not generally practice polyandry any more, although it is accepted in a few isolated regions.\n\nDivorces are accomplished by a simple ceremony performed in the presence of village elders. Divorce can be sought by either partner. The husband has to pay compensation to his ex-wife if she does not remarry. However, this is uncommon among the Lahaulis.\n\nAgriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato farming is common. Occupations include animal husbandry, working in government programs, government services, and other businesses and crafts that include weaving. Houses are constructed in the Tibetan architectural style, as the land in Lahul and Spiti is mountainous and quite prone to earthquakes. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lahaulspititravel.com/references/|title=References - Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|work=Lahaul Spiti Travel - Lahaul Spiti Tourist Guide|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Ki-Gompa Spiti.jpg|right|thumb|[[Key Monastery|Ki-Gompa]], [[Spiti]]]]\n\nMost of the Lahaulis follow a combination of [[Hinduism]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Drukpa Kagyu]] order, while the Spiti Bhotia follow [[Tibetan Buddhism]] of the [[Gelugpa]] order. Within Lahoul, the Todh-Gahr (upper region of Lahaul towards Ladhakh) region had the strongest Buddhist influence, owing to its close proximity to Spiti. This bas-relief, of marble, depicts the Buddhist deity Avalokiteshvara (the embodiment of the Buddha's compassion) in a stylized seated position; Hindu devotees take it to be Shiva Nataraj, Shiva dancing. This image appears to be of sixteenth-century Chamba craftsmanship. It was created to replace the original black stone image of the deity, which became damaged by art looters. This original image is kept beneath the plinth of the shrine. It appears to be of 12th century Kashmiri provenance. Much of the art thieves are active in this remote belt because of neglected gompas and temples. Raja Ghepan, one of the major deities is greatly worshipped by almost all Lahauli.\n\n{{bar box\n| title    = Religions in Lahaul and Spiti\n| titlebar = #Fcd116\n| left1    = Religion\n| right1   = Percent\n| float    = right\n| bars     = \n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|gold|62.01}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|orange|36.91}}\n{{bar percent|[[Christians|Christian]]|dodgerblue|0.67}}\n{{bar percent|Others|black|0.41}}\n| caption = Distribution of religions<br />\n\u2020{{small|Includes [[Muslim]]s (0.23%).}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |title=Census of India: District Profile |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113144353/http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/Basic_Data_Sheet.aspx |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n}}\n\nBefore the spread of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], the people were adherents of the religion 'Lung Pe Chhoi', an animistic religion that had some affinities with the [[B\u00f6n]] religion of [[Tibet]].  While the religion flourished, animal and human sacrifices were regularly offered up to the 'Iha', a term that refers to evil spirits residing in the natural world, notably in the old pencil-cedar trees, rocks, and caves. Vestiges of the Lung Pe Chhoi religion can be seen in the behaviour of the [[Lama]]s, who are believed to possess certain supernatural powers.\n\nThe [[Losar]] festival (also known as Halda in Lahauli) is celebrated between the months of January and February. The date of celebration is decided by the [[Lama]]s. It has the same significance as the [[Diwali]] festival of [[Hinduism]], but is celebrated in a Tibetan fashion.\n\nAt the start of the festival, two or three persons from every household will come holding burning incense. The burning sticks are then piled into a bonfire. The people will then pray to Shiskar Apa, the goddess of wealth (other name [[Vasudhara]]) in the Buddhist religion.\n\n== Tourism ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:Ki gompa-3.jpg|thumb|[[Key Monastery]], is a [[Tibetan Buddhist]] monastery located on top of a hill at an altitude of {{Convert|4166|m|ft|0}} above [[sea level]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Sarina Singh|display-authors=etal|year=2007|title=??correct title?? Lonely Planet Guide|edition=??|publisher=Lonely Planet|page=343}}</ref>]]\nThe natural scenery and Buddhist monasteries, such as [[Ki Gompa|Kye]], [[Dhankar Gompa|Dhankar]], Shashur, [[Guru Ghantal]], Khungri Monastery in [[Pin Valley]], Tnagyud Gompa of the Sakya Sect in [[Komic]], Sherkhang Gompa in Lahlung (believed to be older than Tabo Monastery), the only Buddhist Mummy of a Monk in Gue around 550 years old and [[Chandra Taal|Chandra Taal Lake]] are the main tourist attractions of the region.\n\nOne of the most interesting places is the [[Tabo Monastery]], located 45&nbsp;km from [[Kaza, Himachal Pradesh]], the capital of the Spiti region. This monastery rose to prominence when it celebrated its thousandth year of existence in 1996. It houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist statues and [[Thangka]]s. The ancient gompa is finished with mud plaster, and contains several scriptures and documents. Lama Dzangpo heads the gompa here. There is a modern guest house with a dining hall and all facilities are available.\n\nAnother gompa, [[Kardang Monastery]], is located at an elevation of 3,500 metres across the river, about 8&nbsp;km from [[Keylong]]. Kardang is well connected by the road via the Tandi bridge which is about 14&nbsp;km from Keylong.  Built in the 12th century, this monastery houses a large library of Buddhist literature including the main [[Kangyur]] and [[Tangyur]] scriptures.\n\nThe treacherous weather in Lahaul and Spiti permits visitors to tour only between the months of June to October, when the roads and villages are free of snow and the high passes (Rothang La and Kunzum La) are open. It is possible to access Spiti from [[Kinnaur]] (along the Sutlej) all through the year, although the road is sometimes temporarily closed by landslides or avalanches.\n\n=== Buddhist monasteries ===\nSpiti is one of the important centers of Buddhism in Himachal Pradesh. It is popularly known as the 'land of lamas'. The valley is dotted by numerous Buddhist Monasteries or Gompas.\n\n'''Kye Monastery:'''\n[[Kye Monastery]] is one of the main learning centres of Buddhist studies in Spiti. The monastery is house to some 100 odd monks who receive education here. It is the oldest and biggest monastery in Spiti. It houses rare paintings and scriptures of Buddha and other gods and goddess. There are also rare 'Thangka' paintings and ancient musical instruments 'trumpets, cymbals, and drums in the monastery.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Tabo Monastery:'''\nPerched at an altitude of 3050 meters, Tabo Monastery is often referred to as the 'Ajanta of the Himalayas'. The 10th century Tabo Monastery was founded by the great scholar, Richen Zangpo. The monastery houses more than 60 lamas and contains the rare collection of scriptures, pieces of art, wall paintings -Thankas and Stucco.\n\n=== Adventure activities ===\n\n'''To-do-Trails:'''\nFor trekkers, the Spiti Valley is a paradise, offering challenging treks to explore the new heights of the Himalayas. The treks take people to the most remote areas including the rugged villages and old Gompas followed by the exotic wildlife trails. Some of the trekking routes in the area include Kaza-Langza-Hikim-Komic-Kaza, Kaza-Ki-Kibber-Gete-Kaza, Kaza-Losar-Kunzum La and Kaza-Tabo-Sumdo-Nako. There are some very high altitude treks also where you have to cross passes- like Parangla Pass (connecting Ladakh with Spiti Valley), Pin Parvati Pass, Baba Pass, Hamta Pass trek, Spiti Left Bank Trek are few to name.{{tone-inline|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Skiing:'''\nSkiing is the popular adventure sports in Spiti.\n\n'''Yak Safari:'''\n[[Yak]] can be used to see the flora and fauna of trans-Himalayan desert.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nAerail view of Lahaul valley in winter.JPG|Lahaul Valley in winter\nLahaul Valley,Himachal Pradesh,India.jpg|Waterfall near Udaipur town in Lahaul Valley\nMountain peaks, Lahul.jpg|Mountain peak\nKunzum Pass between Lahaul & Spiti.jpg|[[Kunzum Pass]] between Lahul and Spiti\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of highest towns by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Full References ==\n* Ciliberto, Jonathan.

The rails are engineered to be twice as strong as typical A-36 structural beams and have a hardened, raised tread track, providing a longer life and reduced wear on the wheels. Utilizing patented track rails also significantly eases the installation process.<ref name=\"MHI\" /> The rails are inspected and straightened in factories, which reduces the need to manipulate the beams during installation and startup. In most cases, there is no welding involved in the installation process. All splices are joined with bolted [[splice joint]]s. Also, rails are cut with a slight taper on the ends, which allows for tight joints at the bottom of a splice allowing for a smooth transition between beams. Patented track rails were also designed specifically to be supported from the building. Not requiring a duplicate structure or columns allows for increased flexibility when maneuvering material.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to the strength, versatility, reliability, and prolonged life of the patented track rail, there are many applications where patented track rails are preferred over structural beams.<ref name=\"ETvsPT\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* ANSI MH27.2-2017 -\u00a0[http://www.mhi.org/mma/specifications ''Enclosed Track Underhung Cranes and Monorail Systems'']\n* ASME B30.11 -\u00a0[https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/asme/asmeb30112010?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW13y2-0XK4c_Z9aB89zIqLH4UXybuZ_w2O6llVI9ZbX6eDQHbF44IBoC82sQAvD_BwE ''Monorail and Underhung Cranes'']\n* ASME B30.16 -\u00a0[https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/ASME/ASMEB30162017?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRWxRPl1Aa3FpDQcrRWn7A2Y9u0A_tc7sDwqxfoYQLU3DYz5iFu1D9mBoCq2cQAvD_BwE ''Overhead Hoists (Underhung)'']\n* ASME B30.20 - [https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/ASME/ASMEB30202018?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW1fhBU5P3SlF6Y4hePH8QEOu-QMvyWpSaB2WVQdsU9z273syEbvniRoCsQAQAvD_BwE ''Below-the Hook Lifting Devices'']\n* ASME HST-1 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-1-performance-standard-electric-chain-hoists ''Performance Standard for Electric Chain Hoist'']\n* ASME HST-2 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-2-performance-standard-hand-chain-manually-operated-chain-hoists ''Performance Standard for Hand Chain Manually Operated Chain Hoists'']\n* ASME HST-4 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-4-performance-standard-overhead-electric-wire-rope-hoists ''Performance Standard for Overhead Electric Wire Hoists'']\n* ASME HST-5 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-5-performance-standard-air-chain-hoists ''Performance Standard for Air Chain Hoists'']\n* ASME HST-6 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-6-performance-standard-air-wire-rope-hoists ''Performance Standard for Air Wire Rope Hoists'']\n* ANSI Z535.4 -\u00a0[https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/NEMA/ANSIZ5352011R2017-1668874?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW-5piF2B3Bv5BZ6gqzaDQlaHjig98G2apoGHo50FHBh1XgJ46GhT4BoCkRMQAvD_BwE ''Product Safety Signs and Labels'']\n* NFPA 70 -\u00a0[https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=70 ''National Electric Code'']\n* AISC -\u00a0[https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/aisc/manual/15th-ed-ref-list/load-and-resistance-factor-design-specification-for-structural-steel-buildings.pdf ''AISC manual of Steel Construction: Load and Resistance Factor Design'']\n* AISC -\u00a0[https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/aisc/manual/15th-ed-ref-list/load-and-resistance-factor-design-specification-for-structural-steel-buildings.pdf ''AISC manual of Steel Construction: Allowable Stress Design'']\n* NEMA ICS 6 -\u00a0[https://www.nema.org/Standards/SecureDocuments/ICS-6-R2001-R2006.pdf ''Industrial Controls and Systems: Enclosures'']\n* ANSI/AWS D1.1 -\u00a0[https://www.aws.org/certification/detail/aws-d11-structural-welding-steel ''Structural Welding Code-Steel'']\n* ANSI/AWS D14.1 - [https://pubs.aws.org/Download_PDFS/D14.1-D14.1M-2005PV.pdf ''Specification for Welding of Industrial and Mill Cranes and other Material\u00a0Handling Equipment'']\n* ASTM E2349-05 -\u00a0[https://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/HISTORICAL/E2349-05.htm ''Safety Requirements in Metal Casting Operations: Sand Preparation, Molding and Core Making; Melting and Pouring, and Cleaning & Finishing'']\n\n[[Category:Machinery]]\n[[Category:Cranes by type]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Type of track}}\nA '''patented track crane'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhi.org/glossary?q=%22Patented+track%22&pb=1&fq=&sort=score+desc|title=Glossary|website=www.mhi.org|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhi.org/mma|title=MMA|website=www.mhi.org|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> is a [[crane (machine)|crane]] with a bottom [[flange]] of hardened steel and a raised tread to improve rolling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dearborncrane.com/pdf/bridge_cranes/134-What%20is%20a%20Patented%20Track%20Crane.pdf|title=What is a patented track crane?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn 1867, William Louden was issued a patent for a hay carrier.<ref name=\"Louden\">{{Cite web|url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/64500169_text|title=Louden Machining History|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Rerolled from old car rails, this system handled loads of approximately {{Convert|250|lb|kg|abbr=}} and was suspended by hairpin-shaped hanger rods nailed to the exposed barn rafters.

Webb]] Company, was acquired and became part of TC/American Monorail.<ref name=\"TCA\" /> \n\n==Characteristics==\nPatented track rails are engineered specifically for [[overhead crane]]s and [[monorail]]s.<ref name=\"MHI\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mhi.org/fundamentals/monorails?|title=Monorail Systems / Workstation Cranes|website=www.mhi.org|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref><ref name=\"ETvsPT\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spanco.com/enclosed-track-vs-patented-track/|title=Enclosed Track VS Patented Track|date=2019-07-02|website=Spanco|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> Unlike a symmetrical structural rail, the material in a patented track rail is placed where it is most effective allowing for a significant reduction in weight. The rails are engineered to be twice as strong as typical A-36 structural beams and have a hardened, raised tread track, providing a longer life and reduced wear on the wheels. Utilizing patented track rails also significantly eases the installation process.<ref name=\"MHI\" /> The rails are inspected and straightened in factories, which reduces the need to manipulate the beams during installation and startup. In most cases, there is no welding involved in the installation process. All splices are joined with bolted [[splice joint]]s. Also, rails are cut with a slight taper on the ends, which allows for tight joints at the bottom of a splice allowing for a smooth transition between beams. Patented track rails were also designed specifically to be supported from the building. Not requiring a duplicate structure or columns allows for increased flexibility when maneuvering material.\n\n==Applications==\nDue to the strength, versatility, reliability, and prolonged life of the patented track rail, there are many applications where patented track rails are preferred over structural beams.<ref name=\"ETvsPT\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* ANSI MH27.2-2017 -\u00a0[http://www.mhi.org/mma/specifications ''Enclosed Track Underhung Cranes and Monorail Systems'']\n* ASME B30.11 -\u00a0[https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/asme/asmeb30112010?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW13y2-0XK4c_Z9aB89zIqLH4UXybuZ_w2O6llVI9ZbX6eDQHbF44IBoC82sQAvD_BwE ''Monorail and Underhung Cranes'']\n* ASME B30.16 -\u00a0[https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/ASME/ASMEB30162017?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRWxRPl1Aa3FpDQcrRWn7A2Y9u0A_tc7sDwqxfoYQLU3DYz5iFu1D9mBoCq2cQAvD_BwE ''Overhead Hoists (Underhung)'']\n* ASME B30.20 - [https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/ASME/ASMEB30202018?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW1fhBU5P3SlF6Y4hePH8QEOu-QMvyWpSaB2WVQdsU9z273syEbvniRoCsQAQAvD_BwE ''Below-the Hook Lifting Devices'']\n* ASME HST-1 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-1-performance-standard-electric-chain-hoists ''Performance Standard for Electric Chain Hoist'']\n* ASME HST-2 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-2-performance-standard-hand-chain-manually-operated-chain-hoists ''Performance Standard for Hand Chain Manually Operated Chain Hoists'']\n* ASME HST-4 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-4-performance-standard-overhead-electric-wire-rope-hoists ''Performance Standard for Overhead Electric Wire Hoists'']\n* ASME HST-5 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-5-performance-standard-air-chain-hoists ''Performance Standard for Air Chain Hoists'']\n* ASME HST-6 -\u00a0[https://www.asme.org/codes-standards/find-codes-standards/hst-6-performance-standard-air-wire-rope-hoists ''Performance Standard for Air Wire Rope Hoists'']\n* ANSI Z535.4 -\u00a0[https://webstore.ansi.org/Standards/NEMA/ANSIZ5352011R2017-1668874?gclid=CjwKCAjw5_DsBRBPEiwAIEDRW-5piF2B3Bv5BZ6gqzaDQlaHjig98G2apoGHo50FHBh1XgJ46GhT4BoCkRMQAvD_BwE ''Product Safety Signs and Labels'']\n* NFPA 70 -\u00a0[https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=70 ''National Electric Code'']\n* AISC -\u00a0[https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/aisc/manual/15th-ed-ref-list/load-and-resistance-factor-design-specification-for-structural-steel-buildings.pdf ''AISC manual of Steel Construction: Load and Resistance Factor Design'']\n* AISC -\u00a0[https://www.aisc.org/globalassets/aisc/manual/15th-ed-ref-list/load-and-resistance-factor-design-specification-for-structural-steel-buildings.pdf ''AISC manual of Steel Construction: Allowable Stress Design'']\n* NEMA ICS 6 -\u00a0[https://www.nema.org/Standards/SecureDocuments/ICS-6-R2001-R2006.pdf ''Industrial Controls and Systems: Enclosures'']\n* ANSI/AWS D1.1 -\u00a0[https://www.aws.org/certification/detail/aws-d11-structural-welding-steel ''Structural Welding Code-Steel'']\n* ANSI/AWS D14.1 - [https://pubs.aws.org/Download_PDFS/D14.1-D14.1M-2005PV.pdf ''Specification for Welding of Industrial and Mill Cranes and other Material\u00a0Handling Equipment'']\n* ASTM E2349-05 -\u00a0[https://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/HISTORICAL/E2349-05.htm ''Safety Requirements in Metal Casting Operations: Sand Preparation, Molding and Core Making; Melting and Pouring, and Cleaning & Finishing'']\n\n[[Category:Machinery]]\n[[Category:Cranes by type]]\n", "name_user": "Adavidb", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changingshort descriptionfrom \"Type of track\" to \"Type of crane\" (Shortdesc helper)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patented_track_crane"}
