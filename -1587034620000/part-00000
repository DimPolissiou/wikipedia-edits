At that time, it was a minimalist ICQ clone and officially called Miranda ICQ. The first public release, version 0.0.1, was released on 6 February 2000. This release used LibICQ, had no support for message history, database, and [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], and had a distribution size of less than 100 KB.\n\nA major new feature of version 0.0.4 was the [[MegaHAL]] chat bot, which enabled automatic chatting between Miranda and other ICQ users. Plugin support was added with version 0.0.6. ''Logger Plugin'' was the first plugin bundled with the official release.\n\n===Version 0.1.x===\nAfter the release of version 0.0.6.1 on 26 December 2000, the original developers left, and Richard \"cyreve\" Hughes took over the project. His first release, version 0.1.0.0 on 8 April 2001 was improved through a major rewrite. The split message dialog bundled with this release became the first messaging module to be put into a plugin. The .Net Messenger Service protocol plugin appeared around the time of version 0.1.1.0 release becoming the second messaging protocol to be supported by Miranda. This was also the first official release to support language pack translations. Miranda hence had multi-protocol, multi-language instant messenger features.\n\nAfter v0.1.0.0, Miranda plugin development grew rapidly. With version 0.1.2.1 (28 February 2002), there were approximately 50 plugins available. At the time the new ''Lizard'' plugin enabled skinning support; the only time Miranda supported skins. ''Lizard'' development stopped soon after, due to the instability it caused.\n\n===Version 0.2.x===\nAfter the mysterious disappearance of cyreve in June 2002,<ref>[http://osdir.com/Downloads+index-req-viewdownloaddetails-lid-156-ttitle-Miranda_IM.phtml Miranda IM] ''osdir.com'' [[Open Source Software Directory]].</ref> the developers Martin \u00d6berg (Strickz), Robert Rainwater (rainwater), Sam K (egoDust), and Lyon Lim (lynlimz) took over the project. The MSN protocol was taken over by Rako Shizuka who also developed the first version of [[Yahoo! Messenger]] protocol, which was the third protocol supported by Miranda. The ''Yahoo!'' plugin was closed source, and lost reliability as the official Yahoo! Messenger protocol changed over time \u2013 it was later re-written by new developer Gennady Feldman.\n\nThe first of the non-IM plugins, including ''RSS News'' and ''Weather'', were released within this period. These added a contact to contact list for the purpose of displaying information to the user rather than chatting. <!-- Can this sentence be clarified? --Lexein -->\n\nDiscussion about renaming of the program and removal of ''ICQ'' from the core began about this time. Due to the increase of protocol support, the project was officially renamed to '''Miranda IM''' on 17 December 2002.\n\n<!--Version 0.3 -- conflicts with next paragraph -- Lexein-->The first release under the new name occurred on 1 February 2003, about three years after the beginning of the project, and a bug fix version came two weeks later.\n\n===Version 0.3.x===\nThe major change in version 0.3, released on 23 June 2003, was the removal of ''ICQ'' from the core into a plugin. From now on, Miranda could run without the ''ICQ'' application being installed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=287706 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115040531/http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=287706 |archivedate=2009-01-15 |title=Miranda IM v0.3 released |accessdate=21 November 2008 |date=25 June 2003 |publisher=Miranda IM |work=Sourceforge}}</ref> The project moved to a new site at [https://web.archive.org/web/20081109022642/http://www.miranda-im.org/ www.miranda-im.org], featuring a new discussion board and file listing.\n\nProtocol plugins bundled in version 0.3 included ''ICQ'', ''MSN'', ''AIM'', and ''[[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]]''. The ''Yahoo!'' protocol was not included in the package. IRC support was added later by J\u00f6rgen Persson (m8rix) to the official release of version 0.3.1, on August 8, 2003.<ref name=\"m3chnglog\">{{cite web |title=Miranda IM v0.3.3.1 Changelog |url=http://www.miranda-im.org/release/changelog.php |publisher=Miranda-im.org |accessdate=21 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403105952/http://www.miranda-im.org/release/changelog.php |archivedate=3 April 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"ZDBE\">{{cite web| url=http://www.zdnet.be/downloads/28264/miranda-im-0-3/ |date=25 June 2003 | author=Biesemans, Jamie |title=Miranda IM 0.3 |publisher=ZDNet.be |language=Dutch |accessdate=2010-07-13}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.zdnet.be/downloads/28264/miranda-im-0-3/&hl=en&langpair=auto|en&tbb=1&ie=UTF-8 English tr.])</ref>\n\nAnother major change was the removal of the ''Send-Receive Messaging Module'' from the core into a plugin, ''SRMM''.<ref name=\"m3chnglog\" /> This reduced the size of the executable file and encouraged rapid development of messaging modules. During this period many variations (including ''SRAMM'', ''SRMM_mod'', etc.) offered different new features and improvements over the standard implementation.\n\nZDNet.be reviewed release 0.3, complimenting its \"effortless\" contact importing, low memory usage, and extensive variety of plugins, and stating, \"Miranda is a strong recommendation for people who have a system tray populated by several IM applications.\"<ref name=\"ZDBE\"/>\n\n===Version 0.4.x===\n[[File:Miranda IM customized.png|thumb|250px|right|''Miranda IM'', customized with plugins and skins.]]\nVersion 0.4 of Miranda IM was released on 7 April 2005.

Another new feature is the introduction of ''[[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] [[OSCAR protocol|Oscar]]'', first released in early 2006, allowing users to transfer files and receive away messages.

At that time, it was a minimalist ICQ clone and officially called Miranda ICQ. The first public release, version 0.0.1, was released on 6 February 2000. This release used LibICQ, had no support for message history, database, and [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], and had a distribution size of less than 100 KB.\n\nA major new feature of version 0.0.4 was the [[MegaHAL]] chat bot, which enabled automatic chatting between Miranda and other ICQ users. Plugin support was added with version 0.0.6. ''Logger Plugin'' was the first plugin bundled with the official release.\n\n===Version 0.1.x===\nAfter the release of version 0.0.6.1 on 26 December 2000, the original developers left, and Richard \"cyreve\" Hughes took over the project. His first release, version 0.1.0.0 on 8 April 2001 was improved through a major rewrite. The split message dialog bundled with this release became the first messaging module to be put into a plugin. The .Net Messenger Service protocol plugin appeared around the time of version 0.1.1.0 release becoming the second messaging protocol to be supported by Miranda. This was also the first official release to support language pack translations. Miranda hence had multi-protocol, multi-language instant messenger features.\n\nAfter v0.1.0.0, Miranda plugin development grew rapidly. With version 0.1.2.1 (28 February 2002), there were approximately 50 plugins available. At the time the new ''Lizard'' plugin enabled skinning support; the only time Miranda supported skins. ''Lizard'' development stopped soon after, due to the instability it caused.\n\n===Version 0.2.x===\nAfter the mysterious disappearance of cyreve in June 2002,<ref>[http://osdir.com/Downloads+index-req-viewdownloaddetails-lid-156-ttitle-Miranda_IM.phtml Miranda IM] ''osdir.com'' [[Open Source Software Directory]].</ref> the developers Martin \u00d6berg (Strickz), Robert Rainwater (rainwater), Sam K (egoDust), and Lyon Lim (lynlimz) took over the project. The MSN protocol was taken over by Rako Shizuka who also developed the first version of [[Yahoo! Messenger]] protocol, which was the third protocol supported by Miranda. The ''Yahoo!'' plugin was closed source, and lost reliability as the official Yahoo! Messenger protocol changed over time \u2013 it was later re-written by new developer Gennady Feldman.\n\nThe first of the non-IM plugins, including ''RSS News'' and ''Weather'', were released within this period. These added a contact to contact list for the purpose of displaying information to the user rather than chatting. <!-- Can this sentence be clarified? --Lexein -->\n\nDiscussion about renaming of the program and removal of ''ICQ'' from the core began about this time. Due to the increase of protocol support, the project was officially renamed to '''Miranda IM''' on 17 December 2002.\n\n<!--Version 0.3 -- conflicts with next paragraph -- Lexein-->The first release under the new name occurred on 1 February 2003, about three years after the beginning of the project, and a bug fix version came two weeks later.\n\n===Version 0.3.x===\nThe major change in version 0.3, released on 23 June 2003, was the removal of ''ICQ'' from the core into a plugin. From now on, Miranda could run without the ''ICQ'' application being installed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=287706 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115040531/http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=287706 |archivedate=2009-01-15 |title=Miranda IM v0.3 released |accessdate=21 November 2008 |date=25 June 2003 |publisher=Miranda IM |work=Sourceforge}}</ref> The project moved to a new site at [https://web.archive.org/web/20081109022642/http://www.miranda-im.org/ www.miranda-im.org], featuring a new discussion board and file listing.\n\nProtocol plugins bundled in version 0.3 included ''ICQ'', ''MSN'', ''AIM'', and ''[[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]]''. The ''Yahoo!'' protocol was not included in the package.

The reasons were a shift in the development team and the slow-paced development of the original Miranda. The main differences between the original client and the fork are: a switch to [[Microsoft Visual Studio#Visual Studio 2010|Visual Studio 2010]]'s compiler, dropping support for Windows 95/98/ME and non-Unicode plugins, and the fact that the core and plugins development was combined and that they share a unified repository.\n\n{{As of|February 2020}} the latest version of Miranda NG is 0.95.11, released on 2 February 2020.<ref>{{cite web |author=dartraiden |title=New stable build released: 0.95.11 |url=https://www.miranda-ng.org/pl/news/0-95-11 |accessdate=3 February 2020 |date=2 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n* [[Comparison of instant messaging clients]]\n* [[Comparison of instant messaging protocols]]\n* [[Comparison of Internet Relay Chat clients]]\n* [[Comparison of LAN messengers]]\n* [[LAN messenger]]\n* [[Windows Messenger service]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Miranda IM}}\n*{{Official website|https://sourceforge.net/projects/miranda}}\n*[https://www.miranda-ng.org Miranda NG (New Generation) official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20161231123611/http://wiki.miranda-im.org/ Miranda IM Wiki] (Internet Archive copy)\n*[https://code.google.com/p/miranda/ Old Miranda IM development site] (inactive since 2015)\n\n{{Instant messaging}}\n{{IRC clients}}\n\n[[Category:2000 software]]\n[[Category:Free instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:AIM clients]]\n[[Category:Free XMPP clients]]\n[[Category:Internet Relay Chat clients]]\n[[Category:Free Internet Relay Chat clients]]\n[[Category:Windows Internet Relay Chat clients]]\n[[Category:Windows-only instant messaging clients]]\n[[Category:Portable software]]\n[[Category:Yahoo! instant messaging clients]]\n", "name_user": "MRuniqat", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_IM"}

Lancaster refused battle and harassed the French supply lines while preventing Aiguillon from being [[blockade]]d. After a five-month siege the French were ordered north to confront the main [[Kingdom of England|English]] army, which on 12 July had landed in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] under [[Edward III of England]] and commenced the Cr\u00e9cy campaign.\n\nThis left the French defences in the southwest both weak and disorganised. Lancaster took advantage by launching offensives into [[Quercy]] and the [[Bazas|Bazadais]] and himself leading a third force on a large-scale mounted raid (a ''[[chevauch\u00e9e]]'') between 12 September and 31 October 1346. All three offensives were successful, with Lancaster's ''chevauch\u00e9e'', of approximately 2,000 English and Gascon soldiers, meeting no effective resistance from the French, penetrating {{convert|160|mi|km|abbr=off}} north and storming the rich city of [[Poitiers]]. His force then burnt and looted large areas of [[Saintonge]], [[Aunis]] and [[County of Poitou|Poitou]], capturing numerous towns, castles and smaller fortified places as they went. The offensives completely disrupted the French defences and shifted the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} or more beyond its borders.\n\n==Background==\nSince the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, English monarchs had held [[English overseas possessions#English possessions in Europe|titles and lands within France]], the possession of which made them [[vassal]]s of the kings of France. By 1337 only [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascony]] in southwestern France and [[Ponthieu]] in northern France were left.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}} The independent-minded Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs.{{sfn|Crowcroft|Cannon|2015|p=389}}{{sfn|Lacey|2008|p=122}} Following a series of disagreements between [[Philip VI of France]] ({{reign|1328|1350}}) and [[Edward III of England]] ({{reign|1327|1377}}), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council agreed Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the [[Hundred Years' War]], which was to last 116 years.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=A map of French territory as it was in 1340, showing the enclave of Gascony in the southwest|France in 1330\n{{Legend|#4682B4|Under French royal control in 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|Gained from English control by 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and English-controlled Gascony in 1330}}]]\n\nBefore the war commenced, well over 1000 ships a year departed from Gascony. Among their cargoes were over {{convert|200000000|imppt|hl uspt|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} of locally produced wine.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|pp=xix\u2013xx, 79}}{{sfn|Curry|2002|p=40}} The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from [[Bordeaux]] was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's,{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=39\u201340}} and was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nThe border between English and French territory in Gascony was extremely unclear. Many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each. Each small estate was likely to have a [[fortified tower]] or [[keep]], with larger estates having castles. [[Fortifications]] were also constructed at transport [[choke point]]s, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage; [[Defensive wall|fortified towns]] grew up alongside all bridges and most [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] over the many rivers in the region. Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on frequently. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment.{{sfn|Vale|1999|pp=75, 78}}\n\nAlthough Gascony was the cause of the war, in most campaigning seasons the Gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by the French.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|pp=139\u2013140}}{{sfn|Rogers|2004|p=95}} In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=273, 275}} Typically the Gascons could field 3,000\u20136,000 men, the large majority infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|pp=143\u2013144}} Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility.{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=100}}{{sfn|Vale|1999|pp=72\u201373, 76}}\n\n===1345 campaign===\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge d'Hennebont.jpg|upright=1|thumb|left|alt=A colourful medieval image of a town under attack|{{center|A medieval town under assault (15th-century miniature)}}]]\nBy 1345, after eight years of war, English-controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to [[Bayonne]], with isolated strongholds further inland. In 1345 Edward III had sent [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Lancaster]] to Gascony, and had assembled his main army for action in northern France or [[County of Flanders|Flanders]].{{sfn|DeVries|2006|p=189}} It had sailed but never landed, after the fleet was scattered in a storm.{{sfn|Lucas|1929|pp=519\u2013524}} Knowledge of Edward III's intent had kept French focus on the north until late in the campaigning season.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=461\u2013463}} Meanwhile, Lancaster<ref group=note>During the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. {{harvnb|Sumption|1990|p=476}}.</ref> had led a [[Gascon campaign of 1345|whirlwind campaign]] at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=1}} He had smashed two large French armies at the battles of [[Battle of Bergerac|Bergerac]] and [[Battle of Auberoche|Auberoche]], captured French towns and fortifications in much of [[P\u00e9rigord]] and most of [[Agenais]] and given the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth. During the winter following this successful campaign, Lancaster's second in command, [[Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford|Ralph, Earl of Stafford]], had marched on the vitally important town of [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]], which commanded the junction of the Rivers [[Garonne]] and [[Lot (river)|Lot]], making it important both for trade and for military communications.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} The inhabitants had attacked the garrison and opened the gates to the English.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=215}}\n\n==French offensive==\n[[John II of France|John, Duke of Normandy]], the son and heir of Philip VI, was placed in charge of all French forces in southwest France, as he had been the previous autumn. In March 1346 a French army under Duke John, numbering between 15,000 and 20,000,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} enormously superior to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field,{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=485\u2013486}} marched on Aiguillon and besieged it on 1{{nbsp}}April.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} On 2{{nbsp}}April an ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', a formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for southern France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=485}} French national financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=484}}\n\nEdward III again gathered a large army in England. The French were aware of this, but given the extreme difficulty of disembarking an army other than at a port, the English no longer having access to a port in Flanders, and the existence of friendly ports in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and Gascony, they assumed that Edward would sail for one of the latter; probably Gascony, in order to relieve Aiguillon.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=234}} To guard against any possibility of an English landing in northern France, Philip VI relied on his powerful navy.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=494}} This reliance was misplaced given the naval technology of the time and the French were unable to prevent Edward III successfully crossing the Channel and landing in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], in northern Normandy, on 12 July with an army between 12,000 and 15,000 strong.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=494}} The English achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south,{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=103}} cutting a wide swath of destruction through some of the richest lands in France and burning every town they passed.\n\nPhilip VI immediately recalled his main army, under Duke John, from Gascony. After a furious argument with his advisers, and according to some accounts his father's messenger, Duke John refused to move until his honour was satisfied. On 29 July Philip VI called an ''arri\u00e8re-ban'' for northern France at [[Rouen]]. On 7{{nbsp}}August the English reached the [[Seine]].{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=150}} Philip VI again sent orders to John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north. Edward III marched south east and on 12 August his army was {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=off}} from Paris.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=514\u2013515}} On 14 August Duke John attempted to arrange a local truce. Lancaster, well aware of the situation in the north and in the French camps around Aiguillon, refused. On 20 August, after over five months, the French abandoned the siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder. Duke John did not rejoin the French army in the north until after it had been heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] six days later.{{sfn|Rogers|2010}}\n\n==Anglo-Gascon offensive==\n[[File:Portrait of Henry, Duke of Lancaster - William Bruges's Garter Book (c.1440-1450), f.8 - BL Stowe MS 594 (cropped).jpg|alt=Image of a man dressed in late-medieval finery|upright=0.75|thumb|<center>Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Derby</center>]]\nThe withdrawal of Duke John's army led to the collapse of the French positions in southern [[County of P\u00e9rigord|P\u00e9rigord]] and most of Agenais. The French only held on to their strongholds in the Garonne valley, [[Port-Sainte-Marie]], [[Agen]] and [[Marmande]] downstream of Aiguillon. The English extended their control to include the whole of the Lot valley below [[Villeneuve-sur-Lot|Villeneuve]] and most of the remaining French outposts between the Lot and the Dordogne, during late August. Lancaster was able to capture most towns without a fight.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=539, 541}} [[John I, Count of Armagnac|John, Count of Armagnac]], was appointed French royal lieutenant in the region after Duke John's withdrawal. He struggled to provide effective resistance because of lack of troops; insufficient funds; and repeatedly having his orders countermanded by Philip VI. He formally offered his resignation within three months of his appointment.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=541}}\n\nLancaster now held the operational initiative. In early September he launched three separate offensives. Local English sympathisers in the Agenais under [[Gaillard I de Durfort]] blockaded Agen and Porte Sainte Marie and raided into [[Quercy]] to the west. A large detachment of Gascons was split up to reoccupy the French-held territory to the south and west of the Garonne under the overall command of [[Alixandre de Caumont]], in a mopping up operation. Lancaster took command of 1,000 [[men-at-arms]] and approximately the same number of mounted infantry and led them north on 12 September; most of this force was Gascon.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=541}}\n\nThe force in the Agenais raided deep into Quercy, penetrating over {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}}. Gaillard, leading 400 cavalry, captured the small town of [[Tulle]]. This sparked widespread panic in the province of [[Auvergne]]. The army of John of Armagnac was diverted to Tulle, which it besieged from mid-November until late December, when the Gascon occupiers surrendered on terms and were taken prisoner; all were ransomed.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=549}} The whole French field army of the southwest was tied down by Gaillard's small force. The modern historian [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption]] describes this as \"dislocating the royal administration in central and southern France for three months\".{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=549\u2013550}}\n\nThe troops under Caumont swept through the [[Bazas|Bazadais]], capturing numerous French-held towns and fortifications for little or no loss. Many of these were handed over after negotiations; [[Bazas]] itself for example surrendered after negotiating access for its products through English-occupied territory on favourable terms. The French presence in the area was all but extinguished.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=550}}\n\n===Lancaster's ''chevauch\u00e9e''===\n[[File:Map of route of Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346.svg|thumb|alt=A map of Lancaster's route in 1346|{{center|Map of route of Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346}}]]\n\nLancaster targeted the rich provincial capital of [[Poitiers]], deep in French-held territory{{snd}}{{convert|160|mi|km|abbr=off}} north of his starting point. He marched from the Garonne to the [[Charente (river)|Charente]], {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=off}}, in eight days, arriving at [[Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Charente]] which he captured. He then diverted {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=off}} to [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly]] to rescue some English prisoners. Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly was stormed, captured, and [[looting|sacked]]. Leaving a garrison, Lancaster turned back towards Poitiers, covering 20 miles a day and taking the towns of [[Melle, Deux-S\u00e8vres|Melle]] and [[Lusignan, Vienne|Lusignan]] on the way. Lancaster reached Poitiers late on 3{{nbsp}}October.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=542, 544}}\n\nPoitiers occupied a naturally strong position, but its defences had seen little maintenance for centuries. The city had no royal garrison and the townspeople and local notables had fallen out of the habit of maintaining a guard. Defensive responsibilities were split between the town and three different church bodies, which had the effect of preventing any effective action. The English launched an immediate assault, but they were repulsed by an improvised force organised by some local noblemen. During the night the English found a breach in the wall, which had been deliberately created years before to allow easy access from the city to a nearby watermill. In the morning they seized it and forced their way into eastern Poitiers, killing everyone they came across. As was usual,{{sfn|King|2002|pp=269\u2013270}} only those who appeared wealthy enough to afford a ransom were spared. Most of the population fled the city, but over 600 were killed. The town was thoroughly sacked for eight days.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=544}}\n\nLancaster was unable to take the royal mint at [[Montreuil-Bonnin]], {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} west of Poitiers, and marched rapidly back to Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly. He made no attempt to hold Poitiers; in the province of Poitou he only left troops at Lusignan, a small town with good walls and a strong, modern castle. Once back in Saintonge he took control of the [[Boutonne]] valley all the way to the sea, including the major port of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and the well-fortified island of [[Ol\u00e9ron]]. Lancaster then marched south, taking a large number of small towns and fortifications.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|pp=142\u2013143}} The French were left in control of much of Saintonge: the eastern parts; the larger fortifications such as the province's capital, [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], and its strongest castle, [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]]; and several strategically important strongholds on the east bank of the Gironde.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=547}} Lancaster arrived in Bordeaux, the capital of English Gascony, on 31 October seven weeks after he set out on his chevauch\u00e9e.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=238}} He returned to England in early 1347.{{sfn|Ormrod|2005}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nLancaster left garrisons in the captured towns and castles throughout Saintonge and [[Aunis]], with an especially large garrison at Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly. The Anglo-Gascons supported themselves by raiding French-held and French-leaning territory; as Sumption puts it, they \"were not so much expected to control territory as to create chaos and insecurity\".{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=547}} Whole provinces, securely held by the French only months before, were overrun by bandits, freebooters, deserters and retained troops of both sides. The population moved away from the villages to the relative safety of the towns, townsfolk who could, moved away from the area, and much of the agricultural land went uncultivated. The French ability to counter-attack was lost as they concentrated on attempting to defend the host of newly vulnerable locations or on recovering towns captured deep in what had been considered safe territory, as at Tulle. French trade declined and their taxation income from the area was severely curtailed. Lancaster had moved the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to 50 miles or more beyond its borders.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=547\u2013550}}\n\nThe English army in the north, after its victory at Cr\u00e9cy, went on to [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|besiege Calais]]. Lancaster joined it there in the summer of 1347 and was present when Calais fell after an eleven-month siege, securing an English [[entrep\u00f4t]] into northern France which was [[Pale of Calais|held for two hundred years]].{{sfn|Gribit|2016|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=207\u2013217}} The war in southwest France stayed far from Gascony.

Lancaster refused battle and harassed the French supply lines while preventing Aiguillon from being [[blockade]]d. After a five-month siege the French were ordered north to confront the main [[Kingdom of England|English]] army, which on 12 July had landed in [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] under [[Edward III of England]] and commenced the Cr\u00e9cy campaign.\n\nThis left the French defences in the southwest both weak and disorganised. Lancaster took advantage by launching offensives into [[Quercy]] and the [[Bazas|Bazadais]] and himself leading a third force on a large-scale mounted raid (a ''[[chevauch\u00e9e]]'') between 12 September and 31 October 1346. All three offensives were successful, with Lancaster's ''chevauch\u00e9e'', of approximately 2,000 English and Gascon soldiers, meeting no effective resistance from the French, penetrating {{convert|160|mi|km|abbr=off}} north and storming the rich city of [[Poitiers]]. His force then burnt and looted large areas of [[Saintonge]], [[Aunis]] and [[County of Poitou|Poitou]], capturing numerous towns, castles and smaller fortified places as they went. The offensives completely disrupted the French defences and shifted the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} or more beyond its borders.\n\n==Background==\nSince the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066, English monarchs had held [[English overseas possessions#English possessions in Europe|titles and lands within France]], the possession of which made them [[vassal]]s of the kings of France. By 1337 only [[Duchy of Gascony|Gascony]] in southwestern France and [[Ponthieu]] in northern France were left.{{sfn|Harris|1994|p=8}} The independent-minded Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs.{{sfn|Crowcroft|Cannon|2015|p=389}}{{sfn|Lacey|2008|p=122}} Following a series of disagreements between [[Philip VI of France]] ({{reign|1328|1350}}) and [[Edward III of England]] ({{reign|1327|1377}}), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council agreed Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the [[Hundred Years' War]], which was to last 116 years.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=184}}\n\n[[File:Guyenne 1328-en.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|alt=A map of French territory as it was in 1340, showing the enclave of Gascony in the southwest|France in 1330\n{{Legend|#4682B4|Under French royal control in 1214}}\n{{Legend|#9370DB|Gained from English control by 1330}}\n{{Legend|#FFB6C1|England and English-controlled Gascony in 1330}}]]\n\nBefore the war commenced, well over 1000 ships a year departed from Gascony. Among their cargoes were over {{convert|200000000|imppt|hl uspt|sigfig=2|abbr=off}} of locally produced wine.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|pp=xix\u2013xx, 79}}{{sfn|Curry|2002|p=40}} The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from [[Bordeaux]] was more than all other customs duties combined and by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's,{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=39\u201340}} and was possibly richer. However, by this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nThe border between English and French territory in Gascony was extremely unclear. Many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each. Each small estate was likely to have a [[fortified tower]] or [[keep]], with larger estates having castles. [[Fortifications]] were also constructed at transport [[choke point]]s, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage; [[Defensive wall|fortified towns]] grew up alongside all bridges and most [[Ford (crossing)|fords]] over the many rivers in the region. Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on frequently. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment.{{sfn|Vale|1999|pp=75, 78}}\n\nAlthough Gascony was the cause of the war, in most campaigning seasons the Gascons had had to rely on their own resources and had been hard pressed by the French.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|pp=139\u2013140}}{{sfn|Rogers|2004|p=95}} In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=273, 275}} Typically the Gascons could field 3,000\u20136,000 men, the large majority infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|pp=143\u2013144}} Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility.{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=100}}{{sfn|Vale|1999|pp=72\u201373, 76}}\n\n===1345 campaign===\n[[File:Si\u00e8ge d'Hennebont.jpg|upright=1|thumb|left|alt=A colourful medieval image of a town under attack|{{center|A medieval town under assault (15th-century miniature)}}]]\nBy 1345, after eight years of war, English-controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to [[Bayonne]], with isolated strongholds further inland. In 1345 Edward III had sent [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry, Earl of Lancaster]] to Gascony, and had assembled his main army for action in northern France or [[County of Flanders|Flanders]].{{sfn|DeVries|2006|p=189}} It had sailed but never landed, after the fleet was scattered in a storm.{{sfn|Lucas|1929|pp=519\u2013524}} Knowledge of Edward III's intent had kept French focus on the north until late in the campaigning season.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=461\u2013463}} Meanwhile, Lancaster<ref group=note>During the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. {{harvnb|Sumption|1990|p=476}}.</ref> had led a [[Gascon campaign of 1345|whirlwind campaign]] at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|p=1}} He had smashed two large French armies at the battles of [[Battle of Bergerac|Bergerac]] and [[Battle of Auberoche|Auberoche]], captured French towns and fortifications in much of [[P\u00e9rigord]] and most of [[Agenais]] and given the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth. During the winter following this successful campaign, Lancaster's second in command, [[Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford|Ralph, Earl of Stafford]], had marched on the vitally important town of [[Aiguillon, Lot-et-Garonne|Aiguillon]], which commanded the junction of the Rivers [[Garonne]] and [[Lot (river)|Lot]], making it important both for trade and for military communications.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} The inhabitants had attacked the garrison and opened the gates to the English.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=215}}\n\n==French offensive==\n[[John II of France|John, Duke of Normandy]], the son and heir of Philip VI, was placed in charge of all French forces in southwest France, as he had been the previous autumn. In March 1346 a French army under Duke John, numbering between 15,000 and 20,000,{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} enormously superior to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field,{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=485\u2013486}} marched on Aiguillon and besieged it on 1{{nbsp}}April.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}} On 2{{nbsp}}April an ''[[arri\u00e8re-ban]]'', a formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for southern France.{{sfn|Wagner|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=485}} French national financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=484}}\n\nEdward III again gathered a large army in England. The French were aware of this, but given the extreme difficulty of disembarking an army other than at a port, the English no longer having access to a port in Flanders, and the existence of friendly ports in [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and Gascony, they assumed that Edward would sail for one of the latter; probably Gascony, in order to relieve Aiguillon.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=234}} To guard against any possibility of an English landing in northern France, Philip VI relied on his powerful navy.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=494}} This reliance was misplaced given the naval technology of the time and the French were unable to prevent Edward III successfully crossing the Channel and landing in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]], in northern Normandy, on 12 July with an army between 12,000 and 15,000 strong.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=494}} The English achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south,{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=103}} cutting a wide swath of destruction through some of the richest lands in France and burning every town they passed.\n\nPhilip VI immediately recalled his main army, under Duke John, from Gascony. After a furious argument with his advisers, and according to some accounts his father's messenger, Duke John refused to move until his honour was satisfied. On 29 July Philip VI called an ''arri\u00e8re-ban'' for northern France at [[Rouen]]. On 7{{nbsp}}August the English reached the [[Seine]].{{sfn|Burne|1999|p=150}} Philip VI again sent orders to John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north. Edward III marched south east and on 12 August his army was {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=off}} from Paris.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=514\u2013515}} On 14 August Duke John attempted to arrange a local truce. Lancaster, well aware of the situation in the north and in the French camps around Aiguillon, refused. On 20 August, after over five months, the French abandoned the siege and marched away in considerable haste and disorder. Duke John did not rejoin the French army in the north until after it had been heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] six days later.{{sfn|Rogers|2010}}\n\n==Anglo-Gascon offensive==\n[[File:Portrait of Henry, Duke of Lancaster - William Bruges's Garter Book (c.1440-1450), f.8 - BL Stowe MS 594 (cropped).jpg|alt=Image of a man dressed in late-medieval finery|upright=0.75|thumb|<center>Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Lancaster, Earl of Derby</center>]]\nThe withdrawal of Duke John's army led to the collapse of the French positions in southern [[County of P\u00e9rigord|P\u00e9rigord]] and most of Agenais. The French only held on to their strongholds in the Garonne valley, [[Port-Sainte-Marie]], [[Agen]] and [[Marmande]] downstream of Aiguillon. The English extended their control to include the whole of the Lot valley below [[Villeneuve-sur-Lot|Villeneuve]] and most of the remaining French outposts between the Lot and the Dordogne, during late August. Lancaster was able to capture most towns without a fight.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=539, 541}} [[John I, Count of Armagnac|John, Count of Armagnac]], was appointed French royal lieutenant in the region after Duke John's withdrawal. He struggled to provide effective resistance because of lack of troops; insufficient funds; and repeatedly having his orders countermanded by Philip VI. He formally offered his resignation within three months of his appointment.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=541}}\n\nLancaster now held the operational initiative. In early September he launched three separate offensives. Local English sympathisers in the Agenais under [[Gaillard I de Durfort]] blockaded Agen and Porte Sainte Marie and raided into [[Quercy]] to the west. A large detachment of Gascons was split up to reoccupy the French-held territory to the south and west of the Garonne under the overall command of [[Alixandre de Caumont]], in a mopping up operation. Lancaster took command of 1,000 [[men-at-arms]] and approximately the same number of mounted infantry and led them north on 12 September; most of this force was Gascon.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=541}}\n\nThe force in the Agenais raided deep into Quercy, penetrating over {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}}. Gaillard, leading 400 cavalry, captured the small town of [[Tulle]]. This sparked widespread panic in the province of [[Auvergne]]. The army of John of Armagnac was diverted to Tulle, which it besieged from mid-November until late December, when the Gascon occupiers surrendered on terms and were taken prisoner; all were ransomed.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=549}} The whole French field army of the southwest was tied down by Gaillard's small force. The modern historian [[Jonathan Sumption, Lord Sumption|Jonathan Sumption]] describes this as \"dislocating the royal administration in central and southern France for three months\".{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=549\u2013550}}\n\nThe troops under Caumont swept through the [[Bazas|Bazadais]], capturing numerous French-held towns and fortifications for little or no loss. Many of these were handed over after negotiations; [[Bazas]] itself for example surrendered after negotiating access for its products through English-occupied territory on favourable terms. The French presence in the area was all but extinguished.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=550}}\n\n===Lancaster's ''chevauch\u00e9e''===\n[[File:Map of route of Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346.svg|thumb|alt=A map of Lancaster's route in 1346|{{center|Map of route of Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1346}}]]\n\nLancaster targeted the rich provincial capital of [[Poitiers]], deep in French-held territory{{snd}}{{convert|160|mi|km|abbr=off}} north of his starting point. He marched from the Garonne to the [[Charente (river)|Charente]], {{convert|80|mi|km|abbr=off}}, in eight days, arriving at [[Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Charente]] which he captured. He then diverted {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=off}} to [[Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly]] to rescue some English prisoners. Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly was stormed, captured, and [[looting|sacked]]. Leaving a garrison, Lancaster turned back towards Poitiers, covering 20 miles a day and taking the towns of [[Melle, Deux-S\u00e8vres|Melle]] and [[Lusignan, Vienne|Lusignan]] on the way. Lancaster reached Poitiers late on 3{{nbsp}}October.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=542, 544}}\n\nPoitiers occupied a naturally strong position, but its defences had seen little maintenance for centuries. The city had no royal garrison and the townspeople and local notables had fallen out of the habit of maintaining a guard. Defensive responsibilities were split between the town and three different church bodies, which had the effect of preventing any effective action. The English launched an immediate assault, but they were repulsed by an improvised force organised by some local noblemen. During the night the English found a breach in the wall, which had been deliberately created years before to allow easy access from the city to a nearby watermill. In the morning they seized it and forced their way into eastern Poitiers, killing everyone they came across. As was usual,{{sfn|King|2002|pp=269\u2013270}} only those who appeared wealthy enough to afford a ransom were spared. Most of the population fled the city, but over 600 were killed. The town was thoroughly sacked for eight days.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=544}}\n\nLancaster was unable to take the royal mint at [[Montreuil-Bonnin]], {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} west of Poitiers, and marched rapidly back to Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly. He made no attempt to hold Poitiers; in the province of Poitou he only left troops at Lusignan, a small town with good walls and a strong, modern castle. Once back in Saintonge he took control of the [[Boutonne]] valley all the way to the sea, including the major port of [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and the well-fortified island of [[Ol\u00e9ron]]. Lancaster then marched south, taking a large number of small towns and fortifications.{{sfn|Gribit|2016|pp=142\u2013143}} The French were left in control of much of Saintonge: the eastern parts; the larger fortifications such as the province's capital, [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]], and its strongest castle, [[Taillebourg, Charente-Maritime|Taillebourg]]; and several strategically important strongholds on the east bank of the Gironde.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=547}} Lancaster arrived in Bordeaux, the capital of English Gascony, on 31 October seven weeks after he set out on his chevauch\u00e9e.{{sfn|Fowler|1961|p=238}} He returned to England in early 1347.{{sfn|Ormrod|2005}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nLancaster left garrisons in the captured towns and castles throughout Saintonge and [[Aunis]], with an especially large garrison at Saint-Jean-d'Ang\u00e9ly. The Anglo-Gascons supported themselves by raiding French-held and French-leaning territory; as Sumption puts it, they \"were not so much expected to control territory as to create chaos and insecurity\".{{sfn|Sumption|1990|p=547}} Whole provinces, securely held by the French only months before, were overrun by bandits, freebooters, deserters and retained troops of both sides. The population moved away from the villages to the relative safety of the towns, townsfolk who could, moved away from the area, and much of the agricultural land went uncultivated. The French ability to counter-attack was lost as they concentrated on attempting to defend the host of newly vulnerable locations or on recovering towns captured deep in what had been considered safe territory, as at Tulle. French trade declined and their taxation income from the area was severely curtailed. Lancaster had moved the focus of the fighting from the heart of Gascony to 50 miles or more beyond its borders.{{sfn|Sumption|1990|pp=547\u2013550}}\n\nThe English army in the north, after its victory at Cr\u00e9cy, went on to [[Siege of Calais (1346\u20131347)|besiege Calais]]. Lancaster joined it there in the summer of 1347 and was present when Calais fell after an eleven-month siege, securing an English [[entrep\u00f4t]] into northern France which was [[Pale of Calais|held for two hundred years]].{{sfn|Gribit|2016|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=207\u2013217}} The war in southwest France stayed far from Gascony.

After [[Black Prince's chevauch\u00e9e of 1356|another devastating ''chevauch\u00e9e'' in 1356]], the French army, commanded by Duke John, now King [[John II of France]], intercepted it and forced the outnumbered English to battle {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off}} from Poitiers; the French were [[Battle of Poitiers|decisively defeated]] and John was captured.{{sfn|Burne|1999|pp=275\u2013310}}{{sfn|Oman|1998|p=174}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite book |last=Burne |first=Alfred |title=The Crecy War |year=1999 |orig-year=1955 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |location=Ware, Hertfordshire |isbn=978-1-84022-210-4 |author-link=Alfred Burne |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last1=Crowcroft |first1=Robert |last2=Cannon |first2=John |author2-link=John Cannon (historian) |url={{google books|PM9xCgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}} |title=Gascony |page=389 |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to British History |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-19-967783-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Curry |date=2002 |first=Anne |title=The Hundred Years' War 1337\u20131453 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |place=Oxford |publicationdate=2002-11-13 |isbn=978-1-84176-269-2 |url=http://droppdf.com/files/YYeb5/anne-curry-the-hundred-years-war-1337-1453-2002.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927204153/http://droppdf.com/files/YYeb5/anne-curry-the-hundred-years-war-1337-1453-2002.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2018 |authorlink=Anne Curry |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=DeVries |first=Kelly |author-link=Kelly DeVries |title=Infantry Warfare in the Early Fourteenth Century: Discipline, Tactics, and Technology |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk; Rochester, New York |publisher=Boydell Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-85115-571-5 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite thesis |last=Fowler |first=Kenneth |year=1961 |title=Henry of Grosmont, First Duke of Lancaster, 1310\u20131361|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2597/1/Fowler_K_History_PhD_1961.pdf |location=Leeds |publisher=University of Leeds |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Gribit |first=Nicholas A. |title=Henry of Lancaster's Expedition to Aquitaine, 1345\u20131346: Military Service and Professionalism in the Hundred Years War |series=Warfare in History |volume=42 |location=Woodbridge, Suffolk |publisher=Boydell & Brewer |date=2016 |url={{google books|3yYbDQAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}} |isbn=978-1-78327-117-7 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Harris |first=Robin |date=1994 |title=Valois Guyenne: A Study of Politics, Government, and Society in Late Medieval France |series=Royal Historical Society Studies in History |volume=71 |location=London |publisher=Boydell Press |isbn=978-0-86193-226-9 |url={{google books|aLiC-F1JgYQC|plainurl=yes}} |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last=King |first=Andy |title=According to the Custom Used in French and Scottish Wars: Prisoners and Casualties on the Scottish Marches in the Fourteenth Century |journal=Journal of Medieval History |pages=263\u2013290 |year=2002 |volume=28 |issue=3 |issn=0304-4181 |ref=harv |doi=10.1016/S0048-721X(02)00057-X}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lacey |first=Robert |authorlink=Robert Lacey |title=Great Tales from English History |location=London |publisher= Folio Society |date=2008 |oclc=261939337 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lucas |first=Henry S. |year=1929 |title=The Low Countries and the Hundred Years' War: 1326\u20131347 |url={{google books|QDiztAEACAAJ|plainurl=yes}} |location=Ann Arbor |publisher=University of Michigan Press |oclc=960872598 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Oman |first=Charles |date=1998 |orig-year=1924 |title=A History of the Art of War in the Middle Ages: 1278\u20131485 A.D |url={{google books|CIQpAQAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}} |location=London |publisher=Greenhill Books |isbn=978-1-85367-332-0 |author-link=Charles Oman |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite ODNB |last=Ormrod |first=W.

These apparitions are said to have occurred between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the \"[[Immaculate Conception]].\"\n\nDespite initial skepticism from some Catholic Church authorities, Soubirous's claims were eventually declared \"worthy of belief\" after a canonical investigation, and the Marian apparition became known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Since her death, Soubirous's body has apparently remained internally [[Incorruptibility#Causes|incorrupt]].\nThe [[Marian shrine]] at Lourdes ([[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]], from 2016 part of [[Occitanie]]) went on to become a major [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] site, attracting over five million pilgrims of all denominations each year.\n\nOn 8 December 1933, [[Pope Pius XI]], [[Canonization|declared]] Soubirous a saint of the Catholic Church.

Soubirous was a sickly child and possibly due to this only measured 4&nbsp;ft. 7in. tall. She contracted [[cholera]] as a toddler and suffered severe [[asthma]] for the rest of her life.

While the other girls crossed the little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous stayed behind, looking for a place to cross where she wouldn't get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, \"came a dazzling light, and a white figure\".  This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as ''aquero'' (pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02c8k(e)\u027e\u0254]}}), [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]] for \"that\". In later testimony, she called it \"a small young lady\" (''uo petito damizelo''). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.<ref>Taylor 59\u201360.</ref>\n\nOn 14 February, after Sunday Mass, Soubirous, with her sister Marie and some other girls, returned to the grotto. Soubirous knelt down immediately, saying she saw the apparition again and falling into a [[trance]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} When one of the girls threw [[holy water]] at the niche and another threw a rock from above that shattered on the ground, the apparition disappeared.<ref>Taylor 62\u201363.</ref> On her next visit, 18 February, Soubirous said that \"the vision\" asked her to return to the grotto every day for a fortnight.<ref>Taylor 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nThis period of almost daily visions came to be known as ''la Quinzaine sacr\u00e9e'', \"holy fortnight.\" Initially, Soubirous's parents, especially her mother, were embarrassed and tried to forbid her to go. The supposed apparition did not identify herself until the seventeenth vision. Although the townspeople who believed she was telling the truth assumed she saw the Virgin Mary, Soubirous never claimed it to be Mary, consistently using the word ''aquero''. She described the lady as wearing a white veil, a blue girdle and with a yellow rose on each foot&nbsp;\u2013 compatible with \"a description of any statue of the Virgin in a village church\".<ref>Taylor 84.</ref>\n\nSoubirous's story caused a sensation with the townspeople, who were divided in their opinions on whether or not she was telling the truth. Some believed her to have a mental illness and demanded she be put in an asylum.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe other contents of Soubirous's reported visions were simple and focused on the need for prayer and penance. On 25 February she explained that the vision had told her \"to drink of the water of the spring, to wash in it and to eat the herb that grew there,\" as an act of penance. To everyone's surprise, the next day the grotto was no longer muddy but clear water flowed.<ref>Taylor 88\u201390.</ref> On 2 March, at the thirteenth of the alleged apparitions, Soubirous told her family that the lady said that \"a chapel should be built and a procession formed\".<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSoubirous's 16th claimed vision, which she stated went on for over an hour, was on 25 March. According to her account, during that visitation, she again asked the woman for her name but the lady just smiled back. She repeated the question three more times and finally heard the lady say, in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]], \"I am the [[Immaculate Conception]]\" (''Qu\u00e9 so\u00ef era immaculado councepcio\u0169'', a phonetic transcription of ''Que soi era immaculada concepcion'').<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSome of the people who interviewed Soubirous after her revelation of the visions thought her simple-minded.{{who|date=April 2016}} However, despite being rigorously interviewed by officials of both the Catholic Church and the French government, she stuck consistently to her story.<ref name=crawley/>\n\n== Results of her visions ==\nAfter investigation, Catholic Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862.<ref name=foley/> In the 150 years since Soubirous dug up the spring, 69<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/cures-and-miracles/miraculous-cures-in-lourdes|title=Miraculous cures in Lourdes|publisher=}}</ref> cures have been verified by the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]] as \"inexplicable\" \u2013 after what the Catholic Church claims are \"extremely rigorous scientific and medical examinations\" that failed to find any other explanation. The Lourdes Commission that examined Bernadette after the visions ran an intensive analysis on the water and found that, while it had a high mineral content, it contained nothing out of the ordinary that would account for the cures attributed to it. Bernadette said that it was faith and prayer that cured the sick: \"One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/blog/10-things-to-know-about-our-lady-of-lourdes-and-st-bernadette/2209/|title=10 Things to Know About Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernadette|last=von Huben|first=Ellyn|date=11 February 2015|website=Word on Fire|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous's request to the local priest to build a chapel at the site of her visions eventually gave rise to a number of chapels and churches at Lourdes. The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] is now one of the major Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world. One of the churches built at the site, the [[Basilica of St. Pius X]], can accommodate 25,000 people and was dedicated by the future [[Pope John XXIII]] when he was the [[Papal Nuncio]] to France. Close to 5&nbsp;million pilgrims from all over the world visit Lourdes (population of about 15,000) every year to pray and to drink the miraculous water, believing that they obtain from the Lord healing of the body and of the spirit.\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:Bernadette soubirous 2 publicdomain.gif|thumb|150px|Bernadette in 1866, after having took the religious habit and joining the Sisters of Charity]]\nDisliking the attention she was attracting, Bernadette went to the [[hospice]] school run by the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers]] where she had learned to read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a [[postulant]] and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at [[Nevers]]. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister [[Marie Therese Vauzou]].<ref name=snddl>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/bernadette-soubirous/religious-life|title=Religious life|publisher=}}</ref> The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/spiritual/bernadette-soubirious.html|title=Biography of Bernadette Soubirous|work=Biography Online}}</ref> in honor of her godmother who was named \"Bernarde\". As Patricia A. McEachern observes, \"Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron saint; she copied long texts related to him in notebooks and on bits of paper. The experience of becoming 'Sister Marie-Bernard' marked a turning point for Bernadette as she realized more than ever that the great grace she received from the Queen of Heaven brought with it great responsibilities.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Holy Life\": The Writings of St. Bernadette|last=McEachern|first=Patricia|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous spent the rest of her brief life at the motherhouse, working as an assistant in the infirmary<ref name=snddl/> and later as a [[Sacristy|sacristan]], creating beautiful [[embroidery]] for altar cloths and [[vestments]].

The saint died 46 years before the photo]]\nBishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Catholic Church [[exhumation|exhumed]] the body of Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the presence of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the [[crucifix]] in her hand and her [[rosary]] had both [[redox|oxidized]], her body appeared [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] \u2013 preserved from [[decomposition]]. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before burial in a new double casket.\n\nThe church exhumed the corpse a second time on 3 April 1919. A doctor who examined the body noted, \"The body is practically mummified, covered with patches of [[mildew]] and quite a notable layer of salts, which appear to be calcium salts. ...&nbsp;The skin has disappeared in some places, but it is still present on most parts of the body.\"\n\n[[File:Relic of bernadette.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Relic]] of St. Bernadette and stone from the [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Grotto of Lourdes]], where the Marian apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes is said to have appeared]]\nIn 1925, the church exhumed the body for a third time. They took [[relic]]s, which were sent to Rome. A precise imprint of the face was molded so that the firm of [[Pierre Imans]] in Paris could make a wax mask based on the imprints and on some genuine photos to be placed on her body. This was common practice for relics in France as it was feared that the blackish tinge to the face and the sunken eyes and nose would be viewed as corruption by the public. Imprints of the hands were also taken for the presentation of the body and the making of wax casts. The remains were then placed in a gold and [[crystal]] reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the motherhouse in [[Nevers]].\n\nThree years later in 1928, Doctor Comte published a report on the exhumation of Soubirous in the second issue of the ''Bulletin de I'Association medicale de Notre-Dame de Lourdes''.\n\n\"I would have liked to open the left side of the [[thorax]] to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/tmcdonald/the-marvelous-preservation-of-st.-bernadette|title=The Marvelous Preservation of St. Bernadette|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Depictions ==\n* In 1909 the French short movie ''Bernadette Soubirous et les Apparitions de Lourdes'', directed by Honor\u00e9 Le Sablais,<ref name=lasemainedespyrenees>{{cite news|title=Cin\u00e9ma: Un festival \"Lourdes au cin\u00e9ma\"|url=http://www.lasemainedespyrenees.fr/article/08/10/2008/cinema--un-festival-lourdes-au-cinema/704|first=Christophe|last=Ruiz|journal=La Semaine des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=3 July 2013|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} See [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bernadette+Soubirous+et+les+Apparitions+de+Lourdes%22%22Honor\u00e9+Le+Sablais%22+film+1909+-wikipedia&num=100&safe=off&filter=0&biw=1440&bih=695 occurrences] on Google.</ref> is the first attempt to tell with the new cinematographic art the story of Bernadette, according to [[RAI 3]] documentary ''Lourdes.

These apparitions are said to have occurred between 11 February and 16 July 1858, and the woman who appeared to her identified herself as the \"[[Immaculate Conception]].\"\n\nDespite initial skepticism from some Catholic Church authorities, Soubirous's claims were eventually declared \"worthy of belief\" after a canonical investigation, and the Marian apparition became known as [[Our Lady of Lourdes]]. Since her death, Soubirous's body has apparently remained internally [[Incorruptibility#Causes|incorrupt]].\nThe [[Marian shrine]] at Lourdes ([[Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]], from 2016 part of [[Occitanie]]) went on to become a major [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] site, attracting over five million pilgrims of all denominations each year.\n\nOn 8 December 1933, [[Pope Pius XI]], [[Canonization|declared]] Soubirous a saint of the Catholic Church.

Her godmother was Bernarde Casterot, her mother's sister, a moderately wealthy widow who owned a tavern. Hard times had fallen on France and the family lived in extreme poverty. Soubirous was a sickly child and possibly due to this only measured 4&nbsp;ft. 7in. tall. She contracted [[cholera]] as a toddler and suffered severe [[asthma]] for the rest of her life. Soubirous attended the day school conducted by the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers|Sisters of Charity and Christian Instruction]] from [[Nevers]].<ref name=crawley>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/BERNADET.HTM|title=\"Saint Bernadette Soubirous\", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref> Contrary to a belief popularized by Hollywood movies, Soubirous learned very little French, only studying French in school after age 13. She could read and write very little due to her frequent illness. She spoke the language of [[Occitan]], which was spoken by the local population of the [[Pyrenees]] region at that time and to a lesser degree today (which is similar to Catalan spoken in eastern Spain).\n\n== Visions ==\n{{Main|Lourdes apparitions}}\nBy the time of the events at the grotto, the Soubirous family's financial and social status had declined to the point where they lived in a one-room basement, formerly used as a jail, called ''le cachot'', \"the dungeon\", where they were housed for free by her mother's cousin, Andr\u00e9 Sajoux.<ref>Taylor 42.</ref>\n\nOn 11 February 1858, Soubirous, then aged 14, was out gathering firewood with her sister Toinette and a friend near the [[grotto]] of Massabielle (Tuta de Massavielha) when she experienced her first vision. While the other girls crossed the little stream in front of the grotto and walked on, Soubirous stayed behind, looking for a place to cross where she wouldn't get her stockings wet. She finally sat down to take her shoes off in order to cross the water and was lowering her stocking when she heard the sound of rushing wind, but nothing moved. A wild rose in a natural niche in the grotto, however, did move. From the niche, or rather the dark alcove behind it, \"came a dazzling light, and a white figure\".  This was the first of 18 visions of what she referred to as ''aquero'' (pronounced {{IPA|[a\u02c8k(e)\u027e\u0254]}}), [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]] for \"that\". In later testimony, she called it \"a small young lady\" (''uo petito damizelo''). Her sister and her friend stated that they had seen nothing.<ref>Taylor 59\u201360.</ref>\n\nOn 14 February, after Sunday Mass, Soubirous, with her sister Marie and some other girls, returned to the grotto. Soubirous knelt down immediately, saying she saw the apparition again and falling into a [[trance]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} When one of the girls threw [[holy water]] at the niche and another threw a rock from above that shattered on the ground, the apparition disappeared.<ref>Taylor 62\u201363.</ref> On her next visit, 18 February, Soubirous said that \"the vision\" asked her to return to the grotto every day for a fortnight.<ref>Taylor 68\u201369.</ref>\n\nThis period of almost daily visions came to be known as ''la Quinzaine sacr\u00e9e'', \"holy fortnight.\" Initially, Soubirous's parents, especially her mother, were embarrassed and tried to forbid her to go. The supposed apparition did not identify herself until the seventeenth vision. Although the townspeople who believed she was telling the truth assumed she saw the Virgin Mary, Soubirous never claimed it to be Mary, consistently using the word ''aquero''. She described the lady as wearing a white veil, a blue girdle and with a yellow rose on each foot&nbsp;\u2013 compatible with \"a description of any statue of the Virgin in a village church\".<ref>Taylor 84.</ref>\n\nSoubirous's story caused a sensation with the townspeople, who were divided in their opinions on whether or not she was telling the truth. Some believed her to have a mental illness and demanded she be put in an asylum.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe other contents of Soubirous's reported visions were simple and focused on the need for prayer and penance. On 25 February she explained that the vision had told her \"to drink of the water of the spring, to wash in it and to eat the herb that grew there,\" as an act of penance. To everyone's surprise, the next day the grotto was no longer muddy but clear water flowed.<ref>Taylor 88\u201390.</ref> On 2 March, at the thirteenth of the alleged apparitions, Soubirous told her family that the lady said that \"a chapel should be built and a procession formed\".<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSoubirous's 16th claimed vision, which she stated went on for over an hour, was on 25 March. According to her account, during that visitation, she again asked the woman for her name but the lady just smiled back. She repeated the question three more times and finally heard the lady say, in [[Gascon language|Gascon]] [[Occitan]], \"I am the [[Immaculate Conception]]\" (''Qu\u00e9 so\u00ef era immaculado councepcio\u0169'', a phonetic transcription of ''Que soi era immaculada concepcion'').<ref name=crawley/>\n\nSome of the people who interviewed Soubirous after her revelation of the visions thought her simple-minded.{{who|date=April 2016}} However, despite being rigorously interviewed by officials of both the Catholic Church and the French government, she stuck consistently to her story.<ref name=crawley/>\n\n== Results of her visions ==\nAfter investigation, Catholic Church authorities confirmed the authenticity of the apparitions in 1862.<ref name=foley/> In the 150 years since Soubirous dug up the spring, 69<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/cures-and-miracles/miraculous-cures-in-lourdes|title=Miraculous cures in Lourdes|publisher=}}</ref> cures have been verified by the [[Lourdes Medical Bureau]] as \"inexplicable\" \u2013 after what the Catholic Church claims are \"extremely rigorous scientific and medical examinations\" that failed to find any other explanation. The Lourdes Commission that examined Bernadette after the visions ran an intensive analysis on the water and found that, while it had a high mineral content, it contained nothing out of the ordinary that would account for the cures attributed to it. Bernadette said that it was faith and prayer that cured the sick: \"One must have faith and pray; the water will have no virtue without faith\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordonfire.org/resources/blog/10-things-to-know-about-our-lady-of-lourdes-and-st-bernadette/2209/|title=10 Things to Know About Our Lady of Lourdes and St Bernadette|last=von Huben|first=Ellyn|date=11 February 2015|website=Word on Fire|access-date=8 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous's request to the local priest to build a chapel at the site of her visions eventually gave rise to a number of chapels and churches at Lourdes. The [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes]] is now one of the major Catholic pilgrimage sites in the world. One of the churches built at the site, the [[Basilica of St. Pius X]], can accommodate 25,000 people and was dedicated by the future [[Pope John XXIII]] when he was the [[Papal Nuncio]] to France. Close to 5&nbsp;million pilgrims from all over the world visit Lourdes (population of about 15,000) every year to pray and to drink the miraculous water, believing that they obtain from the Lord healing of the body and of the spirit.\n\n== Later years ==\n[[File:Bernadette soubirous 2 publicdomain.gif|thumb|150px|Bernadette in 1866, after having took the religious habit and joining the Sisters of Charity]]\nDisliking the attention she was attracting, Bernadette went to the [[hospice]] school run by the [[Sisters of Charity of Nevers]] where she had learned to read and write. Although she considered joining the Carmelites, her health precluded her entering any of the strict contemplative orders. On 29 July 1866, with 42 other candidates, she took the religious habit of a [[postulant]] and joined the Sisters of Charity at their motherhouse at [[Nevers]]. Her Mistress of Novices was Sister [[Marie Therese Vauzou]].<ref name=snddl>{{cite web|url=http://en.lourdes-france.org/deepen/bernadette-soubirous/religious-life|title=Religious life|publisher=}}</ref> The Mother Superior at the time gave her the name Marie-Bernarde<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/spiritual/bernadette-soubirious.html|title=Biography of Bernadette Soubirous|work=Biography Online}}</ref> in honor of her godmother who was named \"Bernarde\". As Patricia A. McEachern observes, \"Bernadette was devoted to Saint Bernard, her patron saint; she copied long texts related to him in notebooks and on bits of paper. The experience of becoming 'Sister Marie-Bernard' marked a turning point for Bernadette as she realized more than ever that the great grace she received from the Queen of Heaven brought with it great responsibilities.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Holy Life\": The Writings of St. Bernadette|last=McEachern|first=Patricia|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSoubirous spent the rest of her brief life at the motherhouse, working as an assistant in the infirmary<ref name=snddl/> and later as a [[Sacristy|sacristan]], creating beautiful [[embroidery]] for altar cloths and [[vestments]].

Soubirous's body was laid to rest in the [[Saint Gildard Convent]].\n\n== Sainthood ==\nSoubirous was declared blessed on 14 June 1925<ref name=bio/> by Pope Pius XI.

The saint died 46 years before the photo]]\nBishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Catholic Church [[exhumation|exhumed]] the body of Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the presence of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the [[crucifix]] in her hand and her [[rosary]] had both [[redox|oxidized]], her body appeared [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] \u2013 preserved from [[decomposition]]. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before burial in a new double casket.\n\nThe church exhumed the corpse a second time on 3 April 1919. A doctor who examined the body noted, \"The body is practically mummified, covered with patches of [[mildew]] and quite a notable layer of salts, which appear to be calcium salts. ...&nbsp;The skin has disappeared in some places, but it is still present on most parts of the body.\"\n\n[[File:Relic of bernadette.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Relic]] of St. Bernadette and stone from the [[Our Lady of Lourdes|Grotto of Lourdes]], where the Marian apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes is said to have appeared]]\nIn 1925, the church exhumed the body for a third time. They took [[relic]]s, which were sent to Rome. A precise imprint of the face was molded so that the firm of [[Pierre Imans]] in Paris could make a wax mask based on the imprints and on some genuine photos to be placed on her body. This was common practice for relics in France as it was feared that the blackish tinge to the face and the sunken eyes and nose would be viewed as corruption by the public. Imprints of the hands were also taken for the presentation of the body and the making of wax casts. The remains were then placed in a gold and [[crystal]] reliquary in the Chapel of Saint Bernadette at the motherhouse in [[Nevers]].\n\nThree years later in 1928, Doctor Comte published a report on the exhumation of Soubirous in the second issue of the ''Bulletin de I'Association medicale de Notre-Dame de Lourdes''.\n\n\"I would have liked to open the left side of the [[thorax]] to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/tmcdonald/the-marvelous-preservation-of-st.-bernadette|title=The Marvelous Preservation of St. Bernadette|website=National Catholic Register|accessdate=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Depictions ==\n* In 1909 the French short movie ''Bernadette Soubirous et les Apparitions de Lourdes'', directed by Honor\u00e9 Le Sablais,<ref name=lasemainedespyrenees>{{cite news|title=Cin\u00e9ma: Un festival \"Lourdes au cin\u00e9ma\"|url=http://www.lasemainedespyrenees.fr/article/08/10/2008/cinema--un-festival-lourdes-au-cinema/704|first=Christophe|last=Ruiz|journal=La Semaine des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es|date=8 October 2008|accessdate=3 July 2013|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{in lang|fr}} See [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bernadette+Soubirous+et+les+Apparitions+de+Lourdes%22%22Honor\u00e9+Le+Sablais%22+film+1909+-wikipedia&num=100&safe=off&filter=0&biw=1440&bih=695 occurrences] on Google.</ref> is the first attempt to tell with the new cinematographic art the story of Bernadette, according to [[RAI 3]] documentary ''Lourdes.

The squadron evaluated aircraft weapons systems and to provide training for air defense units. Aircraft flown by the 4758th DSES were the [[B-57 Canberra]] and [[F-100 Super Sabre]]. On 31 October 1970 the squadron was merged with the 4677th DSES at [[Tyndall AFB]] [[Florida]].\n\nOn 1 August 1970, per Air Force Systems Command Special Order G-94, the AFMDC was inactivated and [[Tactical Air Command]] assumed host responsibilities for Holloman Air Force Base. Associate units and programs transferred to other locations within [[Air Force Systems Command]]. The Test & Evaluation activities that remained were the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (CIGTF), the [[Holloman High Speed Test Track|High Speed Test Track]], the Radar Target Scatter Facility (RATSCAT), and the Target Drone Facility.\n\nThese organizations were combined to form the nucleus of a Holloman AFB tenant organization, the '''6585th Test Group''', with the Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC) at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], New Mexico, designated as the headquarters for the Test Group.\n\nIn 1975, AFSWC was disestablished, and the 6585th Test Group at Holloman became part of the '''Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC)''' at [[Eglin AFB]] [[Florida]].\n\n===Tactical Training Center===\nHolloman was designated a [[Tactical Training Center]] on 1 August 1977 and on 1 October 1993, the Air Force Development Test Center at Eglin AFB was redesignated as the Air Armament Center (AAC).<ref name=\"Air Armament Center Fact Sheet\">{{cite web|title=Air Armament Center Fact Sheet|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433001/air-armament-center-afmc/|website=Air Force Historical Research Agency|publisher=USAF|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, a contract was awarded to Flight Systems Inc. (later Honeywell) to modify 194 surplus [[F-106 Delta Dart|Convair F-106 Delta Dart]] aircraft stored at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] [[Arizona]] to the QF-106A target drone configuration. This program came to be known as Pacer Six, and the first flight of a converted drone took place in July 1987. Following the completion of an initial batch of ten QF-106s in 1990, most of the work was transferred to the USAF itself. Much of the conversion work was done before the aircraft were removed from storage at AMARC, with further work being carried out at [[East St Louis]], [[Illinois]].\n\nThe QF-106s began operating as a Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) in late 1991 at [[White Sands Missile Range]] New Mexico, and later at the Eglin Gulf Test Range in Florida (based at Holloman and Tyndall). A typical mission would employ the QF-106 as a target for an [[infrared homing]] missile. The aircraft had burners placed on pylons underneath the wings to act as IR sources for heat-seeking missiles. The intention of the program was for the QF-106 to survive repeated engagements with [[air-to-air missile]]s, to make it possible for each QF-106 to last as long as possible before it was destroyed. The last shootdown of a QF-106 (57\u20132524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997. The QF-106 was replaced by the QF-4 Phantom drone.\n\nToday, the '''96th Test Group''' from Eglin Air Force Base Florida is responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, and improved maintenance equipment and logistics support.\n\n=== 366th Tactical Fighter Wing ===\nOn 15 July 1963, after serving at [[Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base]], [[France]] as a conventional strike force in Europe, the [[366th Tactical Fighter Wing]] moved to Holloman. The move was a result of French president [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles DeGaulle]]'s deep suspicion of \"supranational organizations\" and his country's shift away from the [[NATO]] orbit in the early 1960s that ultimately led to the closure of [[United States Air Force in France|American air bases in France]].<ref name=\"366th Fighter Wing Fact Sheet\" />\n\n366th TFW was organized as follows:\n\n*[[389th Fighter Squadron|389th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (Blue striping)\n*[[390th Fighter Squadron|390st Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (Yellow striping)\n*[[391st Fighter Squadron|391st Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (Red striping)\n* 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Green striping)\n\n[[File:Emblem of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing.jpg|left|100px|Emblem of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing]]\nAt the time of the wing's arrival at Holloman, they flew the [[F-84|Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]], which were former [[Air National Guard]] aircraft transferred to France during the [[Berlin Wall|1961 Berlin Crisis]] as part of Operation Tack Hammer. At Holloman, the wing began converting to the new [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II]] in February 1965.\n\nLater that year, the wing sent its first squadron to the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. The 390th Fighter Squadron was assigned to [[Da Nang International Airport|Da Nang AB]], and the 391st went to [[Cam Ranh Bay|Cam Ranh Bay AB]] in early 1966.\n\nOn 20 March 1966 the rest of the wing entered the conflict and moved to [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang AB]], Republic of Vietnam in support of [[Vietnam War|combat operations in Vietnam]]. With the transfer of the 366th to Vietnam, the 6583d Air Base Group became the host unit at Holloman.\n\n=== 49th Tactical Fighter Wing ===\n[[File:Hol-f4e.jpg|right|thumb|McDonnell Douglas F-4E-41-MC Phantom II AF Serial No. 68-0531 of the 49th FW.

The 6583d Air Base Group was inactivated in place.\n\nUnder the dual-basing concept, the 49th, stationed at Holloman, deployed individual squadrons periodically to [[Europe]], fulfilling their [[NATO]] commitment. The operational squadrons of the 49th TFW upon its arrival were:\n\n*[[7th Fighter Squadron|7th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (HB/HO, blue)\n*[[8th Fighter Squadron|8th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (HC/HO, yellow)\n*[[9th Fighter Squadron|9th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (HD/HO, red)\n\nAll three squadrons flew the [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II]]. In 1972 squadron aircraft tail codes were standardized on \"HO\".\n\nIn 1969, the wing participated in its first dual-basing exercise, Crested Cap I, deploying 2,000 personnel and 72 aircraft to NATO bases in Europe. Also in 1969, the 49th earned the coveted MacKay Trophy for the \"most meritorious flight of the year\", for the redeployment from Germany to Holloman after Crested Cap II. The MacKay Trophy recognized the 49th for the fastest non-stop deployment of jet aircraft accomplished by a wing's entire fleet.\n\nIn May 1972 the 49th deployed their F-4 aircraft and 2,600 personnel to [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base|Takhli RTAFB]] [[Thailand]]. During this deployment the 49th flew more than 21,000 combat hours over just about every battle zone from An Loc to vital installations in the Hanoi vicinity. During five months of combat, the wing did not lose any aircraft or personnel\u2014a testament to the outstanding training and proficiency of all members of the 49th. The unit received an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] with Combat \"V\" Device for its participation. The 49th TFW officially closed out its [[Southeast Asia]] duty on 9 October 1972, turning over Takhli to a former host unit at Holloman, the 366th TFW which was transferred from [[Da Nang Air Base]] [[South Vietnam]].\n\n'''F-15 Eagle era'''\n\nOn 20 December 1977, the wing began converting from the F-4D to F-15A/Bs. The transition was completed on 4 June 1978.\n\nHistory was made during February 1980, when two pilots from the 49th each flew their F-15s 6,200 miles in just over 14 hours, establishing a record for the longest flight of a single-seat fighter aircraft. The flights required six aerial refuelings, proving the global power of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing.\n\nIn July 1980, the wing acquired the commitment of a primary [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|Rapid Deployment Force]] unit. This tasking, which lasted for a year, required the wing to be ready to deploy its aircraft, crews, and support personnel on short notice. The wing served with the Rapid Deployment Force until July 1981, when the tasking was transferred to the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, [[Langley Air Force Base]] [[Virginia]].\n\nThe 49th demonstrated its capabilities in the fall of 1988, winning top honors at the [[William Tell (aerial gunnery competition)|William Tell]] air-to-air weapons competition. The wing outdistanced the nearest competitor by more than 2,000 points. The 49th won a variety of awards, including the coveted \"Top Gun\" for best fighter pilot.\n\n'''F-117 Nighthawk era'''\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, the 49th underwent a number of transitions. On 1 October 1991, the 49th was redesignated the '''49th Fighter Wing''' as part of an Air Force wide redesignation of units.\n\nOn 1 November 1991, the 7th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations, performing a Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) mission with [[T-38 Talon|Northrop AT-38B Talons]], preparing for the transition to the [[F-117 Nighthawk|Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk]]. during most of 1992.\n\nOn 1 June 1992 the 8th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations and started flying AT-38B LIFT missions.\n\nThe 9th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations on 5 June 1992 and received F-4E aircraft from the 20th Fighter Squadron from the closing [[Southern California Logistics Airport|George AFB]] [[California]] as the Fighter Training Unit for the German Air Force.\n\nThe last F-15 departed Holloman 5 June 1992, ending 14 years of Eagle operations.\n\nOn 9 May 1992, four [[F-117 Nighthawk|Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk]] stealth fighters from the [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]] [[Nevada]], arrived at Holloman. The 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Tonopah was inactivated with the transfer of the last F-117s to Holloman on 8 July 1992.\n\nF-117s were initially assigned to the following squadrons:\n\n* 69th Fighter Squadron -> 8th FS (1 July 1993)\n* 69th Fighter Squadron -> 9th FS (1 July 1993)\n* 417th Fighter Squadron -> 7th FS (1 December 1993)\n\nThese squadrons were PCS (moved Permanent Change of Station) to Holloman as part of the 37th Operations Group on 15 June 1992.  The formal transfer to the 49th Operations group occurred on 8 July 1992 when the 37th OG was inactivated. In 1993 these squadrons were inactivated with assets transferred to the 7th, 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons. The 7th was designated a combat training squadron, the 8th and 9th being deployable operational fighter squadrons.\n\nOn 1 July 1993, the '''20th Fighter Squadron''' was activated as part of the 49th Operations Group, taking over the F-4Es of the 9th FS.  The mission of the 20th FS was to conduct training with the German Air Force. The F-4Es which the 20th FS flew initially were USAF-owned aircraft, however in 1997 the squadron began flying German-owned F-4F aircraft. The F-4Fs, however flew in USAF markings. The 20th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 20 December 2004 and the F-4Fs sent to Germany.\n\nThe '''48th Rescue Squadron''' was activated at Holloman AFB on 1 May 1993 with its six [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk]] helicopters. The personnel of the 48th deployed six times in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch. Additionally, the 48th saved 33 lives in real-world rescues in the American Southwest. The unit was inactivated on 1 February 1999.\n\nThe 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]], [[Italy]] and [[Spangdahlem Air Base]], [[Germany]] from 21 February\u20131 July 1999, in support of Operation Allied Force. Flying more than 1,000 total sorties, pilots flew into heavily defended skies, littered with surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire. In particular, F-117A pilots bravely trusting in their aircraft's low observable technology struck some of the most valuable, and highly guarded targets in [[Serbia]]. The F-117s penetrated the heavily defended areas, which conventional aircraft could not reach, and at least two aircraft were lost.\n\n'''Global War on Terror'''\n\nPeople, airplanes, and equipment of the 49th Fighter Wing played a key role in the continued global war against terrorism and particularly{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The wing's F-117s played a major role, dropping the first bombs against an Iraqi leadership target in [[Baghdad]] on 19 March 2003. In all, F-117 pilots flew more than 80 missions and dropped nearly 100 enhanced guided bomb units against key targets.\n\nApproximately 300 people deployed with the air package and provided direct support to the F-117 mission. Additionally, hundreds of other 49th FW personnel were deployed on other missions.\n\n===479th Tactical Training Wing===\nThe 479th TTW was activated at Holloman on 1 January 1977 to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly tactical fighter or attack aircraft. The 479th Flew AT-38B Talons with the following squadrons:\n\n* 416th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (14 March 1979 \u2013 1 September 1983) (grey stripe)<br />Redesignated 433d TFTS (1 September 1983 \u2013 15 November 1991)\n*[[434th Fighter Training Squadron|434th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron]] (1 January 1977 \u2013 15 November 1991) (red stripe)\n*[[435th Fighter Training Squadron|435th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron]] (1 January 1977 \u2013 15 November 1991) (blue stripe)\n*[[436th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron]] (1 January 1977 \u2013 15 November 1991) (yellow stripe)\n\nAll 479th TTW aircraft carried the \"HM\" tail code. The LIFT program was sharply cut back in 1991, and the wing replaced by the '''479th Fighter Group''' at Holloman, with the aircraft being consolidated under the '''586th Flight Training Squadron'''.\n\nThe 479th was inactivated on 31 July 2000, with squadron resources absorbed by the 49th FW, later being transferred to the 46th Test Group as the '''586th Flight Test Squadron'''.\n\n===Base names===\n\n* Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, 14 May 1942\n* Alamogordo Field Training Station, 27 May 1942\n* Alamogordo Army Air Base, c.

On 1 March 2006, it was announced by the United States Air Force that Holloman would be the new home of two squadrons of [[F-22 Raptor|F-22A Raptors]]. In May 2014, with the inactivation of the [[7th Fighter Squadron]], the F-22 mission ceased at Holloman. The Wing's F-22s were transferred to other F-22 wings to bolster their available aircraft.\n\n=== 96th Test Group ===\n[[File:Hol-at-38b.jpg|thumb|[[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] AT-38AB-45-NO Talon Serial 62-3660 of the 586th Flight Test Squadron (AFMC)|alt=]]\nAs of 18 July 2012, the [[46th Test Group]] was 'reflagged' as the [[96th Test Group]], under the new 96 TW, stationed at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eglin.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id%3D6061 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227083407/http://www.eglin.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=6061 |archivedate=27 December 2010  }}</ref> The 96th Test Group is an [[Air Force Materiel Command]] unit responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces.

With the activation, 300 German military personnel and 12 [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft joined Team Holloman. German aircrews come to Holloman for approximately three weeks for advanced tactical training and then return to Germany. The German Air Force also conducts a Fighter Weapons Instructor Course for the Tornado. Aircrews for this course come to Holloman for about six months.\n\nAs of November 2006 there are 650 German military personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft assigned to Holloman AFB.\n\nThere are numerous reasons the German Air Force trains at Holloman. The area offers great flying weather and has suitable air space. Other reasons are the proximity of Holloman to the German Air Force Air Defense Center at [[Fort Bliss]], [[Texas]] and the centralizing of German aircrew training at a single location. To facilitate this, there is a memorandum of understanding between the two governments.[[File:FlgAusbZLw.jpg|thumb|COA of the German Air Force Tactical Training Center]]By offering NATO allies the benefits of available space at Holloman as well as the use of the Southwest's excellent flying weather, the U.S. can help maintain the strength of NATO's forces without the expense of forward-basing U.S. forces in great numbers overseas.\n\nOn 29 September 1999, two Luftwaffe Tornados crashed near Marathon Indian Basin, about {{convert|15|mi}} northwest of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. The crash was investigated by Holloman AFB 49th Wing Safety and German Air Force Safety personnel. Both pilots successfully ejected, and were uninjured.\n\nIn September 2004, Luftwaffe chief of staff, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz announced a reduction in its training program of roughly 20%.\n\nIn March 2013, it was announced that German Air Force units at [[Fort Bliss]] will transfer to Holloman later that same year; this will end the German Air Force presence at Fort Bliss dating back to 1956.<ref>{{cite news |title=German Air Force plans to leave Fort Bliss |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/03/ap-german-air-force-plans-to-leave-bliss-031113 |newspaper=Army Times |date=11 March 2013 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> In 2015, due to funding constraints on the planned new facilities in Europe, the German Air Force Air Defense school will stay open at Fort Bliss until 2020.<ref>[https://archive.today/20150126022729/http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_27326602/german-air-force-maintains-presence-at-bliss-air \"German air force maintains presence at Bliss;

The squadron evaluated aircraft weapons systems and to provide training for air defense units. Aircraft flown by the 4758th DSES were the [[B-57 Canberra]] and [[F-100 Super Sabre]]. On 31 October 1970 the squadron was merged with the 4677th DSES at [[Tyndall AFB]] [[Florida]].\n\nOn 1 August 1970, per Air Force Systems Command Special Order G-94, the AFMDC was inactivated and [[Tactical Air Command]] assumed host responsibilities for Holloman Air Force Base. Associate units and programs transferred to other locations within [[Air Force Systems Command]]. The Test & Evaluation activities that remained were the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (CIGTF), the [[Holloman High Speed Test Track|High Speed Test Track]], the Radar Target Scatter Facility (RATSCAT), and the Target Drone Facility.\n\nThese organizations were combined to form the nucleus of a Holloman AFB tenant organization, the '''6585th Test Group''', with the Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC) at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], New Mexico, designated as the headquarters for the Test Group.\n\nIn 1975, AFSWC was disestablished, and the 6585th Test Group at Holloman became part of the '''Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC)''' at [[Eglin AFB]] [[Florida]].\n\n===Tactical Training Center===\nHolloman was designated a [[Tactical Training Center]] on 1 August 1977 and on 1 October 1993, the Air Force Development Test Center at Eglin AFB was redesignated as the Air Armament Center (AAC).<ref name=\"Air Armament Center Fact Sheet\">{{cite web|title=Air Armament Center Fact Sheet|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/433001/air-armament-center-afmc/|website=Air Force Historical Research Agency|publisher=USAF|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, a contract was awarded to Flight Systems Inc. (later Honeywell) to modify 194 surplus [[F-106 Delta Dart|Convair F-106 Delta Dart]] aircraft stored at [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] [[Arizona]] to the QF-106A target drone configuration. This program came to be known as Pacer Six, and the first flight of a converted drone took place in July 1987. Following the completion of an initial batch of ten QF-106s in 1990, most of the work was transferred to the USAF itself. Much of the conversion work was done before the aircraft were removed from storage at AMARC, with further work being carried out at [[East St Louis]], [[Illinois]].\n\nThe QF-106s began operating as a Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) in late 1991 at [[White Sands Missile Range]] New Mexico, and later at the Eglin Gulf Test Range in Florida (based at Holloman and Tyndall). A typical mission would employ the QF-106 as a target for an [[infrared homing]] missile. The aircraft had burners placed on pylons underneath the wings to act as IR sources for heat-seeking missiles. The intention of the program was for the QF-106 to survive repeated engagements with [[air-to-air missile]]s, to make it possible for each QF-106 to last as long as possible before it was destroyed. The last shootdown of a QF-106 (57\u20132524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997. The QF-106 was replaced by the QF-4 Phantom drone.\n\nToday, the '''96th Test Group''' from Eglin Air Force Base Florida is responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, and improved maintenance equipment and logistics support.\n\n=== 366th Tactical Fighter Wing ===\nOn 15 July 1963, after serving at [[Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base]], [[France]] as a conventional strike force in Europe, the [[366th Tactical Fighter Wing]] moved to Holloman. The move was a result of French president [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles DeGaulle]]'s deep suspicion of \"supranational organizations\" and his country's shift away from the [[NATO]] orbit in the early 1960s that ultimately led to the closure of [[United States Air Force in France|American air bases in France]].<ref name=\"366th Fighter Wing Fact Sheet\" />\n\n366th TFW was organized as follows:\n\n*[[389th Fighter Squadron|389th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (Blue striping)\n*[[390th Fighter Squadron|390st Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (Yellow striping)\n*[[391st Fighter Squadron|391st Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (Red striping)\n* 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Green striping)\n\n[[File:Emblem of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing.jpg|left|100px|Emblem of the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing]]\nAt the time of the wing's arrival at Holloman, they flew the [[F-84|Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]], which were former [[Air National Guard]] aircraft transferred to France during the [[Berlin Wall|1961 Berlin Crisis]] as part of Operation Tack Hammer. At Holloman, the wing began converting to the new [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II]] in February 1965.\n\nLater that year, the wing sent its first squadron to the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. The 390th Fighter Squadron was assigned to [[Da Nang International Airport|Da Nang AB]], and the 391st went to [[Cam Ranh Bay|Cam Ranh Bay AB]] in early 1966.\n\nOn 20 March 1966 the rest of the wing entered the conflict and moved to [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang AB]], Republic of Vietnam in support of [[Vietnam War|combat operations in Vietnam]].

The 6583d Air Base Group was inactivated in place.\n\nUnder the dual-basing concept, the 49th, stationed at Holloman, deployed individual squadrons periodically to [[Europe]], fulfilling their [[NATO]] commitment. The operational squadrons of the 49th TFW upon its arrival were:\n\n*[[7th Fighter Squadron|7th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (HB/HO, blue)\n*[[8th Fighter Squadron|8th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (HC/HO, yellow)\n*[[9th Fighter Squadron|9th Tactical Fighter Squadron]] (HD/HO, red)\n\nAll three squadrons flew the [[F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II]]. In 1972 squadron aircraft tail codes were standardized on \"HO\".\n\nIn 1969, the wing participated in its first dual-basing exercise, Crested Cap I, deploying 2,000 personnel and 72 aircraft to NATO bases in Europe. Also in 1969, the 49th earned the coveted MacKay Trophy for the \"most meritorious flight of the year\", for the redeployment from Germany to Holloman after Crested Cap II. The MacKay Trophy recognized the 49th for the fastest non-stop deployment of jet aircraft accomplished by a wing's entire fleet.\n\nIn May 1972 the 49th deployed their F-4 aircraft and 2,600 personnel to [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base|Takhli RTAFB]] [[Thailand]]. During this deployment the 49th flew more than 21,000 combat hours over just about every battle zone from An Loc to vital installations in the Hanoi vicinity. During five months of combat, the wing did not lose any aircraft or personnel\u2014a testament to the outstanding training and proficiency of all members of the 49th. The unit received an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] with Combat \"V\" Device for its participation. The 49th TFW officially closed out its [[Southeast Asia]] duty on 9 October 1972, turning over Takhli to a former host unit at Holloman, the 366th TFW which was transferred from [[Da Nang Air Base]] [[South Vietnam]].\n\n'''F-15 Eagle era'''\n\nOn 20 December 1977, the wing began converting from the F-4D to F-15A/Bs. The transition was completed on 4 June 1978.\n\nHistory was made during February 1980, when two pilots from the 49th each flew their F-15s 6,200 miles in just over 14 hours, establishing a record for the longest flight of a single-seat fighter aircraft. The flights required six aerial refuelings, proving the global power of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing.\n\nIn July 1980, the wing acquired the commitment of a primary [[United States Rapid Deployment Forces|Rapid Deployment Force]] unit. This tasking, which lasted for a year, required the wing to be ready to deploy its aircraft, crews, and support personnel on short notice. The wing served with the Rapid Deployment Force until July 1981, when the tasking was transferred to the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, [[Langley Air Force Base]] [[Virginia]].\n\nThe 49th demonstrated its capabilities in the fall of 1988, winning top honors at the [[William Tell (aerial gunnery competition)|William Tell]] air-to-air weapons competition. The wing outdistanced the nearest competitor by more than 2,000 points. The 49th won a variety of awards, including the coveted \"Top Gun\" for best fighter pilot.\n\n'''F-117 Nighthawk era'''\n\nFrom 1991 to 1993, the 49th underwent a number of transitions. On 1 October 1991, the 49th was redesignated the '''49th Fighter Wing''' as part of an Air Force wide redesignation of units.\n\nOn 1 November 1991, the 7th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations, performing a Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) mission with [[T-38 Talon|Northrop AT-38B Talons]], preparing for the transition to the [[F-117 Nighthawk|Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk]]. during most of 1992.\n\nOn 1 June 1992 the 8th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations and started flying AT-38B LIFT missions.\n\nThe 9th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations on 5 June 1992 and received F-4E aircraft from the 20th Fighter Squadron from the closing [[Southern California Logistics Airport|George AFB]] [[California]] as the Fighter Training Unit for the German Air Force.\n\nThe last F-15 departed Holloman 5 June 1992, ending 14 years of Eagle operations.\n\nOn 9 May 1992, four [[F-117 Nighthawk|Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk]] stealth fighters from the [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]] [[Nevada]], arrived at Holloman. The 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Tonopah was inactivated with the transfer of the last F-117s to Holloman on 8 July 1992.\n\nF-117s were initially assigned to the following squadrons:\n\n* 69th Fighter Squadron -> 8th FS (1 July 1993)\n* 69th Fighter Squadron -> 9th FS (1 July 1993)\n* 417th Fighter Squadron -> 7th FS (1 December 1993)\n\nThese squadrons were PCS (moved Permanent Change of Station) to Holloman as part of the 37th Operations Group on 15 June 1992.  The formal transfer to the 49th Operations group occurred on 8 July 1992 when the 37th OG was inactivated. In 1993 these squadrons were inactivated with assets transferred to the 7th, 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons. The 7th was designated a combat training squadron, the 8th and 9th being deployable operational fighter squadrons.\n\nOn 1 July 1993, the '''20th Fighter Squadron''' was activated as part of the 49th Operations Group, taking over the F-4Es of the 9th FS.  The mission of the 20th FS was to conduct training with the German Air Force. The F-4Es which the 20th FS flew initially were USAF-owned aircraft, however in 1997 the squadron began flying German-owned F-4F aircraft. The F-4Fs, however flew in USAF markings. The 20th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 20 December 2004 and the F-4Fs sent to Germany.\n\nThe '''48th Rescue Squadron''' was activated at Holloman AFB on 1 May 1993 with its six [[HH-60 Pave Hawk|Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk]] helicopters. The personnel of the 48th deployed six times in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch. Additionally, the 48th saved 33 lives in real-world rescues in the American Southwest. The unit was inactivated on 1 February 1999.\n\nThe 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons deployed to [[Aviano Air Base]], [[Italy]] and [[Spangdahlem Air Base]], [[Germany]] from 21 February\u20131 July 1999, in support of Operation Allied Force. Flying more than 1,000 total sorties, pilots flew into heavily defended skies, littered with surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire. In particular, F-117A pilots bravely trusting in their aircraft's low observable technology struck some of the most valuable, and highly guarded targets in [[Serbia]]. The F-117s penetrated the heavily defended areas, which conventional aircraft could not reach, and at least two aircraft were lost.\n\n'''Global War on Terror'''\n\nPeople, airplanes, and equipment of the 49th Fighter Wing played a key role in the continued global war against terrorism and particularly{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. The wing's F-117s played a major role, dropping the first bombs against an Iraqi leadership target in [[Baghdad]] on 19 March 2003. In all, F-117 pilots flew more than 80 missions and dropped nearly 100 enhanced guided bomb units against key targets.\n\nApproximately 300 people deployed with the air package and provided direct support to the F-117 mission. Additionally, hundreds of other 49th FW personnel were deployed on other missions.\n\n===479th Tactical Training Wing===\nThe 479th TTW was activated at Holloman on 1 January 1977 to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly tactical fighter or attack aircraft. The 479th Flew AT-38B Talons with the following squadrons:\n\n* 416th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (14 March 1979 \u2013 1 September 1983) (grey stripe)<br />Redesignated 433d TFTS (1 September 1983 \u2013 15 November 1991)\n*[[434th Fighter Training Squadron|434th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron]] (1 January 1977 \u2013 15 November 1991) (red stripe)\n*[[435th Fighter Training Squadron|435th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron]] (1 January 1977 \u2013 15 November 1991) (blue stripe)\n*[[436th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron]] (1 January 1977 \u2013 15 November 1991) (yellow stripe)\n\nAll 479th TTW aircraft carried the \"HM\" tail code.

Additionally, the wing delivers Air Transportable Clinics and Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources while providing support to more than 17,000 military and civilian personnel to include German Air Force Flying Training center operations.

The wing deploys combat-ready and mission-support forces supporting Air Expeditionary Force operations, Overseas Contingency Operations, and peacetime contingencies.\n\nThe [[49th Operations Group]] supports national security objectives, as directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by utilizing the Air Force's MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft. The operational squadrons are:\n\n*[[6th Reconnaissance Squadron]] (MQ-9)\n*[[9th Attack Squadron]] (MQ-9)\n*16th Training Squadron (MQ-9)\n*[[29th Attack Squadron]] (MQ-9)\n*49th Operations Support Squadron\n\nThe Operations Group took over the activities of the inactivated 37th Fighter Wing at [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]] when the [[F-117A]]s were transferred to Holloman in 1993. In addition to the 49th OG, other components of the 49th Wing are:\n\n* 49th Maintenance Group: Maintains aircraft, propulsion, avionics and accessory systems for the F-22A Raptor, T-38 Talon & MQ-9 Reaper.\n* 49th Mission Support Group: Provides support to all base operations, personnel, and family members.\n* 49th Medical Group: Provides medical services for active duty and retired military members and their families\n* 49th Materiel Maintenance Group: Maintains and deploys all equipment needed to build a \"BEAR base\" airfield\n* Detachment 1, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (From [[Tyndall AFB]], [[Florida]]):  Maintains and operates Q[[F-16]] Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) drone aircraft (Tail Code HD).\n\nIn February 2006, the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] announced that Holloman would cease to be home to the [[F-117A]] Nighthawk. This move coincided with an announcement that the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117]] will be removed from service on or about 2008. On 1 March 2006, it was announced by the United States Air Force that Holloman would be the new home of two squadrons of [[F-22 Raptor|F-22A Raptors]]. In May 2014, with the inactivation of the [[7th Fighter Squadron]], the F-22 mission ceased at Holloman.

With the activation, 300 German military personnel and 12 [[Panavia Tornado]] aircraft joined Team Holloman. German aircrews come to Holloman for approximately three weeks for advanced tactical training and then return to Germany. The German Air Force also conducts a Fighter Weapons Instructor Course for the Tornado. Aircrews for this course come to Holloman for about six months.\n\nAs of November 2006 there are 650 German military personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft assigned to Holloman AFB.\n\nThere are numerous reasons the German Air Force trains at Holloman. The area offers great flying weather and has suitable air space. Other reasons are the proximity of Holloman to the German Air Force Air Defense Center at [[Fort Bliss]], [[Texas]] and the centralizing of German aircrew training at a single location. To facilitate this, there is a memorandum of understanding between the two governments.[[File:FlgAusbZLw.jpg|thumb|COA of the German Air Force Tactical Training Center]]By offering NATO allies the benefits of available space at Holloman as well as the use of the Southwest's excellent flying weather, the U.S. can help maintain the strength of NATO's forces without the expense of forward-basing U.S. forces in great numbers overseas.\n\nOn 29 September 1999, two Luftwaffe Tornados crashed near Marathon Indian Basin, about {{convert|15|mi}} northwest of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. The crash was investigated by Holloman AFB 49th Wing Safety and German Air Force Safety personnel. Both pilots successfully ejected, and were uninjured.\n\nIn September 2004, Luftwaffe chief of staff, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz announced a reduction in its training program of roughly 20%.\n\nIn March 2013, it was announced that German Air Force units at [[Fort Bliss]] will transfer to Holloman later that same year;

The most common Ukrainian heavy metal subgenres are black, pagan, folk and death metal. The most popular and well-known bands are black metal bands [[Drudkh]], [[Nokturnal Mortum]], [[Khors]], death metal bands Fleshgore, Firelake, folk metal bands [[Tin Sontsia]], [[Veremiy]] and [[Jinjer]], a metalcore band. Among the biggest festivals are Metal Heads Mission ([[Crimea]], [[de jure]] control), [[Carpathian Alliance]] ([[Lviv oblast]]), [[Global East]] ([[Kyiv]]), [[ProRock]] (Kyiv).\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\n'''[[Adem (band)|Adem]]''' was one of the first thrash metal bands to emerge from [[Kyiv]]. They were pioneers of the style in Ukraine and former [[USSR]] in the middle of 1980s.\n\nAdem was formed in 1985 by founding members Yuriy Fedoretenko (guitar) and Viktor Lukianov (bass guitar), later joined by drummer Simon Rymar and second guitarist Volodymyr Stetsenko. At the end of 1986 the group\u2019s line-up was changed - Yuriy Fedoretenko and Volodymyr Stetsenko were replaced by Ihor Shilin (guitars, vocals) and Vadym Virvalsky (second guitarist).\n\nIn late 1980s Adem recorded two studio albums: \"Time of Maddness\" (1988) and \"Golgotha\" (1989)\n\nThe band was well received on their first tour around Ukriaine and Russia in 1987. The next tour  was to Rock Festival \"Drama\" in [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Poland), it took place in 1989.\n\nIn 1990 the group's line-up changed again. Ihor Shilin, Simon Rymar and Vadym Virvalsky left the band, and were replaced by Andriy Antonenko (guitars, vocals) and Yarik (drums). The new album \"Fight Without Rules\" was released in 1996. Adem stopped touring and recording sometime in 1997.\n\nIn 2003 ex-drummer Simon Rymar collected and restored previously recorded albums \"Times of Maddness\" and \"Golgotha\" at the Backstage Studio (United States). The materials were used by Moon Records Studio Recording Company to release these two albums in Ukraine, in 2004.\n\nTheir new album, \"The Souls of Aggression\" was released in 2005. It includes a collection of other songs from the previous years.<ref>[http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/biographie-groupe-Adem-id_bio-4308-l-en.html Biography: Adem]</ref>\n\n'''[[Tok (band)|TOK]]''' was formed in 1986 in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR (today Dnipro, Ukraine).\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Nokturnal_Mortum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nokturnal Mortum at Hell Fast Attack festival, 2015]]\n'''[[Nokturnal Mortum]]''' started as a [[death metal]] band called '''Suppuration''' in 1991,<ref name=rivadavia>{{cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |title=Nokturnal Mortum \u2013 Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nokturnal-mortum-mn0000450479 |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref> then they turned to black metal and changed name to '''{{not a typo|Crystaline}} Darkness''' but \"had to change the name back between 1993 and 1994 to Nocturnal Mortum because there already existed a band with that name in the western underground.\"<ref name=firegoat>Sonia: [http://www.firegoat.com/eng/?id=3&d=16 ''INTERVIEW WITH NOKTURNAL MORTUM''].</ref> Then the band \"changed the letter so that we wouldn't find a band with the same name again like it was the case with {{not a typo|Crystaline}} Darkness.\"<ref name=firegoat/> Nokturnal Mortum gained their first Western recognition with the release of their album ''[[Goat Horns]]'', their second full-length album, notable for having two keyboardists play on the album, often on the same song, and for mixing traditional Ukrainian music with black metal.\n\nThe band's first albums were released through The End Records and (as licence pressings) through [[Nuclear Blast]],<ref>Aaron McKay: [http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-363_the_end_records.aspx ''The Genesis of the End''. ''CoC interviews Andreas Katsambas of The End Records''].</ref> but the label and band separated after releasing the album ''[[Nechrist]]'' and a re-release of the ''[[Lunar Poetry]]'' demo due to a disagreement. According to Varggoth, \"We had a contract with The End Records but it was broken. We have different points of view. They didn't like our policy, we didn't like the way they do business. They owe us some money. That was enough for a conflict.\"\n\nBand frontman [[Knjaz Varggoth]] is one of the foremost figures in Eastern European [[National Socialist Black Metal]] (NSBM) and has played in various NSBM bands, like Aryan Terrorism, Warhead and Temnozor. Nokturnal Mortum's albums \"Weltanschauung\" and the live album \"Live in Katowice\" were released by [[No Colours Records]], a German label associated with NSBM. In an interview with Frostkamp, Varggoth said that the album \"Weltanschauung\" is influenced by [[Miguel Serrano]], a former Chilean diplomat, holocaust denier and major figure in [[Esoteric Hitlerism]].<ref>http://frostkamp.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/nokturnal-mortum-interview/</ref>\n\n'''[[Soulrest]]''' appeared in 1996 in [[Uzhhorod]], Ukraine.\n\nIn the beginning, the band consisted of Doni (drums), Lemi (guitars, vocals) and Yasya (guitarist). They prepared their first demo, which contained compositions written mainly by Lemi. But after some discords, Lemi left the band. In the end of 1996 Dyma (keyboards) and Carcass (vocals) joined the band. In November 1996, this new staff recorded three albums: \"Pathological Processes\", \"This is my Life\", and \"Perpetual Decay\".\n\nIn the beginning of 1997 Ihor, the second guitarist, entered the band, and 5 new songs were recorded with him in April, 1997. At the end of spring, 1997, Soulrest released the demo entitled \"Pathological Processes\", consisting of 8 compositions (40 min). Releasing the demo, Soulrest took part in many concerts and becomes the leading band in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]. At the end of 1997, Carcass leaves the band, and Kasym becomes a new vocalist. With this staff, Soulrest had a concert in Slovakia on the [[Open Air festival]]. After a number concerts in Transcarpathia Kasym left the band and Soulrest continued to play without a vocalist. In 1999 Doni left the band and the new members of Soulrest became Laci (bass) and Tibi (drums). The second album, \"Sentenced To Suicide\" was released in December 2001 with their participation.<ref>[http://soulrestband.tripod.com/band.html Soulrest biography]</ref>\n\n'''Firelake''' was formed in 1997 by Oleh Yavorskyi (guitar), Oleksiy Akulshyn (guitar) and Andriy Salnikov (drums). Under the influence of extremely bands popular at the time of the \"[[Swedish death metal|Swedish wave of death metal]]\" (bands like [[At the Gates]], [[In Flames]] and [[Dark Tranquillity]]), the first musical compositions of Firelake were created with a slant to classic melodic death metal.<ref>[http://www.firelake.in.ua/en/band.php Firelake biography]</ref> After internal arguing, and difficulties to be produced, the band finally managed to find its own style, as melodic death metal band.\n\n===2000s===\n\n'''Fleshgore''' is a [[death metal]] band formed from [[Kyiv]]. It was formed in late 2000 and has gone through a number of line-up changes. Guitarist Ihor Lystopad is the only original member. In their touring history, they have played in 19 countries including Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Slovakia, Sweden and Germany, where they played in [[Wacken Open Air]] in 2006.\n\n[[File:Basowiszcza-2007-TinSoncia-3.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Tin Sontsia at [[Basovi\u0161\u010da]] festival, 2007.]]\n\n'''[[Tin Sontsya|Tin Sontsia]]''' is a Ukrainian [[folk metal]] band from [[Kyiv]].

The most common Ukrainian heavy metal subgenres are black, pagan, folk and death metal. The most popular and well-known bands are black metal bands [[Drudkh]], [[Nokturnal Mortum]], [[Khors]], death metal bands Fleshgore, Firelake, folk metal bands [[Tin Sontsia]], [[Veremiy]] and [[Jinjer]], a metalcore band. Among the biggest festivals are Metal Heads Mission ([[Crimea]], [[de jure]] control), [[Carpathian Alliance]] ([[Lviv oblast]]), [[Global East]] ([[Kyiv]]), [[ProRock]] (Kyiv).\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\n'''[[Adem (band)|Adem]]''' was one of the first thrash metal bands to emerge from [[Kyiv]]. They were pioneers of the style in Ukraine and former [[USSR]] in the middle of 1980s.\n\nAdem was formed in 1985 by founding members Yuriy Fedoretenko (guitar) and Viktor Lukianov (bass guitar), later joined by drummer Simon Rymar and second guitarist Volodymyr Stetsenko. At the end of 1986 the group\u2019s line-up was changed - Yuriy Fedoretenko and Volodymyr Stetsenko were replaced by Ihor Shilin (guitars, vocals) and Vadym Virvalsky (second guitarist).\n\nIn late 1980s Adem recorded two studio albums: \"Time of Maddness\" (1988) and \"Golgotha\" (1989)\n\nThe band was well received on their first tour around Ukriaine and Russia in 1987. The next tour  was to Rock Festival \"Drama\" in [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Poland), it took place in 1989.\n\nIn 1990 the group's line-up changed again. Ihor Shilin, Simon Rymar and Vadym Virvalsky left the band, and were replaced by Andriy Antonenko (guitars, vocals) and Yarik (drums). The new album \"Fight Without Rules\" was released in 1996. Adem stopped touring and recording sometime in 1997.\n\nIn 2003 ex-drummer Simon Rymar collected and restored previously recorded albums \"Times of Maddness\" and \"Golgotha\" at the Backstage Studio (United States). The materials were used by Moon Records Studio Recording Company to release these two albums in Ukraine, in 2004.\n\nTheir new album, \"The Souls of Aggression\" was released in 2005. It includes a collection of other songs from the previous years.<ref>[http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/biographie-groupe-Adem-id_bio-4308-l-en.html Biography: Adem]</ref>\n\n'''[[Tok (band)|TOK]]''' was formed in 1986 in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukrainian SSR (today Dnipro, Ukraine).\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Nokturnal_Mortum.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nokturnal Mortum at Hell Fast Attack festival, 2015]]\n'''[[Nokturnal Mortum]]''' started as a [[death metal]] band called '''Suppuration''' in 1991,<ref name=rivadavia>{{cite web |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |title=Nokturnal Mortum \u2013 Biography |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nokturnal-mortum-mn0000450479 |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref> then they turned to black metal and changed name to '''{{not a typo|Crystaline}} Darkness''' but \"had to change the name back between 1993 and 1994 to Nocturnal Mortum because there already existed a band with that name in the western underground.\"<ref name=firegoat>Sonia: [http://www.firegoat.com/eng/?id=3&d=16 ''INTERVIEW WITH NOKTURNAL MORTUM''].</ref> Then the band \"changed the letter so that we wouldn't find a band with the same name again like it was the case with {{not a typo|Crystaline}} Darkness.\"<ref name=firegoat/> Nokturnal Mortum gained their first Western recognition with the release of their album ''[[Goat Horns]]'', their second full-length album, notable for having two keyboardists play on the album, often on the same song, and for mixing traditional Ukrainian music with black metal.\n\nThe band's first albums were released through The End Records and (as licence pressings) through [[Nuclear Blast]],<ref>Aaron McKay: [http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/chats/1-363_the_end_records.aspx ''The Genesis of the End''. ''CoC interviews Andreas Katsambas of The End Records''].</ref> but the label and band separated after releasing the album ''[[Nechrist]]'' and a re-release of the ''[[Lunar Poetry]]'' demo due to a disagreement. According to Varggoth, \"We had a contract with The End Records but it was broken. We have different points of view. They didn't like our policy, we didn't like the way they do business. They owe us some money. That was enough for a conflict.\"\n\nBand frontman [[Knjaz Varggoth]] is one of the foremost figures in Eastern European [[National Socialist Black Metal]] (NSBM) and has played in various NSBM bands, like Aryan Terrorism, Warhead and Temnozor. Nokturnal Mortum's albums \"Weltanschauung\" and the live album \"Live in Katowice\" were released by [[No Colours Records]], a German label associated with NSBM. In an interview with Frostkamp, Varggoth said that the album \"Weltanschauung\" is influenced by [[Miguel Serrano]], a former Chilean diplomat, holocaust denier and major figure in [[Esoteric Hitlerism]].<ref>http://frostkamp.wordpress.com/2008/08/05/nokturnal-mortum-interview/</ref>\n\n'''[[Soulrest]]''' appeared in 1996 in [[Uzhhorod]], Ukraine.\n\nIn the beginning, the band consisted of Doni (drums), Lemi (guitars, vocals) and Yasya (guitarist). They prepared their first demo, which contained compositions written mainly by Lemi. But after some discords, Lemi left the band. In the end of 1996 Dyma (keyboards) and Carcass (vocals) joined the band. In November 1996, this new staff recorded three albums: \"Pathological Processes\", \"This is my Life\", and \"Perpetual Decay\".\n\nIn the beginning of 1997 Ihor, the second guitarist, entered the band, and 5 new songs were recorded with him in April, 1997. At the end of spring, 1997, Soulrest released the demo entitled \"Pathological Processes\", consisting of 8 compositions (40 min). Releasing the demo, Soulrest took part in many concerts and becomes the leading band in [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]. At the end of 1997, Carcass leaves the band, and Kasym becomes a new vocalist. With this staff, Soulrest had a concert in Slovakia on the [[Open Air festival]]. After a number concerts in Transcarpathia Kasym left the band and Soulrest continued to play without a vocalist. In 1999 Doni left the band and the new members of Soulrest became Laci (bass) and Tibi (drums). The second album, \"Sentenced To Suicide\" was released in December 2001 with their participation.<ref>[http://soulrestband.tripod.com/band.html Soulrest biography]</ref>\n\n'''Firelake''' was formed in 1997 by Oleh Yavorskyi (guitar), Oleksiy Akulshyn (guitar) and Andriy Salnikov (drums). Under the influence of extremely bands popular at the time of the \"[[Swedish death metal|Swedish wave of death metal]]\" (bands like [[At the Gates]], [[In Flames]] and [[Dark Tranquillity]]), the first musical compositions of Firelake were created with a slant to classic melodic death metal.<ref>[http://www.firelake.in.ua/en/band.php Firelake biography]</ref> After internal arguing, and difficulties to be produced, the band finally managed to find its own style, as melodic death metal band.\n\n===2000s===\n\n'''Fleshgore''' is a [[death metal]] band formed from [[Kyiv]].

It is a measure of how efficiently a limited frequency spectrum is utilized by the [[physical layer]] protocol, and sometimes by the [[media access control]] (the [[channel access]] protocol).<ref name=Miao>[[Guowang Miao]], Jens Zander, Ki Won Sung, and Ben Slimane, Fundamentals of Mobile Data Networks, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107143217}}, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Link spectral efficiency==\nThe '''link spectral efficiency''' of a digital communication system is measured in ''[[bit]]/[[second|s]]/[[hertz|Hz]]'',<ref>{{cite book | title = Principles of Digital Transmission: With Wireless Applications | author = Sergio Benedetto and Ezio Biglieri | isbn = 0-306-45753-9 | year = 1999 | publisher = Springer | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=thfj9S8cbdoC&pg=RA1-PA219&dq=%22spectral+efficiency%22+(bit/s)/Hz&lr=&as_brr=3&ei=ZHSuR4XrIo6IswPtrIH-BQ&sig=KvPGYnsRaQVXQ2AtXXPvPA2c5H8 }}</ref> or, less frequently but unambiguously, in ''(bit/s)/Hz''. It is the [[net bitrate]] (useful information rate excluding [[error-correcting code]]s) or [[maximum throughput]] divided by the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in hertz of a [[communication channel]] or a [[data link]]. Alternatively, the spectral efficiency may be measured in ''bit/symbol'', which is equivalent to ''bits per [[channel use]]'' (''bpcu''), implying that the net bit rate is divided by the [[symbol rate]] (modulation rate) or line code pulse rate.\n\nLink spectral efficiency is typically used to analyse the efficiency of a [[digital modulation]] method or [[line code]], sometimes in combination with a [[forward error correction]] (FEC) code and other physical layer overhead. In the latter case, a \"bit\" refers to a user data bit; FEC overhead is always excluded.\n\nThe '''modulation efficiency''' in bit/s is the [[gross bitrate]] (including any error-correcting code) divided by the bandwidth.\n\n:'''Example 1''': A transmission technique using one [[kilohertz]] of bandwidth to transmit 1,000 bits per second has a modulation efficiency of 1 (bit/s)/Hz.\n\n:'''Example 2''': A [[V.92]] modem for the telephone network can transfer 56,000&nbsp;bit/s downstream and 48,000&nbsp;bit/s upstream over an analog telephone network. Due to filtering in the telephone exchange, the frequency range is limited to between 300 hertz and 3,400 hertz, corresponding to a bandwidth of 3,400 \u2212 300 = 3,100 hertz. The spectral efficiency or modulation efficiency is 56,000/3,100 = 18.1&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz downstream, and 48,000/3,100 = 15.5&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz upstream.\n\nAn upper bound for the attainable modulation efficiency is given by the [[Nyquist rate]] or [[Hartley's law]] as follows: For a signaling alphabet with ''M'' alternative symbols, each symbol represents ''N'' = log<sub>2</sub> ''M'' bits. ''N'' is the modulation efficiency measured in ''bit/symbol'' or ''bpcu''. In the case of [[baseband transmission]] ([[line coding]] or [[pulse-amplitude modulation]]) with a baseband bandwidth (or upper cut-off frequency) ''B'', the [[symbol rate]] can not exceed 2''B'' symbols/s in view to avoid [[intersymbol interference]]. Thus, the spectral efficiency can not exceed 2''N'' (bit/s)/Hz in the baseband transmission case. In the passband transmission case, a signal with passband bandwidth ''W'' can be converted to an equivalent baseband signal (using [[undersampling]] or a [[superheterodyne receiver]]), with upper cut-off frequency ''W''/2. If double-sideband modulation schemes such as QAM, ASK, PSK or OFDM are used, this results in a maximum symbol rate of ''W'' symbols/s, and in that the modulation efficiency can not exceed ''N'' (bit/s)/Hz. If digital [[single-sideband modulation]] is used, the passband signal with bandwidth ''W'' corresponds to a baseband message signal with baseband bandwidth ''W'', resulting in a maximum symbol rate of 2''W'' and an attainable modulation efficiency of 2''N'' (bit/s)/Hz.\n\n:'''Example 3:''' A 16QAM modem has an alphabet size of ''M'' = 16 alternative symbols, with ''N'' = 4 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since QAM is a form of double sideband passband transmission, the spectral efficiency cannot exceed ''N'' = 4&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz.\n\n:'''Example 4:''' The [[8VSB]] (8-level vestigial sideband) modulation scheme used in the [[ATSC digital television standard]] gives ''N''=3 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since it can be described as nearly single-side band, the modulation efficiency is close to 2''N'' = 6&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz. In practice, ATSC transfers a gross bit rate of 32&nbsp;Mbit/s over a 6&nbsp;MHz wide channel, resulting in a modulation efficiency of 32/6 = 5.3&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz.\n \n:'''Example 5:''' The downlink of a V.92 modem uses a pulse-amplitude modulation with 128 signal levels, resulting in ''N'' = 7 bit/symbol. Since the transmitted signal before passband filtering can be considered as baseband transmission, the spectral efficiency cannot exceed 2''N'' = 14&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz over the full baseband channel (0 to 4&nbsp;kHz). As seen above, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved if we consider the smaller passband bandwidth.\n\nIf a [[forward error correction]] code is used, the spectral efficiency is reduced from the uncoded modulation efficiency figure.\n\n:'''Example 6:''' If a forward error correction (FEC) code with [[code rate]] 1/2 is added, meaning that the encoder input bit rate is one half the encoder output rate, the spectral efficiency is 50% of the modulation efficiency. In exchange for this reduction in spectral efficiency, FEC usually reduces the [[bit-error rate]], and typically enables operation at a lower [[signal to noise ratio]] (SNR).\n\nAn upper bound for the spectral efficiency possible without [[bit error]]s in a channel with a certain SNR, if ideal error coding and modulation is assumed, is given by the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]].\n\n:'''Example 7:'''  If the SNR is 1, corresponding to 0 [[decibel]], the link spectral efficiency can not exceed 1&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz for error-free detection (assuming an ideal error-correcting code) according to Shannon-Hartley regardless of the modulation and coding.\n\nNote that the [[goodput]] (the amount of application layer useful information) is normally lower than the [[maximum throughput]] used in the above calculations, because of packet retransmissions, higher protocol layer overhead, flow control, congestion avoidance, etc. On the other hand, a data compression scheme, such as the [[V.44]] or [[V.42bis]] compression used in telephone modems, may however give higher goodput if the transferred data is not already efficiently compressed.\n\nThe link spectral efficiency of a wireless telephony link may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous calls over 1&nbsp;MHz frequency spectrum in erlangs per megahertz, or ''[[Erlang unit|E]]/MHz''. This measure is also affected by the source coding (data compression) scheme. It may be applied to analog as well as digital transmission.\n\nIn wireless networks, the ''link spectral efficiency'' can be somewhat misleading, as larger values are not necessarily more efficient in their overall use of radio spectrum. In a wireless network, high link spectral efficiency may result in high sensitivity to co-channel interference (crosstalk), which affects the capacity. For example, in a [[cellular telephone]] network with frequency reuse, [[spread spectrum|spectrum spreading]] and [[forward error correction]] reduce the spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz but substantially lower the required signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to non-spread spectrum techniques. This can allow for much denser geographical frequency reuse that compensates for the lower link spectral efficiency, resulting in approximately the same capacity (the same number of simultaneous phone calls) over the same bandwidth, using the same number of base station transmitters. As discussed below, a more relevant measure for wireless networks would be ''system spectral efficiency'' in bit/s/Hz per unit area. However, in closed communication links such as telephone lines and cable TV networks, and in noise-limited wireless communication system where co-channel interference is not a factor, the largest link spectral efficiency that can be supported by the available SNR is generally used.\n\n== System spectral efficiency or area spectral efficiency ==\n\nIn digital [[wireless network]]s, the ''system spectral efficiency'' or area spectral efficiency is typically measured in ''(bit/s)/Hz per unit area'', in ''(bit/s)/Hz per [[cell site|cell]]'', or in ''(bit/s)/Hz per site''. It is a measure of the quantity of users or services that can be simultaneously supported by a limited radio frequency bandwidth in a defined geographic area.<ref name=Miao/> It may for example be defined as the maximum aggregated [[throughput]] or [[goodput]], i.e. summed over all users in the system, divided by the channel bandwidth and by the covered area or number of base station sites. This measure is affected not only by the single user transmission technique, but also by [[multiple access]] schemes and [[radio resource management]] techniques utilized. It can be substantially improved by dynamic [[radio resource management]]. If it is defined as a measure of the maximum goodput, retransmissions due to co-channel interference and collisions are excluded. Higher-layer protocol overhead (above the [[media access control]] sublayer) is normally neglected.\n\n:'''Example 8:''' In a cellular system based on [[frequency-division multiple access]] (FDMA) with a [[fixed channel allocation]] (FCA) cellplan using a [[frequency reuse factor]] of 1/4, each base station has access to 1/4 of the total available frequency spectrum. Thus, the maximum possible system spectral efficiency in ''(bit/s)/Hz per site'' is 1/4 of the link spectral efficiency. Each base station may be divided into 3 cells by means of 3 sector antennas, also known as a 4/12 reuse pattern. Then each cell has access to 1/12 of the available spectrum, and the system spectral efficiency in ''(bit/s)/Hz per cell'' or ''(bit/s)/Hz per sector'' is 1/12 of the link spectral efficiency.\n\nThe system spectral efficiency of a [[cellular network]] may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous phone calls per area unit over 1&nbsp;MHz frequency spectrum in ''[[Erlang unit|E]]/MHz per cell'', ''E/MHz per sector'', ''E/MHz per site'', or ''(E/MHz)/m<sup>2</sup>''. This measure is also affected by the source coding (data compression) scheme. It may be used in analog cellular networks as well.\n\nLow link spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz does not necessarily mean that an encoding scheme is inefficient from a system spectral efficiency point of view. As an example, consider [[CDMA|Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA)]] [[spread spectrum]], which is not a particularly spectral efficient encoding scheme when considering a single channel or single user. However, the fact that one can \"layer\" multiple channels on the same frequency band means that the system spectrum utilization for a multi-channel CDMA system can be very good.\n\n:'''Example 9:''' In the [[W-CDMA]] 3G cellular system, every phone call is compressed to a maximum of 8,500 bit/s (the useful bitrate), and spread out over a 5&nbsp;MHz wide frequency channel. This corresponds to a link throughput of only 8,500/5,000,000 = 0.0017&nbsp;''(bit/s)/Hz''. Let us assume that 100 simultaneous (non-silent) calls are possible in the same cell. [[Spread spectrum]] makes it possible to have as low a frequency reuse factor as 1, if each base station is divided into 3 cells by means of 3 directional sector antennas. This corresponds to a system spectrum efficiency of over 1 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 0.0017 = 0.17&nbsp;''(bit/s)/Hz per site'', and 0.17/3 = 0.06 ''(bit/s)/Hz per cell or sector''.\n\nThe spectral efficiency can be improved by [[radio resource management]] techniques such as efficient fixed or dynamic [[channel allocation]], [[power control]], [[link adaptation]] and [[diversity scheme]]s.\n\nA combined [[fairness measure]] and system spectral efficiency measure is the [[fairly shared spectral efficiency]].\n\n==Comparison table==\nExamples of predicted numerical spectral efficiency values of some common communication systems can be found in the table below.

It is the [[net bitrate]] (useful information rate excluding [[error-correcting code]]s) or [[maximum throughput]] divided by the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] in hertz of a [[communication channel]] or a [[data link]]. Alternatively, the spectral efficiency may be measured in ''bit/symbol'', which is equivalent to ''bits per [[channel use]]'' (''bpcu''), implying that the net bit rate is divided by the [[symbol rate]] (modulation rate) or line code pulse rate.\n\nLink spectral efficiency is typically used to analyse the efficiency of a [[digital modulation]] method or [[line code]], sometimes in combination with a [[forward error correction]] (FEC) code and other physical layer overhead. In the latter case, a \"bit\" refers to a user data bit; FEC overhead is always excluded.\n\nThe '''modulation efficiency''' in bit/s is the [[gross bitrate]] (including any error-correcting code) divided by the bandwidth.\n\n:'''Example 1''': A transmission technique using one [[kilohertz]] of bandwidth to transmit 1,000 bits per second has a modulation efficiency of 1 (bit/s)/Hz.\n\n:'''Example 2''': A [[V.92]] modem for the telephone network can transfer 56,000&nbsp;bit/s downstream and 48,000&nbsp;bit/s upstream over an analog telephone network. Due to filtering in the telephone exchange, the frequency range is limited to between 300 hertz and 3,400 hertz, corresponding to a bandwidth of 3,400 \u2212 300 = 3,100 hertz. The spectral efficiency or modulation efficiency is 56,000/3,100 = 18.1&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz downstream, and 48,000/3,100 = 15.5&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz upstream.\n\nAn upper bound for the attainable modulation efficiency is given by the [[Nyquist rate]] or [[Hartley's law]] as follows: For a signaling alphabet with ''M'' alternative symbols, each symbol represents ''N'' = log<sub>2</sub> ''M'' bits. ''N'' is the modulation efficiency measured in ''bit/symbol'' or ''bpcu''. In the case of [[baseband transmission]] ([[line coding]] or [[pulse-amplitude modulation]]) with a baseband bandwidth (or upper cut-off frequency) ''B'', the [[symbol rate]] can not exceed 2''B'' symbols/s in view to avoid [[intersymbol interference]]. Thus, the spectral efficiency can not exceed 2''N'' (bit/s)/Hz in the baseband transmission case. In the passband transmission case, a signal with passband bandwidth ''W'' can be converted to an equivalent baseband signal (using [[undersampling]] or a [[superheterodyne receiver]]), with upper cut-off frequency ''W''/2. If double-sideband modulation schemes such as QAM, ASK, PSK or OFDM are used, this results in a maximum symbol rate of ''W'' symbols/s, and in that the modulation efficiency can not exceed ''N'' (bit/s)/Hz. If digital [[single-sideband modulation]] is used, the passband signal with bandwidth ''W'' corresponds to a baseband message signal with baseband bandwidth ''W'', resulting in a maximum symbol rate of 2''W'' and an attainable modulation efficiency of 2''N'' (bit/s)/Hz.\n\n:'''Example 3:''' A 16QAM modem has an alphabet size of ''M'' = 16 alternative symbols, with ''N'' = 4 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since QAM is a form of double sideband passband transmission, the spectral efficiency cannot exceed ''N'' = 4&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz.\n\n:'''Example 4:''' The [[8VSB]] (8-level vestigial sideband) modulation scheme used in the [[ATSC digital television standard]] gives ''N''=3 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since it can be described as nearly single-side band, the modulation efficiency is close to 2''N'' = 6&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz. In practice, ATSC transfers a gross bit rate of 32&nbsp;Mbit/s over a 6&nbsp;MHz wide channel, resulting in a modulation efficiency of 32/6 = 5.3&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz.\n \n:'''Example 5:''' The downlink of a V.92 modem uses a pulse-amplitude modulation with 128 signal levels, resulting in ''N'' = 7 bit/symbol. Since the transmitted signal before passband filtering can be considered as baseband transmission, the spectral efficiency cannot exceed 2''N'' = 14&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz over the full baseband channel (0 to 4&nbsp;kHz). As seen above, a higher spectral efficiency is achieved if we consider the smaller passband bandwidth.\n\nIf a [[forward error correction]] code is used, the spectral efficiency is reduced from the uncoded modulation efficiency figure.\n\n:'''Example 6:''' If a forward error correction (FEC) code with [[code rate]] 1/2 is added, meaning that the encoder input bit rate is one half the encoder output rate, the spectral efficiency is 50% of the modulation efficiency. In exchange for this reduction in spectral efficiency, FEC usually reduces the [[bit-error rate]], and typically enables operation at a lower [[signal to noise ratio]] (SNR).\n\nAn upper bound for the spectral efficiency possible without [[bit error]]s in a channel with a certain SNR, if ideal error coding and modulation is assumed, is given by the [[Shannon-Hartley theorem]].\n\n:'''Example 7:'''  If the SNR is 1, corresponding to 0 [[decibel]], the link spectral efficiency can not exceed 1&nbsp;(bit/s)/Hz for error-free detection (assuming an ideal error-correcting code) according to Shannon-Hartley regardless of the modulation and coding.\n\nNote that the [[goodput]] (the amount of application layer useful information) is normally lower than the [[maximum throughput]] used in the above calculations, because of packet retransmissions, higher protocol layer overhead, flow control, congestion avoidance, etc. On the other hand, a data compression scheme, such as the [[V.44]] or [[V.42bis]] compression used in telephone modems, may however give higher goodput if the transferred data is not already efficiently compressed.\n\nThe link spectral efficiency of a wireless telephony link may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous calls over 1&nbsp;MHz frequency spectrum in erlangs per megahertz, or ''[[Erlang unit|E]]/MHz''. This measure is also affected by the source coding (data compression) scheme. It may be applied to analog as well as digital transmission.\n\nIn wireless networks, the ''link spectral efficiency'' can be somewhat misleading, as larger values are not necessarily more efficient in their overall use of radio spectrum. In a wireless network, high link spectral efficiency may result in high sensitivity to co-channel interference (crosstalk), which affects the capacity. For example, in a [[cellular telephone]] network with frequency reuse, [[spread spectrum|spectrum spreading]] and [[forward error correction]] reduce the spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz but substantially lower the required signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to non-spread spectrum techniques. This can allow for much denser geographical frequency reuse that compensates for the lower link spectral efficiency, resulting in approximately the same capacity (the same number of simultaneous phone calls) over the same bandwidth, using the same number of base station transmitters. As discussed below, a more relevant measure for wireless networks would be ''system spectral efficiency'' in bit/s/Hz per unit area. However, in closed communication links such as telephone lines and cable TV networks, and in noise-limited wireless communication system where co-channel interference is not a factor, the largest link spectral efficiency that can be supported by the available SNR is generally used.\n\n== System spectral efficiency or area spectral efficiency ==\n\nIn digital [[wireless network]]s, the ''system spectral efficiency'' or area spectral efficiency is typically measured in ''(bit/s)/Hz per unit area'', in ''(bit/s)/Hz per [[cell site|cell]]'', or in ''(bit/s)/Hz per site''. It is a measure of the quantity of users or services that can be simultaneously supported by a limited radio frequency bandwidth in a defined geographic area.<ref name=Miao/> It may for example be defined as the maximum aggregated [[throughput]] or [[goodput]], i.e. summed over all users in the system, divided by the channel bandwidth and by the covered area or number of base station sites. This measure is affected not only by the single user transmission technique, but also by [[multiple access]] schemes and [[radio resource management]] techniques utilized. It can be substantially improved by dynamic [[radio resource management]]. If it is defined as a measure of the maximum goodput, retransmissions due to co-channel interference and collisions are excluded. Higher-layer protocol overhead (above the [[media access control]] sublayer) is normally neglected.\n\n:'''Example 8:''' In a cellular system based on [[frequency-division multiple access]] (FDMA) with a [[fixed channel allocation]] (FCA) cellplan using a [[frequency reuse factor]] of 1/4, each base station has access to 1/4 of the total available frequency spectrum. Thus, the maximum possible system spectral efficiency in ''(bit/s)/Hz per site'' is 1/4 of the link spectral efficiency. Each base station may be divided into 3 cells by means of 3 sector antennas, also known as a 4/12 reuse pattern. Then each cell has access to 1/12 of the available spectrum, and the system spectral efficiency in ''(bit/s)/Hz per cell'' or ''(bit/s)/Hz per sector'' is 1/12 of the link spectral efficiency.\n\nThe system spectral efficiency of a [[cellular network]] may also be expressed as the maximum number of simultaneous phone calls per area unit over 1&nbsp;MHz frequency spectrum in ''[[Erlang unit|E]]/MHz per cell'', ''E/MHz per sector'', ''E/MHz per site'', or ''(E/MHz)/m<sup>2</sup>''. This measure is also affected by the source coding (data compression) scheme. It may be used in analog cellular networks as well.\n\nLow link spectral efficiency in (bit/s)/Hz does not necessarily mean that an encoding scheme is inefficient from a system spectral efficiency point of view. As an example, consider [[CDMA|Code Division Multiplexed Access (CDMA)]] [[spread spectrum]], which is not a particularly spectral efficient encoding scheme when considering a single channel or single user. However, the fact that one can \"layer\" multiple channels on the same frequency band means that the system spectrum utilization for a multi-channel CDMA system can be very good.\n\n:'''Example 9:''' In the [[W-CDMA]] 3G cellular system, every phone call is compressed to a maximum of 8,500 bit/s (the useful bitrate), and spread out over a 5&nbsp;MHz wide frequency channel. This corresponds to a link throughput of only 8,500/5,000,000 = 0.0017&nbsp;''(bit/s)/Hz''. Let us assume that 100 simultaneous (non-silent) calls are possible in the same cell. [[Spread spectrum]] makes it possible to have as low a frequency reuse factor as 1, if each base station is divided into 3 cells by means of 3 directional sector antennas. This corresponds to a system spectrum efficiency of over 1 \u00d7 100 \u00d7 0.0017 = 0.17&nbsp;''(bit/s)/Hz per site'', and 0.17/3 = 0.06 ''(bit/s)/Hz per cell or sector''.\n\nThe spectral efficiency can be improved by [[radio resource management]] techniques such as efficient fixed or dynamic [[channel allocation]], [[power control]], [[link adaptation]] and [[diversity scheme]]s.\n\nA combined [[fairness measure]] and system spectral efficiency measure is the [[fairly shared spectral efficiency]].\n\n==Comparison table==\nExamples of predicted numerical spectral efficiency values of some common communication systems can be found in the table below.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form The Ganges.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing {{convert|256.90|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges river follows an {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} the Ganges joins the river [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism. At their confluence the Yamuna is larger than the Ganges, contributing about {{convert|2950|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} or about 58.5% of the combined flow.{{sfn|Gupta|2007|page=347}}\n\nNow flowing east, the river meets the [[Tamsa River]] (also called ''Tons''), which flows north from the [[Kaimur Range]] and contributes an average flow of about {{convert|190|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]]. The Padma is joined by the [[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna River]], the largest distributary of the [[Brahmaputra]]. Further downstream, the Padma joins the [[Meghna River]], the second largest distributary of the Brahmaputra, and takes on the Meghna's name as it enters the Meghna Estuary, which empties into the Bay of Bengal.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136\u201337}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem.

Livid at being disturbed, Kapila sears them with his angry gaze, reduces them to ashes, and dispatches them to the netherworld. Only the waters of the Ganges, then in heaven, can bring the dead sons their salvation. A descendant of these sons, King [[Bhagiratha]], anxious to restore his ancestors, undertakes rigorous penance and is eventually granted the prize of Ganges's descent from heaven. However, since her turbulent force would also shatter the earth, Bhagiratha persuades Shiva in his abode on [[Mount Kailash]] to receive Ganges in the coils of his tangled hair and break her fall. Ganges descends, is tamed in Shiva's locks, and arrives in the Himalayas. She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganges Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.<ref name=eck1998-p145/> In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, \"of Bhagiratha\").<ref name=eck1998-p145/>\n\n===Redemption of the Dead===\n[[Image:HinduCremationVaranasi1903.jpg|thumb|Preparations for cremations on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], 1903.

His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

Now known as the Western Yamuna Canal, it has fallen into disrepair and been restored several times. The [[Mughal emperors|Mughal emperor]] [[Shah Jahan]] built an irrigation canal on the Yamuna River in the early 17th century. It fell into disuse until 1830, when it was reopened as the Eastern Yamuna Canal, under British control. The reopened canal became a model for the Upper Ganges Canal and all following canal projects.{{sfn|Singh|2005|pp=69\u201379}}\n[[File:GangesCanal2.jpg|thumb|The Ganges Canal highlighted in red stretching between its headworks off the Ganges River in [[Haridwar]] and its confluences with the [[Yamuna River|Jumna River]] in [[Etawah]] and with the Ganges in [[Cawnpore]] (now Kanpur).]]\nThe first British canal in India\u2014with no Indian antecedents\u2014was the [[Ganges Canal]] built between 1842 and 1854.<ref name=\"stone2002-p16\">{{Harvnb|Stone|2002|p=16}}</ref>\nContemplated first by Col. [[John Russell Colvin]] in 1836, it did not at first elicit much enthusiasm from its eventual architect Sir [[Proby Thomas Cautley]], who balked at idea of cutting a canal through extensive low-lying land in order to reach the drier upland destination. However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal. The Court of Directors, moreover, considerably enlarged the scope of the projected canal, which, in consequence of the severity and geographical extent of the famine, they now deemed to be the entire [[Doab]] region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ce8FpJzR-4C&pg=PA103|title=Uttar Pradesh General Knowledge|first=Dr C.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C.

It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages.

Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality.

Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form The Ganges.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing {{convert|256.90|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges river follows an {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} the Ganges joins the river [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism. At their confluence the Yamuna is larger than the Ganges, contributing about {{convert|2950|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}},{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} or about 58.5% of the combined flow.{{sfn|Gupta|2007|page=347}}\n\nNow flowing east, the river meets the [[Tamsa River]] (also called ''Tons''), which flows north from the [[Kaimur Range]] and contributes an average flow of about {{convert|190|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

Frequently, discharge is described for the mouth of the Meghna River, thus combining the Ganges with the [[Brahmaputra]] and Meghna.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136\u201337}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem. One plan is for another barrage to be built in Bangladesh at [[Pangsha Upazila|Pangsha]], west of [[Dhaka]].

She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganges Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.<ref name=eck1998-p145/> In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, \"of Bhagiratha\").<ref name=eck1998-p145/>\n\n===Redemption of the Dead===\n[[Image:HinduCremationVaranasi1903.jpg|thumb|Preparations for cremations on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], 1903.

His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art.<ref name=darian2001-p114/> The ''makara'' has a dual symbolism.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself. Although she has provided sustenance to millions, she has also brought hardship, injury, and death by causing major floods along her banks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|pp=119\u201320}}</ref> The goddess Ganga is also accompanied by a dwarf attendant, who carries a cosmetic bag, and on whom she sometimes leans, as if for support.<ref name=pal-1997-p43/> (See, for example, frames 1, 2, and 4 above.)\n\nThe ''purna kumbha'' or full pot of water is the second most discernible element of the Ganga iconography.<ref name=darian-2001-p125>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}}</ref> Appearing first also in the relief in the Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured.<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, in the [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh#Dashavatara temple|Dashavatara temple]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]] (seventh century), the [[Badoli Temples|Trimurti temple]], Badoli, [[Chittor Fort|Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan, and at the [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh#Tourist attractions|Lakshmaneshwar temple]], [[Kharod]], [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]],<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.
