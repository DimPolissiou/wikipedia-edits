Alexander's route included visits to [[Tsavo]], Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of [[Manyara]], famous for attracting giant flocks of [[flamingo]]s; and the [[Ngorongoro]] Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife.<ref name=GFDFL/> The final two sites for her visit were [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] (the archeological site of [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]]); and [[Mount Mikeno|Mt. Mikeno]] in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist [[George Schaller]] had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of [[Jane Goodall]] and the importance of long-term research of the [[great apes]].<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nAlthough Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,<ref name=GFDFL/> by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in [[Uganda]], the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to \"Lily\" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \"noseprints\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks.

In four months in 1979, the Fossey patrol consisting of four African staffers destroyed 987 poachers' traps in the research area's vicinity.<ref name=\"Mowat223\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|p=223}}</ref> The official Rwandan national park guards, consisting of 24 staffers, did not eradicate any poachers' traps during the same period.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/> In the eastern portion of the park not patrolled by Fossey, poachers virtually eradicated all the park's [[elephant]]s for [[ivory]] and killed more than a dozen gorillas.<ref name=\"Mowat223\"/>\n\nFossey helped in the arrest of several poachers, some of whom served or are serving long prison sentences.<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\nIn 1978, Fossey attempted to prevent the export of two young gorillas, Coco and Pucker, from Rwanda to the [[Cologne Zoological Garden|zoo]] in [[Cologne, Germany]]. During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name=\"Mowat74\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74\u20138}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name=\"farley\"/> She viewed the holding of animals in \"prison\" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name=\"fossey\">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>\n\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name=\"Mowat187\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name=\"fossey\"/><ref name=\"Mowat187\"/>\n\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name=\"farley\"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and [[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \"active conservation\" or the international conservation groups' \"theoretical conservation.\"<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\n===Opposition to tourism===\nFossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are very susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.<ref name=\"Mowat174\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174\u20135}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas - The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Preservation of habitat===\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms.

[[Harold Hayes]]'s book ''The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey'' was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'' was based on Hayes' 1987 article in ''Life'' magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.\n\n''No One Loved Gorillas More'' (2005) was written by Camilla de la Bedoyere and published by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in the [[United States]] and [[Palazzo Editions]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey'' was written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber and published in 2006. This account of Fossey's story is told as if in her own words from beyond the grave. Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people. The author also wrote a lengthy article titled \"The Fatal Obsession of Dian Fossey\".<ref>Shoumatoff, Alex (September 1986).

The author gives a candid and vivid portrait of Fossey's mercurial personality, her ill treatment of staff and research students, and her alcohol-fueled tirades. The book also shows the daily workings of camp, Fossey's dependence on her students and the movement to remove her from Karisoke years before her brutal murder.<ref name=\"Fowler 2018\">{{cite book |last=Fowler |first=John |title=A forest in the clouds : my year among the mountain gorillas in the remote enclave of Dian Fossey |publisher=Pegasus Books |location=New York |year=2018 |isbn=9781681776330 |oclc=1022267461}}</ref>\n\n===In media===\nThe [[Kentucky Opera]] Visions Program, in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], has written an [[opera]] about Fossey, entitled ''Nyiramachabelli''; it premiered on May 23, 2006.\n\n[[Universal Studios]] bought the film rights to ''Gorillas in the Mist'' from Fossey in 1985, and [[Warner Bros. Studios]] bought the rights to the Hayes article, despite its having been severely criticized by [[Rosamond Carr]]. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'', starring [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Bryan Brown]], and John Omirah Miluwi. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer [[Bob Campbell (photographer)|Bob Campbell]]. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\n\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\n\nIn December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]], The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/dian-fossey-secrets-in-the-mist#synopsis|website=National Geographic TV|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last=Fossey |first=Dian |author-mask=2 |title=Gorillas in the Mist |url=https://archive.org/details/gorillasinmist00dian |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Mass |year=1983 |isbn=9780395282175 |oclc=9132014}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-link=Thomas B.

Alexander's route included visits to [[Tsavo]], Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of [[Manyara]], famous for attracting giant flocks of [[flamingo]]s; and the [[Ngorongoro]] Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife.<ref name=GFDFL/> The final two sites for her visit were [[Olduvai Gorge]] in [[Tanzania]] (the archeological site of [[Louis Leakey|Louis]] and [[Mary Leakey]]); and [[Mount Mikeno|Mt. Mikeno]] in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist [[George Schaller]] had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for [[hominid]] [[fossil]]s. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of [[Jane Goodall]] and the importance of long-term research of the [[great apes]].<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nAlthough Fossey had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys,<ref name=GFDFL/> by October 16, she was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in [[Uganda]], the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among the first to see the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers [[Joan Root|Joan]] and [[Alan Root]]. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas.<ref name=GFDFL/> After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans.

With the help of Joan Root and Leakey, Fossey acquired the necessary provisions and an old canvas-topped [[Land Rover]] which she named \"Lily\". On the way to the Congo, Fossey visited the [[Gombe Stream National Park|Gombe Stream Research Centre]] to meet Goodall and observe her research methods with chimpanzees.<ref name=GFDFL/> Accompanied by photographer Alan Root, who helped her obtain work permits for the [[Virunga Mountains]], Fossey began her field study at Kabara, in the Congo in early 1967, in the same meadow where Schaller had made his camp seven years earlier.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\">{{Harvnb|Montgomery|p=136}}</ref>  Root taught her basic gorilla tracking, and his tracker Sanwekwe later helped in Fossey's camp. Living in tents on mainly tinned produce, once a month Fossey would hike down the mountain to \"Lily\" and make the two-hour drive to the village of Kikumba to restock.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey identified three distinct groups in her study area, but could not get close to them. She eventually found that mimicking their actions and making grunting sounds assured them, together with submissive behavior and eating of the local celery plant.<ref name=\"Montgomery136\"/> She later attributed her success with habituating gorillas to her experience working as an occupational therapist with autistic children.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Like George Schaller, Fossey relied greatly on individual \"noseprints\" for identification, initially via sketching and later by camera.<ref name=GFDFL/>\n\nFossey had arrived in the Congo in locally turbulent times. Known as the [[Belgian Congo]] until its independence in June 1960, unrest and rebellion plagued the new government until 1965, when Lieutenant General [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], by then commander-in-chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years during what is now called the [[Congo Crisis]]. During the political upheaval, a rebellion and battles took place in the [[Kivu]] Province. On July 9, 1967, soldiers arrived at the camp to escort Fossey and her research workers down, and she was detained at [[Rumangabo]] for two weeks.

During the capture of the infants at the behest of the Cologne Zoo and Rwandan park conservator, 20 adult gorillas had been killed.<ref name=\"Mowat74\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=74\u20138}}</ref> The infant gorillas were given to Fossey by the park conservator of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]] for treatment of injuries suffered during their capture and captivity. With considerable effort, she restored them to some approximation of health. Over Fossey's objections, the gorillas were shipped to Cologne, where they lived nine years in captivity, both dying in the same month.<ref name=\"farley\"/> She viewed the holding of animals in \"prison\" ([[zoo]]s) for the entertainment of people as unethical.<ref name=\"fossey\">Fossey, Dian : ''Gorillas in the Mist''. 1983</ref>\n\nWhile gorillas from rival gang groups on the mountains that were not part of Fossey's study had often been found poached five to ten at a time, and had spurred Fossey to conduct her own anti-poaching patrols, Fossey's study groups had not been direct victims of poaching until Fossey's favorite gorilla Digit was killed in 1978. Later that year, the [[Silverback#Group life|silverback]] of Digit's Group 4, named for Fossey's Uncle Bert, was shot in the heart while trying to save his son, Kweli, from being seized by poachers cooperating with the Rwandan park conservator.<ref name=\"Mowat187\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=187\u2013190}}</ref> Kweli's mother, Macho, was also killed in the raid, but Kweli was not captured due to Uncle Bert's intervention; however, three-year-old Kweli died slowly and painfully of [[gangrene]], from being brushed by a poacher's bullet.<ref name=\"fossey\"/><ref name=\"Mowat187\"/>\n\nAccording to Fossey's letters, ORTPN (the Rwandan national park system), the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[African Wildlife Foundation]], Fauna Preservation Society, the Mountain Gorilla Project and some of her former students tried to wrest control of the Karisoke research center from her for the purpose of tourism, by portraying her as unstable. In her last two years, Fossey claims not to have lost any gorillas to poachers; however, the Mountain Gorilla Project, which was supposed to patrol the [[Mount Sabyinyo]] area, tried to cover up gorilla deaths caused by poaching and diseases transmitted through tourists. Nevertheless, these organizations received most of the public donations directed toward gorilla conservation.<ref name=\"farley\"/> The public often believed their money would go to Fossey, who was struggling to finance her anti-poaching and [[bushmeat]] hunting patrols, while organizations collecting in her name put it into tourism projects and as she put it \"to pay the airfare of so-called conservationists who will never go on anti-poaching patrols in their life.\" Fossey described the differing two philosophies as her own \"active conservation\" or the international conservation groups' \"theoretical conservation.\"<ref name=\"Mowat174\"/>\n\n===Opposition to tourism===\nFossey strongly opposed [[wildlife tourism]], as gorillas are very susceptible to [[Anthroponotic disease|human anthroponotic diseases]] like [[influenza]] for which they have no immunity. Fossey reported several cases in which gorillas died because of diseases spread by tourists. She also viewed tourism as an interference into their natural wild behavior.<ref name=\"farley\"/> Fossey also criticized tourist programs, often paid for by international conservation organizations, for interfering with both her research and the peace of the mountain gorillas' habitat, and was concerned Jane Goodall, who actually joined a chimpanzee society as a member, was inappropriately changing her study subjects' behavior.<ref name=\"Mowat174\">{{Harvnb|Mowat|pp=174\u20135}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International promotes tourism, which they say helps to create a stable and sustainable local community dedicated to protecting the gorillas and their habitat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gorillafund.org/travel|title=Visit Gorillas - The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Preservation of habitat===\nFossey is responsible for the revision of a European Community project that converted parkland into [[pyrethrum]] farms.

[[Harold Hayes]]'s book ''The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey'' was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film ''[[Gorillas in the Mist]]'' was based on Hayes' 1987 article in ''Life'' magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.\n\n''No One Loved Gorillas More'' (2005) was written by Camilla de la Bedoyere and published by [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] in the [[United States]] and [[Palazzo Editions]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. ''Gorilla Dreams: The Legacy of Dian Fossey'' was written by the investigative journalist Georgianne Nienaber and published in 2006. This account of Fossey's story is told as if in her own words from beyond the grave. Fossey is also prominently featured in a book by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist [[Alex Shoumatoff]] called ''African Madness'', in which the author expands on Fossey's controversial behaviors, implying that Fossey provoked her own murder by way of her private and public inflammatory interactions with people.

In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by [[Bryan Brown]]) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.\n\nIn the 2011 BBC documentary ''[[All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace (TV series)|All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace]]'', [[Adam Curtis]] uses Fossey as a symbol of the ideology of [[ecology]], a balance of nature and western post-colonial political exploits in Africa.\n\nIn December 2017, ''Dian Fossey: Secrets in the Mist'', a three-hour series, aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]], The series tells the story of Fossey's life, work, murder and legacy, using archive footage and still images, interviews with people who knew and worked with her, specially shot footage and reconstruction.<ref>{{cite web|title=NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC Dian Fossey: Secrets In The Mist|url=http://www.natgeotv.com/za/shows/natgeo/dian-fossey-secrets-in-the-mist#synopsis|website=National Geographic TV|accessdate=26 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of unsolved murders]]\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*{{cite book |last=Fossey |first=Dian |author-mask=2 |title=Gorillas in the Mist |url=https://archive.org/details/gorillasinmist00dian |url-access=registration |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston, Mass |year=1983 |isbn=9780395282175 |oclc=9132014}}\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Allen |editor1-first=Thomas |editor1-link=Thomas B.

The women were given either high mineral, high protein or high vitamin supplements. Results showed that women across all three conditions in study were showing the recommended intake levels of calories, proteins, calcium, iron, vitamin A and riboflavin. Moreover, these women also had higher red blood cell counts as well as hemoglobin concentrations, following the study. Several correlative conclusions were drawn, among them that the occurrences of birth-related complications in pregnant women with poor diets were higher than in pregnant women who had better diets.

In order to calculate the nutritive value of the meals the children were eating, nutrients such as protein, calcium, vitamin A and vitamin D were measured. Children who received dietary supplements showed a considerable increase in the majority of these nutrients, and also received higher academic evaluations from their teachers; they were more alert and paid better attention, for example.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Cecile H.|last2=Grimmett|first2=Garfield|last3=Lomax|first3=James A.|year=1956|title=Influence of a Low Cost Dietary Supplement on Scholastic Achievement and \"Personality Factors\" of Elementary School Children|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|volume=48|issue=4|pages=244\u20136|pmid=13346349|pmc=2641189}}</ref>\n\n=== Methionine and other proteins ===\nShe had a particular interest in the metabolism of the amino acid [[methionine]], and starting in the 1950s, led an 18-year study for the [[National Institutes of Health]] on this topic.<ref name=\"wp\" /> In addition to that, Edwards was interested in postoperative dieting, due to the loss of tissue protein that is observed during surgeries. She was involved in a study that measured how well following surgery adult rats were able to absorb methionine (whose methyl group is used in a variety of biological functions). Ultimately, the rats that underwent surgery had a smaller uptake of methionine, specifically in the tissues that had been affected during the surgery. Moreover, Edwards observed that in  the two weeks following surgery, the radio labeled plasma and tissue proteins in the rats showed greater activity by the [[Alpha and beta carbon|alpha carbon]] of the methionine, as opposed to the methyl carbon.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Cecile H.|last2=Gadsden|first2=Evelyn L.|last3=Edwards|first3=Gerald A.|year=1964|title=Utilization of methionine by the adult rat: VI.

The purpose of this experiment was to suggest dietary complementation of particular foods, such that a consumer was focusing not just on overall high amino acid intake, but also on the quality of intake. For this reason, cystine and tyrosine quantities were studied as well, because the two share similar biological characteristics with methionine and phenylalanine, respectively.  Acid hydrolyzates as well as microbiological assays were used in the quantification of amino acid content in the foods. Edwards observed differences in amino acid content between similar foods; for example, she found that [[Bolognese sauce|bologna]] contained more amino acids than frankfurters and that lima beans had more cysteine and valine than pork and beans. The purpose of this study, Edwards noted, was to provide knowledge on amino acid content, such that people can consciously pair certain foods together for optimal intake.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=C.

The results supported the conclusion that the body compensates for how much protein is added; for example, when the minimal protein intake was met, the body responded by conserving methionine catabolism. And additionally, when certain amino acids were lacking, they were synthesized as well as reused, in lieu of excretion. Edwards concluded overall that around 46 grams of protein a day are required in the continued maintenance of the adult male. She also made note that  wheat-based diets do provide adequate dietary supplementation, which is an important conclusion given that the geography of various places in the world cause those places to be heavily wheat-based.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Cecile Hoover|year=1971|title=Utilization of wheat by adult man: excretion of vitamins and minerals|url=|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=24|issue=5|pages=547\u2013555|doi=10.1093/ajcn/24.5.547|pmid=4252858}}</ref>\n\nEdwards opposed [[Hereditarianism|hereditarian]] positions in the [[nature and nurture]] debate such as those of [[Arthur Jensen]] which credited genes as the dominant factor in intelligence; she concluded that social and environmental factors were at least as responsible as heredity in influencing intelligence.<ref name=\"wp\" /> Furthermore, Edwards worked to spread knowledge about issues such as childcare and financial budgeting to lower income and disadvantaged populations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Scientists, Revised Addition|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth H.|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-0816061587|location=New York|pages=202|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Social factors in health ===\nIn a review Edwards published in 1995, she introduced a concept of population approach, which she believed was how the medical system should treat patients, by viewing and taking into account their social, economic and cultural environments. Moreover, she looked specifically into hypertension within the Black American demographic, and named weight control, reduced sodium chloride intake and physical activities as ways of prevention. At the same time, she cited social factors as possible causes for the higher hypertension rates among Black Americans than among White Americans. For example, Edwards noted that generally and comparatively, Black Americans were more likely to be poor and more likely to live farther from medical treatment. Additionally, she stated that Black Americans suffered from greater psychosocial stress and other social strains due to racism, and that these factors and their correlation towards hypertension required further research.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Cecile H.|year=1995|title=Emerging issues in lifestyle, social, and environmental interventions to promote behavioral change related to prevention and control of hypertension in the African-American population|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|volume=87|issue=8|pmc=2607925|pmid=7674365|pages=642\u20136}}</ref>\n\n== Further work ==\nEdwards was a nutritional consultant and was also a member of numerous government committees and panels, including those convened by the National Institutes of Health, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], and the 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health.<ref name=\"wp\" /><ref name=\"black\" /> She authored 160 research papers, and co-authored a 1991 book, ''Human Ecology: Interaction of Man With His Environments''.<ref name=\"wp\" /> The publication of one of her articles, titled ''Nutrition, Other Factors, and the Outcomes of Pregnancy'', resulted in the National Institute of Health allotting her a $4.6 million grant; further research concerning this subject was performed at Howard University.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1952<ref name=\":0\"/> she married Gerald Alonzo Edwards, a [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]] with whom she collaborated on many research projects, and who predeceased her by three months.<ref name=\"wp\"/><ref name=black/> They had three children.<ref name=\"wp\"/>\n\nShe died on September 17, 2005 in Washington Home Hospice.<ref name=wp/> She is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, US.<ref name=Gravesite>{{cite web|title=Cecile Hoover Edwards|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11791238|website=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Hoover, Cecile Annette (1950).

Edwards concluded overall that around 46 grams of protein a day are required in the continued maintenance of the adult male. She also made note that  wheat-based diets do provide adequate dietary supplementation, which is an important conclusion given that the geography of various places in the world cause those places to be heavily wheat-based.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Cecile Hoover|year=1971|title=Utilization of wheat by adult man: excretion of vitamins and minerals|url=|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=24|issue=5|pages=547\u2013555|doi=10.1093/ajcn/24.5.547|pmid=4252858}}</ref>\n\nEdwards opposed [[Hereditarianism|hereditarian]] positions in the [[nature and nurture]] debate such as those of [[Arthur Jensen]] which credited genes as the dominant factor in intelligence; she concluded that social and environmental factors were at least as responsible as heredity in influencing intelligence.<ref name=\"wp\" /> Furthermore, Edwards worked to spread knowledge about issues such as childcare and financial budgeting to lower income and disadvantaged populations.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Scientists, Revised Addition|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth H.|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-0816061587|location=New York|pages=202|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Social factors in health ===\nIn a review Edwards published in 1995, she introduced a concept of population approach, which she believed was how the medical system should treat patients, by viewing and taking into account their social, economic and cultural environments. Moreover, she looked specifically into hypertension within the Black American demographic, and named weight control, reduced sodium chloride intake and physical activities as ways of prevention. At the same time, she cited social factors as possible causes for the higher hypertension rates among Black Americans than among White Americans. For example, Edwards noted that generally and comparatively, Black Americans were more likely to be poor and more likely to live farther from medical treatment. Additionally, she stated that Black Americans suffered from greater psychosocial stress and other social strains due to racism, and that these factors and their correlation towards hypertension required further research.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Cecile H.|year=1995|title=Emerging issues in lifestyle, social, and environmental interventions to promote behavioral change related to prevention and control of hypertension in the African-American population|journal=Journal of the National Medical Association|volume=87|issue=8|pmc=2607925|pmid=7674365|pages=642\u20136}}</ref>\n\n== Further work ==\nEdwards was a nutritional consultant and was also a member of numerous government committees and panels, including those convened by the National Institutes of Health, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], and the 1969 White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health.<ref name=\"wp\" /><ref name=\"black\" /> She authored 160 research papers, and co-authored a 1991 book, ''Human Ecology: Interaction of Man With His Environments''.<ref name=\"wp\" /> The publication of one of her articles, titled ''Nutrition, Other Factors, and the Outcomes of Pregnancy'', resulted in the National Institute of Health allotting her a $4.6 million grant; further research concerning this subject was performed at Howard University.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1952<ref name=\":0\"/> she married Gerald Alonzo Edwards, a [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]] with whom she collaborated on many research projects, and who predeceased her by three months.<ref name=\"wp\"/><ref name=black/> They had three children.<ref name=\"wp\"/>\n\nShe died on September 17, 2005 in Washington Home Hospice.<ref name=wp/> She is buried in Mount Hope Cemetery, Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, US.<ref name=Gravesite>{{cite web|title=Cecile Hoover Edwards|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11791238|website=Find A Grave|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Hoover, Cecile Annette (1950).

She went to [[Walton High School (Bronx)]], [[New York City]]. After high school, she attended the all-female, tuition-free [[Hunter College]], where her mother hoped she would learn to become a teacher. Instead, Yalow decided to study physics.{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=I was excited about achieving a career in physics.

She did not believe that any respectable graduate school would admit and financially support a woman, so she took another job as a secretary to [[Michael Heidelberger]], another biochemist at Columbia, who hired her on the condition that she studied [[stenography]]. She graduated from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941.<ref name=\"autobiography\" />\n\nA few years later, she received an offer to be a teaching assistant in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received this offer partially because [[World War II]] had just begun and many men went off to fight, and the University opted to offer women education and jobs to avoid being shut down. At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], she was the only woman among the department's 400 members, and the first since 1917.<ref name=\"straus1999\">{{cite book |last1=Straus |first1=Eugene |title=Rosalyn Yalow, Nobel Laureate: Her Life and Work in Medicine |date=1999 |publisher=Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0738202631 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rosalynyalownobe00stra_0 }}</ref>{{rp|109}} Yalow earned her [[Ph.D.]] in 1945.

They had two children, Benjamin and Elanna Yalow,  and kept a [[kosher]] home. Yalow did not believe in \"balancing her career with her home life\" and instead incorporated her home life wherever she could in her work life.<ref name=\"straus1999\"/>{{rp|109}} Yalow did, however, view the traditional roles of a homemaker as a priority, and devoted herself to traditional duties associated with motherhood and being a wife.\n\nThroughout her career, she tended to shun feminist organizations, but still, she advocated for including more [[women in science]].<ref name=\"kahn2012\"/> While she believed the reason she had certain opportunities in Physics was because of the war, she thought that the reason that the number of women in this field decreased after the war due to a lack of interest. Yalow saw the feminist movement as a challenge to her traditional beliefs and thought that it encouraged women not to fulfill their duties to become mothers and wives.<ref name=\"straus1999\"/>{{rp|109}}\n\n==Work==\nThe month after graduating from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was offered a teaching assistantship in the physics department of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Gaining acceptance to the physics graduate program in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois was one of the many hurdles she had to overcome as a woman in her field. Powerful male figures controlled opportunities for training, recognition, promotion, and many aspects of development in the field of science, and especially physics.\n\nWhen Yalow entered the university in September 1941, she was the only woman in the faculty, which comprised 400 professors and teaching assistants. She was the first woman in more than two decades to attend or teach at this engineering college.<ref name=\"anderson2017\">{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Rebecca J. |title=Breaking Barriers: The Life and Work of Rosalyn Yalow |journal=The Pharmacologist |date=September 2017 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=152\u2013163 |url=https://www.aspet.org/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/publications/v59_n3_9_2017_web.pdf}}</ref> Yalow credited her position at the prestigious graduate school to the shortage of male candidates during World War II. Being surrounded by gifted men made her aware of a wider world in science. They recognized her talent, they encouraged her, and they supported her. They were in a position to help her succeed.<ref name=\"straus1999\"/>\n\nYalow felt that other women in her field did not like her because of her ambition. Other women saw her curiosity as abandoning the only acceptable path for a woman in science at the time, becoming a high school science teacher, but Yalow wanted to be a physicist.<ref name=\"straus1999\"/> During her time at the University of Illinois, she took extra undergraduate courses to increase her knowledge because she wanted to do original experimental research in addition to her regular teaching duties.<ref name=\"world2003\">{{cite web |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/rosalyn-sussman-yalow |website=World of Microbiology and Immunology |language=en |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nFor years Yalow faced criticism from women at work but she never quit nor turned her back on other young women, if she believed they had the potential to become real scientists. She never became an advocate for women's organizations in the field of science.<ref name=\"world2003\"/> She was even quoted as saying, \"It bothers me that there are now organizations for women in science, which means they think they have to be treated differently from the men. I don't approve.\"<ref name=\"straus1999\"/>{{rp|81}} Although girls and young women found a role model in her after she won her Nobel, Yalow was not a champion for improving women's treatment or representation in science.<ref name=\"straus1999\"/>{{rp|76}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://massivesci.com/articles/science-hero-rosalyn-sussman-yalow-facts-insulin-diabetes-blood-radioimmunoassay/|title=Meet Rosalyn Sussman Yalow, the first American-born woman to win a Nobel Prize, who let doctors see into your blood|last=Harrod|first=Jordan|website=[[Massive Science]]|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nYalow's first job after teaching and taking classes at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana graduate school was as an assistant electrical engineer at Federal Telecommunications Laboratory.

There she collaborated with [[Solomon Berson]] to develop [[radioimmunoassay]] (RIA),<ref name=\"straus1999\"/> a radioisotope tracing technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other aqueous fluids.

She graduated from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941.<ref name=\"autobiography\" />\n\nA few years later, she received an offer to be a teaching assistant in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received this offer partially because [[World War II]] had just begun and many men went off to fight, and the University opted to offer women education and jobs to avoid being shut down.

Gaining acceptance to the physics graduate program in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois was one of the many hurdles she had to overcome as a woman in her field. Powerful male figures controlled opportunities for training, recognition, promotion, and many aspects of development in the field of science, and especially physics.\n\nWhen Yalow entered the university in September 1941, she was the only woman in the faculty, which comprised 400 professors and teaching assistants.

Other women saw her curiosity as abandoning the only acceptable path for a woman in science at the time, becoming a high school science teacher, but Yalow wanted to be a physicist.<ref name=\"straus1999\"/> During her time at the University of Illinois, she took extra undergraduate courses to increase her knowledge because she wanted to do original experimental research in addition to her regular teaching duties.<ref name=\"world2003\">{{cite web |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/rosalyn-sussman-yalow |website=World of Microbiology and Immunology |language=en |date=2003}}</ref>\n\nFor years Yalow faced criticism from women at work but she never quit nor turned her back on other young women, if she believed they had the potential to become real scientists.

There she collaborated with [[Solomon Berson]] to develop [[radioimmunoassay]] (RIA),<ref name=\"straus1999\"/> a radioisotope tracing technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other aqueous fluids.
