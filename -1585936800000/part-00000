Show creator [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]], in an interview with ''[[HuffPost]]'', explained that for the series, \"It was never our top priority to be the voice of depression [...] [''Bojack Horseman'' is not] trying to capture this thing [depression] as much as it is trying to capture this character and what he is.\"<ref name=PICKANAME>Maxwell Strachan.

Verizon Communications: New York, July 23, 2016.</ref> Regardless, Maxwell Strachan of ''[[HuffPost]]'' considers this season, and the show as a whole, to be one of the very few shows that accurately depicts the mental illness, saying \"Outside of a handful of series, depictions of depression in [[Hollywood]] have historically felt one-dimensional, as if writers Googled 'depression' and decided it meant 'sad.' In BoJack, we finally have a fully formed character that deals with depression in all its forms, too. We see BoJack suffocating as he grapples with the idea that he will never reach his own definition of greatness, that it is too late to turn his life around, that his best days are behind him and his worst ones ahead. It's not pretty, but it can be soothing to see someone who relates, even if that someone is a drunk horse with a temper.\" Strachan further explains: \"For a brief moment, it feels as if BoJack has finally had a revelation that could last\u2015that he will stop his self-destructive ways, learn to prioritize the people he cares about and beat his depression forever. But soon enough, BoJack is back in the pit of despair, hating himself and hurting the people around him. It's a sad, familiar cycle. It's also what makes the show so good. 'BoJack Horseman' doesn't excuse bad behavior. But it certainly can help those who are struggling with the depression that can cause that bad behavior to feel less alone.\"<ref name=PICKANAME />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{BoJack Horseman}}\n\n[[Category:2016 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:BoJack Horseman seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television season\n| season_number        = 3\n| bgcolour             = #644d36\n| image                = BoJack Horseman season 3 poster.jpg\n| image_upright        = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = Season 3 promotional poster\n| starring             = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Will Arnett]]\n* [[Amy Sedaris]]\n* [[Alison Brie]]\n* [[Paul F.

Verizon Communications: New York, July 23, 2016.</ref> Regardless, Maxwell Strachan of ''[[HuffPost]]'' considers this season, and the show as a whole, to be one of the very few shows that accurately depicts the mental illness, saying \"Outside of a handful of series, depictions of depression in [[Hollywood]] have historically felt one-dimensional, as if writers Googled 'depression' and decided it meant 'sad.' In BoJack, we finally have a fully formed character that deals with depression in all its forms, too. We see BoJack suffocating as he grapples with the idea that he will never reach his own definition of greatness, that it is too late to turn his life around, that his best days are behind him and his worst ones ahead. It's not pretty, but it can be soothing to see someone who relates, even if that someone is a drunk horse with a temper.\" Strachan further explains: \"For a brief moment, it feels as if BoJack has finally had a revelation that could last\u2015that he will stop his self-destructive ways, learn to prioritize the people he cares about and beat his depression forever. But soon enough, BoJack is back in the pit of despair, hating himself and hurting the people around him. It's a sad, familiar cycle. It's also what makes the show so good. 'BoJack Horseman' doesn't excuse bad behavior. But it certainly can help those who are struggling with the depression that can cause that bad behavior to feel less alone.\"<ref name=PICKANAME />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{BoJack Horseman}}\n\n[[Category:2016 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:BoJack Horseman seasons]]\n", "name_user": "D and D master 2016", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEpisodes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman_(season_3)"}

The list is by catalogue number and is more or less in order of creation, starting from around 1610 when Hals began painting on his own. Most of these works are still considered autograph, but in the intervening half-century since Slive's work began, several others have been added to the list, including a few from Slive's \"L\" list of 20 lost paintings and a few from his \"D\" list of 81 doubtful attributions. In addition to these 101 rejections, Slive occasionally mentions other engravings and paintings in various catalogue entries, including as much provenance as possible, which has enabled scholars to make a few attributions based on those as well. The full number of paintings referenced in the Slive 1974 catalogue, whether by catalogue entry, illustration, or publication reference, is over 400.
