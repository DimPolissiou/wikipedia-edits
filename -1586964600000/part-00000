By the 1930s, many bands had incorporated a [[trumpet]], becoming ''septetos'', and in the 1940s a larger type of ensemble featuring [[congas]] and [[piano]] became the norm: the [[Conjunto#Cuban conjunto|conjunto]]. Besides, the son became one of the main ingredients in the jam sessions known as [[descarga]]s that flourished during the 1950s.\n\nThe international presence of the son can be traced back to the 1930s when many bands toured Europe and North America, leading to ballroom adaptations of the genre such as the American [[rhumba]]. Similarly, radio broadcasts of son became popular in West Africa and the Congos, leading to the development of hybrid genres such as [[Congolese rumba]]. In the 1960s, [[New York City|New York]]'s music scene prompted the rapid success of [[salsa music|salsa]], a combination of son and other Latin American styles primarily recorded by [[Puerto Ricans]]. While salsa achieved international popularity during the second half of the 20th century, in Cuba son evolved into other styles such as [[songo music|songo]] and [[timba]], the latter of which is sometimes known as \"Cuban salsa\".\n\n==Etymology and cognates==\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the word ''son'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sonus'', denotes a pleasant sound, particularly a musical one.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola|date=2017|publisher=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|edition=23rd|url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=YLU1m5v|accessdate=March 11, 2017|language=Spanish|chapter=son}}</ref> In eastern Cuba, the term began to be used to refer to the music of the highlands towards the late 19th century. To distinguish it from similar genres from other countries (such as [[son mexicano]] and son guatemalteco), the term ''son cubano'' is most commonly used. In Cuba, various qualifiers are used to distinguish the regional variants of the genre. These include ''son montuno'', ''son oriental'', ''son santiaguero'' and ''son habanero''.<ref name=\"DA\" />\n\nSon singers are generally known as ''soneros'', and the verb ''sonear'' describes not only their singing but also their vocal improvisation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fern\u00e1ndez|first1=Ra\u00fal A.|editor1-last=Fern\u00e1ndez|editor1-first=Dami\u00e1n|editor2-last=C\u00e1mara-Betancourt|editor2-first=Madeline|title=Cuba, the Elusive Nation: Interpretations of National Identity|date=2000|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|chapter=The Musicalia of Twentieth-Century Cuban Popular Music}}</ref> The adjective ''soneado'' refers to songs and styles which incorporate the tempo and syncopation of the son, or even its [[montuno]]s.

This fallacy stemmed from the apocryphal origin story of a folk song known as \"Son de M\u00e1 Teodora\". Such story was first mentioned by Cuban historian Joaqu\u00edn Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda in 1845, who \"cited\" a chronicle supposedly written by Hernando de la Parra in the 16th century. Parra's story was picked up, recycled and expanded by various authors throughout the second half of the 19th century, perpetuating the idea that such song was the first example of the son genre. Despite being given credence by some authors in the first half of the 20th century, including [[Fernando Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez|Fernando Ortiz]], the ''Cr\u00f3nicas'' were repeatedly shown to be apocryphal in subsequent studies by Manuel P\u00e9rez Beato, Jos\u00e9 Juan Arrom, Max Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a and Alberto Muguercia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Muguercia|first1=Alberto|title=Teodora Gin\u00e9s \u00bfmito o realidad hist\u00f3rica?|journal=Revista de la Biblioteca Nacional de Cuba Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed|date=1971|volume=3|url=http://revistas.bnjm.cu/index.php/revista-bncjm/article/view/1736|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n\nThe emergence of son significantly increased the interaction of cultures derived from Africa and Spain.  A large number of former black slaves, recently liberated after the abolition of slavery in 1886 went to live in the slums \"solares\" of low class neighborhoods in Havana, and numerous laborers also arrived from all over the country and some rural areas, looking to improve their living conditions. Many of them brought their Afro-Cuban rumba traditions, and others brought their rumbitas and montunos.\n\nIt was in Havana where the encounter of the rumba rural and the rumba urbana that had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th century took place. The guaracheros and rumberos who used to play with the tiple and the guiro finally met other rumberos who sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (caj\u00f3n) and the Cuban clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called son.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez Ruid\u00edaz, Armando: https://www.academia.edu/8041795/The_origin_of_Cuban_music._Myths_and_Facts, p. 89</ref> Around 1910 the son most likely adopted the [[clave rhythm]] from the Havana-based [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and [[Matanzas]].<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa (2009: 83) ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins.''

Those trovadores from different parts of the country met others who already lived in Havana such as Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera and Rafael Zequeira. They brought their repertoires of canciones (Cuban songs) and boleros that also included rumbas, guarachas and rural rumbitas.\n \nFamous trovador Chico Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez said that he composed his first \"montuno\" called \"Pobre Evaristo\" (Poor Evaristo) in 1906: \"It was a tonada with three or four words that you put on, and after it, we placed a repeated phrase, the real montuno to be sung by everybody\u2026\".<ref>Giro, Radam\u00e9s:Los motivos del son.

One of those groups, The Apaches, was invited in 1916 to a party held by President Mario Menocal at the exclusive Vedado Tennis Club, and that same year some members of the group were reorganized in a quartet named Cuarteto Oriental.<ref>Sublette Ned: Cuba and its music. Chicago Review Press, Inc., 2004, p. 335.</ref> Those members were: Ricardo Mart\u00ednez from Santiago de Cuba (conductor and tres), Gerardo Mart\u00ednez (first voice and clave), Guillermo Castillo (botijuela), and Felipe Neri Cabrera (maracas). According to Jes\u00fas Blanco, quoted by D\u00edaz Ayala, after a few months from its foundation the bongocero Joaqu\u00edn Velazco joined the group.<ref>D\u00edaz Ayala, Crist\u00f3bal: Discograf\u00eda de la M\u00fasica Cubana.

Unexpectedly, a fifth member of the quartet is mentioned, Carlos God\u00ednez, who was a soldier in the standing army (''Ej\u00e9rcito Permanente''). Subsequently, the RCA Victor contracted God\u00ednez in 1918 to organize a group and record several songs. For that recording, the new group was called \"Sexteto Habanero God\u00ednez\", which included: Carlos God\u00ednez (conductor and tresero), Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera (first voice and clave), Manuel Corona (second voice and guitar), Sinsonte (third voice and maracas), Alfredo Bolo\u00f1a (bongo), and another unknown performer who was not included in the list.<ref>D\u00edaz Ayala, Crist\u00f3bal: Discograf\u00eda de la M\u00fasica Cubana.

The city became a haven for the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]], gambling and [[prostitution in Cuba]], and also became a second home for trendy and influential bands from New York City. The son experienced a period of transformation from 1925 to 1928, when it evolved from a marginal genre of music to perhaps the most popular type of music in Cuba.\n\n[[File:Bolona.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Sexteto Bolo\u00f1a 1926.]]\nA turning point that made this transformation possible occurred when then-president [[Gerardo Machado|Machado]] publicly asked [[La Sonora Matancera]] to perform at his birthday party.

In 1928, [[Rita Montaner]]'s \"[[El Manicero]]\" became the first Cuban song to be a major hit in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. In 1930, [[Don Azpiazu]]'s Havana Casino Orchestra took the song to the United States, where it also became a big hit.\n\nThe instrumentation was expanded to include cornets or trumpets, forming the sextets and the septets of the 1920s. Later these conjuntos added piano, other percussion instruments, more trumpets, and even dance orchestra instruments in the style of [[jazz]] big bands.<ref>Argeliers, L. \"Notes toward a Panorama of Popular and Folk Music.\" ''Essays on Cuban Music: North American and Cuban Perspectives.''

Print.</ref>\n\n===Tr\u00edo Matamoros===\n\nThe presence of the [[Tr\u00edo Matamoros]] in the history of Cuban son is so important that it deserves a separate section. Its development constitutes an example of the process that the trovadores usually followed until they became soneros. The Tr\u00edo was founded by Miguel Matamoros (vocals and first guitar), who was born in Santiago de Cuba (Oriente) in 1894. There, he became involved with the traditional trova movement and in 1925 joined Siro Rodr\u00edguez (vocals and maracas) and Rafael Cueto (vocals and second guitar) to create the famous group.<ref>Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 135</ref>\n\nThey synthesized the style of the sextets and septets, adapting it to their ensemble. The different rhythmic layers of the son style were distributed between their three voices, guitars and maracas. Cueto plucked the strings of his guitar instead of strumming them as it was usual, providing the patterns of the [[guajeo]] in the treble range, and the syncopated rhythms of the [[tumbao]] on the bass strings. The counterpoint was completed by the first guitar, played by Matamoros.<ref>Giro, Radam\u00e9s: Los Motivos del son. Panorama de la m\u00fasica popular cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, La Habana, Cuba, 1998, p. 203.</ref> They also occasionally included other instruments such as the bongo, and later they decided to expand the trio format to create a son conjunto by adding a piano, more guitars, tres and other voices. This project was joined by such important figures as Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Francisco Repilado (Compay Segundo) and Beny Mor\u00e9.\n\nIn 1928, they travelled to New York with a recording contract by RCA Victor, and their first album caused such a great impact in the public that they soon became very famous at a national as well as an international level. The Tr\u00edo Matamoros maintained great prominence until their official retirement in 1960.<ref name=\"D\u00edaz Ayala 1993, p. 116\"/>\n\n===1930s===\n\nBy the late 1930s, the heyday of \"Classic son\" had largely ended. The sextetos and septetos that had enjoyed wide commercial popularity increasingly lost ground to [[jazz]] bands and amplified conjuntos.<ref name=\"Moore198\">Moore, R. \"Afrocubanismo and Son.\" ''The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics.'' Ed. Chomsky, Carr, and Smorkaloff. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 198. Print.</ref> The very music that son had helped to create was now replacing son as the more popular and most requested music in Cuba. Original son conjuntos were faced with the options of either to disband and refocus on newer styles of Cuban music, or go back to their roots.\n\n===1940s===\n\n[[File:Conjunto de Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Conjunto de Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez ca. 1949.]]\nIn the 1940s, [[Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez]] became the most influential player of son. He used improvised solos, toques, [[conga]]s, extra trumpets, percussion and pianos, although all these elements had been used previously (\"Papauba\", \"Para bailar son montuno\"). [[Beny Mor\u00e9]] (known as ''El B\u00e1rbaro del Ritmo'', \"The Master of Rhythm\") further evolved the genre, adding [[guaracha]], [[bolero]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] influences. He was perhaps the greatest sonero (\"Castellano que bueno baila usted\", \"Vertiente Camaguey\"); another important sonero was Roberto Faz.\n\nBy the late 1940s, son had lost its controversiality even among conservative Cubans which made it even less appealing to Cubans.<ref name=\"Moore199\">Moore, R. \"Afrocubanismo and Son.\" ''The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics''. Ed. Chomsky, Carr, and Smorkaloff. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 199. Print.</ref> A development that led to the decrease in popularity of the original son occurred in the 1940s. The son grew more sophisticated as it was adopted by conjuntos, which displaced sextetos and septetos. This led to big bands replacing the conjuntos, which managed to keep its flavor despite elaborate arrangements.<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 121. Print.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the tourism boom in Cuba and the popularity of jazz and American music in general fostered the development of big bands and combos on the island.  These bands consisted of a relatively small horn section, piano, double bass, a full array of Cuban percussion instruments and a vocalist fronting the ensemble. Their polished sound and \"cosmopolitan\" \u2013 read \"commercial\" \u2013 repertoire captivated both Cuban and foreign audiences.\n\nThe commercialism of this new music movement led Cuban nightclub owners to recognize the revenue potential of hosting these types of bands to attract the growing flow of tourists. Additionally, as a result of the increasing popularity of big band music and in an effort to increase revenues, the recording industry focused on producing newer types of music and essentially removing son from their music repertoires. These developments were a big blow to the prospects of son and its popularity amongst even Cubans.\n\nWith the arrival of [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] in the United States, son also became extremely popular. After the [[Cuban Revolution]] separated Cuba from the U.S., son, mambo and [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], along with other forms of Afro-Cuban music contributed to the development of [[salsa music]], initially in New York.<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 130. Print.</ref>\n\nThe mass popularization of son music led to an increased valorization of [[Afro-Cuban]] street culture and of the artists who created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban roots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.<ref name=\"Moore198\"/>\n\n===Current state of the son===\n\nAt present, the traditional-style son is seldom heard but has been assimilated into other genres and is present in them. Thus, other types of popular Cuban music and other [[Latin]] styles of music continue using the essential style of the son.<ref>Argeliers, L. \"Notes toward a Panorama of Popular and Folk Music.\" ''Essays on Cuban Music: North American and Cuban Perspectives''. Ed. Peter Manuel. Maryland: Univ. Press of America, 1991. 22. Print.</ref>\n\nAnother important contribution of the son was the introduction of the drum to mainstream music. The increase in popularity of the son unveiled the potential of music with [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythms. This led to the development and mass distribution of newer types of Latin music. Additionally, genres of the later 1940s such as [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] manifest many characteristics derived from son.

It is a syncretic genre that blends elements of Spanish and African origin. Among its fundamental Hispanic components are the vocal style, lyrical [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] and the primacy of the [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]], derived from the [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]]. On the other hand, its characteristic [[clave (rhythm)|clave]] rhythm, [[call and response]] structure and percussion section ([[bongo drum|bongo]], [[maracas]], etc.) are all rooted in traditions of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] origin.<ref name=\"Sublette333\">{{cite book|last1=Sublette|first1=Ned|title=Cuba and Its Music: From the First Drums to the Mambo|date=2004|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago, IL|pages=333\u2013334|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fZZ4QKZEumIC}}</ref>\n\nAround 1909 the son reached [[Havana]], where the first recordings were made in 1917.<ref name=\"DA\">{{cite book|last1=D\u00edaz Ayala|first1=Crist\u00f3bal|title=Encyclopedic Discography of Cuban Music Vol. 1, 1898-1925|date=2014|publisher=Florida International University Libraries|url=http://latinpop.fiu.edu/VIII%20El%20son.pdf|accessdate=March 11, 2017|language=Spanish|chapter=El son}}</ref> This marked the start of its expansion throughout the island, becoming Cuba's most popular and influential genre.<ref name=\"HO\">{{cite book|last1=Orovio|first1=Helio|title=Cuban Music from A to Z|date=2004|publisher=Tumi|location=Bath, UK|pages=203\u2013205|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JUr9ZtK1Wn0C}}</ref> While early groups had between three and five members, during the 1920s the ''sexteto'' ([[sextet]]) became the genre's primary format. By the 1930s, many bands had incorporated a [[trumpet]], becoming ''septetos'', and in the 1940s a larger type of ensemble featuring [[congas]] and [[piano]] became the norm: the [[Conjunto#Cuban conjunto|conjunto]]. Besides, the son became one of the main ingredients in the jam sessions known as [[descarga]]s that flourished during the 1950s.\n\nThe international presence of the son can be traced back to the 1930s when many bands toured Europe and North America, leading to ballroom adaptations of the genre such as the American [[rhumba]]. Similarly, radio broadcasts of son became popular in West Africa and the Congos, leading to the development of hybrid genres such as [[Congolese rumba]]. In the 1960s, [[New York City|New York]]'s music scene prompted the rapid success of [[salsa music|salsa]], a combination of son and other Latin American styles primarily recorded by [[Puerto Ricans]]. While salsa achieved international popularity during the second half of the 20th century, in Cuba son evolved into other styles such as [[songo music|songo]] and [[timba]], the latter of which is sometimes known as \"Cuban salsa\".\n\n==Etymology and cognates==\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the word ''son'', from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''sonus'', denotes a pleasant sound, particularly a musical one.<ref>{{cite book|title=Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola|date=2017|publisher=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|edition=23rd|url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=YLU1m5v|accessdate=March 11, 2017|language=Spanish|chapter=son}}</ref> In eastern Cuba, the term began to be used to refer to the music of the highlands towards the late 19th century. To distinguish it from similar genres from other countries (such as [[son mexicano]] and son guatemalteco), the term ''son cubano'' is most commonly used. In Cuba, various qualifiers are used to distinguish the regional variants of the genre. These include ''son montuno'', ''son oriental'', ''son santiaguero'' and ''son habanero''.<ref name=\"DA\" />\n\nSon singers are generally known as ''soneros'', and the verb ''sonear'' describes not only their singing but also their vocal improvisation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fern\u00e1ndez|first1=Ra\u00fal A.|editor1-last=Fern\u00e1ndez|editor1-first=Dami\u00e1n|editor2-last=C\u00e1mara-Betancourt|editor2-first=Madeline|title=Cuba, the Elusive Nation: Interpretations of National Identity|date=2000|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|chapter=The Musicalia of Twentieth-Century Cuban Popular Music}}</ref> The adjective ''soneado'' refers to songs and styles which incorporate the tempo and syncopation of the son, or even its [[montuno]]s.

The contradanza included many of the traits that are shown in the son, such as duets with melodies in parallel thirds, the presence of a suggested clave rhythm, implicit short vocal refrains borrowed from popular songs, distinctive syncopations, as well as the two-parts song form with an [[ostinato]] section.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manuel|first=Peter|title=From contradanza to son: New perspectives on the prehistory of cuban popular music|journal=Latin American Music Review|date=2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=184\u2013212|doi=10.1353/lat.0.0045}}</ref>\n\n====Apocryphal origins of the son====\n\nDue to the very limited historiographical and ethnomusicological research devoted to the son (considered by D\u00edaz Ayala the \"least studied\" Cuban genre),<ref name=\"DA\" /> until the mid-20th century its origins were incorrectly traced back to the 16th century by many writers. This fallacy stemmed from the apocryphal origin story of a folk song known as \"Son de M\u00e1 Teodora\". Such story was first mentioned by Cuban historian Joaqu\u00edn Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda in 1845, who \"cited\" a chronicle supposedly written by Hernando de la Parra in the 16th century. Parra's story was picked up, recycled and expanded by various authors throughout the second half of the 19th century, perpetuating the idea that such song was the first example of the son genre. Despite being given credence by some authors in the first half of the 20th century, including [[Fernando Ortiz Fern\u00e1ndez|Fernando Ortiz]], the ''Cr\u00f3nicas'' were repeatedly shown to be apocryphal in subsequent studies by Manuel P\u00e9rez Beato, Jos\u00e9 Juan Arrom, Max Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a and Alberto Muguercia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Muguercia|first1=Alberto|title=Teodora Gin\u00e9s \u00bfmito o realidad hist\u00f3rica?|journal=Revista de la Biblioteca Nacional de Cuba Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed|date=1971|volume=3|url=http://revistas.bnjm.cu/index.php/revista-bncjm/article/view/1736|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\n\nThe emergence of son significantly increased the interaction of cultures derived from Africa and Spain.  A large number of former black slaves, recently liberated after the abolition of slavery in 1886 went to live in the slums \"solares\" of low class neighborhoods in Havana, and numerous laborers also arrived from all over the country and some rural areas, looking to improve their living conditions. Many of them brought their Afro-Cuban rumba traditions, and others brought their rumbitas and montunos.\n\nIt was in Havana where the encounter of the rumba rural and the rumba urbana that had been developing separately during the second half of the 19th century took place. The guaracheros and rumberos who used to play with the tiple and the guiro finally met other rumberos who sang and danced accompanied by the wooden box (caj\u00f3n) and the Cuban clave, and the result was the fusion of both styles in a new genre called son.<ref>Rodr\u00edguez Ruid\u00edaz, Armando: https://www.academia.edu/8041795/The_origin_of_Cuban_music._Myths_and_Facts, p. 89</ref> Around 1910 the son most likely adopted the [[clave rhythm]] from the Havana-based [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], which had been developed in the late 19th century in Havana and [[Matanzas]].<ref>Pe\u00f1alosa (2009: 83) ''The Clave Matrix; Afro-Cuban Rhythm: Its Principles and African Origins.''

Those trovadores from different parts of the country met others who already lived in Havana such as Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera and Rafael Zequeira. They brought their repertoires of canciones (Cuban songs) and boleros that also included rumbas, guarachas and rural rumbitas.\n \nFamous trovador Chico Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez said that he composed his first \"montuno\" called \"Pobre Evaristo\" (Poor Evaristo) in 1906: \"It was a tonada with three or four words that you put on, and after it, we placed a repeated phrase, the real montuno to be sung by everybody\u2026\".<ref>Giro, Radam\u00e9s:Los motivos del son.

Subsequently, the RCA Victor contracted God\u00ednez in 1918 to organize a group and record several songs. For that recording, the new group was called \"Sexteto Habanero God\u00ednez\", which included: Carlos God\u00ednez (conductor and tresero), Mar\u00eda Teresa Vera (first voice and clave), Manuel Corona (second voice and guitar), Sinsonte (third voice and maracas), Alfredo Bolo\u00f1a (bongo), and another unknown performer who was not included in the list.<ref>D\u00edaz Ayala, Crist\u00f3bal: Discograf\u00eda de la M\u00fasica Cubana.

In 1928, [[Rita Montaner]]'s \"[[El Manicero]]\" became the first Cuban song to be a major hit in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. In 1930, [[Don Azpiazu]]'s Havana Casino Orchestra took the song to the United States, where it also became a big hit.\n\nThe instrumentation was expanded to include cornets or trumpets, forming the sextets and the septets of the 1920s. Later these conjuntos added piano, other percussion instruments, more trumpets, and even dance orchestra instruments in the style of [[jazz]] big bands.<ref>Argeliers, L. \"Notes toward a Panorama of Popular and Folk Music.\" ''Essays on Cuban Music: North American and Cuban Perspectives.'' Ed. Peter Manuel. Maryland: Univ. Press of America, 1991. 21. Print.</ref>\n\n===Tr\u00edo Matamoros===\n\nThe presence of the Tr\u00edo Matamoros in the history of Cuban son is so important that it deserves a separate section. Its development constitutes an example of the process that the trovadores usually followed until they became soneros. The Tr\u00edo was founded by Miguel Matamoros (vocals and first guitar), who was born in Santiago de Cuba (Oriente) in 1894. There, he became involved with the traditional trova movement and in 1925 joined Siro Rodr\u00edguez (vocals and maracas) and Rafael Cueto (vocals and second guitar) to create the famous group.<ref>Orovio, Helio: Cuban music from A to Z. Tumi Music Ltd. Bath, U.K., 2004, p. 135</ref>\n\nThey synthesized the style of the sextets and septets, adapting it to their ensemble. The different rhythmic layers of the son style were distributed between their three voices, guitars and maracas. Cueto plucked the strings of his guitar instead of strumming them as it was usual, providing the patterns of the [[guajeo]] in the treble range, and the syncopated rhythms of the [[tumbao]] on the bass strings. The counterpoint was completed by the first guitar, played by Matamoros.<ref>Giro, Radam\u00e9s: Los Motivos del son. Panorama de la m\u00fasica popular cubana. Editorial Letras Cubanas, La Habana, Cuba, 1998, p. 203.</ref> They also occasionally included other instruments such as the bongo, and later they decided to expand the trio format to create a son conjunto by adding a piano, more guitars, tres and other voices. This project was joined by such important figures as Lorenzo Hierrezuelo, Francisco Repilado (Compay Segundo) and Beny Mor\u00e9.\n\nIn 1928, they travelled to New York with a recording contract by RCA Victor, and their first album caused such a great impact in the public that they soon became very famous at a national as well as an international level. The Tr\u00edo Matamoros maintained great prominence until their official retirement in 1960.<ref name=\"D\u00edaz Ayala 1993, p. 116\"/>\n\n===1930s===\n\nBy the late 1930s, the heyday of \"Classic son\" had largely ended. The sextetos and septetos that had enjoyed wide commercial popularity increasingly lost ground to [[jazz]] bands and amplified conjuntos.<ref name=\"Moore198\">Moore, R. \"Afrocubanismo and Son.\" ''The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics.'' Ed. Chomsky, Carr, and Smorkaloff. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 198. Print.</ref> The very music that son had helped to create was now replacing son as the more popular and most requested music in Cuba. Original son conjuntos were faced with the options of either to disband and refocus on newer styles of Cuban music, or go back to their roots.\n\n===1940s===\n\n[[File:Conjunto de Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Conjunto de Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez ca. 1949.]]\nIn the 1940s, [[Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez]] became the most influential player of son. He used improvised solos, toques, [[conga]]s, extra trumpets, percussion and pianos, although all these elements had been used previously (\"Papauba\", \"Para bailar son montuno\"). [[Beny Mor\u00e9]] (known as ''El B\u00e1rbaro del Ritmo'', \"The Master of Rhythm\") further evolved the genre, adding [[guaracha]], [[bolero]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] influences. He was perhaps the greatest sonero (\"Castellano que bueno baila usted\", \"Vertiente Camaguey\"); another important sonero was Roberto Faz.\n\nBy the late 1940s, son had lost its controversiality even among conservative Cubans which made it even less appealing to Cubans.<ref name=\"Moore199\">Moore, R. \"Afrocubanismo and Son.\" ''The Cuba Reader: History, Culture, Politics''. Ed. Chomsky, Carr, and Smorkaloff. Durham: Duke University Press, 2004. 199. Print.</ref> A development that led to the decrease in popularity of the original son occurred in the 1940s. The son grew more sophisticated as it was adopted by conjuntos, which displaced sextetos and septetos. This led to big bands replacing the conjuntos, which managed to keep its flavor despite elaborate arrangements.<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 121. Print.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the tourism boom in Cuba and the popularity of jazz and American music in general fostered the development of big bands and combos on the island.  These bands consisted of a relatively small horn section, piano, double bass, a full array of Cuban percussion instruments and a vocalist fronting the ensemble. Their polished sound and \"cosmopolitan\" \u2013 read \"commercial\" \u2013 repertoire captivated both Cuban and foreign audiences.\n\nThe commercialism of this new music movement led Cuban nightclub owners to recognize the revenue potential of hosting these types of bands to attract the growing flow of tourists. Additionally, as a result of the increasing popularity of big band music and in an effort to increase revenues, the recording industry focused on producing newer types of music and essentially removing son from their music repertoires. These developments were a big blow to the prospects of son and its popularity amongst even Cubans.\n\nWith the arrival of [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] in the United States, son also became extremely popular. After the [[Cuban Revolution]] separated Cuba from the U.S., son, mambo and [[Cuban rumba|rumba]], along with other forms of Afro-Cuban music contributed to the development of [[salsa music]], initially in New York.<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 130. Print.</ref>\n\nThe mass popularization of son music led to an increased valorization of [[Afro-Cuban]] street culture and of the artists who created it. It also opened the door for other music genres with Afro-Cuban roots to become popular in Cuba and throughout the world.<ref name=\"Moore198\"/>\n\n===Current state of the son===\n\nAt present, the traditional-style son is seldom heard but has been assimilated into other genres and is present in them. Thus, other types of popular Cuban music and other [[Latin]] styles of music continue using the essential style of the son.<ref>Argeliers, L. \"Notes toward a Panorama of Popular and Folk Music.\" ''Essays on Cuban Music: North American and Cuban Perspectives''. Ed. Peter Manuel. Maryland: Univ. Press of America, 1991. 22. Print.</ref>\n\nAnother important contribution of the son was the introduction of the drum to mainstream music. The increase in popularity of the son unveiled the potential of music with [[Afro-Cuban]] rhythms. This led to the development and mass distribution of newer types of Latin music. Additionally, genres of the later 1940s such as [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] manifest many characteristics derived from son. [[Charanga (Cuba)|Charanga]] orchestras, also developed dance music heavily influenced by son.<ref name=\"Moore199\"/>\n\nPerhaps the most significant contribution of son is its influence on present day [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]]. Son is specifically considered to be the foundation on which [[Salsa music|salsa]] was created.<ref>Argeliers, L. \"Notes toward a Panorama of Popular and Folk Music.\"'' Essays on Cuban Music: North American and Cuban Perspectives.'' Ed. Peter Manuel. Maryland: Univ. Press of America, 1991. 160. Print.</ref>\n\nAlthough the \"classic son\" continues to be a very important musical foundation for all kinds of [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]], it is no longer a popular music genre in Cuba. Younger generations of Cubans prefer the faster, dance-oriented son-derivatives such as [[timba]] or [[Salsa music|salsa]]. Older generations continue to preserve the son as one of the music genres they listen to, specifically in [[Oriente Province|Oriente]], where they tend to maintain more traditional versions of the son compared to [[Havana]].<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 252. Print.</ref>\n\nThe demise of the [[USSR]] (Cuba's major economic mainstay) in 1991 forced Cuba to encourage tourism to attract sorely needed foreign currency.  Along with tourism, music became one of Cuba's major assets.  The [[Buena Vista Social Club]] album and film as well as a stream of CDs triggered a worldwide Cuban music boom.<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 145. Print.</ref> In addition to the original [[Buena Vista Social Club]] album, there has been a stream of solo CDs by the members of the \"Club\". These individuals were subsequently offered individual contracts, ensuring a continued flow of CDs that include many original Cuban son classics.\n\nThanks to the [[Buena Vista Social Club]] album, film, and follow-up solo albums there has been a revival of the traditional son and a rediscovery of older son performers who had often fallen by the wayside.<ref>Leymarie, Isabelle. \"Cuban Fire: The Story of Salsa and Latin Jazz.\" New York: Continuum Publishing, 2002. 256. Print.</ref>  Although most Cubans don\u2019t see the value of the [[Buena Vista Social Club]] album and feel it doesn't represent present-day Cuba,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} it has introduced the Cuban son to younger generations of people from around the world who had never heard of son. It has also introduced foreign audiences to an important part of Cuban music history.\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\n[[File:Claves.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Claves]]]]\nThe basic son ensemble of early 20th-century Havana consisted of guitar, [[Tres (musical instrument)|tres]], [[claves]], [[bongos]], [[mar\u00edmbula]] or [[botija]], and [[maracas]]. The tres plays the typical Cuban [[ostinato]] figure known as [[guajeo]]. The rhythmic pattern of the following generic guajeo is used in many different songs. Note that the first measure consists of all offbeats. The figure can begin in the first measure, or the second measure, depending upon the structure of the song.\n\n[[File:Generic 3-2 guajeo.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Basic son tres guajeo written in cut-time. {{audio|Generic 3-2 guajeo.mid|Play}}]]\n\nLater on, the double bass replaced the mar\u00edmbula and [[bongo drum|bongo]]s and a trumpet were added, giving rise to ''sextetos'' and ''septetos''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cuba|Music}}\n*[[Music of Cuba]]\n*[[Dance in Cuba]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n*Argeliers, Leon. \"Notes toward a Panorama of Popular and Folk Music.\" ''Essays on Cuban Music: North American and Cuban Perspectives.''

It is the album's 12th and final track.\n\n==Concept==\nThe song originated in Jonathan Davis's former band [[Sexart]].<ref>[[Sexart]]</ref> The original concept came from Sexart member Dennis Shinn. As Shinn stated: \"The song took on 2 lives. 1st being titled \"Follow Me\" as it was written and performed in our band we had together called [[Sexart]]. The song changed form when it was re-produced by Korn. The first version of the song is lyrically portrayed from an older person's perspective, who is about to rape the mind of an \"Innocent Child\" sexually (being referenced as a virgin not an actual child metaphorically speaking). As the song focused more on the creepy element being their first sexual experience. The song carried a dark feel, both musically, and in lyrics. This is probably how, and exactly why Jonathan was able to channel a dark moment from his past when he was in the process of re-producing the song with [[Korn]].

Specifically, megalosaurids exhibit especially giant size, with some members of the family weighing more than one [[tonne]]. Over time, there is evidence of size increase within the family. Basal megalosaurids from the [[Early Jurassic]] had smaller body size than those appearing in the late Middle Jurassic. Due to this size increase over time, Megalosauridae appear to follow a size increase pattern similar to that of other giant sized theropods like [[Spinosauridae]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Carrano|first=Matthew T.|date=2012|title=The phylogeny of Tetanurae (Dinosauria: Theropoda)|url=|journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology|doi=10.1080/14772019.2011.630927|pmid=|access-date=|volume=10|issue=2|pages=211\u2013300}}</ref> This pattern follows [[Cope's rule|Cope's Rule]], the postulation by paleontologist [[Edward Drinker Cope|Edward Cope]] about evolutionary increase in body size.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hone|first=D.|date=January 1, 2005|title=Research Focus: The evolution of large size: how does Cope's Rule work?|url=|journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution [serial online]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Anatomical characteristics===\n[[File:Megalosaur skulls.png|thumb|Megalosaurid skulls. Clockwise from top left: ''[[Dubreuillosaurus]]'', ''[[Torvosaurus]]'', ''[[Afrovenator]]'', ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'']]\nOne unambiguous [[synapomorphy]] of Megalosauridae is a lower and longer [[skull]] with a length to height ratio of 3:1. In addition, the typical [[skull roof]] tends to be much less ornamented than that of other tetanurans, and crests or horns are either very small or absent entirely. Megalosaurids also have [[femoral head]]s with an orientation 45 degrees between anteromedial and fully medial. Megalosauridae are also defined by the following unique unambiguous synapomorphies:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n* A humeral deltopectoral crest that terminates about halfway along the humeral shaft\n* The absence of a fibular anterolateral tubercle.\n* [[Nostril|Nares]] which extend as far as the [[premaxilla]]ry teeth, yet the portion of the premaxilla anterior to the nares being longer than the portion under them; angled snout tip (angle between the anterior and alveolar margins <70 degrees).\n* Medial foramina on the [[Quadrate bone|quadrate]] adjacent to the mandibular condyles.\n* Pleurocoelous fossae on the [[Sacrum|sacral vertebrae]].\n* The oblique ligament groove on the posterior surface of the femoral head is shallow.\n\nMegalosaurinae (all megalosaurids more closely related to ''Megalosaurus'' than ''Afrovenator'') are characterized by a moderate (0.5-2.0) height/length ratio of the premaxilla below the level of the nares, compared to other megalosaurids which have a lower ratio and thus less tall snout tip.\n\nAfrovenatorinae (all megalosaurids more closely related to ''Afrovenator'' than ''Megalosaurus)'' are characterized by a squared anterior margin of the [[Antorbital fenestra|antorbital fossa]] and the puboischiadic plate being broadly open along the midline.\n\n===Dental morphology===\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi tooth 2.jpg|thumb|right|Tooth from ''Megalosaurus'']]\nDental findings are frequently used to differentiate between various theropods and to further inform cladistic [[phylogeny]]. Tooth morphology and dental evolutionary markers are prone to [[homoplasy]] and disappear or reappear throughout history. However, megalosaurids have several specific denture conditions that differentiate them from other basal theropods. One dental condition present in Megalosauridae is multiple enamel wrinkles near the carinae, the sharp edge or serration row of the tooth. Ornamented teeth and a well-marked enamel surface also characterize basal megalosaurids.

For example, most large carnivores found for about a century after the naming of ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' were placed in Megalosauridae. ''Megalosaurus'' was the first paleontological finding of its kind when William Buckland discovered a giant [[femur]] and named it in 1824, predating even the term Dinosauria.<ref name=\":0\" /> When initially defined, the species ''M. bucklandii'' was anatomically based on various dissociated bones found in [[Quarry|quarries]] around the village of Stonesfield, UK. Some of these early findings included a right [[Mandible|dentary]] with a well-preserved tooth, [[Rib cage|ribs]], [[pelvic bones]], and [[Sacrum|sacral vertebrae]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hendrickx|first=C.|date=2015|title=An overview of non-avian theropod discoveries and classification|url=|journal=Palarch's Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> As early [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] and researchers found more dinosaur bones in the surrounding area, they attributed them all to ''M. bucklandii'' since it was the only named and described dinosaur at this point in history. Therefore, the species was initially described and classified by a mass of possibly unrelated characteristics.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern [[paleontology]] first began to approach the problematic [[Cladistics|cladistic]] separation of Megalosauridae during the [[early 20th century]]. [[Friedrich von Huene|Fredrich von Huene]] separated carnivorous theropods, which had all been grouped into the broad category of megalosaurids, into two distinct families of larger, more giant sized and smaller, more lightly built theropods. These two groups were named [[Coelurosauria]] and [[Pachypodosauria]] respectively. Later on, [[Friedrich von Huene|Huene]] distinguished between carnivorous and [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] dinosaurs in Pachypodosauria, placing the meat-eaters in a new group [[Carnosauria]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAs more information was uncovered about basal theropods and phylogenetic characteristics, modern paleontologists began to question the proper naming for this group. In 2005 paleontologist [[Paul Sereno]] rejected the use of the clade Megalosauridae due to its ambiguous early history in favor of the name Torvosauridae.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P.C.|date=November 7, 2005|title=Stem Archosauria|url=|journal=TaxonSearch|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today, it is accepted that megalosaurids existed at least as a group of basal tetanurans, due to the fact that they have more derived taxa than [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurs]]<ref name=\":3\" /> and that the name Megalosauridae should represent this group. Megalosauridae also has priority over Torvosauridae under ICZN rules governing family names.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===Phylogeny===\n[[File:Torvosaurus tanneri Reconstruction.png|thumb|A reconstruction of ''[[Torvosaurus tanneri]]''|233x233px]]\nMegalosauridae was first phylogenetically defined in 1869 by Thomas Huxley, yet was used as a \u2018waste-basket\u2019 clade for many years. In 2002, Ronan Allain redefined the clade after he discovered a complete megalosaurid skull in northwestern France of species ''[[Poekilopleuron]]''. Using the characters described in this study, Allain defined Megalosauridae as dinosaurs including ''Poekilopleuron valesdunesis'', now known as ''[[Dubreuillosaurus]]'', ''Torvosaurus'', ''Afrovenator'', and all descendants of their common ancestor. Allain also defined two taxa within Megalosauridae: Torvosaurinae was defined as all Megalosauridae more closely related to ''Torvosaurus'' than to ''Poekilopleuron'' and [[Afrovenator|''Afrovenato'']]<nowiki/>r, and Megalosaurinae was defined as all those that are more closely related to ''Poekilopleuron''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Megalosauridae also falls under the basal clade Megalosauroidea, which also contains [[Spinosauridae]]. However, many taxa are still quite unstable and cannot be placed in one clade with absolute certainty. For example, ''Eustreptospondylus'' and ''[[Streptospondylus]]'', while they are both defined as Megalosauridae, are often excluded to make more stable cladograms since they are not defined to a certain subgroup.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The [[cladogram]] presented here follows Benson (2010) and Benson ''et al.''

During the middle Jurassic, this site would have been a tidal flat exposed at low tide on the edge of a lagoon. Unlike most coastal tracks, which are parallel to the coastline and probably left by migrating animals, the Vale de Meios tracks were perpendicular to the coast, with the vast majority oriented towards the lagoon. This indicates that the megalosaurids which would have left these tracks approached the tidal flat once the tide retreated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Razzolini|first=Novella L.|last2=Oms|first2=Oriol|last3=Castanera|first3=Diego|last4=Vila|first4=Bernat|last5=Santos|first5=Vanda Faria dos|last6=Galobart|first6=\u00c0ngel|date=2016-08-19|title=Ichnological evidence of Megalosaurid Dinosaurs Crossing Middle Jurassic Tidal Flats|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=31494|doi=10.1038/srep31494|pmid=27538759|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2016NatSR...631494R|pmc=4990902}}</ref>\n\nThis indicates that megalosaurids could have scavenged for the carcasses of marine creatures left by the receding tides.

In addition, the typical [[skull roof]] tends to be much less ornamented than that of other tetanurans, and crests or horns are either very small or absent entirely. Megalosaurids also have [[femoral head]]s with an orientation 45 degrees between anteromedial and fully medial. Megalosauridae are also defined by the following unique unambiguous synapomorphies:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" />\n* A humeral deltopectoral crest that terminates about halfway along the humeral shaft\n* The absence of a fibular anterolateral tubercle.\n* [[Nostril|Nares]] which extend as far as the [[premaxilla]]ry teeth, yet the portion of the premaxilla anterior to the nares being longer than the portion under them; angled snout tip (angle between the anterior and alveolar margins <70 degrees).\n* Medial foramina on the [[Quadrate bone|quadrate]] adjacent to the mandibular condyles.\n* Pleurocoelous fossae on the [[Sacrum|sacral vertebrae]].\n* The oblique ligament groove on the posterior surface of the femoral head is shallow.\n\nMegalosaurinae (all megalosaurids more closely related to ''Megalosaurus'' than ''Afrovenator'') are characterized by a moderate (0.5-2.0) height/length ratio of the premaxilla below the level of the nares, compared to other megalosaurids which have a lower ratio and thus less tall snout tip.\n\nAfrovenatorinae (all megalosaurids more closely related to ''Afrovenator'' than ''Megalosaurus)'' are characterized by a squared anterior margin of the [[Antorbital fenestra|antorbital fossa]] and the puboischiadic plate being broadly open along the midline.\n\n===Dental morphology===\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi tooth 2.jpg|thumb|right|Tooth from ''Megalosaurus'']]\nDental findings are frequently used to differentiate between various theropods and to further inform cladistic [[phylogeny]]. Tooth morphology and dental evolutionary markers are prone to [[homoplasy]] and disappear or reappear throughout history. However, megalosaurids have several specific denture conditions that differentiate them from other basal theropods. One dental condition present in Megalosauridae is multiple enamel wrinkles near the carinae, the sharp edge or serration row of the tooth. Ornamented teeth and a well-marked enamel surface also characterize basal megalosaurids. The ornamentation and well-marked surface appears in early megalosaurids but disappears in derived megalosaurids, suggesting that the condition was lost over time as megalosaurids grew in size.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=G.|date=1995|title=Split Carinae on Tyrannosaurid teeth and implications of their development|url=|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|doi=10.1080/02724634.1995.10011229|volume=15|issue=2|pages=268\u2013274}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n=== Historical classification ===\n[[File:Megalosaurus_femur.jpg|thumb|left|''Megalosaurus'' [[femur]]]]\nFrom the family's inception, many specimens found in the field have been wrongly classified as megalosaurids. For example, most large carnivores found for about a century after the naming of ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' were placed in Megalosauridae. ''Megalosaurus'' was the first paleontological finding of its kind when William Buckland discovered a giant [[femur]] and named it in 1824, predating even the term Dinosauria.<ref name=\":0\" /> When initially defined, the species ''M. bucklandii'' was anatomically based on various dissociated bones found in [[Quarry|quarries]] around the village of Stonesfield, UK. Some of these early findings included a right [[Mandible|dentary]] with a well-preserved tooth, [[Rib cage|ribs]], [[pelvic bones]], and [[Sacrum|sacral vertebrae]].<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Hendrickx|first=C.|date=2015|title=An overview of non-avian theropod discoveries and classification|url=|journal=Palarch's Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> As early [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] and researchers found more dinosaur bones in the surrounding area, they attributed them all to ''M. bucklandii'' since it was the only named and described dinosaur at this point in history. Therefore, the species was initially described and classified by a mass of possibly unrelated characteristics.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern [[paleontology]] first began to approach the problematic [[Cladistics|cladistic]] separation of Megalosauridae during the [[early 20th century]]. [[Friedrich von Huene|Fredrich von Huene]] separated carnivorous theropods, which had all been grouped into the broad category of megalosaurids, into two distinct families of larger, more giant sized and smaller, more lightly built theropods. These two groups were named [[Coelurosauria]] and [[Pachypodosauria]] respectively. Later on, [[Friedrich von Huene|Huene]] distinguished between carnivorous and [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] dinosaurs in Pachypodosauria, placing the meat-eaters in a new group [[Carnosauria]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAs more information was uncovered about basal theropods and phylogenetic characteristics, modern paleontologists began to question the proper naming for this group. In 2005 paleontologist [[Paul Sereno]] rejected the use of the clade Megalosauridae due to its ambiguous early history in favor of the name Torvosauridae.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Sereno|first=P.C.|date=November 7, 2005|title=Stem Archosauria|url=|journal=TaxonSearch|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> Today, it is accepted that megalosaurids existed at least as a group of basal tetanurans, due to the fact that they have more derived taxa than [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurs]]<ref name=\":3\" /> and that the name Megalosauridae should represent this group. Megalosauridae also has priority over Torvosauridae under ICZN rules governing family names.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n===Phylogeny===\n[[File:Torvosaurus tanneri Reconstruction.png|thumb|A reconstruction of ''[[Torvosaurus tanneri]]''|233x233px]]\nMegalosauridae was first phylogenetically defined in 1869 by Thomas Huxley, yet was used as a \u2018waste-basket\u2019 clade for many years. In 2002, Ronan Allain redefined the clade after he discovered a complete megalosaurid skull in northwestern France of species ''[[Poekilopleuron]]''. Using the characters described in this study, Allain defined Megalosauridae as dinosaurs including ''Poekilopleuron valesdunesis'', now known as ''[[Dubreuillosaurus]]'', ''Torvosaurus'', ''Afrovenator'', and all descendants of their common ancestor. Allain also defined two taxa within Megalosauridae: Torvosaurinae was defined as all Megalosauridae more closely related to ''Torvosaurus'' than to ''Poekilopleuron'' and [[Afrovenator|''Afrovenato'']]<nowiki/>r, and Megalosaurinae was defined as all those that are more closely related to ''Poekilopleuron''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Megalosauridae also falls under the basal clade Megalosauroidea, which also contains [[Spinosauridae]]. However, many taxa are still quite unstable and cannot be placed in one clade with absolute certainty. For example, ''Eustreptospondylus'' and ''[[Streptospondylus]]'', while they are both defined as Megalosauridae, are often excluded to make more stable cladograms since they are not defined to a certain subgroup.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> The [[cladogram]] presented here follows Benson (2010) and Benson ''et al.''

Middle Jurassic-era [[Trace fossil|tracks]] believed to have left by megalosaurids have been found at Vale de Meios in Portugal. During the middle Jurassic, this site would have been a tidal flat exposed at low tide on the edge of a lagoon. Unlike most coastal tracks, which are parallel to the coastline and probably left by migrating animals, the Vale de Meios tracks were perpendicular to the coast, with the vast majority oriented towards the lagoon. This indicates that the megalosaurids which would have left these tracks approached the tidal flat once the tide retreated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Razzolini|first=Novella L.|last2=Oms|first2=Oriol|last3=Castanera|first3=Diego|last4=Vila|first4=Bernat|last5=Santos|first5=Vanda Faria dos|last6=Galobart|first6=\u00c0ngel|date=2016-08-19|title=Ichnological evidence of Megalosaurid Dinosaurs Crossing Middle Jurassic Tidal Flats|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=31494|doi=10.1038/srep31494|pmid=27538759|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2016NatSR...631494R|pmc=4990902}}</ref>\n\nThis indicates that megalosaurids could have scavenged for the carcasses of marine creatures left by the receding tides. Another possibility is that megalosaurids were [[Piscivore|piscivorous]], approaching the coast to hunt for fish. Spinosaurids, which were close relatives of megalosaurids, had numerous adaptations for piscivory and semiaquatic life, so such a lifestyle is supported by phylogenetic data. [[Shark]] teeth, [[cartilage]] fragments, and [[gastrolith]]s have been documented as stomach contents in ''Poekilopleuron''. Both this genus and ''Dubreillosaurus'' were discovered in sediments also preserving mangrove roots, providing further evidence for a coastal habitat. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the possibility that megalosaurids also fed on terrestrial prey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Allain|first=Ronan|date=2005|title=The Postcranial Anatomy of the Megalosaur Dubreuillosaurus valesdunensis (Dinosauria Theropoda) from the Middle Jurassic of Normandy, France|jstor=4524511|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=850\u2013858|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2005)025[0850:tpaotm]2.0.co;2}}</ref>\n\n===Palaeogeography===\n[[File:Pangaea_continents.svg|thumb|200px|[[Pangaea|Pangea]] before the split into [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]]]]\nSpecies included in Megalosauridae have been found on every modern [[continent]], split relatively equally between sites on the [[Gondwana]] and [[Laurasia]] [[supercontinent]]s.

Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore [[Sanatana Dharma]] rather than Hindu Dharma ([[Hinduism]]).  Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 March 1983.</ref> He explained further: \"I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions.

Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 24 December 1981</ref> He said:  \"We are all one with each other and with God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 2 April 1980.</ref> Haidakhan Babaji said: \"You should seek harmony in everything you do.

Babaji used to say that: \"Work is worship\"<ref name=\"Babaji 1981\">The Teachings of Babaji, 23 October 1981.</ref> and that hard work is the best spiritual practice.  On another occasion he said: \"If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma \u2013 activity \u2013 is the only thing which can drive out all evils\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 17 November 1983</ref> Babaji also taught that \"perfection in work\" was the real meaning of [[Kriya]] Yoga.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 10 November 1983</ref>\n\n\n[[Japa|Nama Japa]], the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings:\n\n:''Have faith! Reciting the Name of the Lord is not the first, but the last stage of spiritual practice! When lions enter the forest, the other animals run away. Likewise, all evil thoughts will vanish with the recitation of the Lord's name. Reciting the Name of the Lord will bring you the company of a good people and you will be near saints. Blessed are the few who will discard the kingdom of the world for the Lord's name. Such a devotee always resides in My heart. In the womb, you take a vow not to get attached; but as soon as you come out, you get entangled. Abandon attachment! Your mind plays tricks on you! That is why you are after pleasures! All worldly things \u2013 including the desire for liberation \u2013 are obstacles to which you are attached.

Perhaps the best way to write it would be Hairdakhan but that is not usually done.</ref> in northern [[India]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and taught publicly from 1970 to 1984.\n\n== Life ==\n\nAccording to \"The Teachings of Babaji,\" Haidakhan Babaji \"appeared\" in June 1970 in a cave at the foot of the Kumaon Mount Kailash, across the river Gautama Ganga, near a remote village called Hairakhan, in the [[Nainital district|Nainital]] District of [[Uttrakhand]], India.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"The Teachings of Babaji\", foreword</ref> His followers maintain that Haidakhan Babaji is a Mahavatar \u2013 \"a human manifestation of God, not born from woman.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt is reported that starting in late September 1970 Haidakhan Babaji spent forty-five days meditating in a small temple on the top of the Kumaon Mount Kailash \"without leaving his seat.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In September 1971, Haidakhan Babaji, in a sworn testimony, convinced the judge of the court in Haldwani that he was the \"[[Hariakhan Baba|Old Hariakhan Baba]],\u201d thought to be active in that region in the years 1860\u20131922, and that he had the right to use the [[ashram]]s in Kathgaria and Haidakhan.<ref>Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. PP.125\u2013135.</ref> In 1971 Haidakhan Babaji started travelling across India, proclaiming his Message, performing sacred ceremonies, such as [[yagna]], and attracting more devotees. This included celebrities, such as [[Shammi Kapoor]],<ref>Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. P.158.</ref> and gradually more Westerners.<ref>See for instance: Gaura Devi. (2001). Fire of Transformation. My life with Babaji.</ref>\n\nThough some of his followers<ref>See for instance: Orr, Leonard, 1988, 1995.</ref> believed he was immortal, Haidakhan Babaji took Mahasamadhi on 14 February 1984, local sources would say it appeared to be a heart failure. He was buried in Haidakhan Ashram.  This is how Babaji foretold and explained his death:\n\n{{quote|My body is meant to dry up one day. This body is nothing; it is here only to serve people. (\u2026) Even my own body has come only to perform a duty to serve all human and all living things.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji. 2 February 1983.</ref>}}\n\n== Teachings ==\n\nHaidakhan Babaji maintained that: \"All religions are incorporated in the principle of Truth, Simplicity and Love\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 December 1981</ref> In his living years he taught intensively the importance to live a simple life with loving principles in truth. Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore [[Sanatana Dharma]] rather than Hindu Dharma ([[Hinduism]]).  Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 25 March 1983.</ref> He explained further: \"I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions. I seek the elevation of all mankind. \"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 29 July 1983.</ref>\n\nHe stressed the unity of all religions as expressed in the following words: \"In any town there is always a central place; all the roads in the town or from out of town lead to that central place. Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 24 December 1981</ref> He said:  \"We are all one with each other and with God.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 2 April 1980.</ref> Haidakhan Babaji said: \"You should seek harmony in everything you do. I am harmony. Thank you for your love.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 12 April 1980.</ref><ref>More on this subject can be found in the book: \"I Am Harmony\", by Radhe Shyam (1990).</ref> Haidakhan Babaji proclaimed: \"One can follow any religion, one can follow any practice or path, but one must be humane.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 22 January 1983</ref> He said: \"The world now is in a state of turmoil. It is suffering from three kinds of pain \u2013 physical, mental, spiritual \u2013 and there is only one way of being cured from these. We have to root out inhumanity and replace it with humanity. (\u2026)\" He also made the following statement: \"The only true man is one who practices 'humanism.' (\u2026) this is the only way to success in life.\"<ref name=\"Ibidem_d\">The Teachings of Babaji, 29 October 1983.</ref>\n\nBabaji talked about the importance of hard work and proper performance of one's duty so often that Karma Yoga should be considered the central element of his teachings.  Babaji used to say that: \"Work is worship\"<ref name=\"Babaji 1981\">The Teachings of Babaji, 23 October 1981.</ref> and that hard work is the best spiritual practice.  On another occasion he said: \"If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma \u2013 activity \u2013 is the only thing which can drive out all evils\".<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 17 November 1983</ref> Babaji also taught that \"perfection in work\" was the real meaning of [[Kriya]] Yoga.<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 10 November 1983</ref>\n\n\n[[Japa|Nama Japa]], the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings:\n\n:''Have faith! Reciting the Name of the Lord is not the first, but the last stage of spiritual practice! When lions enter the forest, the other animals run away. Likewise, all evil thoughts will vanish with the recitation of the Lord's name. Reciting the Name of the Lord will bring you the company of a good people and you will be near saints. Blessed are the few who will discard the kingdom of the world for the Lord's name. Such a devotee always resides in My heart. In the womb, you take a vow not to get attached; but as soon as you come out, you get entangled. Abandon attachment! Your mind plays tricks on you! That is why you are after pleasures! All worldly things \u2013 including the desire for liberation \u2013 are obstacles to which you are attached. If you want divine peace, leave behind ignorant karma.''<ref name=RadheShyam/> He explained that God's name is the most powerful sound of the Creation \u2013 \"more powerful than a thousand atomic and hydrogen bombs.\"<ref>The Teachings of Babaji, 26 December 1982</ref>  \u2013 and that this is the only real thing.\n\nHaidakhan Babaji especially recommended the use of the [[mantra]] \"[[\u0950]] nama\u1e25 \u015biv\u0101y\" ([[Sanskrit]]: \u0950 \u0928\u092e\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0935\u093e\u092f\u094d )<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224203444/http://ginakim.net/graphics/OmNamahShivai_Babaji_45pc.gif |archive-date=24 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \u2013 while \"\u0950\" is mostly [[IAST|transliterated]] as \"o\u1e43\" or \"au\u1e43\") \u2013 because of its protective qualities,<ref>E.g. \"Chant OM NAMAH SHIVAY and you can defy death.\" The Teachings of Babaji, 28 July 1979.</ref> but also stated that one can use any God's name \"his religion teaches.\"<ref>Gaura Devi.
