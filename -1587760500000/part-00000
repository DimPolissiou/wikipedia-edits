The statue was presented to the city by Jury's Hotel Group to mark the Millennium.\n\nOn 18 July 2014, the statue was relocated to Suffolk Street, in front of the Tourist Information Office, to make way for [[Luas]] track-laying work to be completed at the old location. Due to the increase in tourist foot traffic, and a common penchant for being \"handsy\", the statue has been groped often enough that the [[bronze]] hue has begun to wear off on the bosom.\n\n==History==\nThe song tells the fictional tale of a [[fishwife]] who plied her trade on the streets of Dublin, but who died young, of a fever. In the late 20th century a legend grew up that there was a historical Molly, who lived in the 17th century. She is typically represented as a [[hawker (trade)|hawker]] by day and part-time prostitute by night.<ref name = \"kil\">Siobh\u00e1n Marie Kilfeather, ''Dublin: a cultural history'', Oxford University Press US, 2005, p. 6.</ref> In contrast she has also been portrayed as one of the few chaste female street-hawkers of her day.\n\nThere is no evidence that the song is based on a real woman, of the 17th century or any other time. The name \"[[Molly (name)|Molly]]\" originated as a familiar version of the names [[Mary (given name)|Mary]] and [[Margaret (name)|Margaret]]. While many such \"Molly\" Malones were born in Dublin over the centuries, no evidence connects any of them to the events in the song.<ref name = \"kil\"/><ref name = \"eire\"/> Nevertheless, the Dublin Millennium Commission in 1988 endorsed claims made for a Mary Malone who died on 13 June 1699, and proclaimed 13 June to be \"Molly Malone day\".<ref name = \"kil\"/>\n\nThe song is not recorded earlier than 1876, when it was published in [[Boston]], Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Waite|first1=Henry Randall|title=Carmina Collegensia: A Complete Collection of the Songs of the American Colleges, with Selections from the Student Songs of the English and German Universitys|date=1876|publisher=Ditson|page=73}}</ref> The song's placement in the section of the book entitled \"Songs from English and German Universities\" suggests an Irish origin.<ref name=\"Jensen-Brown\">{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Peter Jensen|title=Molly Malone, Molly Mogg and a Missing Link \u2013 the Fishy History and Origins of \"Cockles and Mussels\"|url=http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2015/07/molly-malone-molly-mogg-and-missing.html|website=Early Sports 'n' Pop-Culture History Blog}}</ref> It was also published by [[Francis, Day & Hunter Ltd.|Francis Brothers and Day]] in London in 1884 as a work written and composed by James Yorkston, of Edinburgh, with music arranged by Edmund Forman.

Birds intermediate between the normal morph and the white morph are known as W\u00fcrdemann's heron; these birds resemble a \"normal\" great blue with a white head.\n\nThe theory that great white herons may be a separate species (''A. occidentalis'') from the great blue heron has again been given some support by [[David Allen Sibley|David Sibley]].<ref name=\"sibleyguides\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe \"great white heron\" could be confused with the [[great egret]] (''Ardea alba''), but is larger, with yellow legs as opposed to the great egret's black legs. The [[reddish egret]] (''Egretta rufescens'') and [[little blue heron]] (''Egretta caerulea'') could be mistaken for the great blue heron, but are much smaller, and lack white on the head and yellow in the bill. In the southern reaches of its range, the great blue sometimes overlaps in range with the closely related and similarly sized [[cocoi heron]] (''A. cocoi''). The cocoi is distinguished by a striking white neck and solid black crown, but the duller juveniles are more easily confused. More superficially similar is the slightly smaller [[grey heron]], which may sometimes vagrate to the northern coasts of North America. The grey heron (which occupies the same ecological niche in [[Eurasia]] as the great blue heron) has very similar plumage, but has a solidly soft-gray neck. Erroneously, the great blue heron is sometimes referred to as a \"crane\".  A heron is differentiated from a [[Crane (bird)|crane]] in flight. The crane's neck is straight and the heron's is always curved.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Ardea herodias -Illinois, USA -flying-8.jpg|thumb|With nesting material in [[Illinois]]]]\n[[File:DSC 2441 hr.jpg|thumb|December in Virginia at a partially frozen pond]]\nThe great blue heron is found throughout most of North America, as far north as [[Alaska]] and the southern [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s in the summer. In winter, the range extends south through Florida, [[Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean]] to South America. Birds east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the northern part of their range are [[bird migration|migratory]] and winter in the coastal areas of the [[Southern United States]], Central America, or northern South America. From the Southern United States southwards, and on the lower [[Pacific coast]], they are year-round residents.<ref name=hbw/> However, their hardiness is such that individuals often remain through cold northern winters, as well, so long as fish-bearing waters remain unfrozen (which may be the case only in flowing water such as streams, creeks, and rivers).\n\nThe great blue heron can adapt to almost any wetland habitat in its range. It may be found in numbers in fresh and saltwater [[marsh]]es, [[mangrove]] swamps, flooded meadows, lake edges, or [[shoreline]]s. It is quite adaptable and may be seen in heavily developed areas as long as they hold bodies of fish-bearing water.\n\nGreat blue herons rarely venture far from bodies of water, but are occasionally seen flying over upland areas. They usually nest in trees or bushes near water's edge, often on islands (which minimizes the potential for predation) or partially isolated spots.<ref name=\"usgs\">Short, Henry L. and Cooper, Robert J.

Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but also feed in fields or drop from the air, or a perch, into water. Mice are occasionally preyed on in upland areas far from the species' typical aquatic environments.<ref name=\"usgs\"/> Occasionally, loose feeding flocks form and may be beneficial since they are able to locate schools of fish more easily.<ref name=\"usgs\"/>\n\nAs large wading birds, great blue herons are capable of feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep,<ref name=\"usgs\"/> or at the water's edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or [[frog]]s with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.<ref name=\"usgs\"/>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Ardea herodias at the nest 11.jpg|At the nest|thumb]]\nThis species usually breeds in [[Bird colony|colonies]], in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a [[heronry]] (a more specific term than \"[[rookery]]\"). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within {{convert|4|to|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, to ideal feeding spots.<ref name=\"usgs\"/> Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and duck blinds. Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies.<ref>Custer, T. W., R. G. Osborn, and W. F. Stout. 1980.

In a track, the front toes, as well as the back, often show the small talons.<ref>Murie & Elbroch, ''Peterson Field Guide to Animal Tracks'', pg. 334 (2005)</ref>\n\nThe subspecies differ only slightly in size and plumage tone, with the exception of ''A. h. occidentalis'', native to South Florida, which also has a distinct white [[Polymorphism (biology)|morph]], known as the '''great white heron''' (not to be confused with the [[great egret]], for which \"great white heron\" was once a common name).<ref name=\"fws\"/> The great white heron differs from other great blues in bill morphology, head plume length, and in having a total lack of pigment in its plumage. It averages somewhat larger than the sympatric race ''A. h. wardi'' and may be the largest race in the species. In a survey of ''A. h. occidentalis'' in Florida, males were found to average {{convert|3.02|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and females average {{convert|2.57|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, with a range for both sexes of {{convert|2|to|3.39|kg|abbr=on}}.<ref name = \"CRC\"/> This is mainly found near salt water, and was long thought to be a separate species. Birds intermediate between the normal morph and the white morph are known as W\u00fcrdemann's heron; these birds resemble a \"normal\" great blue with a white head.\n\nThe theory that great white herons may be a separate species (''A. occidentalis'') from the great blue heron has again been given some support by [[David Allen Sibley|David Sibley]].<ref name=\"sibleyguides\"/>\n\n===Similar species===\nThe \"great white heron\" could be confused with the [[great egret]] (''Ardea alba''), but is larger, with yellow legs as opposed to the great egret's black legs. The [[reddish egret]] (''Egretta rufescens'') and [[little blue heron]] (''Egretta caerulea'') could be mistaken for the great blue heron, but are much smaller, and lack white on the head and yellow in the bill. In the southern reaches of its range, the great blue sometimes overlaps in range with the closely related and similarly sized [[cocoi heron]] (''A. cocoi''). The cocoi is distinguished by a striking white neck and solid black crown, but the duller juveniles are more easily confused. More superficially similar is the slightly smaller [[grey heron]], which may sometimes vagrate to the northern coasts of North America. The grey heron (which occupies the same ecological niche in [[Eurasia]] as the great blue heron) has very similar plumage, but has a solidly soft-gray neck. Erroneously, the great blue heron is sometimes referred to as a \"crane\".  A heron is differentiated from a [[Crane (bird)|crane]] in flight. The crane's neck is straight and the heron's is always curved.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Ardea herodias -Illinois, USA -flying-8.jpg|thumb|With nesting material in [[Illinois]]]]\n[[File:DSC 2441 hr.jpg|thumb|December in Virginia at a partially frozen pond]]\nThe great blue heron is found throughout most of North America, as far north as [[Alaska]] and the southern [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]]s in the summer. In winter, the range extends south through Florida, [[Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean]] to South America. Birds east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the northern part of their range are [[bird migration|migratory]] and winter in the coastal areas of the [[Southern United States]], Central America, or northern South America. From the Southern United States southwards, and on the lower [[Pacific coast]], they are year-round residents.<ref name=hbw/> However, their hardiness is such that individuals often remain through cold northern winters, as well, so long as fish-bearing waters remain unfrozen (which may be the case only in flowing water such as streams, creeks, and rivers).\n\nThe great blue heron can adapt to almost any wetland habitat in its range. It may be found in numbers in fresh and saltwater [[marsh]]es, [[mangrove]] swamps, flooded meadows, lake edges, or [[shoreline]]s. It is quite adaptable and may be seen in heavily developed areas as long as they hold bodies of fish-bearing water.\n\nGreat blue herons rarely venture far from bodies of water, but are occasionally seen flying over upland areas. They usually nest in trees or bushes near water's edge, often on islands (which minimizes the potential for predation) or partially isolated spots.<ref name=\"usgs\">Short, Henry L. and Cooper, Robert J.

Primary prey is variable based on availability and abundance. In [[Nova Scotia]], 98% of the diet was [[flounder]]s.<ref name= Quinney>Quinney, T. E. and P. C. Smith. 1979.

Individuals usually forage while standing in water, but also feed in fields or drop from the air, or a perch, into water. Mice are occasionally preyed on in upland areas far from the species' typical aquatic environments.<ref name=\"usgs\"/> Occasionally, loose feeding flocks form and may be beneficial since they are able to locate schools of fish more easily.<ref name=\"usgs\"/>\n\nAs large wading birds, great blue herons are capable of feeding in deeper waters, thus are able to harvest from niche areas not open to most other heron species. Typically, the great blue heron feeds in shallow waters, usually less than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep,<ref name=\"usgs\"/> or at the water's edge during both the night and the day, but especially around dawn and dusk. The most commonly employed hunting technique of the species is wading slowly with its long legs through shallow water and quickly spearing fish or [[frog]]s with its long, sharp bill. Although usually ponderous in movements, the great blue heron is adaptable in its fishing methods. Feeding behaviors variably have consisted of standing in one place, probing, pecking, walking at slow speeds, moving quickly, flying short distances and alighting, hovering over water and picking up prey, diving headfirst into the water, alighting on water feet-first, jumping from perches feet-first, and swimming or floating on the surface of the water.<ref name=\"usgs\"/>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Ardea herodias at the nest 11.jpg|At the nest|thumb]]\nThis species usually breeds in [[Bird colony|colonies]], in trees close to lakes or other wetlands. Adults generally return to the colony site after winter from December (in warmer climes such as California and Florida) to March (in cooler areas such as Canada). Usually, colonies include only great blue herons, though sometimes they nest alongside other species of herons. These groups are called a [[heronry]] (a more specific term than \"[[rookery]]\"). The size of these colonies may be large, ranging between five and 500 nests per colony, with an average around 160 nests per colony. A heronry is usually relatively close, usually within {{convert|4|to|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}, to ideal feeding spots.<ref name=\"usgs\"/> Heronry sites are usually difficult to reach on foot (e.g., islands, trees in swamps, high branches, etc.) to protect from potential mammalian predators. Trees of any type are used when available. When not, herons may nest on the ground, sagebrush, cacti, channel markers, artificial platforms, beaver mounds, and duck blinds. Other waterbirds (especially smaller herons) and, occasionally, even fish and mammal-eating raptors may nest amongst colonies.<ref>Custer, T. W., R. G. Osborn, and W. F. Stout. 1980.
