Ford used ''Sequoia'' less than Nixon. In May 1975, Ford was the first known president to host a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting aboard the vessel. Lasting four hours, the President and his cabinet discussed wide-ranging issues facing the United States, including a discussion regarding Congressional relations, confronting the issue of Vietnamese refugees, and the status of the U.S. Energy program in light of the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref>Box C20, folder \u201cPresidential Handwriting, 5/5/1975 (3)\u201d of the Presidential Handwriting File at the Gerald R.

Carter would later recall selling the yacht as a mistake. In a conversation with broadcaster Ray Suarez, Carter said: \u201cPeople thought I was not being reverent enough to the office I was holding, that I was too much of a peanut farmer, not enough of an aristocrat, or something like that. So I think that shows that the American people want something of, an element of, image of monarchy in the White House.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/events-and-awards/forums/past-forums/transcripts/a-conversation-with-president-jimmy-carter-0|title=Link to Oral History Interview with Jimmy Carter}}</ref> In his 2015 [[autobiography]] \"''A Full Life: Reflections at 90\"'' Presidential Carter wrote of selling ''Sequoia, \"''I was determined to be strict on expenditures for the nation, and to set an example in my personal life. I decided to sell the presidential yacht ''Sequoia'', and to minimize the playing of \u201cRuffles and Flourishes\u201d when I arrived at public meetings. I was surprised when some of these changes proved to be quite unpopular, and to learn how much the public cherished the pomp and ceremony of the presidency.\" \n\n=== Winston Churchill and the ''Sequoia'' ===\n''Sequoia'' served as refuge for presidents to relax with friends and conduct business outside of the public spotlight. As a result, no official documentary evidence exists for many events which took place aboard the yacht, and certain lore has developed, particularly regarding British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s activities aboard ''Sequoia''. This includes, but is not limited to, Churchill and Roosevelt planning [[Normandy landings|D-day]] together on the large table in ''Sequoia''{{'}}s main salon, Churchill gifting deck chairs from the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] for ''Sequoia''{{'}}s upper deck and Churchill being the impetus behind Roosevelt decommissioning the USS ''Sequoia'' so that the two leaders could drink on board \u2013 alcoholic beverages were prohibited aboard commissioned naval vessels. Despite these persistent legends, Churchill was never documented as being aboard the yacht.\n\n==Private Ownership==\n''Sequoia'' has had 7 owners since being sold by the U.S. government in 1977. Certain of the past owners sought to offset the costs of maintaining and operating the vessel by offering ''Sequoia'' for private charter, and others were non-profit groups seeking to maintain her for historical reasons and/or return her to Presidential service. \n\nIt was Thomas Malloy who purchased ''Sequoia'' from the U.S government in May 1977 for $286,000.<ref>Box 57, folder \u201cSequoia \u2013 Presidential Yacht\u201d of the Elizabeth Lumpkin Press Office Files at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/archives.html|title=Link to Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref> Three months later, Malloy resold ''Sequoia'' to a partnership led by Norman Pulliam for $355,000. Mr. Pulliam maintained ''Sequoia'' in Myrtal Beach SC and then sold her to The Ocean Learning Institute of Palm Beach, FL during March 1980 for $750,000. The institute used ''Sequoia'' to entertain potential donors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/06/17/the-sequoia-sales-home/a9de04ea-b079-4581-93ed-65524d4e06ce/|title=The Washington Post|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpg|thumb|left|Vice President George Bush and future Chinese President Shangkun Yang aboard ''Sequoia'' May 1987]][[File:Sequoia World Trade Centers 1985.jpg|thumb|right|''Sequoia'' in front of the World Trade Centers July 4, 1986]]The Presidential Yacht Trust, a non-profit organization, acquired ''Sequoia'' from the Institute for approximately $1.1 million in 1980 and brought ''Sequoia'' back to D.C for use by the President and his cabinet.

During 1984 ''Sequoia'' received a heroes welcome as she was taken on an eight-month, 6,000-mile tour of the country.   \n\nA Congressional Resolution written to assist the Trust in bringing ''Sequoia'' back into government service, passed in December 1985. ''Sequoia'' underwent a $2 million restoration in 1986 before participating in the flotilla of vessels celebrating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986. [[Vice President George H.W.

Sequoia Presidential Yacht. Centreville, MD: Tidewater Publishers, 2004.</ref>\n\nEmily Warren Roebling famously took over much of the responsibility for completing the Brooklyn Bridge after her husband, John Augustus Roebling's son and heir, was incapacitated during its construction. She later won wide acclaim for her essay, \"A Wife's Disabilities,\" in which she argued for greater women's rights and railed against discriminatory practices targeted at women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-2091932;jsessionid=F055D32E0F7AAEC1AE210C668D3466E9|title=American National Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nEmily Warren Roebling's namesake and niece, Emily Roebling Cadwalader, became the driving force behind the four exceptional yachts constructed for the Cadwaladers.

Ford used ''Sequoia'' less than Nixon. In May 1975, Ford was the first known president to host a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting aboard the vessel. Lasting four hours, the President and his cabinet discussed wide-ranging issues facing the United States, including a discussion regarding Congressional relations, confronting the issue of Vietnamese refugees, and the status of the U.S. Energy program in light of the [[1973 oil crisis]].<ref>Box C20, folder \u201cPresidential Handwriting, 5/5/1975 (3)\u201d of the Presidential Handwriting File at the Gerald R.

Carter would later recall selling the yacht as a mistake. In a conversation with broadcaster Ray Suarez, Carter said: \u201cPeople thought I was not being reverent enough to the office I was holding, that I was too much of a peanut farmer, not enough of an aristocrat, or something like that. So I think that shows that the American people want something of, an element of, image of monarchy in the White House.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/events-and-awards/forums/past-forums/transcripts/a-conversation-with-president-jimmy-carter-0|title=Link to Oral History Interview with Jimmy Carter}}</ref> In his 2015 [[autobiography]] \"''A Full Life: Reflections at 90\"'' Presidential Carter wrote of selling ''Sequoia, \"''I was determined to be strict on expenditures for the nation, and to set an example in my personal life. I decided to sell the presidential yacht ''Sequoia'', and to minimize the playing of \u201cRuffles and Flourishes\u201d when I arrived at public meetings. I was surprised when some of these changes proved to be quite unpopular, and to learn how much the public cherished the pomp and ceremony of the presidency.\" \n\n=== Winston Churchill and the ''Sequoia'' ===\n''Sequoia'' served as refuge for presidents to relax with friends and conduct business outside of the public spotlight. As a result, no official documentary evidence exists for many events which took place aboard the yacht, and certain lore has developed, particularly regarding British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]'s activities aboard ''Sequoia''. This includes, but is not limited to, Churchill and Roosevelt planning [[Normandy landings|D-day]] together on the large table in ''Sequoia''{{'}}s main salon, Churchill gifting deck chairs from the [[RMS Queen Mary|''Queen Mary'']] for ''Sequoia''{{'}}s upper deck and Churchill being the impetus behind Roosevelt decommissioning the USS ''Sequoia'' so that the two leaders could drink on board \u2013 alcoholic beverages were prohibited aboard commissioned naval vessels. Despite these persistent legends, Churchill was never documented as being aboard the yacht.\n\n==Private Ownership==\n''Sequoia'' has had 7 owners since being sold by the U.S. government in 1977. Certain of the past owners sought to offset the costs of maintaining and operating the vessel by offering ''Sequoia'' for private charter, and others were non-profit groups seeking to maintain her for historical reasons and/or return her to Presidential service. \n\nIt was Thomas Malloy who purchased ''Sequoia'' from the U.S government in May 1977 for $286,000.<ref>Box 57, folder \u201cSequoia \u2013 Presidential Yacht\u201d of the Elizabeth Lumpkin Press Office Files at the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/archives.html|title=Link to Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref> Three months later, Malloy resold ''Sequoia'' to a partnership led by Norman Pulliam for $355,000. Mr. Pulliam maintained ''Sequoia'' in Myrtal Beach SC and then sold her to The Ocean Learning Institute of Palm Beach, FL during March 1980 for $750,000. The institute used ''Sequoia'' to entertain potential donors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1981/06/17/the-sequoia-sales-home/a9de04ea-b079-4581-93ed-65524d4e06ce/|title=The Washington Post|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}</ref>  \n\n[[File:Bush and Yang 5-1987.jpg|thumb|left|Vice President George Bush and future Chinese President Shangkun Yang aboard ''Sequoia'' May 1987]][[File:Sequoia World Trade Centers 1985.jpg|thumb|right|''Sequoia'' in front of the World Trade Centers July 4, 1986]]The Presidential Yacht Trust, a non-profit organization, acquired ''Sequoia'' from the Institute for approximately $1.1 million in 1980 and brought ''Sequoia'' back to D.C for use by the President and his cabinet.

''Sequoia'' underwent a $2 million restoration in 1986 before participating in the flotilla of vessels celebrating the centennial of the Statue of Liberty on July 4, 1986. [[Vice President George H.W.

They have been awarded each year at the [[Small Press Expo]] since 1997,<ref>\"Small Press Expo Initiates First Festival Prize for Comic Books: Ignatz Award,\" ''Comics Buyer's Guide'' (Sept. 12, 1997), p. 8</ref> only skipping a year in 2001 due to the show's cancellation after the [[September 11 attacks]]. {{as of|2014}} SPX has been held in either [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]],  [[North Bethesda, Maryland|North Bethesda]], or [[Silver Spring, Maryland]].\n\nThe Ignatz Awards are named in honour of [[George Herriman]] and his strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]'', which featured a brick-throwing mouse named Ignatz.\n\n== Awards criteria ==\nAs one of the few festival awards rewarded in comics, the Ignatz Awards are voted on by attendees of the annual [[Small Press Expo]] (SPX, or The Expo, its<!--no apostrophe!--> corporate name), a weekend convention and [[tradeshow]] showcasing creator-owned comics. Nominations for the Ignatz Awards are made by a five-member jury panel consisting of comic book professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/ignatz.php|title=Ignatz Awards|last=Hahn|first=Joel|year=2006|work=Comic Book Awards Almanac|accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe jury panel remains anonymous (from both the public as well as each other) until the announcement of the awards. Jurors are prohibited from nominating their own work. However, there is no prohibition of one jury member's work being nominated for an award by his or her fellow jurors.\n\n== History ==\nThe first comics industry awards given the title \"Ignatz\" originated at the [[OrlandoCon]],<ref>[[R. C. Harvey|Harvey, R. C.]] \"\"Blood & Thunder: Two for Cho, ''The Comics Journal'' #219 (Jan. 2000), p. 3.</ref> held in Orlando, Florida, from 1974-1994. The current Ignatz Awards are not connected with OrlandoCon. The SPX Ignatz Awards were conceived in 1996 by SPX organizer Chris Oarr and cartoonist [[Ed Brubaker]]. Their original mandate, to set the Ignatz apart from \"mainstream\" awards like the [[Eisner Awards]], was that the work nominated be creator-owned, and focus more on work done by a single writer/artist.\n\nThe Award was administered by Jeff Alexander from 1998\u20132006,<ref name=MCE>McElhatton, Greg. [http://www.gregmce.com/2011/01/30/goodbye-jeff/ \"Goodbye, Jeff,\"] GregMcE.com (Jan. 30, 2011).</ref> when they were taken over by Greg McElhatton.<ref name=MCE /> During his tenure as Ignatz Award Coordinator, Alexander drew a strip for the annual award program in [[George Herriman]]'s style.<ref name=MCE /><ref>MacDonald, Heidi.
