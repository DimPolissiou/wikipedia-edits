{"title_page": "Abuse of rights", "text_new": "In [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions, '''abuse of rights''' (also known as Prohibition of Chicane) is the exercise of a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] only to cause annoyance, harm, or injury to another.

Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, <blockquote> The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality.... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\">Bakshtein, Joseph. \"A View from Moscow,\" ''Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986'', eds.

They can be difficult to classify because often they were not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit.\n\n===Lianozovo Group===\n\nThe  Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 was  named after the small village [[Lianozovo District|Lianozovo]] outside Moscow, where most of the artists lived and worked.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artathhar.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/under-the-iron-curtain-modern-art-from-the-soviet-bloc/ |title=Under the Iron Curtain: Modern Art from the Soviet Bloc |last=artathhar |date=2012-12-16 |website=Derfner Judaica Museum + The Art Collection Exhibition Catalogues |language=en |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The members of this group were: Evgenii Kropivnitsky {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, the artist and poet, Olga Potapova {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430}}, [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Lidiya Masterkova|Lidia Masterkova]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], Nikolai Vechtomov  and the poets Vsevolod Nekrasov {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, [[Genrikh Sapgir]], and [[Igor Kholin]].

Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the [[Manezh]] exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, [[Victor Tupitsyn]] points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues.<ref name=\"Tupitsyn\"/> \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the [[Bulldozer Exhibition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/30/russian-painters-traitors-exhibit-london |title=Russian painters denounced as Soviet traitors exhibit in London |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2010-11-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Sretensky Boulevard Group===\n[[File:Pered_rasvetom.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Oleg Vassiliev (painter)|Oleg Vasiliev]], Before the Sunrise, 1964'']]\nA group of artists that had studios on and around [[Sretensky Boulevard]], Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s.

The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/viktor_pivovarov_breaking_the_ice.htm |title=Viktor Pivovarov - Artist's Profile - The Saatchi Gallery |website=www.saatchigallery.com |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Conceptualists===\n\nMany of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the [[Moscow Conceptualists|Moscow Conceptualist]] school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\"/>\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"<ref>Roberts, Norma, ed.

Khrushchev got into a public and now-famous argument with [[Ernst Neizvestny]], sculptor (1925-2016), regarding the function of art in society. However, this altercation had the unintended effect of fomenting unofficial art as a movement. Artists could no longer hold delusions that the state would recognize their art, yet the climate had become friendly and open enough that a coherent organization had formed. Additionally, punishments for unofficial artists became less severe; they were denied admittance to the union instead of being executed.\n\nAs a \"movement\" nonconformist art was stylistically diverse. However, in the post-thaw era its function and role in society became clear. As the Russian curator, author and museum director Joseph Bakstein wrote, <blockquote> The duality of life in which the official perception of everyday reality is independent of the reality of the imagination leads to a situation where art plays a special role in society. In any culture, art is a special reality, but in the Soviet Union, art was doubly real precisely because it had no relation to reality. It was a higher reality.... The goal of nonconformism in art was to challenge the status of official artistic reality, to question it, to treat it with irony. Yet that was the one unacceptable thing. All of Soviet society rested on orthodoxy, and nonconformism was its enemy. That is why even the conditional and partial legalization of nonconformism in the mid-1970s was the beginning of the end of the Soviet regime.<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\">Bakshtein, Joseph. \"A View from Moscow,\" ''Nonconformist Art: The Soviet Experience 1956-1986'', eds.

They can be difficult to classify because often they were not related due to stylistic objectives, but geographical proximity. Furthermore, participation in these groups was fluid as the community of nonconformist artists in Moscow was relatively small and close-knit.\n\n===Lianozovo Group===\n\nThe  Lianozovo Group formed in 1958 was  named after the small village [[Lianozovo District|Lianozovo]] outside Moscow, where most of the artists lived and worked.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artathhar.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/under-the-iron-curtain-modern-art-from-the-soviet-bloc/ |title=Under the Iron Curtain: Modern Art from the Soviet Bloc |last=artathhar |date=2012-12-16 |website=Derfner Judaica Museum + The Art Collection Exhibition Catalogues |language=en |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref> The members of this group were: Evgenii Kropivnitsky {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041a\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, the artist and poet, Olga Potapova {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041f\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0410\u043d\u0430\u043d\u044c\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0430}}, [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Lidiya Masterkova|Lidia Masterkova]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], Nikolai Vechtomov  and the poets Vsevolod Nekrasov {{Interlanguage link multi| |ru|3=\u041d\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432, \u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447}}, [[Genrikh Sapgir]], and [[Igor Kholin]].

Artists began experimenting with abstraction, as it was the antithesis of Socialist Realism. However, the fallout from the [[Manezh]] exhibition, in 1962, caused restrictions to be enforced once again. The new restrictions could not however, curtail what the young artists had learned during the five-year interlude. Additionally, [[Victor Tupitsyn]] points out that the 1960s mark an era of \"decommunalization\" in the Soviet Union. Khrushchev worked to improve housing conditions, and a consequence of this was that artists began to get studios of their own, or shared spaces with like-minded colleagues.<ref name=\"Tupitsyn\"/> \n\nOfficially, those in the Lianozovo group were members of the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists, working in the applied and graphic arts. As such, they were not permitted to hold painting exhibitions, as that fell under the domain of the Artists' Union. Consequently, apartment exhibitions and literary salons began at this time as a means of publicly exhibiting. However, the Lianozovo group in particular was often harassed by Soviet officials as they were vigilant in pursuing public exhibitions of their work. In an attempt to circumvent the law, the Lianozovo group proposed an open-air exhibition in 1974, inviting dozens of other nonconformist artists also to exhibit. The result was the demolition of the exhibition by bulldozers and water cannons, for which reason the exhibition is still known as the [[Bulldozer Exhibition]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/nov/30/russian-painters-traitors-exhibit-london |title=Russian painters denounced as Soviet traitors exhibit in London |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |date=2010-11-30 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>\n\n===Sretensky Boulevard Group===\n[[File:Pered_rasvetom.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Oleg Vassiliev (painter)|Oleg Vasiliev]], Before the Sunrise, 1964'']]\nA group of artists that had studios on and around [[Sretensky Boulevard]], Moscow, became a loosely associated like-minded community in the late 1960s.

The artists' studios were also used as venues to show and exchange ideas about unofficial art. Like their colleagues in the Lianozovo group, the majority of visual artists who were part of the Sretensky Boulevard Group were admitted to the Moscow Union of Graphic Artists. This allowed the artists to work officially as book illustrators and graphic designers, which provided them with studio space, materials, and time to work on their own projects. Although they shared the same type of official career, the Sretensky group is not stylistically homogeneous. The name merely denotes the community that they formed as a result of working in close proximity to each other.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/viktor_pivovarov_breaking_the_ice.htm |title=Viktor Pivovarov - Artist's Profile - The Saatchi Gallery |website=www.saatchigallery.com |access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Conceptualists===\n\nMany of the artists on Sretensky Boulevard were part of the [[Moscow Conceptualists|Moscow Conceptualist]] school. This movement arose in the 1970s to describe the identity of the contemporary Russian artist in opposition to the government. As Joseph Bakstein explained, \"The creation of this nonconformist tradition was impelled by the fact that an outsider in the Soviet empire stood alone against a tremendous state machine, a great Leviathan that threatened to engulf him. To preserve one's identity in this situation, one had to create a separate value system, including a system of aesthetic values.\"<ref name=\"Bakshtein, Joseph 1995, p. 332\"/>\n\nErik Bulatov explains that conceptualist art is, \"a rebellion of man against the everyday reality of life... a picture interests me as some kind of system... opening into the space of my everyday existence.\"<ref>Roberts, Norma, ed.
