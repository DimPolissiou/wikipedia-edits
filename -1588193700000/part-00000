After Philip's assassination in 336&nbsp;BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army.

Following the conquest of [[Anatolia]], Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. He subsequently overthrew Persian King [[Darius III]] and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.{{Cref2|b}} At that point, his empire stretched from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Beas River]].\n\nAlexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|invaded India]] in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the [[Pauravas]] at the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in [[Babylon]] in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following [[Death of Alexander the Great|his death]], a [[Wars of the Diadochi|series of civil wars]] tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.\n\nAlexander's legacy includes the [[cultural diffusion]] and [[syncretism]] which his conquests engendered, such as [[Greco-Buddhism]]. He founded some [[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great|twenty cities that bore his name]], most notably [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization]], aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek speakers in central]] and [[Pontic Greeks|far eastern Anatolia]] until the [[Greek genocide]] of the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of [[Achilles]], and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures.

Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] engraved with a lion's image.<ref name=\"PA2\" /> Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was [[Zeus]]. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.<ref name=\"PA2\" />\n\nOn the day Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a [[siege]] on the city of [[Potidea]] on the peninsula of [[Chalcidice]]. That same day, Philip received news that his general [[Parmenion]] had defeated the combined [[Illyria]]n and [[Paeonian]] armies and that his horses had won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. It was also said that on this day, the [[Temple of Artemis]] in [[Ephesus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], burnt down. This led [[Hegesias of Magnesia]] to say that it had burnt down because [[Artemis]] was away, attending the birth of Alexander.<ref>{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=28}}, {{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=21}}</ref> Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}}\n\nIn his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, [[Lanike]], sister of Alexander's future general [[Cleitus the Black]]. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict [[Leonidas of Epirus|Leonidas]], a relative of his mother, and by [[Lysimachus of Acarnania]].{{sfn|Renault|2001|pp=33\u201334}} Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the [[lyre]], ride, fight, and hunt.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=186}}\n\n[[File:\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7 2014 (The Statue of Alexander the Great) - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Alexander the Great in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Greece]]]]\nWhen Alexander was ten years old, a trader from [[Thessaly]] brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen [[Attic talent|talents]]. The horse refused to be mounted, and Philip ordered it away. Alexander, however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}} Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: \"My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you\", and bought the horse for him.<ref name=\"PA6\" /> Alexander named it [[Bucephalas]], meaning \"ox-head\". Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as [[India]]. When the animal died (because of old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]].<ref>{{harvnb|Durant|1966|p=538}}, {{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|p=64}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=39}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\nWhen Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a [[tutor]], and considered such academics as [[Isocrates]] and [[Speusippus]], the latter offering to resign from his stewardship of the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose [[Aristotle]] and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at [[Mieza, Macedonia|Mieza]] as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of [[Stageira]], which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|pp=65\u201366}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=44}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=15}}</ref>\n\nMieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Hephaistion]], and [[Cassander]]. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of [[Homer]], and in particular the ''[[Iliad]]''; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.<ref>{{harvnb|Lane Fox|1980|pp=65\u201366}}, {{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=45\u201347}}, {{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=16}}</ref>\n\nDuring his youth, Alexander was also acquainted with Persian exiles at the Macedonian court, who received the protection of Philip II for several years as they opposed [[Artaxerxes III]].<ref name=\"NC\"/><ref>{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Timothy |last2=Brice |first2=Lee L. |title=Brill's Companion to Insurgency and Terrorism in the Ancient Mediterranean |date=2015 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-28473-9 |page=170 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=248DCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA170 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"EDC\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Elizabeth Donnelly |title=Women and Monarchy in Macedonia |date=2000 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=978-0-8061-3212-9 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbI2hZBy_EkC&pg=PA101 |language=en}}</ref> Among them were [[Artabazos II]] and his daughter [[Barsine]], future mistress of Alexander, who resided at the Macedonian court from 352 to 342 BC, as well as [[Amminapes]], future [[satrap]] of Alexander, or a Persian nobleman named [[Sisines]].<ref name=\"NC\">{{cite book |last1=Cawthorne |first1=Nigel |title=Alexander the Great |date=2004 |publisher=Haus Publishing |isbn=978-1-904341-56-7 |pages=42\u201343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxyz0v9T74sC&pg=PA42 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"JM\">{{cite book |last1=Morgan |first1=Janett |title=Greek Perspectives on the Achaemenid Empire: Persia Through the Looking Glass |date=2016 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-4724-8 |pages=271\u201372 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49JVDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA271 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Briant |first1=Pierre |title=Alexander the Great and His Empire: A Short Introduction |date=2012 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-15445-9 |page=114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAW6kmL30RUC&pg=PA114 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"EJ\">{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Erik |title=Barbarians in the Greek and Roman World |date=2018 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=978-1-62466-714-5 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QCRtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA92 |language=en}}</ref> This gave the Macedonian court a good knowledge of Persian issues, and may even have influenced some of the innovations in the management of the Macedonian state.<ref name=\"JM\"/>\n\n[[Suda]] writes that, also, [[Anaximenes of Lampsacus]] was one of his teachers.

Campaigning against the Greek city of [[Perinthus]], Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of [[Amphissa (city)|Amphissa]] began to work lands that were sacred to [[Apollo]] near [[Delphi]], a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in southern Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.{{sfn|Renault|2001|pp=47\u201349}}\n\nPhilip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through [[Thermopylae]], taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison.

During the ensuing [[Battle of Chaeronea (338&nbsp;BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian [[hoplites]] to follow, thus breaking their line.

This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan, and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (\"The Furthest\") in modern [[Tajikistan]].

Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Cleitus the Black]], during a violent drunken altercation at [[Maracanda]] (modern day [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]]), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgmental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.{{sfn|Gergel|2004|p=99}}\n\nLater, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal [[page (servant)|pages]].

He invited the [[tribal chief|chieftains]] of the former satrapy of [[Gandhara]] (a region presently straddling eastern [[Afghanistan]] and northern [[Pakistan]]), to come to him and submit to his authority. [[Omphis]] (Indian name [[Ambhi]]), the ruler of [[Taxila]], whose kingdom extended from the [[Indus]] to the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes (Jhelum)]], complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the [[Aspasioi]] and [[Assakenoi]] sections of the [[Kambojas]] (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.{{sfn|Tripathi|1999|pp=118\u201321}} [[Ambhi]] hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1,000 talents in gold\". Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at [[Hund, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Hund]],<ref>Lane Fox 1973</ref> supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.\n\nOn the subsequent advance of the [[Macedon]]ian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5,000 men and took part in the [[battle of the Hydaspes River]]. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of [[Porus]] (Indian name Puru), to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]], son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC.\n\nIn the winter of 327/326&nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.<ref>{{harvnb|Narain|1965|pp=155\u201365}}</ref> A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost.

By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persians' [[scimitars]] and [[javelins]]. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}}\n\nAt Issus in 333&nbsp;BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}} Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.{{sfn|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=193}} At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes.

The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.{{sfn|Morkot|1996|p=122}}\n\nWhen faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style.

He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented [[military campaign]] through [[western Asia]] and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty, he had created one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] of the ancient world, stretching from [[Greece]] to northwestern [[Historical India|India]].<ref>Bloom, Jonathan M.; Blair, Sheila S.

After Philip's assassination in 336&nbsp;BC, he succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. Alexander was awarded the [[League of Corinth|generalship of Greece]] and used this authority to launch his father's pan-Hellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of [[Persia]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Heckel|editor1-first=Waldemar|editor2-last=Tritle|editor2-first=Lawrence A.|title=Alexander the Great: A New History|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3082-0|page=99|chapter=The Corinthian League}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Burger|first1=Michael|title=The Shaping of Western Civilization: From Antiquity to the Enlightenment|date=2008|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-432-3|page=76}}</ref> In 334 BC, he invaded the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (Persian Empire) and began a [[Wars of Alexander the Great|series of campaigns]] that lasted 10 years. Following the conquest of [[Anatolia]], Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. He subsequently overthrew Persian King [[Darius III]] and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety.{{Cref2|b}} At that point, his empire stretched from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Beas River]].\n\nAlexander endeavoured to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\" and [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|invaded India]] in 326 BC, winning an important victory over the [[Pauravas]] at the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]. He eventually turned back at the demand of his homesick troops, dying in [[Babylon]] in 323 BC, the city that he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following [[Death of Alexander the Great|his death]], a [[Wars of the Diadochi|series of civil wars]] tore his empire apart, resulting in the establishment of several states ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.\n\nAlexander's legacy includes the [[cultural diffusion]] and [[syncretism]] which his conquests engendered, such as [[Greco-Buddhism]]. He founded some [[List of cities founded by Alexander the Great|twenty cities that bore his name]], most notably [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization]], aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the mid-15th century AD and the presence of [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek speakers in central]] and [[Pontic Greeks|far eastern Anatolia]] until the [[Greek genocide]] of the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mould of [[Achilles]], and he features prominently in the history and mythic traditions of both Greek and non-Greek cultures. He was undefeated in battle and became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves.

Sometime after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] engraved with a lion's image.<ref name=\"PA2\" /> Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was [[Zeus]].

This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan, and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (\"The Furthest\") in modern [[Tajikistan]]. The campaign took Alexander through [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] (West Afghanistan), [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]] (South and Central Afghanistan), [[Bactria]] (North and Central Afghanistan), and [[Scythia]].{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc=III, 23\u201325, 27\u201330; IV, 1\u20137}}\n\nIn 329 BC, [[Spitamenes]], who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, betrayed Bessus to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc= III, 30}} However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt.

After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of [[Porus]] (Indian name Puru), to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]], son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC.\n\nIn the winter of 327/326&nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.<ref>{{harvnb|Narain|1965|pp=155\u201365}}</ref> A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost.

It served the [[Tidewater region]], including [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Newport News]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Virginia Beach]].   It began as one of only a handful of American radio stations broadcasting full time to the [[African American]] community, featuring [[R&B]], [[soul music]] and [[urban contemporary gospel|black gospel]], along with news and talk programs.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years on AM 1050===\nWRAP premiered in September 1952.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1953/Radio%20N%20Ter%20BC%20YB%201953.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 303]</ref> It joined a select few radio stations across the country that aimed to reach black audiences, including [[WDIA]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], founded in 1948, [[WVON]] in [[Chicago]] and [[WERD (defunct)|WERD]] in [[Atlanta]], the first radio station to be owned by an African American. \u201c[[Negro]]-oriented\u201d radio stations, which later became known as black-oriented stations, featured mostly black [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and targeted African American audiences with recordings by black artists and advertising aimed at black consumers.<ref>William Barlow, Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998)</ref>\n\nThe station began on [[AM 1050]] and was a [[daytimer]].  It broadcast at only 500 [[watt]]s by day and had to [[sign-off]] at night to avoid interfering with [[clear-channel]] station [[XEG-AM|XEG]] in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]].  Nearly all broadcast properties in that era, even black-oriented radio stations, were [[White people|white]]-owned, including WRAP.<ref>Juan Gonzalez and Joseph Torres, News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media (New York: Verso Books, 2011), 328 </ref> WRAP was a subsidiary of Rollins Broadcasting, owned by local businessmen John W. Rollins, who served as president, and O. Wayne Rollins, the vice president.  It would be several decades before the [[Federal Communications Commission]] issued rules that encouraged minorities to own and operate broadcasting outlets.\n\nThe owners chose the [[call sign]] W'''RAP'''.  \"Rap\" is an [[African-American English]] word for \"talk\" or \"discussion.\"  (It would take until the 1980s before \"[[rap]]\" would refer to a musical style.)  As early as 1953, a newspaper article described WRAP as \u201cthe only station in the Tidewater area of Virginia which beams its programs exclusively to a [[Negro]] audience.\u201d<ref>{{cite news | title = WRAP Tabs New General Manager | newspaper = Pittsburgh Courier | date = July 4, 1953 | page = 5}}</ref>   An early station slogan that appeared in newspaper [[advertisements]] declared that the station played the \u201cMusic That Belongs to America.\u201d<ref>{{citation | title = WRAP advertisement | newspaper = [[New Journal and Guide]] | date = June 12, 1954 | page = D30}}</ref>\n\n===Move to AM 850===\nIn 1957, WRAP moved to [[AM 850]].<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1957/Radio-NE-Ter-1957-BC-YB.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 268]</ref>  The change in frequency allowed it to broadcast around the clock with more power, 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night.  An advertisement in the 1957 edition of ''[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting Yearbook]]'', using the descriptions of the era, said \"Survey figures show the most Negroes in the Norfolk area listen most to WRAP.\" It added that WRAP, at 850 [[kilocycle]]s, was \"the only all-Negro station in Norfolk.\"  \n\nIn December 1978, five African American WRAP DJs joined together and asked the station\u2019s white management for raises.  They were summarily fired.  One of the DJs, Randy Williams, managed to issue an on-air \u201cstatement of solidarity\u201d in protest of the firings before he was forced to leave the station.  The next month, \u201cThe WRAP Fired Five\u201d organized a public rally to protest WRAP.

It served the [[Tidewater region]], including [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Newport News]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] and [[Virginia Beach]].   It began as one of only a handful of American radio stations broadcasting full time to the [[African American]] community, featuring [[R&B]], [[soul music]] and [[urban contemporary gospel|black gospel]], along with news and talk programs.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years on AM 1050===\nWRAP premiered in September 1952.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1953/Radio%20N%20Ter%20BC%20YB%201953.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1953 page 303]</ref> It joined a select few radio stations across the country that aimed to reach black audiences, including [[WDIA]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], founded in 1948, [[WVON]] in [[Chicago]] and [[WERD (defunct)|WERD]] in [[Atlanta]], the first radio station to be owned by an African American. \u201c[[Negro]]-oriented\u201d radio stations, which later became known as black-oriented stations, featured mostly black [[disc jockey|DJ]]s and targeted African American audiences with recordings by black artists and advertising aimed at black consumers.<ref>William Barlow, Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998)</ref>\n\nThe station began on [[AM 1050]] and was a [[daytimer]].  It broadcast at only 500 [[watt]]s by day and had to [[sign-off]] at night to avoid interfering with [[clear-channel]] station [[XEG-AM|XEG]] in [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico]].  Nearly all broadcast properties in that era, even black-oriented radio stations, were [[White people|white]]-owned, including WRAP.<ref>Juan Gonzalez and Joseph Torres, News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media (New York: Verso Books, 2011), 328 </ref> WRAP was a subsidiary of Rollins Broadcasting, owned by local businessmen John W. Rollins, who served as president, and O. Wayne Rollins, the vice president.  It would be several decades before the [[Federal Communications Commission]] issued rules that encouraged minorities to own and operate broadcasting outlets.\n\nThe owners chose the [[call sign]] W'''RAP'''.  \"Rap\" is an [[African-American English]] word for \"talk\" or \"discussion.\"  (It would take until the 1980s before \"[[rap]]\" would refer to a musical style.)  As early as 1953, a newspaper article described WRAP as \u201cthe only station in the Tidewater area of Virginia which beams its programs exclusively to a [[Negro]] audience.\u201d<ref>{{cite news | title = WRAP Tabs New General Manager | newspaper = Pittsburgh Courier | date = July 4, 1953 | page = 5}}</ref>   An early station slogan that appeared in newspaper [[advertisements]] declared that the station played the \u201cMusic That Belongs to America.\u201d<ref>{{citation | title = WRAP advertisement | newspaper = [[New Journal and Guide]] | date = June 12, 1954 | page = D30}}</ref>\n\n===Move to AM 850===\nIn 1957, WRAP moved to [[AM 850]].<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1957/Radio-NE-Ter-1957-BC-YB.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 268]</ref>  The change in frequency allowed it to broadcast around the clock with more power, 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night.  An advertisement in the 1957 edition of ''[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting Yearbook]]'', using the descriptions of the era, said \"Survey figures show the most Negroes in the Norfolk area listen most to WRAP.\" It added that WRAP, at 850 [[kilocycle]]s, was \"the only all-Negro station in Norfolk.\"  \n\nIn December 1978, five African American WRAP DJs joined together and asked the station\u2019s white management for raises.  They were summarily fired.  One of the DJs, Randy Williams, managed to issue an on-air \u201cstatement of solidarity\u201d in protest of the firings before he was forced to leave the station.  The next month, \u201cThe WRAP Fired Five\u201d organized a public rally to protest WRAP.

He is also one of the co-founders and a board adviser of the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR), as well as a  color commentator on events for the PBR's elite tour, the [[Unleash the Beast Series]] (UTB).\n\n==Early life==\nMurray was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to Joy and Harold \"Butch\" Murray. He has two sisters, Kim and Kerri. Murray's father, who is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, is a former rodeo hand who owned a business in which he operated starter equipment at horse racing venues all over the United States. Ty Murray's mother was a young rider in the [[National Little Britches Rodeo Association]] and won first place in the national Little Britches Rodeo Bull Riding competition. As a child Murray was taught rodeo fundamentals by his father and mother. Later he was mentored by then world champion bull rider and all-around cowboy, [[Larry Mahan]], who had won more [[National Finals Rodeo]] (NFR) first place \"All Around Cowboy\" championships than anyone in history. At the age of 9, Ty Murray was asked by his school teacher to write a paper on what he wanted to be when he grew up. His entire essay was as follows: \"I want to break Larry Mahan's record\".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Career==\nMurray competed in the [[Arizona High School Rodeo Association]] where he was the All-Around Champion Cowboy and led Arizona to its first [[National High School Rodeo Association]] Championship in 1987. He was also the National All-Around Champion that year, competing all the rough-stock events as well as cutting. He went to [[Odessa College]] where he competed in rodeo for the school. When he turned 18, he joined the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA). Murray became the youngest PRCA World All-Around Cowboy, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]''.\n\nMurray won the [[List of World All-Around Rodeo Champions|World All-Around Champion]] title seven times (1989\u20131994, 1998),<ref name=\"prorodeo\">{{Cite web|url=http://prorodeo.com/prorodeo/cowboys/world-champions-historical/|title=PRCA World Champions (Historical)|website=prorodeo.com|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> being the top money-earner in [[Bareback riding|bareback]], [[Saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding|saddle bronc]], and [[bull riding]] events for those years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/resources/pdfs/2012/05NFR377-406.pdf|title=Wrangler NFR Records and History|website=www.prorodeo.com|publisher=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> Additionally, Murray won the PRCA World Bull Riding Championship title in 1993 and 1998.<ref name=\"prorodeo\" />  In 1994, Murray broke Mahan's and Ferguson's record of six titles and tied Ferguson's record of having won six titles consecutively.

He was out of rodeo for a year. During that time he bought a 2,400+ acre (8&nbsp;km\u00b2) ranch in [[Stephenville, Texas]]. In 1996, six weeks after his return to rodeo, he damaged his shoulder during the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR) [[Bud Light Cup Series|Bud Light Cup Series']] George Paul Memorial bull riding event in [[Del Rio, Texas]]. Surgery laid him off for another year, costing him a major sponsor. His comeback in 1997 was astonishing &mdash; then he broke his shoulder at the PBR Bud Light Cup Series event in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], laying him off for another year. After a total of three years off, Murray came back in 1998 to win the PRCA World All-Around Championship for the record seventh time, as well as his second PRCA World Champion Bull Rider title. He also qualified for the PBR Finals in 1998 and finished 20th in the PBR world standings that year.\n\nMurray joined the PBR full-time in 2000 (after dividing his time between the PBR and PRCA in the years prior). He qualified for the PBR World Finals from 1994\u201396 and 1998-2002, but did not compete at the finals in 1995, 1996, and 2002 due to injuries.\n\nMurray was the Reserve World Bull Riding Champion in the PBR from 1999 to 2001. In April 2002, after a neck injury during the PBR's Bud Light Cup Series event in [[Billings, Montana]], Murray officially retired from bull riding, and rodeo competition altogether.

He is an inductee of the [[ProRodeo Hall of Fame]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], in the all-around category. He is also one of the co-founders and a board adviser of the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR), as well as a  color commentator on events for the PBR's elite tour, the [[Unleash the Beast Series]] (UTB).\n\n==Early life==\nMurray was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to Joy and Harold \"Butch\" Murray. He has two sisters, Kim and Kerri. Murray's father, who is of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, is a former rodeo hand who owned a business in which he operated starter equipment at horse racing venues all over the United States. Ty Murray's mother was a young rider in the [[National Little Britches Rodeo Association]] and won first place in the national Little Britches Rodeo Bull Riding competition. As a child Murray was taught rodeo fundamentals by his father and mother. Later he was mentored by then world champion bull rider and all-around cowboy, [[Larry Mahan]], who had won more [[National Finals Rodeo]] (NFR) first place \"All Around Cowboy\" championships than anyone in history. At the age of 9, Ty Murray was asked by his school teacher to write a paper on what he wanted to be when he grew up. His entire essay was as follows: \"I want to break Larry Mahan's record\".{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Career==\nMurray competed in the [[Arizona High School Rodeo Association]] where he was the All-Around Champion Cowboy and led Arizona to its first [[National High School Rodeo Association]] Championship in 1987. He was also the National All-Around Champion that year, competing all the rough-stock events as well as cutting. He went to [[Odessa College]] where he competed in rodeo for the school. When he turned 18, he joined the [[Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association]] (PRCA). Murray became the youngest PRCA World All-Around Cowboy, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]''.\n\nMurray won the [[List of World All-Around Rodeo Champions|World All-Around Champion]] title seven times (1989\u20131994, 1998),<ref name=\"prorodeo\">{{Cite web|url=http://prorodeo.com/prorodeo/cowboys/world-champions-historical/|title=PRCA World Champions (Historical)|website=prorodeo.com|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> being the top money-earner in [[Bareback riding|bareback]], [[Saddle bronc and bareback bronc riding|saddle bronc]], and [[bull riding]] events for those years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prorodeo.com/resources/pdfs/2012/05NFR377-406.pdf|title=Wrangler NFR Records and History|website=www.prorodeo.com|publisher=Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association|access-date=30 May 2017}}</ref> Additionally, Murray won the PRCA World Bull Riding Championship title in 1993 and 1998.<ref name=\"prorodeo\" />  In 1994, Murray broke Mahan's and Ferguson's record of six titles and tied Ferguson's record of having won six titles consecutively. In 1998, Murray won his seventh title, surpassing the record for all-around titles.<ref name=\"prorodeo\" /> That's when they started calling Murray \"King of the Cowboys.\"<ref name=\"Brazile\" /> In 2010, [[Trevor Brazile]] won his eighth all-around title, surpassing them all.

He was out of rodeo for a year. During that time he bought a 2,400+ acre (8&nbsp;km\u00b2) ranch in [[Stephenville, Texas]]. In 1996, six weeks after his return to rodeo, he damaged his shoulder during the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR) [[Bud Light Cup Series|Bud Light Cup Series']] George Paul Memorial bull riding event in [[Del Rio, Texas]]. Surgery laid him off for another year, costing him a major sponsor. His comeback in 1997 was astonishing &mdash; then he broke his shoulder at the PBR Bud Light Cup Series event in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], laying him off for another year. After a total of three years off, Murray came back in 1998 to win the PRCA World All-Around Championship for the record seventh time, as well as his second PRCA World Champion Bull Rider title. He also qualified for the PBR Finals in 1998 and finished 20th in the PBR world standings that year.\n\nMurray joined the PBR full-time in 2000 (after dividing his time between the PBR and PRCA in the years prior). He qualified for the PBR World Finals from 1994\u201396 and 1998-2002, but did not compete at the finals in 1995, 1996, and 2002 due to injuries.\n\nMurray was the Reserve World Bull Riding Champion in the PBR from 1999 to 2001. In April 2002, after a neck injury during the PBR's Bud Light Cup Series event in [[Billings, Montana]], Murray officially retired from bull riding, and rodeo competition altogether. At the 2002 PBR World Finals, Murray was inducted into the PBR's Heroes & Legends Celebration: Ring of Honor.<ref name=\"heroes\">{{Cite web|url=http://cms.pbr.com/en/riders/heroes-and-legends/ring-of-honor/2002/ty-murray.aspx|title=Heroes & Legends Celebration - Ring of Honor - Ty Murray|website=Professional Bull Riders|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nMurray was featured in the Miller Lite \"[[Man Laws]]\" series of commercials.<ref>{{cite web|title=Man Law|url=http://www.manlaws.com|website=Man Law|accessdate=18 May 2017}}</ref> He is a frequent announcer on televised PBR Bull Riding events.

In 1835, he enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], where he studied with [[Johann Ender]] and [[Leopold Kupelwieser]],<ref name=\"M\">[http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC16920/16992.htm Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikonban]: Brief biography.</ref> who taught the history of [[aesthetics]]. Under their influence, he rejected the prevailing [[Academic art|Academicism]] and embraced [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. During his studies, he also worked as a [[lithographer]] and gave art lessons. After holding a successful exhibition, he became popular as a portrait painter and was able to stay in Vienna until the end of the 1830s, working in both urban and rural areas.\n\nIn 1840, as the vogue for portraits waned in Vienna, he moved to Munich<ref name=\"M\" /> in hopes of continuing his career. He had no better luck there and turned to producing scenes from Hungarian history, such as the death of [[John Hunyadi]]. This change of subject matter proved to be a success and he was soon established as a popular history painter.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1847, he took a trip through Italy, where he produced numerous rural landscapes and [[Genre art|genre]] works of peasant life.<ref name=\"M\" /> On his way back to Munich, however, he was struck by homesickness and returned to Pest where he once again set himself up as a portraitist, although it was not especially profitable. He also created landscapes and [[cityscape]]s in addition to more history paintings; some on Biblical themes. When short on commissions, he supported himself as he had in Vienna, producing lithographs for local magazines and giving art lessons.\n\nThe [[Hungarian National Gallery]] preserves several paintings and drawings of this famous master of the [[Biedermeier]] painting.<ref>https://en.mng.hu/artworks/?artwork_author=weber-henrik</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"145\">\nFile:Weber Henrik Weber csal\u00e1d.jpg|''The Weber Family'' (1846)\nFile:Henrik Weber - Romantic Scene - WGA25504.jpg|''Romantic Scene'' (1851)\nFile:Weber Henrik Hung\u00e1ria.jpg|''Hungaria'' (1840s)\nFile:Tyroler Batthyany kormany.jpg|''The [[Batthy\u00e1ny]] Family'' (1840s)\nFile:Henrik Weber - King Solomon in the Prison - WGA25505.jpg|''The [[King Solomon]] in Prison'' (1847)\nFile:Weber Pesti polg\u00e1r.jpg|''Burgher of Pest'' (1840s)\nFile:Weber henrik-mosonyi mihaly.jpg|''The Composer [[Mih\u00e1ly Mosonyi]] and his Wife'' (1840)\nFile:Weber Henrik Magyarorsz\u00e1gi n\u00e9pviseletek.jpg|''Hungarian folk costumes'' (1855)\nFile:Weber Neapolitan Woman.jpg|''Neapolitan Woman'' (1840s)\nFile:Weber Woman adorned with lace.jpg|''Woman Adorned with Lace'' (1863)\nFile:Weber Greek Woman c. 1844.jpg|''Greek Woman'' (1844)\n</gallery>\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\u201c''[[Istvan Ferenczy]], [[Henrik Weber]], [[K\u00e1roly_Mark\u00f3_the_Younger|Karoly Marko]] and [[Miklos Izso]] left us emblematic representations of the 19th century image of the nation.

In 1835, he enrolled at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna]], where he studied with [[Johann Ender]] and [[Leopold Kupelwieser]],<ref name=\"M\">[http://mek.oszk.hu/00300/00355/html/ABC16920/16992.htm Magyar \u00c9letrajzi Lexikonban]: Brief biography.</ref> who taught the history of [[aesthetics]]. Under their influence, he rejected the prevailing [[Academic art|Academicism]] and embraced [[Realism (art)|Realism]]. During his studies, he also worked as a [[lithographer]] and gave art lessons. After holding a successful exhibition, he became popular as a portrait painter and was able to stay in Vienna until the end of the 1830s, working in both urban and rural areas.\n\nIn 1840, as the vogue for portraits waned in Vienna, he moved to Munich<ref name=\"M\" /> in hopes of continuing his career. He had no better luck there and turned to producing scenes from Hungarian history, such as the death of [[John Hunyadi]]. This change of subject matter proved to be a success and he was soon established as a popular history painter.\n\nFrom 1845 to 1847, he took a trip through Italy, where he produced numerous rural landscapes and [[Genre art|genre]] works of peasant life.<ref name=\"M\" /> On his way back to Munich, however, he was struck by homesickness and returned to Pest where he once again set himself up as a portraitist, although it was not especially profitable. He also created landscapes and [[cityscape]]s in addition to more history paintings; some on Biblical themes. When short on commissions, he supported himself as he had in Vienna, producing lithographs for local magazines and giving art lessons.\n\nThe [[Hungarian National Gallery]] preserves several paintings and drawings of this famous master of the [[Biedermeier]] painting.<ref>https://en.mng.hu/artworks/?artwork_author=weber-henrik</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"145\">\nFile:Weber Henrik Weber csal\u00e1d.jpg|''The Weber Family'' (1846)\nFile:Henrik Weber - Romantic Scene - WGA25504.jpg|''Romantic Scene'' (1851)\nFile:Weber Henrik Hung\u00e1ria.jpg|''Hungaria'' (1840s)\nFile:Tyroler Batthyany kormany.jpg|''The [[Batthy\u00e1ny]] Family'' (1840s)\nFile:Henrik Weber - King Solomon in the Prison - WGA25505.jpg|''The [[King Solomon]] in Prison'' (1847)\nFile:Weber Pesti polg\u00e1r.jpg|''Burgher of Pest'' (1840s)\nFile:Weber henrik-mosonyi mihaly.jpg|''The Composer [[Mih\u00e1ly Mosonyi]] and his Wife'' (1840)\nFile:Weber Henrik Magyarorsz\u00e1gi n\u00e9pviseletek.jpg|''Hungarian folk costumes'' (1855)\nFile:Weber Neapolitan Woman.jpg|''Neapolitan Woman'' (1840s)\nFile:Weber Woman adorned with lace.jpg|''Woman Adorned with Lace'' (1863)\nFile:Weber Greek Woman c. 1844.jpg|''Greek Woman'' (1844)\n</gallery>\n\n== Citations ==\n\n\u201c''[[Istvan Ferenczy]], [[Henrik Weber]], [[K\u00e1roly_Mark\u00f3_the_Younger|Karoly Marko]] and [[Miklos Izso]] left us emblematic representations of the 19th century image of the nation.

Skipping the teams both times she finished tenth at the [[2006 World Junior Curling Championships|2006 Jeonju, Korea Worlds]] and seventh at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships|2008 \u00d6stersund, Sweden Worlds]].\n\nRoth's senior career began in 2009 as the [[Third (curling)|third]] for [[Erika Brown|Erika Brown's]] team.

There they lost in a tiebreaker match, settling for fifth place.  In her last season as a member of the Brown rink, the team would finish in fourth place at [[2011 United States Women's Curling Championship|2011 Nationals]]. On the [[World Curling Tour]], the Roth rink played in three [[Grand Slam (curling)|Grand Slam]] events making it as far as the quarterfinals at the [[2010 Sobeys Slam]].\n\nIn 2011, Roth joined the [[Patti Lank]] rink as third. They finished in eighth place at the [[2012 United States Women's Curling Championship]]. They played in just one Grand Slam that season, the [[2011 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic]], failing to qualify. Elsewhere on the tour, the team won the [[St. Paul Cash Spiel]].

The team would win the [[2014 United States Women's Curling Championship]], but did not have enough tour points to represent the United States at that years' World Championship. The following season, [[Jamie Sinclair]] was added as the team's third, Hamilton moved to play second, and [[Tara Peterson]] was added at lead position. The team had less success at the [[2015 United States Women's Curling Championship]], just missing the playoffs with a 4\u20135 record. On the tour, the team played in two slams but missed the playoffs in both.\n\nIn 2015 Roth formed a new team consisting of [[Monica Walker]], [[Aileen Sormunen]] and [[Vicky Persinger]].

On the tour that season they won the [[Canad Inns Women's Classic]] and played in two slams, making it as far as the quarterfinals at the [[2018 Players' Championship]].\n\nTeam Roth attempted to defend their title at the [[2019 United States Women's Curling Championship]], but lost out to Team Sinclair in the final.

She would compete in five more Junior Nationals, winning the title in 2006 and 2008. As a member of the Junior Championship team she qualified for two [[World Junior Curling Championships]]. Skipping the teams both times she finished tenth at the [[2006 World Junior Curling Championships|2006 Jeonju, Korea Worlds]] and seventh at the [[2008 World Junior Curling Championships|2008 \u00d6stersund, Sweden Worlds]].\n\nRoth's senior career began in 2009 as the [[Third (curling)|third]] for [[Erika Brown|Erika Brown's]] team. They qualified for the [[2010 United States Olympic Curling Trials|2009 US Nationals]] where they placed fourth.\n\nRoth returned to the [[United States Curling Women's Championships|United States Nationals]] in March 2010 where Team Brown won the [[2010 United States Women's Curling Championship|National Championship]] earning the right to compete as Team USA at the [[2010 Ford World Women's Curling Championship|2010 Swift Current World Championships]]. There they lost in a tiebreaker match, settling for fifth place.  In her last season as a member of the Brown rink, the team would finish in fourth place at [[2011 United States Women's Curling Championship|2011 Nationals]]. On the [[World Curling Tour]], the Roth rink played in three [[Grand Slam (curling)|Grand Slam]] events making it as far as the quarterfinals at the [[2010 Sobeys Slam]].\n\nIn 2011, Roth joined the [[Patti Lank]] rink as third. They finished in eighth place at the [[2012 United States Women's Curling Championship]]. They played in just one Grand Slam that season, the [[2011 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic]], failing to qualify. Elsewhere on the tour, the team won the [[St. Paul Cash Spiel]]. The next season, Roth moved to play [[second (curling)|second]] on the team. The team played in the [[2013 United States Women's Curling Championship]] and finished in fifth place after losing in a tiebreaker. Also that season, the team defended their title at the St. Paul Cash Spiel.\n\nAt the start of the [[2013\u201314 curling season]], Roth joined [[Becca Hamilton]]'s rink as their skip and Hamilton throwing third stones. The team would win the [[2014 United States Women's Curling Championship]], but did not have enough tour points to represent the United States at that years' World Championship. The following season, [[Jamie Sinclair]] was added as the team's third, Hamilton moved to play second, and [[Tara Peterson]] was added at lead position. The team had less success at the [[2015 United States Women's Curling Championship]], just missing the playoffs with a 4\u20135 record. On the tour, the team played in two slams but missed the playoffs in both.\n\nIn 2015 Roth formed a new team consisting of [[Monica Walker]], [[Aileen Sormunen]] and [[Vicky Persinger]]. The team made it to the finals of the [[2016 United States Women's Curling Championship]], where they lost to Roth's former skip, Erika Brown. The next season, Becca Hamilton came back to the team to play lead, Geving was moved to second and [[Tabitha Peterson]] was added to play third. The team lost in the finals at the 2017 Nationals to Jamie Sinclair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.curlingzone.com/event.php?view=Team&eventid=4590&teamid=107463&profileid=7877#1|title=Roth runner-up at 2017 USA Women's National Curling Championship|last=|first=|date=|website=CurlingZone|url-status=live|access-date=Apr 28, 2020}}</ref> However, they had enough points on the tour to represent the United States at the [[2017 World Women's Curling Championship]]. There they just missed the playoffs, finishing with a 6\u20135 record. On the tour they won one event, the [[Molson Cash Spiel]]. That season the team also represented the United States at the [[2017 Americas Challenge]], where they easily beat Brazil to qualify the U.S. for the 2017 Worlds.\n\nThe team would get the best of Sinclair at the [[2017 United States Olympic Curling Trials]], where they defeated the Sinclair rink in the final, winning the right to represent the United States at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]]. There Roth led the United States to a 4\u20135 record, missing the playoffs. Because they played in the Olympics, Team Roth opted to skip the 2018 US Nationals. On the tour that season they won the [[Canad Inns Women's Classic]] and played in two slams, making it as far as the quarterfinals at the [[2018 Players' Championship]].\n\nTeam Roth attempted to defend their title at the [[2019 United States Women's Curling Championship]], but lost out to Team Sinclair in the final. They had better luck on the Grand Slam tour, making it to the semifinals of the [[2018 Tour Challenge]] and the [[2019 Canadian Open (curling)|2019 Canadian Open]].

They also won their following event, the 2019 [[WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup]], defeating [[Kim Eun-jung (curler)|Kim Eun-jung]] in the final. Roth missed most of the season while on maternity leave, with Tabitha Peterson skipping the team. During the 2020 off-season the team announced that Peterson would remain as skip when Roth returned from maternity leave. Roth will re-join the team as vice-skip at third, with Hamilton moving to second, Tara Peterson to lead, and Geving to alternate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Curling/Features/2020/April/27/Team-Peterson-Announced?fbclid=IwAR05mZc31IcjNebv3TzGwkcZG0PgHz2Ln3mzWtuhLBue3twyv7scHQBWqss|title=Team Peterson Announced|last=|first=|date=Apr 27, 2020|website=USA Curling|url-status=live|access-date=Apr 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nRoth earned a nursing degree from [[Edgewood College]] and works as a registered nurse.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/espnw/life-style/article/22373366/part-nurse-full-olympic-curler-nina-roth-hopes-help-us-win-first-olympic-medal|title=Part-time nurse and full-time Olympic curler, Nina Roth hopes to help the U.S. win its first Olympic medal|last=Carpenter|first=Kevin|date=Feb 8, 2018|website=ESPN|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=Apr 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wkow.com/2018/06/07/more-than-an-olympian-nina-roths-passion-for-nursing/|title=\"More than an Olympian\" - Nina Roth's passion for nursing|last=|first=|date=Jun 7, 2018|website=WKOW|language=en-US|url-status=live|access-date=Apr 28, 2020}}</ref> She married Tony Roth in 2014 and they have one child.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archivepyc.nbcolympics.com/news/qa-nina-roth|title=Q&A with Nina Roth|last=|first=|date=Oct 20, 2017|website=NBC Olympics|url-status=live|access-date=Apr 28, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/TeamPetersonUSA/posts/2453772401604513?__tn__=-R|title=Team Peterson|last=|first=|date=Feb 8, 2020|website=Facebook|url-status=live|access-date=Apr 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Teams ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\"\n|-\n!width=\"60\"|Season!!Skip!!Third!!Second!!Lead!!Alternate<br>''<small>Coach</small>''!!Events\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\"| '''Women's curling'''\n|-\n| 2003\u201304<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/events/2004JrNationals/tmpg/wisw1.html|title=Team Wisconsin 1|last=|first=|date=|website=2004 USA Curling Junior National Championships|url-status=live|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>||'''Nina Spatola''' || Kayla Kaschinske || Katie Bland || Andrea Cooper || <br><small>''[[Steve Brown (curler)|Steve Brown]]''</small> || 2004 [[United States Junior Curling Championships|USJCC]] (7th)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/events/2004JrNationals/scores/standings2.html|title=Standings|last=|first=|date=|website=2004 USA Curling Junior National Championships|url-status=live|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2004\u201305<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/events/2005_Juniors/qualifiers.html|title=Junior Women's National Championship qualifiers|last=|first=|date=|website=2005 USA Curling Junior National Championships|url-status=live|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>||'''Nina Spatola''' || Jordan Moulton || Erin Schaefer || Andrea Mueller || <br><small>''Jim Dexter''</small> || 2005 USJCC (SF)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usacurl.org/events/2005_Juniors/releasesemis.html|title=Gold medal opponents set at USA Curling Jr. Nationals|last=|first=|date=2005-02-03|website=2005 USA Curling Junior National Championships|url-status=live|access-date=2020-02-06}}</ref>\n|-\n| 2005\u201306 ||'''Nina Spatola''' || Megan O'Connell || Jaclyn Mueller || Jordan Moulton || Molly Bonner || 2006 USJCC {{Gold1}}<br>{{WJCC|2006|2006 WJCC}} (10th)\n|-\n| 2006\u201307 ||'''Nina Spatola''' || Amanda McLean || Kayla Kaschinske || Megan Pond || || 2007 USJCC {{Bronze3}}\n|-\n| 2007\u201308 ||'''Nina Spatola''' || [[Becca Hamilton]] || Anna Plys || [[Jenna Haag]] || || 2008 USJCC {{Gold1}}<br>{{WJCC|2008|2008 WJCC}} (8th)\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2008\u201309 ||'''Nina Spatola''' || Molly Bonner || [[Becca Hamilton]] || Anna Plys || <br><small>''[[Lisa Schoeneberg]]''</small> || 2009 USJCC {{Silver2}}\n|-\n|| [[Erika Brown]] || '''Nina Spatola''' || Nina Reiniger || Laura Hallisey || || [[2009 United States Olympic Curling Trials|2009 USOCT]] (4th)\n|-\n| 2009\u201310 ||[[Erika Brown]] || '''Nina Spatola''' || [[Ann Swisshelm]] || Laura Hallisey || [[Jessica Schultz]]*<br><small>*for WWCC</small>|| [[2010 United States Women's Curling Championship|2010 USWCC]] {{Gold1}}<br>{{WWCC|2010|2010 WWCC}} (5th)\n|-\n| 2010\u201311 ||[[Erika Brown]] || '''Nina Spatola''' || [[Ann Swisshelm]] || Laura Hallisey || [[Debbie McCormick]] || [[2011 United States Women's Curling Championship|2011 USWCC]] (4th)<br>[[2011 Continental Cup of Curling|2011 Cont.
