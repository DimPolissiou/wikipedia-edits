although it has no in-built features to modify the SWF file at runtime. It can execute software written in the [[ActionScript]] programming language which enables the runtime manipulation of text, data, [[vector graphics]], [[raster graphics]], [[sound]] and [[video]]. The player can also access certain connected hardware devices, including the [[web camera]]s and [[microphone]]s, after permission for the same has been granted by the user.\n\nFlash Player is used internally by the [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] (AIR), to provide a cross-platform runtime environment for [[desktop applications]] and mobile applications. AIR supports installable applications on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and some mobile operating systems such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Flash applications must specifically be built for the AIR runtime to use additional features provided, such as file system integration, native client extensions, native window/screen integration, taskbar/dock integration, and hardware integration with connected [[Accelerometer]] and [[GPS]] devices.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/products/air.html AIR 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821051943/http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html |date=August 21, 2014 }}, Adobe</ref>\n\n===Data formats===\nFlash Player includes native support for many [[File format|data formats]], some of which can only be accessed through the [[ActionScript]] scripting interface.\n\n* '''XML:''' Flash Player has included native support for [[XML]] parsing and generation since version 8. XML data is held in memory as an XML [[Document Object Model]], and can be manipulated using ActionScript. ActionScript 3 also supports [[ECMAScript for XML]] (E4X), which allows XML data to be manipulated more easily.\n* '''JSON:''' Flash Player 11 includes native support for importing and exporting data in the [[JavaScript Object Notation]] (JSON) format, which allows interoperability with [[web service]]s and [[JavaScript]] programs.\n* '''AMF:''' Flash Player allows application data to be stored on users computers, in the form of [[Local Shared Object]]s, the Flash equivalent to [[HTTP cookie|browser cookies]].<ref name=\"adobe-lso\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/ |title=What are local shared objects? |work=Security and privacy |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529082335/http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/ |archivedate=May 29, 2010 }}</ref> Flash Player can also [[Native (computing)|natively]] read and write files in the [[Action Message Format]], the default data format for Local Shared Objects. Since the AMF format specification is published, data can be transferred to and from Flash applications using AMF datasets instead of [[JSON]] or [[XML]], reducing the need for [[parsing]] and [[Data validation|validating]] such data.\n* '''SWF:''' The specification for the [[SWF]] file format was published by Adobe, enabling the development of the SWX Format project, which used the SWF file format and AMF as a means for Flash applications to exchange data with server side applications.<ref>[http://swxformat.org/ SWX: SWF Data Format] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817072235/http://swxformat.org/ |date=August 17, 2012 }}, official website</ref><ref>[https://code.google.com/p/swxjava/ swxjava \u2013 SWX RPC implementation in Java] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607012209/http://code.google.com/p/swxjava/ |date=June 7, 2014 }}, Google Code</ref> The SWX system stores data as standard SWF bytecode which is automatically interpreted by Flash Player.<ref>[https://code.google.com/p/swx-format/ swx-format \u2013 Data Format] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803222401/http://code.google.com/p/swx-format/ |date=August 3, 2014 }}, Google Code</ref> Another [[Open-source software|open-source]] project, SWXml allows Flash applications to load XML files as native ActionScript objects without any client-side XML parsing, by converting XML files to SWF/AMF on the server.<ref>[http://swxformat.org/177 SWX Contest Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818142648/http://swxformat.org/177 |date=August 18, 2012 }}, SWX Format Website</ref><ref>[http://aralbalkan.com/1075 Introducing SWXml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112121226/http://aralbalkan.com/1075 |date=November 12, 2007 }}, Aral Balkan</ref>\n\n===Multimedia formats===\nFlash Player is primarily a graphics and multimedia platform, and has supported [[raster graphics]] and [[vector graphics]] since its earliest version. It supports the following different multimedia formats which it can natively [[Parsing|decode]] and play back.\n\n* '''MP3:''' Support for decoding and playback of [[Streaming media|streaming]] [[MP3|MPEG-2 Audio Layer III]] (MP3) audio was introduced in Flash Player 4. MP3 files can be accessed and played back from a server via [[HTTP]], or embedded inside an SWF file, which is also a streaming format.\n* '''FLV:''' Support for decoding and playing back video and audio inside [[Flash Video]] (FLV and F4V) files, a format developed by [[Adobe Systems]] and [[Macromedia]].

Flash Player 11 can also encode a PNG bitmap via ActionScript.\n* '''JPEG:''' Support for decoding and rendering compressed [[JPEG]] images. Flash Player 10 added support for the [[JPEG-XR]] advanced image compression standard developed by [[Microsoft Corporation]], which results in better compression and quality than JPEG. JPEG-XR enables [[Lossy compression|lossy]] and [[Lossless compression|lossless]] compression with or without [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] transparency. Flash Player 11 can also encode a JPEG or JPEG-XR bitmap via ActionScript.\n* '''GIF:''' Support for decoding and rendering compressed [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) images, in its single-frame variants only. Loading a multi-frame GIF will display only the first image frame.\n\n===Streaming protocols===\n* '''HTTP:''' Support for communicating with [[web server]]s using [[HTTP]] requests and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] data.<ref>[http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1014968&seqNum=2 Protocols: HTTP vs. RTMP> Beginner's Guide to Distributing Flash Video] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313180548/http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1014968&seqNum=2 |date=March 13, 2013 }}, Adobe Press</ref> However, only websites that explicitly allow Flash to connect to them can be accessed via HTTP or [[Network socket|sockets]], to prevent Flash being used as a tool for [[cross-site request forgery]],<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/cross_domain_policy.html Cross-domain policy file usage recommendations for Flash Player] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813035047/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/cross_domain_policy.html |date=August 13, 2014 }}, Adobe</ref> [[cross-site scripting]], [[DNS rebinding]]<ref name=\"fp9sec\"/> and [[denial-of-service attack]]s.

although it has no in-built features to modify the SWF file at runtime. It can execute software written in the [[ActionScript]] programming language which enables the runtime manipulation of text, data, [[vector graphics]], [[raster graphics]], [[sound]] and [[video]]. The player can also access certain connected hardware devices, including the [[web camera]]s and [[microphone]]s, after permission for the same has been granted by the user.\n\nFlash Player is used internally by the [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] (AIR), to provide a cross-platform runtime environment for [[desktop applications]] and mobile applications. AIR supports installable applications on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]], and some mobile operating systems such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Flash applications must specifically be built for the AIR runtime to use additional features provided, such as file system integration, native client extensions, native window/screen integration, taskbar/dock integration, and hardware integration with connected [[Accelerometer]] and [[GPS]] devices.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/products/air.html AIR 3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821051943/http://www.adobe.com/products/air.html |date=August 21, 2014 }}, Adobe</ref>\n\n===Data formats===\nFlash Player includes native support for many [[File format|data formats]], some of which can only be accessed through the [[ActionScript]] scripting interface.\n\n* '''XML:''' Flash Player has included native support for [[XML]] parsing and generation since version 8. XML data is held in memory as an XML [[Document Object Model]], and can be manipulated using ActionScript. ActionScript 3 also supports [[ECMAScript for XML]] (E4X), which allows XML data to be manipulated more easily.\n* '''JSON:''' Flash Player 11 includes native support for importing and exporting data in the [[JavaScript Object Notation]] (JSON) format, which allows interoperability with [[web service]]s and [[JavaScript]] programs.\n* '''AMF:''' Flash Player allows application data to be stored on users computers, in the form of [[Local Shared Object]]s, the Flash equivalent to [[HTTP cookie|browser cookies]].<ref name=\"adobe-lso\">{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/ |title=What are local shared objects? |work=Security and privacy |publisher=[[Adobe Systems]] |accessdate=December 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529082335/http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/ |archivedate=May 29, 2010 }}</ref> Flash Player can also [[Native (computing)|natively]] read and write files in the [[Action Message Format]], the default data format for Local Shared Objects. Since the AMF format specification is published, data can be transferred to and from Flash applications using AMF datasets instead of [[JSON]] or [[XML]], reducing the need for [[parsing]] and [[Data validation|validating]] such data.\n* '''SWF:''' The specification for the [[SWF]] file format was published by Adobe, enabling the development of the SWX Format project, which used the SWF file format and AMF as a means for Flash applications to exchange data with server side applications.<ref>[http://swxformat.org/ SWX: SWF Data Format] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120817072235/http://swxformat.org/ |date=August 17, 2012 }}, official website</ref><ref>[https://code.google.com/p/swxjava/ swxjava \u2013 SWX RPC implementation in Java] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607012209/http://code.google.com/p/swxjava/ |date=June 7, 2014 }}, Google Code</ref> The SWX system stores data as standard SWF bytecode which is automatically interpreted by Flash Player.<ref>[https://code.google.com/p/swx-format/ swx-format \u2013 Data Format] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803222401/http://code.google.com/p/swx-format/ |date=August 3, 2014 }}, Google Code</ref> Another [[Open-source software|open-source]] project, SWXml allows Flash applications to load XML files as native ActionScript objects without any client-side XML parsing, by converting XML files to SWF/AMF on the server.<ref>[http://swxformat.org/177 SWX Contest Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818142648/http://swxformat.org/177 |date=August 18, 2012 }}, SWX Format Website</ref><ref>[http://aralbalkan.com/1075 Introducing SWXml] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112121226/http://aralbalkan.com/1075 |date=November 12, 2007 }}, Aral Balkan</ref>\n\n===Multimedia formats===\nFlash Player is primarily a graphics and multimedia platform, and has supported [[raster graphics]] and [[vector graphics]] since its earliest version. It supports the following different multimedia formats which it can natively [[Parsing|decode]] and play back.\n\n* '''MP3:''' Support for decoding and playback of [[Streaming media|streaming]] [[MP3|MPEG-2 Audio Layer III]] (MP3) audio was introduced in Flash Player 4. MP3 files can be accessed and played back from a server via [[HTTP]], or embedded inside an SWF file, which is also a streaming format.\n* '''FLV:''' Support for decoding and playing back video and audio inside [[Flash Video]] (FLV and F4V) files, a format developed by [[Adobe Systems]] and [[Macromedia]].

Flash Player 11 can also encode a PNG bitmap via ActionScript.\n* '''JPEG:''' Support for decoding and rendering compressed [[JPEG]] images. Flash Player 10 added support for the [[JPEG-XR]] advanced image compression standard developed by [[Microsoft Corporation]], which results in better compression and quality than JPEG. JPEG-XR enables [[Lossy compression|lossy]] and [[Lossless compression|lossless]] compression with or without [[Alpha compositing|alpha channel]] transparency. Flash Player 11 can also encode a JPEG or JPEG-XR bitmap via ActionScript.\n* '''GIF:''' Support for decoding and rendering compressed [[Graphics Interchange Format]] (GIF) images, in its single-frame variants only. Loading a multi-frame GIF will display only the first image frame.\n\n===Streaming protocols===\n* '''HTTP:''' Support for communicating with [[web server]]s using [[HTTP]] requests and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]] data.<ref>[http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1014968&seqNum=2 Protocols: HTTP vs. RTMP> Beginner's Guide to Distributing Flash Video] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313180548/http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=1014968&seqNum=2 |date=March 13, 2013 }}, Adobe Press</ref> However, only websites that explicitly allow Flash to connect to them can be accessed via HTTP or [[Network socket|sockets]], to prevent Flash being used as a tool for [[cross-site request forgery]],<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/cross_domain_policy.html Cross-domain policy file usage recommendations for Flash Player] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813035047/http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/cross_domain_policy.html |date=August 13, 2014 }}, Adobe</ref> [[cross-site scripting]], [[DNS rebinding]]<ref name=\"fp9sec\"/> and [[denial-of-service attack]]s.
