During its most commercially successful period from 1987\u20131992, the band consisted of [[Jan Kuehnemund]] (lead guitar), [[Janet Gardner]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Share Ross]] (bass guitar), and [[Roxy Petrucci]] (drums).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=379}}</ref>\n\nThe band's [[Vixen (Vixen album)|eponymous first album]] was released in 1988, and reached  #41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Their second album ''[[Rev It Up]]'' was released in 1990, and reached #52 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Their third album [[Tangerine (Vixen album)|''Tangerine'']] was released in 1998. Their fourth album [[Live & Learn (Vixen album)|''Live & Learn'']] was released in 2006.\n\nPart of the [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] [[glam metal]] scene, the band has been described as \"the female [[Bon Jovi]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/10/jan-kuehnemund-founder-of-pioneering-all-female-metal-band-vixen-passes-away/|title=Jan Kuehnemund, founder of pioneering all-female metal band Vixen, passes away|date=October 11, 2013|work=The Current|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref> Several singles released by the band from 1988\u20131990 reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including the Top 40 singles \"Edge of a Broken Heart\" at #26, and \"Cryin'\" at #22.\n\nWhile the band originally disbanded in 1992, it reformed from 1997\u20131998 by Gardner and Petrucci but a lawsuit filed by Kuehnemund over ownership of the name ruled in her favor ending that version of the band. Kuehnemund reunited the band with the classic lineup in 2001 but disagreements caused Kuehnemund to quickly recruit a new version of the band with three new members; this lineup lasted until 2012. Kuehnemund died in 2013. From then on Gardner, Ross, and Petrucci reformed the band with Gina Stile on guitar. \n\nAs of 2019 the band currently consists of Ross, Petrucci, Britt Lightning, and Lorraine Lewis.\n[[File:Vixen Stuttgart 2018 111.jpg|thumb|250px|Lead guitarist Britt Lightning and lead vocalist Janet Gardner in [[Stuttgart]], 2018]]\n[[File:Vixen 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|The band in 2014]]\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nVixen was formed in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]] in 1980 by guitarist [[Jan Kuehnemund]] after playing in the band Lemon Pepper in high school later changing the name to Genesis, which broke up in 1974. [[Nancy Shanks]] was her bandmate during that time. Six years later she formed a new all-female rock band named Vixen with a new lineup.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAlex Henderson, writing for [[AllMusic]], said they started in 1981 in [[Los Angeles]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Henderson, Alex|title=Vixen|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vixen-p21284/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref> California. In 1984, an early version of the band with Kuehnemund, singer [[Janet Gardner]], bassist Pia Maiocco, and rhythm guitarist/singer-songwriter Tammy Ivanov appeared in the movie ''[[Hardbodies]]'', as the on-screen band Diaper Rash. They were a quintet at that time, playing in a pop rock style. In 1985, the band moved to the inner areas of Los Angeles to join the city's rock scene.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Commercial success===\nLineup changes happened during the following years until the \"classic lineup\" of Kuehnemund, Gardner, [[Roxy Petrucci]], and [[Share Ross|Share Pedersen]] was formed. This lineup of Vixen was interviewed in 1987 along with many other rock artists of the day by [[Penelope Spheeris]] for her film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years]]''. All members except Kuehnemund appeared in the film.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1988, the band was signed to [[Manhattan Records|EMI Manhattan]], and they began recording their self-titled debut album ''[[Vixen (Vixen album)|Vixen]]'', which was released in September 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> [[Singer-songwriter]] [[Richard Marx]] co-wrote with [[Fee Waybill]] and arranged their signature hit, \"Edge of a Broken Heart\" and produced the song.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  Marx had nothing to do with their follow-up CD, since he was becoming more of a mainline singer than songwriter. Vixen spent the next year touring the world, supporting acts such as [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and [[Bon Jovi]], as well as headlining their own shows. The band returned to the studio in late 1989/early 1990 to record their follow-up album, ''[[Rev It Up]]'', which was released in July 1990.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> A year of touring followed, including headlining their own shows and supporting acts such as [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and [[Deep Purple]]. After the tour concluded in mid-1991, the group disbanded in 1992 due to musical differences.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===First reunion===\nIn 1997, drummer Roxy Petrucci reformed Vixen, with Janet Gardner and recruited [[Gina Stile]] on lead guitar and Rana Ross, previously from [[Phantom Blue]], on bass guitar. This lineup toured the United States in 1997, and in 1998 Gardner, Stile, and Petrucci recorded the album ''[[Tangerine (Vixen album)|Tangerine]]'', which eventually became Stile's only album and Gardner's last during their respective tenures in the band. After the release of the new album, Roxy's sister Maxine Petrucci was brought in to play bass on a US tour during 1998, but they were sued successfully for [[trademark infringement]] by Kuehnemund.<ref>{{cite interview |date=June 28, 2005 |title=VIXEN Guitarist Talks About Band's New Lineup |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vixen-guitarist-talks-about-band-s-new-lineup/ |first=Jan |last=Kuehnemund |interviewer=Antenna.nu |format=Excerpt}}</ref> According to her, she realized that the rest of Vixen left her out and usurped her right to represent them.<ref>{{cite episode |first=Aamer |last=Haleem |authorlink=Aamer Haleem |date=November 2004 |title=Vixen |series=Bands Reunited |network=VH1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Share Ross joined her husband's band, [[the Dogs D'Amour]], who reformed after a long hiatus. She appeared on their 2000 albums ''[[Happy Ever After (album)|Happy Ever After]]'' and ''[[Seconds (The Dogs D'Amour album)|Seconds]]'', playing bass, keyboards, and backing vocals, later leaving that band. Share and her husband, Bam, also had their own band, Bubble, which was very popular in L.A.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Second reunion===\nIn 2001, Vixen was reformed by Kuehnemund with a lineup consisting of herself, Janet Gardner, Roxy Petrucci, and new bassist Pat Holloway. This lineup toured the US as part of the Voices of Metal tour. Halfway through the tour, disagreements with management caused the band to split-up, with only Kuehnemund remaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vixen-guitarist-addresses-rumors-behind-band-s-split/|title=VIXEN Guitarist Addresses Rumors Behind Band's Split|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=March 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-pkWnUKi3I|title=A CMS Tribute To Jan Kuehnemund (made with Spreaker)|first=Jan|last=Kuehnemund|work=The Classic Metal Show|type=Podcast|date=October 13, 2013|id=The question is asked at 19:52|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Kuehnemund quickly recruited [[Jenna Sanz-Agero|Jenna Sanz-Agero (Jenna Piccolo)]], Lynn Louise Lowrey, and Kathrin \"Kat\" Kraft to complete the tour.

However, in January 2013, days before they were about to make the official announcement of their reunion, Kuehnemund was diagnosed with cancer. This forced them to delay the announcement indefinitely, until possibly when Kuehnemund was fully recovered and cancer-free. The plan for a full-fledged reunion became impossible on October 10, 2013 when, after nine months battling her cancer, Jan Kuehnemund died at the age of 59.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/vixen-founder-jan-kuehnemund-loses-battle-with-cancer/|title=Vixen Founder Jan Kuehnemund Loses Battle With Cancer|website=Sleazeroxx.com|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013 the three surviving classic lineup members decided to carry on under the name of Vixen in honor of Jan Kuehnemund.<ref name=Vixen_continue>{{cite web|title=Surviving Members Of Classic VIXEN Lineup Resurrect Band In Honor Of Fallen Guitarist|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/surviving-members-of-classic-vixen-lineup-resurrect-band-in-honor-of-fallen-guitarist/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThey played several gigs in 2014 in the U.S., Spain, and Canada.

The former is their own cover of [[Raymond Louis Kennedy|Ray Kennedy]]'s \"You Oughta Know by Now\", originally on his 1980 self-titled album.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn January 16, 2019, Gardner confirmed in a Facebook post that she had definitely left Vixen,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2193156947664353&id=100009102087408| title=After much soul searching and many sleepless nights, I have decided that it's time for me to step aside and let Roxy and Share pursue their vision for the future of Vixen.... |last=Gardner|first=Janet|date=January 16, 2019|website=Facebook.com}}</ref> to devote more time to family and prioritize her solo career.

During its most commercially successful period from 1987-1992, the band consisted of [[Jan Kuehnemund]] (lead guitar), [[Janet Gardner]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Share Ross]] (bass guitar), and [[Roxy Petrucci]] (drums).<ref name=\"LarkinHM\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who\u2019s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=379}}</ref>\n\nThe band's [[Vixen (Vixen album)|eponymous first album]] was released in 1988, and reached  #41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Their second album ''[[Rev It Up]]'' was released in 1990, and reached #52 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Their third album [[Tangerine (Vixen album)|''Tangerine'']] was released in 1998. Their fourth album [[Live & Learn (Vixen album)|''Live & Learn'']] was released in 2006.\n\nPart of the [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] [[glam metal]] scene, the band has been described as \"the female [[Bon Jovi]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/10/jan-kuehnemund-founder-of-pioneering-all-female-metal-band-vixen-passes-away/|title=Jan Kuehnemund, founder of pioneering all-female metal band Vixen, passes away|date=October 11, 2013|work=The Current|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref> Several singles released by the band from 1988-1990 reached the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], including the Top 40 singles \"Edge of a Broken Heart\" at #26, and \"Cryin'\" at #22.\n\nWhile the band originally disbanded in 1992, it reformed from 1997-1998 by Gardner and Petrucci but a lawsuit filed by Kuehnemund over ownership of the name ruled in her favor ending that version of the band. Kuehnemund reunited the band with the classic lineup in 2001 but disagreements caused Kuehnemund to quickly recruit a new version of the band with three new members; this lineup lasted until 2012. Kuehnemund died in 2013. From then on Gardner, Ross, and Petrucci reformed the band with Gina Stile on guitar. \n\nAs of 2019 the band currently consists of Ross, Petrucci, Britt Lightning, and Lorraine Lewis.\n[[File:Vixen Stuttgart 2018 111.jpg|thumb|250px|Lead guitarist Britt Lightning and lead vocalist Janet Gardner in [[Stuttgart]], 2018]]\n[[File:Vixen 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|The band in 2014]]\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nVixen was formed in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul, Minnesota]] in 1980 by guitarist [[Jan Kuehnemund]] after playing in the band Lemon Pepper in high school later changing the name to Genesis, which broke up in 1974. [[Nancy Shanks]] was her bandmate during that time. Six years later she formed a new all-female rock band named Vixen with a new lineup.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nAlex Henderson, writing for [[AllMusic]], said they started in 1981 in [[Los Angeles]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Henderson, Alex|title=Vixen|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vixen-p21284/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}</ref> California. In 1984, an early version of the band with Kuehnemund, singer [[Janet Gardner]], bassist Pia Maiocco, and rhythm guitarist/singer-songwriter Tammy Ivanov appeared in the movie ''[[Hardbodies]]'', as the on-screen band Diaper Rash. They were a quintet at that time, playing in a pop rock style. In 1985, the band moved to the inner areas of Los Angeles to join the city's rock scene.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Commercial success===\nLineup changes happened during the following years until the \"classic lineup\" of Kuehnemund, Gardner, [[Roxy Petrucci]], and [[Share Ross|Share Pedersen]] was formed. This lineup of Vixen was interviewed in 1987 along with many other rock artists of the day by [[Penelope Spheeris]] for her film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization II: The Metal Years]]''. All members except Kuehnemund appeared in the film.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn 1988, the band was signed to [[Manhattan Records|EMI Manhattan]], and they began recording their self-titled debut album ''[[Vixen (Vixen album)|Vixen]]'', which was released in September 1988.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> [[Singer-songwriter]] [[Richard Marx]] co-wrote with [[Fee Waybill]] and arranged their signature hit, \"Edge of a Broken Heart\" and produced the song.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>  Marx had nothing to do with their follow-up CD, since he was becoming more of a mainline singer than songwriter. Vixen spent the next year touring the world, supporting acts such as [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], and [[Bon Jovi]], as well as headlining their own shows. The band returned to the studio in late 1989/early 1990 to record their follow-up album, ''[[Rev It Up]]'', which was released in July 1990.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> A year of touring followed, including headlining their own shows and supporting acts such as [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and [[Deep Purple]]. After the tour concluded in mid-1991, the group disbanded in 1992 due to musical differences.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===First reunion===\nIn 1997, drummer Roxy Petrucci reformed Vixen, with Janet Gardner and recruited [[Gina Stile]] on lead guitar and Rana Ross, previously from [[Phantom Blue]], on bass guitar. This lineup toured the United States in 1997, and in 1998 Gardner, Stile, and Petrucci recorded the album ''[[Tangerine (Vixen album)|Tangerine]]'', which eventually became Stile's only album and Gardner's last during their respective tenures in the band. After the release of the new album, Roxy's sister Maxine Petrucci was brought in to play bass on a US tour during 1998, but they were sued successfully for [[trademark infringement]] by Kuehnemund.<ref>{{cite interview |date=June 28, 2005 |title=VIXEN Guitarist Talks About Band's New Lineup |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vixen-guitarist-talks-about-band-s-new-lineup/ |first=Jan |last=Kuehnemund |interviewer=Antenna.nu |format=Excerpt}}</ref> According to her, she realized that the rest of Vixen left her out and usurped her right to represent them.<ref>{{cite episode |first=Aamer |last=Haleem |authorlink=Aamer Haleem |date=November 2004 |title=Vixen |series=Bands Reunited |network=VH1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Share Ross joined her husband's band, [[the Dogs D'Amour]], who reformed after a long hiatus. She appeared on their 2000 albums ''[[Happy Ever After (album)|Happy Ever After]]'' and ''[[Seconds (The Dogs D'Amour album)|Seconds]]'', playing bass, keyboards, and backing vocals, later leaving that band. Share and her husband, Bam, also had their own band, Bubble, which was very popular in L.A.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Second reunion===\nIn 2001, Vixen was reformed by Kuehnemund with a lineup consisting of herself, Janet Gardner, Roxy Petrucci, and new bassist Pat Holloway. This lineup toured the US as part of the Voices of Metal tour. Halfway through the tour, disagreements with management caused the band to split-up, with only Kuehnemund remaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vixen-guitarist-addresses-rumors-behind-band-s-split/|title=VIXEN Guitarist Addresses Rumors Behind Band's Split|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=March 4, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-pkWnUKi3I|title=A CMS Tribute To Jan Kuehnemund (made with Spreaker)|first=Jan|last=Kuehnemund|work=The Classic Metal Show|type=Podcast|date=October 13, 2013|id=The question is asked at 19:52|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Kuehnemund quickly recruited [[Jenna Sanz-Agero|Jenna Sanz-Agero (Jenna Piccolo)]], Lynn Louise Lowrey, and Kathrin \"Kat\" Kraft to complete the tour.

However, in January 2013, days before they were about to make the official announcement of their reunion, Kuehnemund was diagnosed with cancer. This forced them to delay the announcement indefinitely, until possibly when Kuehnemund was fully recovered and cancer-free. The plan for a full-fledged reunion became impossible on October 10, 2013 when, after nine months battling her cancer, Jan Kuehnemund died at the age of 59.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/vixen-founder-jan-kuehnemund-loses-battle-with-cancer/|title=Vixen Founder Jan Kuehnemund Loses Battle With Cancer|website=Sleazeroxx.com|accessdate=November 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013 the three surviving classic lineup members decided to carry on under the name of Vixen in honor of Jan Kuehnemund.<ref name=Vixen_continue>{{cite web|title=Surviving Members Of Classic VIXEN Lineup Resurrect Band In Honor Of Fallen Guitarist|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/surviving-members-of-classic-vixen-lineup-resurrect-band-in-honor-of-fallen-guitarist/|website=Blabbermouth.net|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThey played several gigs in 2014 in the U.S., Spain, and Canada.

The former is their own cover of [[Raymond Louis Kennedy|Ray Kennedy]]'s \"You Oughta Know by Now\", originally on his 1980 self-titled album.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nOn January 16, 2019, Gardner confirmed in a Facebook post that she had definitely left Vixen,<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2193156947664353&id=100009102087408| title=After much soul searching and many sleepless nights, I have decided that it's time for me to step aside and let Roxy and Share pursue their vision for the future of Vixen.... |last=Gardner|first=Janet|date=January 16, 2019|website=Facebook.com}}</ref> to devote more time to family and prioritize her solo career.

The skin lesions observed in the early stage last for weeks or months. The skin lesions are highly infectious, and the spirochetes in the lesions are transmitted by direct contact. The lesions regress as the immune response develops against ''T. pallidum''. The latent stage that results lasts a lifetime in many cases. In a minority of cases, the disease exits latency and enters a tertiary phase, in which destructive lesions of skin, bone, and cartilage ensue. Unlike yaws and bejels, syphilis in its tertiary stage often affects the heart, eyes, and nervous system as well.<ref name=Giacani2014/>\n\n===Syphilis===\n{{Main|Syphilis}}\n\n''T. p. pallidum'' is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by close [[sexually transmitted disease|sexual contact]], entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar [[epithelium]]. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by [[placenta|transplacental]] passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of ''T. p. pallidum'' allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin.  In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis.<ref name = \"Radolf_1996\" /> It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.<ref name=\"Radolf_1996\" />\n\nThe incubation period for a ''T. p. pallidum'' infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 days to 90 days.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm | title = STD Facts \u2013 Syphilis (Detailed) | publisher = Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | access-date = 2017-04-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Laboratory identification==\n[[Image:Treponema pallidum - very high mag - extreme crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Micrograph]] showing ''T. pallidum'' (black and thin) \u2013 [[Dieterle stain]]]]\n''T. pallidum'' was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by [[Fritz Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann]] at the [[Charit\u00e9]] in Berlin in 1905.<ref name=\"Schaudinn1905\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Schaudinn|first1=Fritz Richard|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Erich|authorlink2=Erich Hoffmann|year=1905|title=Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht \u00fcber das Vorkommen von Spirochaeten in syphilitischen Krankheitsprodukten und bei Papillomen|trans-title=Preliminary report on the occurrence of Spirochaetes in syphilitic chancres and papillomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_TPkAAAAAYAAJ#page/n535/mode/2up|journal=[[Arbeiten aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte]]|volume=22|pages=527\u2013534|authorlink1=Fritz Richard Schaudinn|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the [[Dieterle stain]].

The skin lesions observed in the early stage last for weeks or months. The skin lesions are highly infectious, and the spirochetes in the lesions are transmitted by direct contact. The lesions regress as the immune response develops against ''T. pallidum''. The latent stage that results lasts a lifetime in many cases. In a minority of cases, the disease exits latency and enters a tertiary phase, in which destructive lesions of skin, bone, and cartilage ensue. Unlike yaws and bejels, syphilis in its tertiary stage often affects the heart, eyes, and nervous system as well.<ref name=Giacani2014/>\n\n===Syphilis===\n{{Main|Syphilis}}\n\n''T. p. pallidum'' is a motile spirochaete that is generally acquired by close [[sexually transmitted disease|sexual contact]], entering the host via breaches in squamous or columnar [[epithelium]]. The organism can also be transmitted to a fetus by [[placenta|transplacental]] passage during the later stages of pregnancy, giving rise to congenital syphilis. The helical structure of ''T. p. pallidum'' allows it to move in a corkscrew motion through mucous membranes or enter minuscule breaks in the skin.  In women the initial lesion is usually on the labia, the walls of the vagina, or the cervix; in men it is on the shaft or glans of the penis.<ref name = \"Radolf_1996\" /> It gains access to the host's blood and lymph systems through tissue and mucous membranes. In more severe cases, it may gain access to the host by infecting the skeletal bones and central nervous system of the body.<ref name=\"Radolf_1996\" />\n\nThe incubation period for a ''T. p. pallidum'' infection is usually around 21 days, but can range from 10 days to 90 days.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-syphilis-detailed.htm | title = STD Facts \u2013 Syphilis (Detailed) | publisher = Centers for Disease Control (CDC) | access-date = 2017-04-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Laboratory identification==\n[[Image:Treponema pallidum - very high mag - extreme crop.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Micrograph]] showing ''T. pallidum'' (black and thin) \u2013 [[Dieterle stain]]]]\n''T. pallidum'' was first microscopically identified in syphilitic chancres by [[Fritz Schaudinn]] and [[Erich Hoffmann]] at the [[Charit\u00e9]] in Berlin in 1905.<ref name=\"Schaudinn1905\">\n{{cite journal|last1=Schaudinn|first1=Fritz Richard|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Erich|authorlink2=Erich Hoffmann|year=1905|title=Vorl\u00e4ufiger Bericht \u00fcber das Vorkommen von Spirochaeten in syphilitischen Krankheitsprodukten und bei Papillomen|trans-title=Preliminary report on the occurrence of Spirochaetes in syphilitic chancres and papillomas|url=https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_TPkAAAAAYAAJ#page/n535/mode/2up|journal=[[Arbeiten aus dem Kaiserlichen Gesundheitsamte]]|volume=22|pages=527\u2013534|authorlink1=Fritz Richard Schaudinn|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> This bacterium can be detected with special stains, such as the [[Dieterle stain]].

The CMT Association certifies{{cn|date=September 2017}} that an individual is competent in the use of technical analysis via the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nUnder its original name of Market Technicians Association, the organization was incorporated as a not-for-profit association in 1973, but began holding meetings since 1971. There were 18 charter members in 1973, but the three founders are considered to be Ralph Acampora, John Brooks and John Greeley. These charter members found that they were doing the same thing for a living (practicing technical analysis), and believed there should be an organization similar to the one that already existed for fundamental analysts.  At first, the CMT Association was a New York-based group, however, as it became apparent that there were technical analysts all over the globe, the CMT Association transformed first to a U.S. based and eventually to a global professional association.\n\nThe CMT Association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) program emerged after significant work in the second half of the 1980s. The first tests were given and the first CMTs were granted in 1989. In 2005 the NASD (now FINRA) submitted a rule filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to accept the CMT 1 and 2 as an alternative to the series 86 examination required of financial analysts.\n\nThrough most of the early years of its history, the CMT Association was located in various downtown New York City locations, usually in a shared space of other friendly associations (i.e., NY Institute of Finance [NYIF]; later the NY Society of Security Analysts [NYSSA]). In September, 2001 the CMT Association was in the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] when the Twin Towers fell.\n\nThe CMT Association quickly relocated to space in Woodbridge, New Jersey and actively worked at building back its library of resources through, in large measure, the donations of members and friends of the CMT Association.  The CMT Association moved back to a new downtown NYC location in early 2007, located at 61 Broadway\u2014Suite 514, NY, NY 10006, which is within one block of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

The CMT Association certifies{{cn|date=September 2017}} that an individual is competent in the use of technical analysis via the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nUnder its original name of Market Technicians Association, the organization was incorporated as a not-for-profit association in 1973, but began holding meetings since 1971. There were 18 charter members in 1973, but the three founders are considered to be Ralph Acampora, John Brooks and John Greeley. These charter members found that they were doing the same thing for a living (practicing technical analysis), and believed there should be an organization similar to the one that already existed for fundamental analysts.  At first, the CMT Association was a New York-based group, however, as it became apparent that there were technical analysts all over the globe, the CMT Association transformed first to a U.S. based and eventually to a global professional association.\n\nThe CMT Association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) program emerged after significant work in the second half of the 1980s. The first tests were given and the first CMTs were granted in 1989. In 2005 the NASD (now FINRA) submitted a rule filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to accept the CMT 1 and 2 as an alternative to the series 86 examination required of financial analysts.\n\nThrough most of the early years of its history, the CMT Association was located in various downtown New York City locations, usually in a shared space of other friendly associations (i.e., NY Institute of Finance [NYIF]; later the NY Society of Security Analysts [NYSSA]). In September, 2001 the CMT Association was in the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] when the Twin Towers fell.\n\nThe CMT Association quickly relocated to space in Woodbridge, New Jersey and actively worked at building back its library of resources through, in large measure, the donations of members and friends of the CMT Association.  The CMT Association moved back to a new downtown NYC location in early 2007, located at 61 Broadway\u2014Suite 514, NY, NY 10006, which is within one block of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The CMT Association relocated in May, 2017 to [[Cunard Building (New York City)|25 Broadway]], next to the famous Charging Bull. The organization changed its name from Market Technicians Association to CMT Association with effect from July 14, 2017.\n\n==Mission==\nThe CMT Association is a not-for-profit professional regulatory organization servicing over 9,000 market analysis professionals in over 80 countries around the globe.
