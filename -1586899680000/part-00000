Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, and crafting, and also explore [[procedurally-generated]] caves with materials and ores to mine or battle creatures within. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money, or work at completing bundles; specific collections of materials offered to the town's Community Center. Completing bundles rewards players with various items, including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to new areas and game mechanics, such as a desert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/12298-the-many-hidden-secrets-of-stardew-valley|title=The Many Hidden Secrets of Stardew Valley - GameRevolution|date=March 2, 2016|work=GameRevolution|access-date=September 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref> All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health, exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. If players become too exhausted anywhere outside of their house, they will be forced to pay 10% of their gold up to 1,000 g and will be returned to their house and restored with energy on the morning of the next day, but having forgone any opportunities to continue in activities from the previous day. If players lose too much health, they will lose most of their energy and a random amount of money and items. The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having only four 28-day months that represent each [[season]], which determines which crops can be grown and which activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can restore a [[greenhouse]] which is able to grow any crop regardless of the current season.

pay back in bonuses that aided exploration, farming, mining and fishing skills.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Barone also opted to not include the butchering of farm animals for meat products, encouraging players to name and tend to each animal individually in staying with the feeling he wanted for the game.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> The animals cannot die but, if not tended to, stop producing

The game was initially released for [[Microsoft Windows]] in February 2016, with ports later being released for [[macOS]], [[Linux]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]], [[PlayStation Vita]], [[iOS]], and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].\n\nIn ''Stardew Valley'', players take the role of a character who, to get away from the hustle of the city, takes over their deceased grandfather's dilapidated farm in a place known as Stardew Valley. The game is open-ended, allowing players to take on several activities such as growing crops, raising livestock, crafting goods, mining for ores, selling produce, and socializing with the townsfolk, including marriage and having children. The game also allows up to three other players to play together online.\n\nBarone developed the game by himself over four years. The game was heavily inspired by the ''[[Story of Seasons|Harvest Moon]]'' video game series, with additions to address some of the shortcomings of these games while using the opportunity as an exercise to improve his own programming and game design skills. [[Chucklefish]] approached Barone midway through development with the offer to publish the game, allowing him to focus more on completing it. ''Stardew Valley'' was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms by 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Stardew valley screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Stardew Valley'' puts players in charge of running a farm, including growing crops and raising livestock.]]\n''Stardew Valley'' is a farming [[simulation video game|simulation]] game primarily inspired by the ''[[Story of Seasons|Harvest Moon]]'' video game series.<ref name=\"Kotaku 1 March 2016\">{{Cite web |last1=Grayson |first1=Nathan |title=Steam's Latest Hit Is A Game About Farming And Relationships |url=http://steamed.kotaku.com/steams-latest-hit-is-a-game-about-farming-and-relations-1762038774 |accessdate=March 1, 2016 |work=[[Kotaku]] |date=March 1, 2016}}</ref> At the start of the game, players create their character, who becomes the recipient of a plot of land including a small house once owned by their grandfather in a small town called Pelican Town. Players may select from several different farm map types, with each one having their benefits and drawbacks.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-09-29-stardew-valley-is-changing-the-way-you-start-your-farm |title=Eurogamer.net  Home News Stardew Valley PC Wii U PlayStation 4 Xbox One Stardew Valley is changing the way you start your farm |first=Tom |last=Phillips |date=September 29, 2016 |accessdate=September 29, 2016 |work=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> The farm plot is initially overrun with boulders, trees, stumps, and weeds, and players must work to clear them in order to restart the farm, tending to crops and livestock so as to generate revenue and further expand the farm's buildings and facilities.\n\nPlayers may also interact with [[non-player character]]s (NPC) that inhabit the town, including engaging in relationships with these characters; this can culminate in marriage, which results in the NPC helping the player's character to tend the farm. Players can also engage in fishing, cooking, and crafting, and also explore [[procedurally-generated]] caves with materials and ores to mine or battle creatures within. Players can take on various quests to earn additional money, or work at completing bundles; specific collections of materials offered to the town's Community Center. Completing bundles rewards players with various items, including seeds and tools. Completing multiple bundles grants players access to new areas and game mechanics, such as a desert.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/features/12298-the-many-hidden-secrets-of-stardew-valley|title=The Many Hidden Secrets of Stardew Valley - GameRevolution|date=March 2, 2016|work=GameRevolution|access-date=September 27, 2017|language=en}}</ref> All of these activities must be metered against the character's current health, exhaustion level, and the game's internal clock. If players become too exhausted anywhere outside of their house, they will be forced to pay 10% of their gold up to 1,000 g and will be returned to their house and restored with energy on the morning of the next day, but having forgone any opportunities to continue in activities from the previous day. If players lose too much health, they will lose most of their energy and a random amount of money and items. The game uses a simplified calendar, each year having only four 28-day months that represent each [[season]], which determines which crops can be grown and which activities can be beneficial. Later in the game, players can restore a [[greenhouse]] which is able to grow any crop regardless of the current season. The character is evaluated by their third year, but there is no deadline that otherwise ends the game.\n\n==Development==\n''Stardew Valley'' was created by American [[indie game]] designer Eric Barone, under the alias of ConcernedApe.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Chris |title=The 4 years of self-imposed crunch that went into Stardew Valley |url=http://gamasutra.com/view/news/267563/The_4_years_of_selfimposed_crunch_that_went_into_Stardew_Valley.php |website=[[Gamasutra]] |date=March 9, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"kotaku popularity\"/> In 2011, Barone had graduated from the [[University of Washington Tacoma]] with a [[computer science]] degree, but had not been able to get a job in the industry, instead working as an usher at the [[Paramount Theatre (Seattle)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Seattle]].<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/stardew-valley-interview/ |title=Interview: What's next for Stardew Valley |first=Tom |last=Marks |date=March 10, 2016 |accessdate=March 10, 2016 |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref><ref name=\"vulture\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/first-time-developer-made-stardew-valley.html |title=How a First-time Developer Created Stardew Valley, 2016\u2019s Best Game to Date |first=Jesse |last=Singal |date=March 14, 2016 |accessdate=March 14, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |publisher=[[New York Media, LLC]]}}</ref> Looking to improve his computer skills for better job prospects, he came to the idea of crafting a game which would also pull in his artistic side.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> \n\n''Stardew Valley'' originally began as a modern fan-made alternative to the ''Harvest Moon'' series, as he felt \"the series had gotten progressively worse after ''[[Harvest Moon: Back to Nature]]''\".<ref name=\"Daily Sun\">{{cite web |last1=Lin |first1=Amy |title=Stardew Valley: Pushing The Boundaries of Farming RPGs |url=http://cornellsun.com/2016/02/23/stardew-valley-pushing-the-boundaries-of-farming-rpgs/ |work=[[The Cornell Daily Sun]] |date=February 23, 2016 |accessdate=March 9, 2016}}</ref> Unable to find a satisfactory replacement, Barone began to create a game similar to the series, stating that his intent was \"to address the problems I had with ''Harvest Moon''\" and that \"no title in the series ever brought it all together in a perfect way\".<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Barone was also inspired by other games, including ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Rune Factory]]'', ''[[Minecraft]]'', and ''[[Terraria]]'', adding features seen in those games such as crafting, quests, and combat.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=King |first1=Melissa |title=Stardew Valley: Love Who You Actually Love |url=https://unwinnable.com/2016/03/16/stardew-valley-love-who-you-actually-love/ |website=Unwinnable |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Lin |first1=Amy |title=Stardew Valley: Pushing The Boundaries of Farming RPGs |url=https://cornellsun.com/2016/02/23/stardew-valley-pushing-the-boundaries-of-farming-rpgs/ |website=The Cornell Daily Sun |accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nInitially, Barone considered releasing the title on [[Xbox Live Indie Games]] due to the ease of publishing on that platform, but found early on that his scope for the game became much larger than originally anticipated.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> Barone publicly announced the game in September 2012, using [[Steam (software)|Steam]]'s Greenlight system to gauge interest on the game.<ref name=\"polygon popular\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra\"/><ref name=\"Daily Sun\"/> After the title was shown a great deal of support from the community, Barone began working on the title in full, engaging with [[Reddit]] and [[Twitter]] communities to discuss his progress and gain feedback on proposed additions.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Shortly after the Greenlight period in 2013, he was approached by Finn Brice, director of [[Chucklefish]], who offered to help publish the game on release.<ref name=\"pcgamer interview\"/> Chucklefish took over many of the non-development activities for Barone, such as site hosting and setting up his development [[wiki]].<ref name=\"MCV\"/> Barone decided not to use Steam's [[early access]] feature for development, as he felt that it was not well suited to Stardew Valley.<ref name=\"MCV\"/>Barone spent four years working on the project, redoing it multiple times, and was the sole developer on the game, frequently spending 10 hours or more a day working on it.

open-ended), which could end after two years of in-game time has passed, Barone kept ''Stardew Valley'' open-ended so that players would not feel rushed to try to complete everything possible.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> During development, Barone recognized that some players would attempt to figure out mechanically how to maximize their farm's yield and profit through spreadsheets and other tools, but hoped that most players would take the time to learn these on their own.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> To that end, he designed the cooking aspect of the game purposely to not be profitable, but instead pay back in bonuses that aided exploration, farming, mining and fishing skills.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> Barone also opted to not include the butchering of farm animals for meat products, encouraging players to name and tend to each animal individually in staying with the feeling he wanted for the game.<ref name=\"vulture\"/> The animals cannot die but, if not tended to, stop producing products.\n\n===Release===\nIn April 2015, Barone announced he intended to release the game only once he felt it was feature complete, refusing to put the game onto the Early Access program, or accept

In 1408, at the command of the rich and influential [[Benveniste ben Solomon ben Labi]], he wrote a work in Arabic on the value and effects of various foodstuffs and of simple and composite medicaments. It was translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], under the title ''Gerem ha-Ma'alot,'' by Benveniste's son, [[Joseph Vidal]].\n\nThis Joshua al-Lorqui is perhaps, as [[Philoxene Luzzatto]] points out, identical with the Joshua al-Lorqui who wrote an anti-Christian letter to his friend Solomon ha-Levi ([[Paul de Burgos]]), and who was also a physician in Alca\u00f1iz and was on friendly terms with Benveniste ben Labi, being present at Moses Benveniste's wedding. In the letter the writer expresses his astonishment at the fact that Paul de Burgos should have resolved to change his faith; he investigates the motives which could have led him to take such a step\u2014ambition, mania for wealth and power, satisfaction of sensual desires, doubt of the truths of [[Judaism]]. He then gives eight arguments against the truth of [[Christianity]], and in conclusion asks Paul if one who professes a certain religion is obliged to inquire into the truth of its doctrines.\n\nThis letter was addressed to Paul de Burgos at a time when the latter occupied a high position, was surrounded by luxury and a band of servants, and, as is supposed, had already been appointed tutor to the young king [[Juan II of Castile]].\n\n== Family ==\n\nJoshua Lorki's father, '''Joseph ben Joshua ibn Vives al-Lorqui''', who died before 1372, was also a physician.
