The show was produced by [[Sunbow Entertainment]] from season 1 up to season 2 (being the final television series to be produced by Sunbow before the company was shut down in 2004), Telemagination from season 3 up to season 4 and TV-Loonland AG in association with [[List of international Cartoon Network channels|Cartoon Network Europe]]. It is about Wayne Cramp ([[Tom Kenny]]) and Lucien Cramp ([[Kath Soucie]]), [[Fraternal twins|non-identical twin]] brothers who live with their [[mysophobia|germophobic]] [[mother]] Dorothy ([[Nicole Oliver]]) and their Western-obsessed [[father]] Horace ([[Ian James Corlett]]) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucien's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe ([[Lee Tockar]]), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Jayne Peterson) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss Hillary Hissy ([[Cathy Weseluck]] who also plays Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons ([[Terry Klassen]], who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).\n\nThe first season premiered in the United Kingdom on 3 September 2001 on [[BBC One]], [[Cartoon Network (UK & Ireland)|Cartoon Network UK]] in October and on September 10, 2001 on [[CBBC]], respectively and reached high popularity with children; the season ended on 21 June 2002. The second season premiered in Summer 2003 and finished in Autumn of the same year. The third season started in 2004 and ended in 2005. The fourth and final season began in 2006 and ended that same year, but [[Rerun|repeats]] of the show continued to air for some time afterwards in the UK. The show is currently licensed to [[Cartoon Network]]. In the US, season one premiered February 8, 2003 on [[Fox Box]] (later known as [[4Kids TV]]) where all four seasons aired until the show's end in 2006. The season three finale however remains unaired in the US when the show was cancelled on February 26, 2005 to continue to air [[Mew Mew Power]] in its timeslot. Cramp Twins returned to 4Kids TV in 2006 to finish the show's run. It also showed in some parts of Africa.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Wayne Cramp (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is the younger of the twins, but is taller than Lucien. Wayne is energetic, egotistical, manipulative, rude and descriptive, and the less intelligent of the two. He is also the bully of their class and feared by most kids. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by his only friend, Dirty Joe Muldoon. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Apart from sweet stuff, he also likes fast-food. He is also shown to be a self-taught mechanical genius in various episodes, like building an entire \"Road-Ready Drag Racer\" out of his bed, turning his bed into a trampoline, welding together various junk to create an Egyptian-style temple or taking good care of the Junkyard when Joe's out of town. He is shown to have a softer side when he creates his own imaginary brother out of an old arcade board after being banned from playing with Lucien.\n* Lucien Cramp (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) is Wayne's older twin brother, as the opening credits indicate. Lucien is the smarter of the twins, and is considered an \"eco-nerd.\" Despite being the older twin, Lucien is the favorite target of Wayne's bullying nature, and Wayne frequently refers to him with the nickname \"Girl Pants\". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a [[vegetarian]]. Lucien longs for a pet, either a cat, a dog, or a hamster, but due to his mother's extreme cleanliness rules, he cannot have one. To combat this, Lucien secretly keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about; his mom and dad are unaware that he has it. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a [[Coulrophobia|fear of clowns]]. He has many skills, including [[knitting]], and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is often seen trying to promote environmental awareness, usually through protesting against the environmentally unfriendly products or activities rife in Soap City. However, due to the disinterest or, in some cases, dislike many of its residents have towards nature (and especially the swamp), these attempts are almost always ignored, belittled or ridiculed; he is frequently teased by other children. He has a crush on Tony's mom as shown in one episode.\n* Dorothy Cramp (n\u00e9e O'Neil) (voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]]), is the yellow-skinned short-tempered, strict mother to the twins, and wife of Horace Cramp. She is a complete germaphobe and neat freak. Her obsession for cleanliness is a major source of comedy in the show. She once raided the twins' rooms and husband's storage to check their cleanliness, which resulted in her kicking them out of the house due to Wayne's junk, Lucien's mud for his worms, and Horace's Rodeo Rita picture. She is something of a scientist by way of cleaning products, for she often mixes home-made cleaning formulas to seek out the strongest germ-killer, which seems to awaken her twisted desire to clean everything \"to the brim\". This is described by Horace as having \"The Cleanies\" and happens every once in a while which results in everyone preparing for shelter because she always desires to test it on them first \"for safety\". She has a crush on fellow clean-freak Agent X, who is suspected by Lucien to be an alien and is a frequent fuel of jealousy for Horace.\n* Horace Cramp (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) is the green-skinned and dim-witted man-child father of Wayne and Lucien and husband of Dorothy Cramp. He works at the local soap and cleaner products factory. He is also a third-rate cowboy, being obsessed with pretty much anything Western-oriented, including \"cowgirl\" Rodeo Rita, much to his wife's disapproval. He is always fruitlessly trying to impress his boss, Mr. Winkle, although is quite incompetent, and hated by his [[mother-in-law]]. By the 4th season his cowardice has almost completely disappeared as a result of Wayne's attempt to use him as a source of income in one episode.\n* Tony Parsons (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) is Lucien's best friend (although they have been known to fall out) and a swamp child. He possesses a vast knowledge about the swamp, its people's traditions, and natural history. He has many brothers and sisters. Tony's dad's name is Seth and his mom's is Lily. Tony is extremely short (about a half metre tall) and finds it hampers his day-to-day life, e.g. riding a bicycle, but uses equipment to aid him, e.g. he wears a flag-meet-helmet whilst riding his specially-designed bike so other road users can see him. Apart from this, Tony's height doesn't seem to effect his self-esteem. As his father also used to be very short, it can be presumed that Tony is also going to grow taller. He and Mari are Lucien's only friends in the show. A running gag in the show is Tony's belief in supernatural things, like magic and aliens. Lucien often tries to argue against Tony's beliefs, using vague scientific facts, though Lucien always ends up standing corrected.\n* Wendy Winkle (voiced by Jayne Paterson) is the only daughter of Walter Winkle. Wendy is a bubbly but very spoiled brat who has an obvious crush on Wayne. Because of her immense wealth she has a tendency to get her way and bullies pretty much anyone. Throughout the series, she tries everything to win Wayne's heart, yet is always unsuccessful. However, she seems to exhibit an attraction to even Lucien sometimes, but she always ends up backing away from it in the end, with little regard to what happened and why.\n* Mari Phelps (voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]]) is Lucien's other friend. She often co-operates with Lucien on his environment-conserving efforts, but often can't help desiring a bit of power. She is a foster child and is looked after by a happiness-obsessed, brown-haired family with strange [[Mormonism|mormonist]] based customs. She is the black sheep of her foster family and is often embarrassed by their habits. Lucien briefly had a crush on Mari when she felt sorry for him during a time he felt certain he would never have a girlfriend, but nothing came of it. However, they remain good friends.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Dirty Joe Muldoon: (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]) A dim-witted, lonely, middle-aged man who owns the local junkyard frequented by Wayne. He is Wayne's best and only friend. He is an [[unseen character]] (except for a hand and part of his clothes). According to one episode, he had never bathed or showered in his life, and he showers for the first time in his life when he comes to live with the Cramps.\n* Walter Winkle: (voiced by Colin Murdock) Mr Cramp's boss and Wendy's father. He owns the city's soap-producing factory. He is a very unlikable man who practically owns the town, since many of the residents work for him and don't dare to cross him. It is hinted in many episodes that he is in fact a swamp person and that he and Mr Parsons knew each other as children. The reason why he doesn't disapprove of his daughter's toxic influence over him is often regarded as a desire for her not to hate him which could result in a falling out that will guarantee his loneliness, which is why he frequently asks for other people to solve his problems regarding her.\n* Hillary Hissy: (voiced by [[Cathy Weseluck]]) Hillary (Miss Hissy) is Wayne's, Lucien's, Wendy's and Mari's oversized teacher. She hates children and is a friend of Dirty Joe. They were thought to be dating once, but it turned out she was only tutoring him. Miss Hissy has also been shown to have a crush on Horace Cramp (Wayne and Lucien's father) and Mr Winkle. She is very unlikeable and her teaching methods usually involve bullying her students. Her catch-phrase is \"tout de suite\". In one episode it is revealed that she is a [[karate]] [[expert]]. She owns a long stick with hammered bottle caps on it (called 'The Crank') and threatens students into behaving by shaking it in an aggressive manner.\n* Seth Parsons: (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) Tony's father and a swamp person. He and the Parson family live near the swamp. His wife is Lily (who did not appear until later episodes). In the 3rd episode, \"The Bad Seed\", it is shown that, in the western era, he was the outlaw Bad Seed's sidekick Little Hat in his childhood; at the time, he was very short, and he resembled his future son Tony. Little Hat wore a cowboy outfit and has a hat that covers his head.\n* Mr. Pretty: (voiced by [[Jay Brazeau]]) A \"friend\" of Wayne and Lucien's. In the past, Mr Pretty's mom bullied Dorothy Cramp, and his father bullied Horace Cramp. In the European version he is the overly peppy principal of the school, whose methods to an extent annoy the Cramps. He is often quick to blame Miss Hissy for his own incompetence.\n* Lillian \"Lilly\" Parsons: (voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]]) Seth's wife and the mother of Tony and his siblings. Lucien once had a crush on her, much to Tony's annoyance.\n* Mrs. Phelps: Mari's mother. She is the strictest member of the family. Voiced by Kath Soucie.\n* Vinnie Phelps: Mari's dad. He worked as a barber in his first appearance and then as the vice principal of the school. Voiced by Ian James Cortlett and Tom Kenny in \"No Means Yes\".\n* Principal Earlington Richard Quartermaine: Earlington is the principal of the school and Hillary's boss. He was Mrs. Phelps' ex-boyfriend.\n* Agent X: (voiced by Phil Hayes) is a mysterious cleaning agent. There is evidence to support he is an undercover spy, for example, he gave Mr. Cramp a suitcase containing \"spy protection gear\".\n\n===Minor===\n* Mrs. Winkle: (voiced by Cathy Weseluck) Wendy's mother and Walter Winkle's wife. She behaves more or less like her husband, but ignores/denies the fact they're related to Swamp People.\n* Barber: The barber who replaced Mr. Phelps. Mrs. Cramp takes Lucien and Wayne to see him, and due to a number of circumstances, ends up shutting down his shop entirely. He appears to dislike and to be scared of Tony, as Tony did not pay his hair shaving fees.\n* Rodeo Rita: (voiced by Kath Soucie) A bull rider and country yodeler who turns out to be a fraud. Mr. Cramp is a big fan of hers, and has a crush on her; the revelation did almost nothing to affect his opinion of her.\n* Big Baby: The boys' unnamed female cousin. Although she is five years old, she can barely speak or walk. According to Mrs. Cramp, she \"puts all her energy into growing\". She is also shown to be very strong, smart and manipulative, as she manages to get away with using the twins as piggy back rides, or in her case \"ponies\". She outwits the twins after they try to tell on her and prove her mischief, but she was exposed by the end of the episode.\n* Marsha and Tandy: Dorothy's so-called friends. They are usually seen in town but their names are not always given, meaning that they sometimes make cameos in some episodes. Marsha is voiced by Ellen Kennedy and Tandy is voiced by Iris Quinn. They are often seen arguing or insulting each other and often take delight in Mrs Cramp's domestic Misfortunes (i.e. Wayne and/or Lucien embarrassing her, behaving in an unsanitary manner, etc).\n\n====The Winkles====\nThere is various evidence from sources that the Winkles are \"swamp folk\" and relations of Tony's ancestors. In the episode where the toilet is clogged Tony and his father cites \"the deeper you go, the more you know\" in realization that their basement links to Mr. Winkle's mansion's foundations, where his \"ancestors left for a pure and earthy existence\". In hearing this, he decided to pay Mr. Parsons the sum for cleaning the house that he before refused, otherwise their secret link would be revealed. Other sources are when the swamp was to be replaced with Wendy's \"Sweet Dream Valley\", Mr. Parsons pays a visit to Mr. Winkle reminding him \"you can take the man out of the swamp but you can't take the swamp out of the man\", reminding him they used to race with his swamp name \"Eely\". Mr. Winkle is almost always present and knows all swamp phenomenon, such as the mystery egg which, by swamp tradition, gave good luck. He also frequently visits the swamp to eat dumb radishes. Furthermore, he knows about the \"crested marsh swallow\", a swamp resident, and ordered them to be delivered to his residence when Tony told Lucien they are \"delicious\". In the episode \"Soap Day\" where it rains soap, Tony tells that the people of Soap City have an immunity to soap that outsiders, and Swamp Folk, don't. Later, Tony is seen delivering a package to Mr. Winkles house, where Mr. Winkle and Wendy were coughing. Mr. Winkle and Parsons become friends in the episode (Wendy Boy) where they camp out in the night. Mr. Winkle pays a visit to \"old man Parsons\" to prepare his food for him, suggesting he did this in the past. Mr. Winkle's office is full of various swamp objects, and in a number of episodes, Mrs. Winkle refers to the office as \"the ugly room.\" In the episode \"Cow Son\", when Lucien yells \"Ukyuba\" on the animal sounds contest, the eagle appeared and Mr. Winkle hits it like Mr. Parsons did. He is also shown, in a running gag, to be eating flies like a frog by the end of each episode he appears in.\n\n====Agent X====\nAgent X is a mysterious and charismatic character portrayed as an FBI Agent (or similar). He has neat, black hair, and always wears a black suit, a white shirt, and a black tie. It is suggested in episode 'Alien Glow', that he is an alien, and in episode 'Agent W', a spy.  While neither of these suspicions are confirmed, Agent X does have a talent for vanishing in fast and silent ways, impossible for normal people to perform. He appears to have an obsession for cleanliness, like Mrs. Cramp, who has a crush on him because of this, and because she likes his deep voice. However, Agent X often manipulates to achieve his goals, e.g. he gives Wayne sweets in return for information about Mrs. Cramp. Clever and articulate, Agent X always appears when something mysterious is happening in Soap City. During episode 'Alien Glow', Wayne believes aliens are landing. He tries to convince others the same by painting himself green and frightening the neighbours. At the end of the episode, Agent X finds traces of green paint on Wayne, and declares it the mark of alien abduction. Whether or not Agent X truly thought this isn't verified, but Agent X takes Wayne away, against Wayne's will, \"for tests and deprogramming\". The true nature of his 'abducting' Wayne is never revealed. It is unclear what Agent X's motive for coming to Soap City is. His name, place of residence, and who he works for, are all unknown.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Cramp Twins episodes}}\n{{:List of The Cramp Twins episodes}}\nIn total there are four seasons of ''The Cramp Twins''.

It is about Wayne Cramp ([[Tom Kenny]]) and Lucien Cramp ([[Kath Soucie]]), [[Fraternal twins|non-identical twin]] brothers who live with their [[mysophobia|germophobic]] [[mother]] Dorothy ([[Nicole Oliver]]) and their Western-obsessed [[father]] Horace ([[Ian James Corlett]]) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucien's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe ([[Lee Tockar]]), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Jayne Peterson) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss Hillary Hissy ([[Cathy Weseluck]] who also plays Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons ([[Terry Klassen]], who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).\n\nThe first season premiered in the United Kingdom on 3 September 2001 on [[BBC One]], [[Cartoon Network (UK & Ireland)|Cartoon Network UK]] in October and on September 10, 2001 on [[CBBC]], respectively and reached high popularity with children; the season ended on 21 June 2002. The second season premiered in Summer 2003 and finished in Autumn of the same year. The third season started in 2004 and ended in 2005. The fourth and final season began in 2006 and ended that same year, but [[Rerun|repeats]] of the show continued to air for some time afterwards in the UK. The show is currently licensed to [[Cartoon Network]]. In the US, season one premiered February 8, 2003 on [[Fox Box]] (later known as [[4Kids TV]]) where all four seasons aired until the show's end in 2006. The season three finale however remains unaired in the US when the show was cancelled on February 26, 2005 to continue to air [[Mew Mew Power]] in its timeslot. Cramp Twins returned to 4Kids TV in 2006 to finish the show's run. It also showed in some parts of Africa.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main===\n* Wayne Cramp (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is the younger of the twins, but is taller than Lucien. Wayne is energetic, egotistical, manipulative, rude and descriptive, and the less intelligent of the two. He is also the bully of their class and feared by most kids. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by his only friend, Dirty Joe Muldoon. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Apart from sweet stuff, he also likes fast-food. He is also shown to be a self-taught mechanical genius in various episodes, like building an entire \"Road-Ready Drag Racer\" out of his bed, turning his bed into a trampoline, welding together various junk to create an Egyptian-style temple or taking good care of the Junkyard when Joe's out of town. He is shown to have a softer side when he creates his own imaginary brother out of an old arcade board after being banned from playing with Lucien.\n* Lucien Cramp (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) is Wayne's older twin brother, as the opening credits indicate. Lucien is the smarter of the twins, and is considered an \"eco-nerd.\" Despite being the older twin, Lucien is the favorite target of Wayne's bullying nature, and Wayne frequently refers to him with the nickname \"Girl Pants\". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a [[vegetarian]]. Lucien longs for a pet, either a cat, a dog, or a hamster, but due to his mother's extreme cleanliness rules, he cannot have one. To combat this, Lucien secretly keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about; his mom and dad are unaware that he has it. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a [[Coulrophobia|fear of clowns]]. He has many skills, including [[knitting]], and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is often seen trying to promote environmental awareness, usually through protesting against the environmentally unfriendly products or activities rife in Soap City. However, due to the disinterest or, in some cases, dislike many of its residents have towards nature (and especially the swamp), these attempts are almost always ignored, belittled or ridiculed; he is frequently teased by other children. He has a crush on Tony's mom as shown in one episode.\n* Dorothy Cramp (n\u00e9e O'Neil) (voiced by [[Nicole Oliver]]), is the yellow-skinned short-tempered, strict mother to the twins, and wife of Horace Cramp. She is a complete germaphobe and neat freak. Her obsession for cleanliness is a major source of comedy in the show. She once raided the twins' rooms and husband's storage to check their cleanliness, which resulted in her kicking them out of the house due to Wayne's junk, Lucien's mud for his worms, and Horace's Rodeo Rita picture. She is something of a scientist by way of cleaning products, for she often mixes home-made cleaning formulas to seek out the strongest germ-killer, which seems to awaken her twisted desire to clean everything \"to the brim\". This is described by Horace as having \"The Cleanies\" and happens every once in a while which results in everyone preparing for shelter because she always desires to test it on them first \"for safety\". She has a crush on fellow clean-freak Agent X, who is suspected by Lucien to be an alien and is a frequent fuel of jealousy for Horace.\n* Horace Cramp (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) is the green-skinned and dim-witted man-child father of Wayne and Lucien and husband of Dorothy Cramp. He works at the local soap and cleaner products factory. He is also a third-rate cowboy, being obsessed with pretty much anything Western-oriented, including \"cowgirl\" Rodeo Rita, much to his wife's disapproval. He is always fruitlessly trying to impress his boss, Mr. Winkle, although is quite incompetent, and hated by his [[mother-in-law]]. By the 4th season his cowardice has almost completely disappeared as a result of Wayne's attempt to use him as a source of income in one episode.\n* Tony Parsons (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) is Lucien's best friend (although they have been known to fall out) and a swamp child. He possesses a vast knowledge about the swamp, its people's traditions, and natural history. He has many brothers and sisters. Tony's dad's name is Seth and his mom's is Lily. Tony is extremely short (about a half metre tall) and finds it hampers his day-to-day life, e.g. riding a bicycle, but uses equipment to aid him, e.g. he wears a flag-meet-helmet whilst riding his specially-designed bike so other road users can see him. Apart from this, Tony's height doesn't seem to effect his self-esteem. As his father also used to be very short, it can be presumed that Tony is also going to grow taller. He and Mari are Lucien's only friends in the show. A running gag in the show is Tony's belief in supernatural things, like magic and aliens. Lucien often tries to argue against Tony's beliefs, using vague scientific facts, though Lucien always ends up standing corrected.\n* Wendy Winkle (voiced by Jayne Paterson) is the only daughter of Walter Winkle. Wendy is a bubbly but very spoiled brat who has an obvious crush on Wayne. Because of her immense wealth she has a tendency to get her way and bullies pretty much anyone. Throughout the series, she tries everything to win Wayne's heart, yet is always unsuccessful. However, she seems to exhibit an attraction to even Lucien sometimes, but she always ends up backing away from it in the end, with little regard to what happened and why.\n* Mari Phelps (voiced by [[Tabitha St. Germain]]) is Lucien's other friend. She often co-operates with Lucien on his environment-conserving efforts, but often can't help desiring a bit of power. She is a foster child and is looked after by a happiness-obsessed, brown-haired family with strange [[Mormonism|mormonist]] based customs. She is the black sheep of her foster family and is often embarrassed by their habits. Lucien briefly had a crush on Mari when she felt sorry for him during a time he felt certain he would never have a girlfriend, but nothing came of it. However, they remain good friends.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Dirty Joe Muldoon: (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]) A dim-witted, lonely, middle-aged man who owns the local junkyard frequented by Wayne. He is Wayne's best and only friend. He is an [[unseen character]] (except for a hand and part of his clothes). According to one episode, he had never bathed or showered in his life, and he showers for the first time in his life when he comes to live with the Cramps.\n* Walter Winkle: (voiced by Colin Murdock) Mr Cramp's boss and Wendy's father. He owns the city's soap-producing factory. He is a very unlikable man who practically owns the town, since many of the residents work for him and don't dare to cross him. It is hinted in many episodes that he is in fact a swamp person and that he and Mr Parsons knew each other as children. The reason why he doesn't disapprove of his daughter's toxic influence over him is often regarded as a desire for her not to hate him which could result in a falling out that will guarantee his loneliness, which is why he frequently asks for other people to solve his problems regarding her.\n* Hillary Hissy: (voiced by [[Cathy Weseluck]]) Hillary (Miss Hissy) is Wayne's, Lucien's, Wendy's and Mari's oversized teacher. She hates children and is a friend of Dirty Joe. They were thought to be dating once, but it turned out she was only tutoring him. Miss Hissy has also been shown to have a crush on Horace Cramp (Wayne and Lucien's father) and Mr Winkle. She is very unlikeable and her teaching methods usually involve bullying her students. Her catch-phrase is \"tout de suite\". In one episode it is revealed that she is a [[karate]] [[expert]]. She owns a long stick with hammered bottle caps on it (called 'The Crank') and threatens students into behaving by shaking it in an aggressive manner.\n* Seth Parsons: (voiced by [[Terry Klassen]]) Tony's father and a swamp person. He and the Parson family live near the swamp. His wife is Lily (who did not appear until later episodes). In the 3rd episode, \"The Bad Seed\", it is shown that, in the western era, he was the outlaw Bad Seed's sidekick Little Hat in his childhood; at the time, he was very short, and he resembled his future son Tony. Little Hat wore a cowboy outfit and has a hat that covers his head.\n* Mr. Pretty: (voiced by [[Jay Brazeau]]) A \"friend\" of Wayne and Lucien's. In the past, Mr Pretty's mom bullied Dorothy Cramp, and his father bullied Horace Cramp. In the European version he is the overly peppy principal of the school, whose methods to an extent annoy the Cramps. He is often quick to blame Miss Hissy for his own incompetence.\n* Lillian \"Lilly\" Parsons: (voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]]) Seth's wife and the mother of Tony and his siblings. Lucien once had a crush on her, much to Tony's annoyance.\n* Mrs. Phelps: Mari's mother. She is the strictest member of the family. Voiced by Kath Soucie.\n* Vinnie Phelps: Mari's dad. He worked as a barber in his first appearance and then as the vice principal of the school. Voiced by Ian James Cortlett and Tom Kenny in \"No Means Yes\".\n* Principal Earlington Richard Quartermaine: Earlington is the principal of the school and Hillary's boss. He was Mrs. Phelps' ex-boyfriend.\n* Agent X: (voiced by Phil Hayes) is a mysterious cleaning agent. There is evidence to support he is an undercover spy, for example, he gave Mr. Cramp a suitcase containing \"spy protection gear\".\n\n===Minor===\n* Mrs. Winkle: (voiced by Cathy Weseluck) Wendy's mother and Walter Winkle's wife. She behaves more or less like her husband, but ignores/denies the fact they're related to Swamp People.\n* Barber: The barber who replaced Mr. Phelps. Mrs. Cramp takes Lucien and Wayne to see him, and due to a number of circumstances, ends up shutting down his shop entirely. He appears to dislike and to be scared of Tony, as Tony did not pay his hair shaving fees.\n* Rodeo Rita: (voiced by Kath Soucie) A bull rider and country yodeler who turns out to be a fraud. Mr. Cramp is a big fan of hers, and has a crush on her; the revelation did almost nothing to affect his opinion of her.\n* Big Baby: The boys' unnamed female cousin. Although she is five years old, she can barely speak or walk. According to Mrs. Cramp, she \"puts all her energy into growing\". She is also shown to be very strong, smart and manipulative, as she manages to get away with using the twins as piggy back rides, or in her case \"ponies\". She outwits the twins after they try to tell on her and prove her mischief, but she was exposed by the end of the episode.\n* Marsha and Tandy: Dorothy's so-called friends. They are usually seen in town but their names are not always given, meaning that they sometimes make cameos in some episodes. Marsha is voiced by Ellen Kennedy and Tandy is voiced by Iris Quinn. They are often seen arguing or insulting each other and often take delight in Mrs Cramp's domestic Misfortunes (i.e. Wayne and/or Lucien embarrassing her, behaving in an unsanitary manner, etc).\n\n====The Winkles====\nThere is various evidence from sources that the Winkles are \"swamp folk\" and relations of Tony's ancestors. In the episode where the toilet is clogged Tony and his father cites \"the deeper you go, the more you know\" in realization that their basement links to Mr. Winkle's mansion's foundations, where his \"ancestors left for a pure and earthy existence\". In hearing this, he decided to pay Mr. Parsons the sum for cleaning the house that he before refused, otherwise their secret link would be revealed. Other sources are when the swamp was to be replaced with Wendy's \"Sweet Dream Valley\", Mr. Parsons pays a visit to Mr. Winkle reminding him \"you can take the man out of the swamp but you can't take the swamp out of the man\", reminding him they used to race with his swamp name \"Eely\". Mr. Winkle is almost always present and knows all swamp phenomenon, such as the mystery egg which, by swamp tradition, gave good luck. He also frequently visits the swamp to eat dumb radishes. Furthermore, he knows about the \"crested marsh swallow\", a swamp resident, and ordered them to be delivered to his residence when Tony told Lucien they are \"delicious\". In the episode \"Soap Day\" where it rains soap, Tony tells that the people of Soap City have an immunity to soap that outsiders, and Swamp Folk, don't. Later, Tony is seen delivering a package to Mr. Winkles house, where Mr. Winkle and Wendy were coughing. Mr. Winkle and Parsons become friends in the episode (Wendy Boy) where they camp out in the night. Mr. Winkle pays a visit to \"old man Parsons\" to prepare his food for him, suggesting he did this in the past. Mr. Winkle's office is full of various swamp objects, and in a number of episodes, Mrs. Winkle refers to the office as \"the ugly room.\" In the episode \"Cow Son\", when Lucien yells \"Ukyuba\" on the animal sounds contest, the eagle appeared and Mr. Winkle hits it like Mr. Parsons did. He is also shown, in a running gag, to be eating flies like a frog by the end of each episode he appears in.\n\n====Agent X====\nAgent X is a mysterious and charismatic character portrayed as an FBI Agent (or similar). He has neat, black hair, and always wears a black suit, a white shirt, and a black tie. It is suggested in episode 'Alien Glow', that he is an alien, and in episode 'Agent W', a spy.  While neither of these suspicions are confirmed, Agent X does have a talent for vanishing in fast and silent ways, impossible for normal people to perform. He appears to have an obsession for cleanliness, like Mrs. Cramp, who has a crush on him because of this, and because she likes his deep voice. However, Agent X often manipulates to achieve his goals, e.g. he gives Wayne sweets in return for information about Mrs. Cramp. Clever and articulate, Agent X always appears when something mysterious is happening in Soap City. During episode 'Alien Glow', Wayne believes aliens are landing. He tries to convince others the same by painting himself green and frightening the neighbours. At the end of the episode, Agent X finds traces of green paint on Wayne, and declares it the mark of alien abduction. Whether or not Agent X truly thought this isn't verified, but Agent X takes Wayne away, against Wayne's will, \"for tests and deprogramming\". The true nature of his 'abducting' Wayne is never revealed. It is unclear what Agent X's motive for coming to Soap City is. His name, place of residence, and who he works for, are all unknown.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of The Cramp Twins episodes}}\n{{:List of The Cramp Twins episodes}}\nIn total there are four seasons of ''The Cramp Twins''.

It was hosted by [[Rolf Harris]], the Australian television presenter. The series began in 2001, and the most recent episode was made in 2007. It was followed by Harris's other art programme, ''[[Star Portraits with Rolf Harris]]'', which was released after the success of ''Rolf on Art''.\n\nEach episode revolved around Harris looking at a various notable artist from history, and both investigating their life as well as imitating their style of art.\n\n==Rolf Harris's style==\nUnlike many other art presenters, Harris did not just look and talk about an artist's work: he created works in their own style. This was a key part of the shows' success. For each episode, he usually painted two pictures in their style, normally in the same place where they created their works. Some episodes were big events, which were held in a public place, such as [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. Harris presented these but many other people (both celebrities and the general public) were enlisted to paint.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series One \u2013 ''The Impressionists''===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Art rolfonart 2s.jpg|thumb|200px| Rolf's self portrait in Van Gogh's style]] -->\nIn the first series, from 2001, Harris looked at the [[Impressionists]], a group he has a great affinity for:\n# '''[[Claude Monet]]'''\n# '''[[Edgar Degas]]'''\n# '''[[Vincent van Gogh]]'''\n# '''[[Paul Gauguin]]'''\n\n===Series Two \u2013 ''The Post-Impressionists''===\nIn the second series, he looked at several artists who worked around and after the time of the Impressionists, but were not Impressionists.\n# '''[[Henri Rousseau]]''' \u2013 the French painter of 2D Jungle scenes\n# '''[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]''' \u2013 the French painter of the ''[[At the Moulin Rouge|Moulin Rouge]]''\n# '''[[Gustav Klimt]]''' \u2013 the artist who worked in gold leaf\n# '''[[Auguste Rodin]]''' \u2013 the famous sculptor\n\n===Series Three \u2013 ''20th-century Masters''===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Art rolfonart 1s.jpg|thumb|200px|Rolf's picture in Toulouse-Lautrec's style]] -->\n# '''[[L.

M. W. Turner]]'''\n# '''[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]'''\n\n===''The Christmas Special''===\nIn this special, Harris looked at [[Christmas card]] making. The card he produced was mass-produced and sold for charity that year.\n\n===''The Africa Special''===\nHarris went on a tour of [[Africa]], looking at different styles on African art, including rock art, [[Makonde people|Makonde]] wood carving and [[Benin Bronzes]]. It was released to coincide with the [[Live 8]] festival in 2005 and the series of programmes on the BBC about Africa.\n\n===Series Five \u2013 ''Old Masters''===\n# '''The Big Event ~ [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'''\n# '''[[Thomas Gainsborough]]'''\n# '''[[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]]'''\n# '''[[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'''\n# '''The Big Event ~ [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'''\n\n===''The Queen, by Rolf''===\nThis special, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 1 January 2006, showed the creation of [[Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 An 80th Birthday Portrait|Harris's 80th birthday portrait painting]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&ID=388 Rolf Harris unveils official portrait of The Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse]</ref> It was highly publicised because the Queen had never been seen on such a programme before. In it, Harris goes to [[Buckingham Palace]] where he meets the Queen and paints her in an impressionist style. It is debatable whether it was a part of the ''Rolf on Art'' series, because it does not contain the title sequence or ''Rolf on Art'' in the title.

It was hosted by [[Rolf Harris]], the Australian television presenter. The series began in 2001, and the most recent episode was made in 2007. It was followed by Harris's other art programme, ''[[Star Portraits with Rolf Harris]]'', which was released after the success of ''Rolf on Art''.\n\nEach episode revolved around Harris looking at a various notable artist from history, and both investigating their life as well as imitating their style of art.\n\n==Rolf Harris's style==\nUnlike many other art presenters, Harris did not just look and talk about an artist's work: he created works in their own style. This was a key part of the shows' success. For each episode, he usually painted two pictures in their style, normally in the same place where they created their works. Some episodes were big events, which were held in a public place, such as [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. Harris presented these but many other people (both celebrities and the general public) were enlisted to paint.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series One \u2013 ''The Impressionists''===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Art rolfonart 2s.jpg|thumb|200px| Rolf's self portrait in Van Gogh's style]] -->\nIn the first series, from 2001, Harris looked at the [[Impressionists]], a group he has a great affinity for:\n# '''[[Claude Monet]]'''\n# '''[[Edgar Degas]]'''\n# '''[[Vincent van Gogh]]'''\n# '''[[Paul Gauguin]]'''\n\n===Series Two \u2013 ''The Post-Impressionists''===\nIn the second series, he looked at several artists who worked around and after the time of the Impressionists, but were not Impressionists.\n# '''[[Henri Rousseau]]''' \u2013 the French painter of 2D Jungle scenes\n# '''[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]''' \u2013 the French painter of the ''[[At the Moulin Rouge|Moulin Rouge]]''\n# '''[[Gustav Klimt]]''' \u2013 the artist who worked in gold leaf\n# '''[[Auguste Rodin]]''' \u2013 the famous sculptor\n\n===Series Three \u2013 ''20th-century Masters''===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Art rolfonart 1s.jpg|thumb|200px|Rolf's picture in Toulouse-Lautrec's style]] -->\n# '''[[L.

The card he produced was mass-produced and sold for charity that year.\n\n===''The Africa Special''===\nHarris went on a tour of [[Africa]], looking at different styles on African art, including rock art, [[Makonde people|Makonde]] wood carving and [[Benin Bronzes]]. It was released to coincide with the [[Live 8]] festival in 2005 and the series of programmes on the BBC about Africa.\n\n===Series Five \u2013 ''Old Masters''===\n# '''The Big Event ~ [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'''\n# '''[[Thomas Gainsborough]]'''\n# '''[[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]]'''\n# '''[[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'''\n# '''The Big Event ~ [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'''\n\n===''The Queen, by Rolf''===\nThis special, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 1 January 2006, showed the creation of [[Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II \u2013 An 80th Birthday Portrait|Harris's 80th birthday portrait painting]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref>[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&ID=388 Rolf Harris unveils official portrait of The Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse]</ref> It was highly publicised because the Queen had never been seen on such a programme before. In it, Harris goes to [[Buckingham Palace]] where he meets the Queen and paints her in an impressionist style. It is debatable whether it was a part of the ''Rolf on Art'' series, because it does not contain the title sequence or ''Rolf on Art'' in the title. However, it was advertised as a ''Rolf on Art'' special.\n\n===''Rolf on Lowry''===\nA one-off special, aired on 4 March 2007, where Harris followed in the footsteps of the painter [[L. S. Lowry]].

An important plot strand concentrates on a rift between two cousins ([[Claire Skinner]] and [[Toby Stephens]]) and their aunt ([[Lindsay Duncan]]) that has grown since the sudden death of the cousins' brother and Daniel's attempts to reunite the trio. An early incident of Raymond suffering a stroke while giving a withering speech to the reunion-goers and his subsequent bedridden state force him to appreciate the character of relatives that reflect his.

There were five series of the drama, shown on [[BBC One]].  The first two were composed of individual stories. Series three, four and five were each single stories composed over multiple episodes. [[Colin Bateman]] adapted the pilot for a [[Murphy's Law (novel)|novel]].\n\nA sixth series has not been commissioned. In a 2008 interview, Nesbitt attributed this to the fifth series' ratings being damaged after it was scheduled opposite [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s popular drama ''[[Doc Martin]]''.<ref>Dickson, E. Jane (3\u20139 May 2008). \"Of Muck and Men\". ''Radio Times''. BBC Magazines: pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nAll 23 episodes have since been released on DVD. All episodes from series two onwards were released as edited 50-minute masters instead of the 60-minute versions that were broadcast, except series 3 which was released uncut in the US. The first, second and third series were all released on 28 August 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-DVD-James-Nesbitt/dp/B000FGFTFA/|title=Murphy's Law: Series 1 [DVD] [2003]|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-DVD-James-Nesbitt/dp/B000FGFTFK/|title=Murphy's Law: Series 2 [DVD] [2003]|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-DVD-James-Nesbitt/dp/B000FGFTG4/|title=Murphy's Law: Series 3 [DVD] [2003]|publisher=}}</ref> The fourth and fifth series were released in a joint box-set on 15 October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-Complete-BBC-Kevin-Doyle/dp/B000L42N8W/|title=Murphy's Law : Complete BBC Series 4 & 5 [DVD]|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDetective Sergeant Tommy Murphy ([[James Nesbitt]]) is an uncompromising, sometimes tough talking cop. He has no issues with using his charm and sense of humour to attempt to impress any woman, especially Annie, his colleague and later boss. Murphy was previously married with a young daughter, in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653963/ Electric Bill] information from ''IMDB''</ref> There, his family were taken hostage and he was forced to make a choice; either carry a [[bomb]] and blow himself up in a local barracks, or have his daughter killed.\n\nHe originally chose the first option but when he got to the barracks he couldn't go through with detonating a bomb that would kill a hundred people. When he got back to the house, he found that they had slit his daughter's throat and that his wife had been forced to watch. His decision affected almost everything he does in life.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653969/ Manic Monday] information from ''IMDB''</ref> He reflects at intervals, and remarks that he received 'a nice medal' for 'saving' so many lives, by making such a sacrifice. Yet, he still feels responsible for his daughter's death.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653960/ Bent Moon On The Rise] information from ''IMDB''</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* D.S.

There were five series of the drama, shown on [[BBC One]].  The first two were composed of individual stories. Series three, four and five were each single stories composed over multiple episodes. [[Colin Bateman]] adapted the pilot for a [[Murphy's Law (novel)|novel]].\n\nA sixth series has not been commissioned. In a 2008 interview, Nesbitt attributed this to the fifth series' ratings being damaged after it was scheduled opposite [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s popular drama ''[[Doc Martin]]''.<ref>Dickson, E. Jane (3\u20139 May 2008). \"Of Muck and Men\". ''Radio Times''. BBC Magazines: pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nAll 23 episodes have since been released on DVD. All episodes from series two onwards were released as edited 50-minute masters instead of the 60-minute versions that were broadcast, except series 3 which was released uncut in the US. The first, second and third series were all released on 28 August 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-DVD-James-Nesbitt/dp/B000FGFTFA/|title=Murphy's Law: Series 1 [DVD] [2003]|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-DVD-James-Nesbitt/dp/B000FGFTFK/|title=Murphy's Law: Series 2 [DVD] [2003]|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-DVD-James-Nesbitt/dp/B000FGFTG4/|title=Murphy's Law: Series 3 [DVD] [2003]|publisher=}}</ref> The fourth and fifth series were released in a joint box-set on 15 October 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Murphys-Law-Complete-BBC-Kevin-Doyle/dp/B000L42N8W/|title=Murphy's Law : Complete BBC Series 4 & 5 [DVD]|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDetective Sergeant Tommy Murphy ([[James Nesbitt]]) is an uncompromising, sometimes tough talking cop. He has no issues with using his charm and sense of humour to attempt to impress any woman, especially Annie, his colleague and later boss. Murphy was previously married with a young daughter, in [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653963/ Electric Bill] information from ''IMDB''</ref> There, his family were taken hostage and he was forced to make a choice; either carry a [[bomb]] and blow himself up in a local barracks, or have his daughter killed.\n\nHe originally chose the first option but when he got to the barracks he couldn't go through with detonating a bomb that would kill a hundred people. When he got back to the house, he found that they had slit his daughter's throat and that his wife had been forced to watch. His decision affected almost everything he does in life.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653969/ Manic Monday] information from ''IMDB''</ref> He reflects at intervals, and remarks that he received 'a nice medal' for 'saving' so many lives, by making such a sacrifice. Yet, he still feels responsible for his daughter's death.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0653960/ Bent Moon On The Rise] information from ''IMDB''</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* D.S.
