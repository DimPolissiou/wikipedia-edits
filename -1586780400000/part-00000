He works as sporting director for [[Aris Thessaloniki]].\n\nAt club level he has played for [[Aris Thessaloniki]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Feyenoord]], [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], [[AC Arles-Avignon|Arles-Avignon]], and [[Al-Nassr FC|Al-Nassr]].\n\nInternationally, he was capped 88 times by [[Greece national football team|Greece]], scoring 25 goals. He was a member of the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] winning team, scoring three goals, including the winning goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final against Portugal]]. He also represented Greece at [[Euro 2008]] and the [[2010 World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Aris Thessaloniki===\nAfter a few years playing for non-league Strimonikos Serron, Charisteas eventually started his professional career with Greek side [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]]. It was during his first season at Aris that Charisteas started making a name for himself, scoring twice in nine matches as they won the Greek second division in 1997\u201398. Charisteas started well in his first season in the Greek top league and got further noticed when he scored twice in the local derby against Thessaloniki rivals [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]]. The striker made twelve appearances in the [[Superleague Greece|Alpha Ethniki]] \u2013 six as a substitute \u2013 before a loan at [[Athinaikos F.C.|Athinaikos]] in 1998\u201399. He returned to Aris the following season and made his European debut in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] defeat by [[Celta de Vigo]] at the age of 19. Charisteas was continuously developing and in the 2000\u201301 season, where he scored seven goals.\n\n===Werder Bremen===\nHaving been watched by scouts from a number of Europe's leading sides,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} he was signed by German [[Bundesliga]] side [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the summer of 2002. The transfer fee paid to Aris was reported as \u20ac3 million.<ref name=\"ajax\">{{cite news |title=Werders Grieche wechselt zu Ajax |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/angelos-charisteas-werders-grieche-wechselt-zu-ajax-a-334387.html |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Der Spiegel |date=23 December 2004 |language=German}}</ref> He had a successful first season scoring nine goals in 31 appearances in the Bundesliga and two goals from four games in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|2003\u201304 season]], Werder Bremen won the Bundesliga and the [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] with Charisteas scoring four goals from 24 appearances.\n\nOn 29 September 2004, Charisteas contributed a goal in his side's 2\u20131 win against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Charisteas und Klose f\u00fchren Werder zum Sieg |url=https://rp-online.de/sport/fussball/champions-league/charisteas-und-klose-fuehren-werder-zum-sieg_aid-16826239 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Rheinische Post |date=29 September 2004 |language=German}}</ref> In total, he scored five goals in 11 matches for Werder Bremen the 2004\u201305 season.\n\n===Ajax===\nIn December 2004, Charisteas moved to the Netherlands to play for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] for a reported fee nearly \u20ac5 million.<ref name=\"ajax\"/> Greece manager [[Otto Rehhagel]] had publicly urged Charisteas to try to move to another club during the January 2005 transfer window, in order to get more first-team action. Ajax fitted the bill, as they were hoping to find a replacement for [[Sweden national football team|Swedish international]] striker [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]], who had been sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Charisteas made his Ajax debut on 23 January 2005 against [[FC Utrecht]] and scored his first goal four days later against [[SC Heerenveen]]. However, he only managed three more games all season. Charisteas netted home eight goals in the 2005\u201306 season, which included a late winner against [[Vitesse Arnhem]]. Charisteas missed Greece's crucial match in the World Cup qualifying due to a head injury received after colliding with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]] in a Champions League match which Ajax lost 2\u20131.\n\nUnder new Ajax manager [[Henk ten Cate]], Charisteas was the 5th striker behind [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]], [[Ryan Babel]], [[Markus Rosenberg]], and [[Rydell Poepon]]. Ten Cate explained this by saying that Charisteas is a great striker for the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u20132]] formation, but not for the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133]] formation, which is played for Ajax.\n\n===Feyenoord===\nDespite stating that he was only interested in a move to England or Germany, Charisteas signed for arch-rivals [[Feyenoord]] in [[Rotterdam]] on 31 August 2006, the final day of the summer transfer window. This move caused a great deal of agitation in Rotterdam with parts of [[Het Legioen|The Legion]], stating that they did not want an Ajax player at their club, protesting the move at [[De Kuip]] with the chant \"Wij willen geen neus.\" (translated as: \"we don't want a nose,\" nose being derogatory slang for Ajax players) and demanded that chairman [[Jorien van den Herik]] resign. Despite the protests, Charisteas made his debut for Feyenoord on 10 September against [[Sparta Rotterdam]] and played the full game. He eventually scored his first goal for his new club in his tenth game. Although he seemed to have convinced some fans at a certain point, Charisteas never enjoyed a good relationship with Feyenoord supporters. He finished the season having played a total of 28 games for Feyenoord, netting nine goals.\n\n===N\u00fcrnberg===\nOn 6 July 2007, [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] confirmed a deal with Feyenoord to sign Charisteas on a four-year deal worth \u20ac2.5 million.<ref name=\"arles\">{{cite news |title=Charisteas wechselt nach Frankreich |url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/541186/artikel_Charisteas-wechselt-nach-Frankreich.html |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=kicker Online |date=16 August 2010 |language=German}}</ref> He scored his first two official team goals in a 6\u20130 victory against fourth division club [[SC Victoria Hamburg]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 2009\u201310 season, he returned to the newly promoted N\u00fcrnberg. His first goal of the season came on 12 March 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the 1\u20132 away win against [[Hertha BSC]], helping N\u00fcrnberg to avoid the relegation, before [[Otto Rehhagel]] called him up to the Greece national team for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].\n\n===Bayer Leverkusen===\nOn 2 February 2009, he was loaned out to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] until the end of the season,<ref name=\"arles\"/> helping the team to reach the final of the German Cup.\n\n===Arles-Avignon===\nOn 10 August 2010, Charisteas signed for [[AC Arles-Avignon|Arles-Avignon]], along with teammate [[Angelos Basinas]].<ref>{{cite news | title = ACAA: \u00e0 la sauce grecque | url = http://www.ledauphine.com/isere-sud/2010/08/16/a-la-sauce-grecque | newspaper = [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] | date = 16 August 2010 | accessdate = 8 June 2011 | language = French | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723104806/http://www.ledauphine.com/isere-sud/2010/08/16/a-la-sauce-grecque| archivedate= 23 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"arles\"/> He made his debut on 21 August 2010 in a 1\u20132 away defeat against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53646 | title = Toulouse v.

Charisteas signed a contract on 30 June 2011, until the end of the season. In his debut match for Schalke, he scored the second goal in a 2\u20131 home win against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. It was his first touch of the ball, having been on the pitch for only 52 seconds. On 13 April 2011, Charisteas reached the semi-finals of the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League]] with Schalke, beating in the quarter-finals the defending champion [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], Charisteas replaced the Brazilian [[Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves de Oliveira|Edu]] in the 32nd minute of the second half. Schalke 04 and Charisteas reached a result never achieved before.\n\nOn 21 May 2011, Charisteas won the German Cup with Schalke 04.\n\n===Panetolikos===\nOn 27 July 2011, Charisteas joined [[Panetolikos F.C.|Panetolikos]], newly promoted to the [[Superleague Greece|Super League]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Griechenland: Charisteas kehrt heim |url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/intligen/startseite/555739/artikel_griechenland_charisteas-kehrt-heim.html |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=kicker Online |date=27 July 2007 |language=German}}</ref> signing a one-year contract. His first goal of the season came on 14 September 2011 when he scored the winning goal in the 1\u20130 home win against [[Asteras Tripoli F.C.|Asteras Tripolis]].\n\n===Al-Nassr===\nAfter interest from Inter Milan, reported in the newspaper ''Corriere dello Sport'', on 17 February 2013, Charisteas signed a one and a half year contract with [[Al-Nassr FC]]. Charisteas played his debut in the final of the [[2012\u201313 Saudi Crown Prince Cup]] against [[Al-Hilal FC]] on 22 February 2013. After 90 minutes penalties had to be taken and Charisteas missed the fourth.\n\n==International career==\nHaving been a regular player for the Greek Under-21 side, Charisteas made his senior international debut in February 2001 in a 3\u20133 draw against [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. His impact was immediate as he scored two of the goals for Greece that day. His prolific goal scoring continued, eventually helping his team qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]].\n\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Charisteas scores for Greece in the Euro 2004 final against Portugal on 4 July]]\nDuring the victorious Euro 2004 campaign, Charisteas scored three goals: one in the group stage against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], one against [[France national football team|France]] in the quarterfinals and the winning goal against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the final. His contribution to the team and his impact in the competition was further recognised when he was named in the Euro 2004 All-star Team and he was also nominated for the [[2004 Ballon d'Or]] award, where he finished 11th in votes.\n\nIn January 2007, Charisteas told Dutch football magazine Voetbal International that winning Euro 2004 was an unbelievable experience which he would not swap for all the money in the world: \"Even in 50 years time, everybody will remember that I scored the goal which made Greece the champions of Europe. We wrote history and my life changed completely at that point.\"\n\nIn the qualifying rounds for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], Charisteas scored three goals, helping Greece to automatically qualify for the competition with two games left. He would go on to be one of the few Greek players who performed well at Euro 2008, scoring the defending champions' only goal of the tournament in the 2\u20131 defeat to Spain. He also scored 4 goals for his country in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]].\n\nCharisteas was part of the squad that travelled to South Africa for the final tournament, where he played one game and he was the only Greek player with [[Giourkas Seitaridis]], [[Kostas Katsouranis]], [[Georgios Karagounis]] and the goalkeeper [[Kostas Chalkias]] to participate in 2 European Championships and a World Cup.\n\nCharisteas was called up again on 8 October 2011 for the qualification match against Croatia, and on 11 October 2011, where he scored the winning goal in the 85th minute in Georgia, securing a 2\u20131 victory which sent Greece automatically to the Euro 2012 Championships. With this goal, Charisteas score in three qualifiers for European Championships and for three consecutive World Cups, became the only player to reach that in the Greek national team.\n\nCharisteas also became the second top scorer for the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]] with 25 goals, four less than the retired [[Nikos Anastopoulos]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Angelos Charisteas \u2013 Goals in International Matches | publisher = The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation| url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/charisteas-intlg.html | date = 29 February 2012 | first = Roberto | last = Mamrud | accessdate = 30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nIn 2019, Charisteas became sporting director of his former club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Werder Bremen-Legende Angelos Charisteas erkl\u00e4rt sein Doppelleben! |url=https://www.deichstube.de/news/werder-bremen-angelos-charisteas-doppelleben-manager-aris-saloniki-politiker-griechenland-13362781.html |accessdate=8 January 2020 |work=Deichstube |publisher=Kreiszeitung |language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=G\u00f3mez |first1=Sergio |title=Greek top flight side Aris Thessaloniki sound out Guti |url=https://en.as.com/en/2019/09/10/football/1568103442_864323.html |website=AS |accessdate=8 January 2020 |date=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nDuring his time as a footballer, Charisteas was known to play the [[Bouzouki]] in his spare time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Angelos Charisteas |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/greece/players_to_watch/3654607.stm |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n:Source:<ref name=\"nft\">{{NFT player|2644|accessdate=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[Aris Thessaloniki FC|Aris Thessaloniki]]||1997\u201398||[[Beta Ethniki]]||9||2||1||0||0||0||10||2\n|-\n|1998\u201399||rowspan=\"4\"|[[Super League Greece|Alpha Ethniki]]||12||4||2||0||0||0||14||4\n|-\n|1999\u201300||19||1||2||1||1||0||22||2\n|-\n|2000\u201301||28||8||3||2||0||0||31||10\n|-\n|2001\u201302||19||4||2||1||0||0||21||5\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!87||19||10||4||1||0||98||23\n|-\n|[[Athinaikos]]||1998\u201399||Beta Ethniki||7||1||0||0||0||0||7||1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]||2002\u201303||rowspan=\"3\"|[[Bundesliga]]||31||9||4||4||4||2||39||15\n|-\n|2003\u201304||24||4||5||2||3||1||32||7\n|-\n|2004\u201305||11||5||2||0||5||1||18||6\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!66||18||11||6||12||4||89||28\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]||2004\u201305||rowspan=\"3\"|[[Eredivisie]]||13||4||0||0||0||0||13||4\n|-\n|2005\u201306||17||8||3||1||4||0||24||9\n|-\n|2006\u201307||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!31||12||3||1||4||0||38||13\n|-\n|[[Feyenoord Rotterdam]]||2006\u201307||Eredivisie||28||9||3||1||5||1||36||11\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[1.

He works as sporting director for [[Aris Thessaloniki]].\n\nAt club level he has played for [[Aris Thessaloniki]], [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[Feyenoord]], [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]], [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], [[AC Arles-Avignon|Arles-Avignon]], and [[Al-Nassr FC|Al-Nassr]].\n\nInternationally, he was capped 88 times by [[Greece national football team|Greece]], scoring 25 goals. He was a member of the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] winning team, scoring three goals, including the winning goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|final against Portugal]]. He also represented Greece at [[Euro 2008]] and the [[2010 World Cup]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Aris Thessaloniki===\nAfter a few years playing for non-league Strimonikos Serron, Charisteas eventually started his professional career with Greek side [[Aris Thessaloniki F.C.|Aris Thessaloniki]]. It was during his first season at Aris that Charisteas started making a name for himself, scoring twice in nine matches as they won the Greek second division in 1997\u201398. Charisteas started well in his first season in the Greek top league and got further noticed when he scored twice in the local derby against Thessaloniki rivals [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]]. The striker made twelve appearances in the [[Superleague Greece|Alpha Ethniki]] \u2013 six as a substitute \u2013 before a loan at [[Athinaikos F.C.|Athinaikos]] in 1998\u201399. He returned to Aris the following season and made his European debut in a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] defeat by [[Celta de Vigo]] at the age of 19. Charisteas was continuously developing and in the 2000\u201301 season, where he scored seven goals.\n\n===Werder Bremen===\nHaving been watched by scouts from a number of Europe's leading sides,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} he was signed by German [[Bundesliga]] side [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]] in the summer of 2002. The transfer fee paid to Aris was reported as \u20ac3 million.<ref name=\"ajax\">{{cite news |title=Werders Grieche wechselt zu Ajax |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/angelos-charisteas-werders-grieche-wechselt-zu-ajax-a-334387.html |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Der Spiegel |date=23 December 2004 |language=German}}</ref> He had a successful first season scoring nine goals in 31 appearances in the Bundesliga and two goals from four games in the UEFA Cup.\n\nIn the [[2003\u201304 Bundesliga|2003\u201304 season]], Werder Bremen won the Bundesliga and the [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] with Charisteas scoring four goals from 24 appearances.\n\nOn 29 September 2004, Charisteas contributed a goal in his side's 2\u20131 win against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Charisteas und Klose f\u00fchren Werder zum Sieg |url=https://rp-online.de/sport/fussball/champions-league/charisteas-und-klose-fuehren-werder-zum-sieg_aid-16826239 |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=Rheinische Post |date=29 September 2004 |language=German}}</ref> In total, he scored five goals in 11 matches for Werder Bremen the 2004\u201305 season.\n\n===Ajax===\nIn December 2004, Charisteas moved to the Netherlands to play for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] for a reported fee nearly \u20ac5 million.<ref name=\"ajax\"/> Greece manager [[Otto Rehhagel]] had publicly urged Charisteas to try to move to another club during the January 2005 transfer window, in order to get more first-team action. Ajax fitted the bill, as they were hoping to find a replacement for [[Sweden national football team|Swedish international]] striker [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]], who had been sold to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Charisteas made his Ajax debut on 23 January 2005 against [[FC Utrecht]] and scored his first goal four days later against [[SC Heerenveen]]. However, he only managed three more games all season. Charisteas netted home eight goals in the 2005\u201306 season, which included a late winner against [[Vitesse Arnhem]]. Charisteas missed Greece's crucial match in the World Cup qualifying due to a head injury received after colliding with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Kolo Tour\u00e9]] in a Champions League match which Ajax lost 2\u20131.\n\nUnder new Ajax manager [[Henk ten Cate]], Charisteas was the 5th striker behind [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]], [[Ryan Babel]], [[Markus Rosenberg]], and [[Rydell Poepon]]. Ten Cate explained this by saying that Charisteas is a great striker for the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20134\u20132|4\u20134\u20132]] formation, but not for the [[Formation (association football)#4\u20133\u20133|4\u20133\u20133]] formation, which is played for Ajax.\n\n===Feyenoord===\nDespite stating that he was only interested in a move to England or Germany, Charisteas signed for arch-rivals [[Feyenoord]] in [[Rotterdam]] on 31 August 2006, the final day of the summer transfer window. This move caused a great deal of agitation in Rotterdam with parts of [[Het Legioen|The Legion]], stating that they did not want an Ajax player at their club, protesting the move at [[De Kuip]] with the chant \"Wij willen geen neus.\" (translated as: \"we don't want a nose,\" nose being derogatory slang for Ajax players) and demanded that chairman [[Jorien van den Herik]] resign. Despite the protests, Charisteas made his debut for Feyenoord on 10 September against [[Sparta Rotterdam]] and played the full game. He eventually scored his first goal for his new club in his tenth game. Although he seemed to have convinced some fans at a certain point, Charisteas never enjoyed a good relationship with Feyenoord supporters. He finished the season having played a total of 28 games for Feyenoord, netting nine goals.\n\n===N\u00fcrnberg===\nOn 6 July 2007, [[1. FC N\u00fcrnberg]] confirmed a deal with Feyenoord to sign Charisteas on a four-year deal worth \u20ac2.5 million.<ref name=\"arles\">{{cite news |title=Charisteas wechselt nach Frankreich |url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/541186/artikel_Charisteas-wechselt-nach-Frankreich.html |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=kicker Online |date=16 August 2010 |language=German}}</ref> He scored his first two official team goals in a 6\u20130 victory against fourth division club [[SC Victoria Hamburg]].\n\nAt the beginning of the 2009\u201310 season, he returned to the newly promoted N\u00fcrnberg. His first goal of the season came on 12 March 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the 1\u20132 away win against [[Hertha BSC]], helping N\u00fcrnberg to avoid the relegation, before [[Otto Rehhagel]] called him up to the Greece national team for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].\n\n===Bayer Leverkusen===\nOn 2 February 2009, he was loaned out to [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]] until the end of the season,<ref name=\"arles\"/> helping the team to reach the final of the German Cup.\n\n===Arles-Avignon===\nOn 10 August 2010, Charisteas signed for [[AC Arles-Avignon|Arles-Avignon]], along with teammate [[Angelos Basinas]].<ref>{{cite news | title = ACAA: \u00e0 la sauce grecque | url = http://www.ledauphine.com/isere-sud/2010/08/16/a-la-sauce-grecque | newspaper = [[Le Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]] | date = 16 August 2010 | accessdate = 8 June 2011 | language = French | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110723104806/http://www.ledauphine.com/isere-sud/2010/08/16/a-la-sauce-grecque| archivedate= 23 July 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=\"arles\"/> He made his debut on 21 August 2010 in a 1\u20132 away defeat against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53646 | title = Toulouse v.

Charisteas signed a contract on 30 June 2011, until the end of the season. In his debut match for Schalke, he scored the second goal in a 2\u20131 home win against [[Eintracht Frankfurt]]. It was his first touch of the ball, having been on the pitch for only 52 seconds. On 13 April 2011, Charisteas reached the semi-finals of the [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League]] with Schalke, beating in the quarter-finals the defending champion [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]], Charisteas replaced the Brazilian [[Eduardo Gon\u00e7alves de Oliveira|Edu]] in the 32nd minute of the second half.

His first goal of the season came on 14 September 2011 when he scored the winning goal in the 1\u20130 home win against [[Asteras Tripoli F.C.|Asteras Tripolis]].\n\n===Al-Nassr===\nAfter interest from Inter Milan, reported in the newspaper ''Corriere dello Sport'', on 17 February 2013, Charisteas signed a one and a half year contract with [[Al-Nassr FC]]. Charisteas played his debut in the final of the [[2012\u201313 Saudi Crown Prince Cup]] against [[Al-Hilal FC]] on 22 February 2013. After 90 minutes penalties had to be taken and Charisteas missed the fourth.\n\n==International career==\nHaving been a regular player for the Greek Under-21 side, Charisteas made his senior international debut in February 2001 in a 3\u20133 draw against [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. His impact was immediate as he scored two of the goals for Greece that day. His prolific goal scoring continued, eventually helping his team qualify for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]].\n\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Charisteas scores for Greece in the Euro 2004 final against Portugal on 4 July]]\nDuring the victorious Euro 2004 campaign, Charisteas scored three goals: one in the group stage against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], one against [[France national football team|France]] in the quarterfinals and the winning goal against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in the final. His contribution to the team and his impact in the competition was further recognised when he was named in the Euro 2004 All-star Team and he was also nominated for the [[2004 Ballon d'Or]] award, where he finished 11th in votes.\n\nIn January 2007, Charisteas told Dutch football magazine Voetbal International that winning Euro 2004 was an unbelievable experience which he would not swap for all the money in the world: \"Even in 50 years time, everybody will remember that I scored the goal which made Greece the champions of Europe. We wrote history and my life changed completely at that point.\"\n\nIn the qualifying rounds for [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]], Charisteas scored three goals, helping Greece to automatically qualify for the competition with two games left. He would go on to be one of the few Greek players who performed well at Euro 2008, scoring the defending champions' only goal of the tournament in the 2\u20131 defeat to Spain. He also scored 4 goals for his country in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]].\n\nCharisteas was part of the squad that travelled to South Africa for the final tournament, where he played one game and he was the only Greek player with [[Giourkas Seitaridis]], [[Kostas Katsouranis]], [[Georgios Karagounis]] and the goalkeeper [[Kostas Chalkias]] to participate in 2 European Championships and a World Cup.\n\nCharisteas was called up again on 8 October 2011 for the qualification match against Croatia, and on 11 October 2011, where he scored the winning goal in the 85th minute in Georgia, securing a 2\u20131 victory which sent Greece automatically to the Euro 2012 Championships. With this goal, Charisteas score in three qualifiers for European Championships and for three consecutive World Cups, became the only player to reach that in the Greek national team.\n\nCharisteas also became the second top scorer for the [[Greece national football team|Greece national team]] with 25 goals, four less than the retired [[Nikos Anastopoulos]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Angelos Charisteas \u2013 Goals in International Matches | publisher = The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation| url = http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/charisteas-intlg.html | date = 29 February 2012 | first = Roberto | last = Mamrud | accessdate = 30 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Post-playing career==\nIn 2019, Charisteas became sporting director of his former club.<ref>{{cite news |title=Werder Bremen-Legende Angelos Charisteas erkl\u00e4rt sein Doppelleben! |url=https://www.deichstube.de/news/werder-bremen-angelos-charisteas-doppelleben-manager-aris-saloniki-politiker-griechenland-13362781.html |accessdate=8 January 2020 |work=Deichstube |publisher=Kreiszeitung |language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=G\u00f3mez |first1=Sergio |title=Greek top flight side Aris Thessaloniki sound out Guti |url=https://en.as.com/en/2019/09/10/football/1568103442_864323.html |website=AS |accessdate=8 January 2020 |date=10 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nDuring his time as a footballer, Charisteas was known to play the [[Bouzouki]] in his spare time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Angelos Charisteas |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/greece/players_to_watch/3654607.stm |accessdate=10 September 2018 |work=BBC News |date=25 May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Career statistics==\n===Club===\n:Source:<ref name=\"nft\">{{NFT player|2644|accessdate=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Club\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Season\n!colspan=\"3\"|League\n!colspan=\"2\"|Cup\n!colspan=\"2\"|Continental\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n|-\n!Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|[[Aris Thessaloniki FC|Aris Thessaloniki]]||1997\u201398||[[Beta Ethniki]]||9||2||1||0||0||0||10||2\n|-\n|1998\u201399||rowspan=\"4\"|[[Super League Greece|Alpha Ethniki]]||12||4||2||0||0||0||14||4\n|-\n|1999\u201300||19||1||2||1||1||0||22||2\n|-\n|2000\u201301||28||8||3||2||0||0||31||10\n|-\n|2001\u201302||19||4||2||1||0||0||21||5\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!87||19||10||4||1||0||98||23\n|-\n|[[Athinaikos]]||1998\u201399||Beta Ethniki||7||1||0||0||0||0||7||1\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]]||2002\u201303||rowspan=\"3\"|[[Bundesliga]]||31||9||4||4||4||2||39||15\n|-\n|2003\u201304||24||4||5||2||3||1||32||7\n|-\n|2004\u201305||11||5||2||0||5||1||18||6\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!66||18||11||6||12||4||89||28\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]||2004\u201305||rowspan=\"3\"|[[Eredivisie]]||13||4||0||0||0||0||13||4\n|-\n|2005\u201306||17||8||3||1||4||0||24||9\n|-\n|2006\u201307||1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Total\n!31||12||3||1||4||0||38||13\n|-\n|[[Feyenoord Rotterdam]]||2006\u201307||Eredivisie||28||9||3||1||5||1||36||11\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"|[[1.

While the term \"android\" is used in reference to human-looking robots in general, a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a \"[[gynoid]]\".\n\nThe ''Oxford English Dictionary'' traces the earliest use (as \"Androides\") to [[Ephraim Chambers]]' 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]],'' in reference to an [[automaton]] that St. [[Albertus Magnus]] allegedly created.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/><ref>''OED'' at \"android\" citing Ephraim Chambers, ''Cyclop\u00e6dia; or, a universal dictionary of arts and sciences.'' 1728.</ref> By the late 1700s \"androides\", elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities, were displayed in exhibit halls.<ref>{{cite news |title=At the Mechanical Theater |work=[[London Times]] |date=22 December 1795}}</ref> \nThe term \"android\" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=QhIAAAAAEBAJ&dq=patent:40891%7C|title=U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Patent# 40891, ''Toy Automation''|publisher=[[Google Patents]]| accessdate = 7 January 2007}}</ref> The term ''android'' was used in a more modern sense by the French author [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]] in his work ''[[The Future Eve|Tomorrow's Eve]]'' (1886).<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> This story features an artificial humanlike robot named Hadaly. As said by the officer in the story, \"In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.\" The term made an impact into English [[pulp science fiction]] starting from [[Jack Williamson]]'s ''[[The Cometeers]]'' (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s [[Captain Future]] (1940\u20131944).<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nAlthough [[Karel \u010capek]]'s robots in ''[[R.U.R.|R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)\u2014the play that introduced the word ''[[robot]]'' to the world\u2014were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> The term \"android\" can mean either one of these,<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> while a cyborg (\"cybernetic organism\" or \"bionic man\") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.\n\nThe term \"[[droid (Star Wars)|droid]]\", popularized by [[George Lucas]] in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of \"android\", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like [[R2-D2]]. The word \"android\" was used in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\" The abbreviation \"andy\", coined as a [[pejorative]] by writer [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series ''[[Total Recall 2070]]''.<ref name=\"TR2070\">{{Cite episode|title=Rough Whimper of Insanity |url=http://www.fancast.com/tv/Total-Recall-2070/10604/full-episodes |series=Total Recall 2070 |serieslink=Total Recall 2070 |credits=Levin, Drew S.

In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> In other stories, authors have used the word \"android\" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nEric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a \"synthetic human being\", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:\n* the mummy type \u2013 where androids are made of \"dead things\" or \"stiff, inanimate, natural material\", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues\n* the golem type \u2013 androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi\n* the automaton type \u2013 androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots<ref name=\"Wilson2006\"/>\n\nAlthough human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).\n\n==Projects==\nSeveral projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]{{Expand section|1=more recent examples and additional citations|section=1|date=October 2018}}\n[[Japanese robotics]] have been leading the field since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|title=Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics|first1=Sa\u00efd|last1=Zeghloul|first2=Med Amine|last2=Laribi|first3=Jean-Pierre|last3=Gazeau|authorlink3=Jean-Pierre Gazeau|date=21 September 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319223681}}</ref> [[Waseda University]] initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html|title=Humanoid History -WABOT-|website=www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp}}</ref><ref name=\"androidworld.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htm|title=Historical Android Projects|work=androidworld.com}}</ref> Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using [[tactile sensor]]s.

In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.\n\nThe Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.\n\nThe [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a [[3D scanner]] to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.\n\n===Singapore===\nProf Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple's [[Siri]] or Microsoft's [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]]. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly.\n\nAssoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R&D development in [[tele-presence robotics]], creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user's face and expressions displayed on the robot's face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.\n<ref name=\"singapore_NTU\">{{cite web|url=http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=fde9bfb6-ee3f-45f0-8c7b-f08bc1a9a179|title=NTU scientists unveil social and telepresence robots|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\n[[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]]\n\n[[KITECH]] researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial \"musculature\" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words.

She uses AI to process and synthesize information in order to make her own decisions on how to talk and engage. She collects data through conversations, direct data inputs such as books or articles, and through internet sources.\nMaria Bot was built by an international high-tech company for Dr. Barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty. Maria Bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence. Dr. Barry also uses Maria Bot to demonstrate that programming a robot with life-affirming, ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same.

As said by the officer in the story, \"In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.\" The term made an impact into English [[pulp science fiction]] starting from [[Jack Williamson]]'s ''[[The Cometeers]]'' (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s [[Captain Future]] (1940\u20131944).<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nAlthough [[Karel \u010capek]]'s robots in ''[[R.U.R.|R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)\u2014the play that introduced the word ''[[robot]]'' to the world\u2014were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> The term \"android\" can mean either one of these,<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> while a cyborg (\"cybernetic organism\" or \"bionic man\") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.\n\nThe term \"[[droid (Star Wars)|droid]]\", popularized by [[George Lucas]] in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of \"android\", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like [[R2-D2]]. The word \"android\" was used in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\" The abbreviation \"andy\", coined as a [[pejorative]] by writer [[Philip K. Dick]] in his novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'', has seen some further usage, such as within the TV series ''[[Total Recall 2070]]''.<ref name=\"TR2070\">{{Cite episode|title=Rough Whimper of Insanity |url=http://www.fancast.com/tv/Total-Recall-2070/10604/full-episodes |series=Total Recall 2070 |serieslink=Total Recall 2070 |credits=Levin, Drew S.

In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> In other stories, authors have used the word \"android\" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nEric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a \"synthetic human being\", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:\n* the mummy type \u2013 where androids are made of \"dead things\" or \"stiff, inanimate, natural material\", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues\n* the golem type \u2013 androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi\n* the automaton type \u2013 androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots<ref name=\"Wilson2006\"/>\n\nAlthough human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).\n\n==Projects==\nSeveral projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]{{Expand section|1=more recent examples and additional citations|section=1|date=October 2018}}\n[[Japanese robotics]] have been leading the field since the 1970s.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66|title=Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics|first1=Sa\u00efd|last1=Zeghloul|first2=Med Amine|last2=Laribi|first3=Jean-Pierre|last3=Gazeau|authorlink3=Jean-Pierre Gazeau|date=21 September 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319223681}}</ref> [[Waseda University]] initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html|title=Humanoid History -WABOT-|website=www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp}}</ref><ref name=\"androidworld.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htm|title=Historical Android Projects|work=androidworld.com}}</ref> Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using [[tactile sensor]]s.

It was capable of playing the organ. Wabot-2 had 10 fingers and two feet, and was able to read a score of music.

In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.\n\nThe Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.\n\nThe [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a [[3D scanner]] to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.\n\n===Singapore===\nProf Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple's [[Siri]] or Microsoft's [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]]. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly.\n\nAssoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R&D development in [[tele-presence robotics]], creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user's face and expressions displayed on the robot's face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.\n<ref name=\"singapore_NTU\">{{cite web|url=http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=fde9bfb6-ee3f-45f0-8c7b-f08bc1a9a179|title=NTU scientists unveil social and telepresence robots|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\n[[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]]\n\n[[KITECH]] researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial \"musculature\" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words.

The band was formed in 2013 by [[YG Entertainment]] through Mnet survival program ''WIN: Who Is Next'' leading to their official debut on August 17, 2014 with studio album ''[[2014 S/S]]''. Originally a five-piece band, [[Nam Tae Hyun|Taehyun]], departed from the group in November 2016 due to his mental health and well-being. Upon debut, The Korea Herald cited their immediate success as \"unprecedented\" for a new group, thus dubbed as \"Monster rookies\". ''The Korea Corporate Reputation Research Institute'' revealed the band was acquired to have one of the highest brand reputations in South Korea, listing among the top five while peaking at number three.

Winner is also currently the fastest act to win on a televised music show. Their success throughout Asia earned them numerous awards for music, fashion and popularity including the [[Melon Music Awards]], MTV Asia Music Gala and [[Style Icon Awards]]. Following the bands reformation, Winner's lead single, \"Really Really\" from first single album ''[[Fate Number For]]'' (2017) instantly spawned to number one in South Korea. \"Really Really\" went on to selling over 2.5 million digital copies on [[Gaon]] and creating a record of surpassing 100 million streams on Gaon, making Winner the first-ever K-pop boy group in history to achieve this while keeping their \"Chart-In\" status.\n\nThroughout their career, the band cumulatively held over 100 concerts, where their first world tour, ''Winner Everywhere Tour'' in 2018 marks the band's largest tour to date. Winner is also known through endorsement deals with brands [[Adidas]], [[Oreo]], [[Kiehl's]] and more.

Their success throughout Asia earned them numerous awards for music, fashion and popularity including the [[Melon Music Awards]], MTV Asia Music Gala and [[Style Icon Awards]]. Following the bands reformation, Winner's lead single, \"Really Really\" from first single album ''[[Fate Number For]]'' (2017) instantly spawned to number one in South Korea. \"Really Really\" went on to selling over 2.5 million digital copies on [[Gaon]] and creating a record of surpassing 100 million streams on Gaon, making Winner the first-ever K-pop boy group in history to achieve this while keeping their \"Chart-In\" status.\n\nThroughout their career, the band cumulatively held over 100 concerts, where their first world tour, ''Winner Everywhere Tour'' in 2018 marks the band's largest tour to date.
