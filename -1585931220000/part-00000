The song features vocals from American singer [[Ty Dolla Sign]] and Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper [[Nicki Minaj]]. Relying on [[flute]]s being played along with a punchy bassline, the song's original lyrics are about [[body shaming]] and the stigma surrounding [[plastic surgery]]. A reworked version of the song featuring Christian-themed lyrics was later previewed at listening parties for West's ninth studio album ''[[Jesus Is King]]'' (2019). \n\nThe song was ultimately scrapped from ''Jesus Is King'' just before its October 2019 release due to creative differences between West and Minaj. Since being leaked online in July 2019, the song received positive reviews and was noted for being a highlight among other leaked ''Yandhi'' tracks. Critics praised West's reworked Christian lyrics for being more positive and respectful.\n\n==Background and recording==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| footer = Nicki Minaj (left) and Ty Dolla Sign (right) previously appeared together on Kanye West's song \"[[Violent Crimes (song)|Violent Crimes]]\" (2018).\n| image1    = Nicki Minaj Live in concert 2018 (cropped).png\n| width1    = 159\n| image2 = Ty Dolla Sign 2018 (Cropped).jpg\n| width2 = 123}}\nNicki Minaj was previously prominently featured on West's fifth studio album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' (2010) and provided a voice memo for his eighth studio album ''[[Ye (album)|Ye]]'' (2018).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/06/nicki-minaj-writing-credit-kanye-west-ye-album|title=Nicki Minaj Influenced A Lyric On Kanye West's 'Ye' Album|date=June 1, 2018|accessdate=December 20, 2019|work=Vibe|author=Camille Augustin}}</ref> Ty Dolla Sign was also featured on ''Ye'', along with ''[[The Life of Pablo]]'' (2016) and ''[[Kids See Ghosts]]'' (2018), West's collaborative album with [[Kid Cudi]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8459095/ty-dolla-sign-teases-kanye-west-joint-album|title=Ty Dolla $ign Teases Possibility of Joint Album With Kanye West: 'U Ready?'|date=June 4, 2018|accessdate=December 20, 2019|author=Michael Saponara|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-kid-cudi-ty-dolla-sign-sued-over-kids-see-ghosts-song-report/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=March 7, 2019|accessdate=December 20, 2019|author=Braudie Blais-Billie|title=Kanye, Kid Cudi, Ty Dolla Sign Sued Over ''Kids See Ghosts'' Song: Report}}</ref> \"New Body\" features production from American producer [[Ronny J]],<ref name=\"Xavier\">{{Cite web|url=https://xaviernewswire.com/2019/09/11/kanyes-yandhi-album-leaked-to-mixed-reviews/|title=Kanye\u2019s Yandhi album leaked to mixed reviews|date=September 11, 2019|accessdate=January 21, 2019|website=[[Xavier University|The Xavier Newswire]]|author=Sebastian Augiler}}</ref> who has previously worked with West on the collaborative track \"[[I Love It (Kanye West and Lil Pump song)|I Love It]]\" with American rapper [[Lil Pump]] and later on \"[[Everything We Need]]\" featuring Ty Dolla Sign and [[Ant Clemons]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/07/ronny-j-ty-dolla-sign-rich-the-kid-lights-out|title=Ronny J Recruits Ty Dolla Sign and Rich the Kid for \"Lights Out\"|date=July 12, 2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|author=Joe Price}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/kanye-west-and-dr-dre-working-on-something-specialfor-the-fans-according-to-producer-ronny-j-news.96668.html|title=Kanye West & Dr. Dre Working On \"Something Special\" According To Producer Ronny J|date=November 27, 2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020|website=HotNewHipHop|author=Erika Marie}}</ref>\n\nOn September 9, 2018, West was spotted recording music with American rapper [[6ix9ine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/tekashi-6ix9ines-controversial-career-a-timeline.html|title=The Complete History of Tekashi 6ix9ine\u2019s Controversial Career|date=September 18, 2019|accessdate=December 16, 2019|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|author1=Dee Lockett|author2=Zoe Haylock}}</ref> On September 17, 2018, West announced his ninth studio album ''Yandhi'', just three months after the release of his previous solo album ''Ye'', revealing the cover art and initial release date of September 29, 2018.<ref name=\"Reveal\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.thefader.com/2018/09/18/kanye-west-new-project-yandhi-announcement|title=Kanye West announces new project ''Yandhi''|date=September 18, 2018|accessdate=December 14, 2019|magazine=The Fader|first=Salvator|last=Maicki|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227144745/http://www.thefader.com/2018/09/18/kanye-west-new-project-yandhi-announcement|archive-date=February 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On September 27, 2018, West visited ''[[The Fader]]'' headquarters to preview new music from ''Yandhi''.

He wrote that he \"loved Charterhouse immediately\", with its history and \"every possible area of encouragement from sport to intellectual pursuits.\" Unlike at Stoke House, there were other boys there who appreciated pop music. He bought a [[transistor radio]] and earphones and joined the \"under the bedclothes\" club, listening to [[Tony Hall (music executive)|Tony Hall]], [[Jimmy Savile]], Don Moss and [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]] on [[Radio Luxembourg]], and keeping track of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' charts.<ref name=King4/> The music, particularly [[Buddy Holly]], [[Adam Faith]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Gene Pitney]], made him \"ache with desire\":\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;\">\nSince \"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\" swept me off my feet, I had become a raving pop addict, desperate for a fix every few seconds.

Thereafter, he proceeded to Bauchi Provincial School.<ref name=\":1\" /> Like many of his contemporaries, he studied at [[Barewa College]], then known as Katsina College, where he was student number 145. Ahmadu Rabah, later known as Ahmadu Bello, was student number 87 and was two years his senior, while [[Abubakar Imam]] was a year ahead of him.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Islam and colonialism : intellectual responses of Muslims of Northern Nigeria to British colonial rule|last=Sani.|first=Umar, Muhammad|date=2006|publisher=Brill|isbn=900413946X|location=Leiden|oclc=62554253}}</ref> The College was several kilometers from Bauchi and was not close to a railway station nor other public transportation. During holidays, which was twice a year, Balewa trekked home, a journey of more than 400 kilometers. He trekked for 40 kilometers a day, before finding a resting place at a nearby village. In total, the journey took him 10 days.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nKatsina College had British expatriate teachers, many of whom had been educated at leading British schools and then attended Cambridge or Oxford. Students were taught in English, and speech was an important part of learning for the students. Apart from excellence in English, the school was also a training ground for teachers to be posted to the provincial and middle schools within the [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Provinces of Nigeria]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBalewa completed his five-year education in 1933 and returned to Bauchi to teach at Bauchi Middle School. He taught at the school and rose to become a senior schoolmaster. In 1941, he became acquainted with a young [[Aminu Kano]], who was posted to the school as a teacher. After a student unrest, investigations into student grievances indicted the headmaster, and in 1941 Balewa was nominated as the new headmaster.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1944, Balewa and some other educated teachers in the Northern Provinces were chosen to study abroad at the [[University of London]]'s [[Institute of Education]], which today forms part of [[University College London]]. Upon returning to Nigeria, he became an Inspector of Schools for the colonial administration and later entered politics.\n\nHe was elected in 1946 to the Northern House of Assembly, and to the Legislative Council in 1947. As a legislator, he was a vocal advocate of the rights of Northern Nigeria. He supported hesitance by the North to become independent, based on the objection that the north and south regions were not on an equal footing. In the Northern Assembly, he sought more roles and responsibility in the Native Administration for the educated members of the emirates.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nTogether with Alhaji Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]], who held the hereditary title of ''Sardauna'' of [[Sokoto]], they proposed the transformation of the cultural organization, Jam'iyyar Mutanen Arewa, which means [[Northern People's Congress]] (NPC) in English, to become a political platform for use as campaign platform during the elections of 1951. Balewa was elected Vice President of the new party and subsequently resigned his post as headmaster of Bauchi Middle School. NPC won the plurality of votes to the regional House of Assembly in 1951. Balewa was among the new legislators in Kaduna. Under a new constitution, the Macpherson Constitution of 1951, an electoral college system was implemented whereby, some regional legislators were elected to the Federal House of Representatives in Lagos, and among the federal legislators, three members from each region would be appointed federal ministers with portfolio. Balewa was among those nominated to Lagos and along with [[Kashim Ibrahim]] and [[Muhammadu Ribadu]] were nominated to become ministers.\n\n==From self-government to independence==\n\n===Balewa administration===\n\nBalewa entered the government in 1952 as Minister of Works, and later served as Minister of Transport during a time Nigeria was moving towards self-government.  During his tenure at the transport ministry, both the Marine and Railway departments were transformed to corporations and the designs for a bridge over the [[Niger River|Niger]] and plans for the Kainji Dam were developed.\n\nIn 1957, NPC won the plurality of votes in the Federal House of Representatives and Balewa became the Chief Minister and designated Prime Minister. As part of his plans to unify the country towards the move for independence in 1960, he formed a coalition government between the [[Northern People's Congress|NPC]] and the [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC), led by [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]] and also invited the Action Group (A.G.), the 1957 cabinet was constituted as an all party cabinet. Though, Awolowo, the leader of A.G. and premier of the Western region was skeptical of the plan,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democracy and prebendal politics in Nigeria : the rise and fall of the Second Republic|last=A.|first=Joseph, Richard|publisher=|isbn=9781107633537|location=Cambridge|pages=34|oclc=864086426|date = 6 February 2014}}</ref> the national executive committee of Action Group party endorsed the National Government and [[Ayo Rosiji]] and [[Samuel Akintola]] were nominated by the party. During this period, Balewa developed a close relationship with [[K. O. Mbadiwe|K.O. Mbadiwe]] from NCNC and Akintola from AG.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBalewa retained the post as [[Prime Minister of Nigeria]] when Nigeria gained independence in 1960, and was reelected in 1964.\n\nPrior to Nigeria's independence, a [[constitutional conference]] in 1954 had adopted a regional political framework for the country, with all regions given a considerable amount of [[political freedom]]. The three regions then were composed of diverse [[cultural]] groups. The [[premier]]s and some prominent leaders of the regions later took on a policy of guiding their regions against political encroachment from other regional leaders. Later on, this political environment influenced the Balewa administration. His term in office was turbulent, with regional factionalism constantly threatening his government.\n[[File:JFKWHP-ST-A-A3-3-61.jpg|thumb|left|Balewa at the White House with [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], 1961]]\n\nHowever, as Prime Minister of [[Nigeria]], he played important roles in the continent's formative indigenous rule. He was an important leader in the formation of the Organisation of African Unity and creating a cooperative relationship with [[French language|French]] speaking [[African countries]]. He was also instrumental in negotiations between [[Moise Tshombe]] and the Congolese authorities during the [[Congo Crisis]] of 1960\u20131964. He led a vocal protest against the [[Sharpeville Massacre]] of 1960 and also entered into an alliance with [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] ministers who wanted [[South Africa]] to leave the Commonwealth in 1961. However, a [[treason]] charge and conviction against one of the western region's leaders, [[Obafemi Awolowo]], led to protest and condemnation from many of his supporters. The 1965 election in the region later produced violent protests. Rioting and violence were soon synchronous with what was perceived as inordinate political encroachment and an over-exuberant election outcome for Awolowo's western opponents.\n\nAs Prime Minister of [[Nigeria]], Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, from 1960 to 1961, doubled as Foreign Affairs advocate of Nigeria. In 1961, the Balewa government created an official Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations ministerial position in favour of [[Jaja Wachuku]] who became, from 1961 to 1965, the first substantive Nigerian [[Minister (government)|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Relations, later called External Affairs.\n\n==Honours==\nIn January 1960, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was knighted by Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]]. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Sheffield]] in May 1960.<ref name=\":0\"/> He was also awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the [[New York University]] in July 1961.\n\n==Overthrow==\nHe was overthrown and murdered in a [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 15 January 1966]], as were many other leaders, including his old companion Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]]. The circumstances of his death still remain unresolved. His body was discovered at a roadside near [[Lagos]] six days after he was ousted from office. Balewa was buried in [[Bauchi]]. News of his assassination spurred violent riots throughout [[Northern Nigeria]] and ultimately led to the bloody counter-coup of July 1966.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nToday, his portrait adorns the 5 [[Naira]] Note. The [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] in [[Bauchi]] is named in his honour.\n\n==Balewa's ''Shaihu Umar''==\nIn 1934, Balewa wrote ''Shaihu Umar'', a novella about a pious Muslim in response to a request to promote Hausa literature by Rupert East, head of the colonial Translation Bureau.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f|first=Olga Bessmertnaya-\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430|title=A Hausa Author's Idea of Literature as an&quot; about-face&quot; response to the British literary challenge|url=https://www.academia.edu/562281|journal=Multiculturalism &amp; Hybridity in African \u2026|language=en}}</ref> Written in a prose homily structure,<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> the protagonist, Shaihu Umar, recounts his events in his life's history.

Rioting and violence were soon synchronous with what was perceived as inordinate political encroachment and an over-exuberant election outcome for Awolowo's western opponents.\n\nAs Prime Minister of [[Nigeria]], Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, from 1960 to 1961, doubled as Foreign Affairs advocate of Nigeria. In 1961, the Balewa government created an official Foreign Affairs and Commonwealth Relations ministerial position in favour of [[Jaja Wachuku]] who became, from 1961 to 1965, the first substantive Nigerian [[Minister (government)|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Relations, later called External Affairs.\n\n==Honours==\nIn January 1960, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was knighted by Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]]. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Sheffield]] in May 1960.<ref name=\":0\"/> He was also awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the [[New York University]] in July 1961.\n\n==Overthrow==\nHe was overthrown and murdered in a [[1966 Nigerian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup on 15 January 1966]], as were many other leaders, including his old companion Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]]. The circumstances of his death still remain unresolved. His body was discovered at a roadside near [[Lagos]] six days after he was ousted from office. Balewa was buried in [[Bauchi]]. News of his assassination spurred violent riots throughout [[Northern Nigeria]] and ultimately led to the bloody counter-coup of July 1966.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nToday, his portrait adorns the 5 [[Naira]] Note. The [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] in [[Bauchi]] is named in his honour.\n\n==Balewa's ''Shaihu Umar''==\nIn 1934, Balewa wrote ''Shaihu Umar'', a novella about a pious Muslim in response to a request to promote Hausa literature by Rupert East, head of the colonial Translation Bureau.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=\u0411\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f|first=Olga Bessmertnaya-\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430|title=A Hausa Author's Idea of Literature as an&quot; about-face&quot; response to the British literary challenge|url=https://www.academia.edu/562281|journal=Multiculturalism &amp; Hybridity in African \u2026|language=en}}</ref> Written in a prose homily structure,<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> the protagonist, Shaihu Umar, recounts his events in his life's history.

Formerly known lovingly as ''Untitled Gay Retiree Documentary''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe subjects of ''Before You Know It'' are no ordinary senior citizens. They are go-go booted bar-hoppers, love struck activists, troublemaking baton twirlers, late night Internet cruisers, seasoned renegades, and bold adventurers. They are also among the estimated 2.4 million LGBT Americans over the age of 55 in the U.S. many of whom face heightened levels of discrimination, neglect and exclusion. But ''Before You Know It'' is not a film about cold statistics, it's a film about generational trailblazers who have surmounted prejudice and defied expectation to form communities of strength, renewal and camaraderie.

Formerly known lovingly as ''Untitled Gay Retiree Documentary''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe subjects of ''Before You Know It'' are no ordinary senior citizens. They are go-go booted bar-hoppers, love struck activists, troublemaking baton twirlers, late night Internet cruisers, seasoned renegades, and bold adventurers. They are also among the estimated 2.4 million LGBT Americans over the age of 55 in the U.S. many of whom face heightened levels of discrimination, neglect and exclusion. But ''Before You Know It'' is not a film about cold statistics, it\u2019s a film about generational trailblazers who have surmounted prejudice and defied expectation to form communities of strength, renewal and camaraderie. ''Before You Know It'' focuses on the lives of three gay seniors, but reminds us that while LGBT elders face a specific set of issues, aging and its challenges are universal. An affirmation of life and human resilience told with a refreshing humor and candor, ''Before You Know It'' confirms that you are never too old to reshape society.\n\n==Cast==\n* Dennis Creamer - Himself (as Dennis)\n* Ty Martin - Himself (as Ty)\n* Robert Mainor - Himself (as Robert)\n* Dixie Monroe - Herself\n* Carly Davin Nation - Herself\n\n==Festivals==\nThe film premiered at [[South by Southwest]] 2013 and screened at other film festivals such as [[Independent Film Festival of Boston]], the [[San Francisco International Film Festival]], [[Maryland Film Festival]], Toronto LGBT Film Festival, [[Edinburgh International Film Festival]], [[Outfest|Outfest Los Angeles LGBT Film Festival]], [[Asian Film Festival of Dallas]], QFest Philadelphia, and QFest Galveston.
