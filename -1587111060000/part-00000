His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

During ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', he begins to travel through Sinnoh, where he meets and develops a rivalry with Ash Ketchum. Unlike Ash's previous rivals, Paul is a grumpy and serious trainer whose only concern towards Pok\u00e9mon is their ability to act in battle and who believes that forming bonds with Pok\u00e9mon dilutes their potential, and is thereby seen by many characters for being the complete opposite of Ash. His harsh training style, competitive behavior, and desire to be strong derives from his resentment toward his older brother, Reggie, who had been an accomplished trainer until he lost to Pyramid King Brandon, causing him to quit Pok\u00e9mon training to become a breeder. Paul is determined to make sure he doesn't meet that same fate, so he plans to surpass not just any trainer, but his own brother as well, although he is clearly unlikable to many. In Japan, he is named after [[Shinji Mikami]], the creator of the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. He ultimately loses his battle against Ash in the Sinnoh League. Afterwards, he finds a bit of respect for Ash, and heads out to battle with Brandon. Ash and Paul depart on a good note. Ash wishes him luck, which Paul returns. Just as Paul is about to leave Ash calls out that they should battle again, real soon. Then he smiles, finally accepting him. As he waves good-bye, he walks away, into the sunset.

He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

During ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon: Diamond and Pearl]]'', he begins to travel through Sinnoh, where he meets and develops a rivalry with Ash Ketchum. Unlike Ash's previous rivals, Paul is a grumpy and serious trainer whose only concern towards Pok\u00e9mon is their ability to act in battle and who believes that forming bonds with Pok\u00e9mon dilutes their potential, and is thereby seen by many characters for being the complete opposite of Ash. His harsh training style, competitive behavior, and desire to be strong derives from his resentment toward his older brother, Reggie, who had been an accomplished trainer until he lost to Pyramid King Brandon, causing him to quit Pok\u00e9mon training to become a breeder. Paul is determined to make sure he doesn't meet that same fate, so he plans to surpass not just any trainer, but his own brother as well, although he is clearly unlikable to many. In Japan, he is named after [[Shinji Mikami]], the creator of the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series. He ultimately loses his battle against Ash in the Sinnoh League. Afterwards, he finds a bit of respect for Ash, and heads out to battle with Brandon. Ash and Paul depart on a good note. Ash wishes him luck, which Paul returns. Just as Paul is about to leave Ash calls out that they should battle again, real soon. Then he smiles, finally accepting him. As he waves good-bye, he walks away, into the sunset.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James.

Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the [[beach]]. In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the [[sea]]. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient [[lake]] or [[sea]] beds. Dunes can form under the action of water flow ([[fluvial]] processes), and on sand or [[gravel]] beds of [[river]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and the sea-bed.\n\nThe modern word \"dune\" came into English from French around 1790,<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dune |title=Dune\u2014Define Dune |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |access-date=1 May 2018 |publisher=[[Dictionary.com, LLC]]}}</ref> which in turn came from [[Middle Dutch]] ''d\u016bne''.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Saltation on sand dune.png|thumb|left|Sand hitting sand is more likely to stick; sand hitting a more coherent surface is more likely to bounce ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]). This exacerbating [[feedback loop]] helps sand accumulate into dunes.]]\nDunes are made of sand-sized particles, and may consist of quartz, calcium carbonate, snow, gypsum, or other materials. The upwind/upstream/upcurrent side of the dune is called the stoss side; the downflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]) up the stoss side, and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip face (or slipface).\n\nThe [[Bagnold formula]] gives the speed at which particles can be transported.\n\n==Aeolian dunes==\n\n===Aeolian dune shapes===\nFive basic dune types are recognized: crescentic, linear, star, dome, and parabolic. Dune areas may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).<ref name=\"USGS\">[https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ Types of dunes], a [[USGS]] publication</ref>\n\n====Barchan or crescentic====\n{{main|barchan}}\n[[File:Barchan in Noachis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Isolated barchan dunes on the surface of [[Mars]]. Dominant wind direction would be from left to right.]]\nBarchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds which are generally wider than they are long. The lee-side slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction (unimodal winds). They form separate crescents when the sand supply is comparatively small. When the sand supply is greater, they may merge into barchanoid ridges, and then transverse dunes (see below).\n\nSome types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over [[desert]] surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in [[China]]'s [[Ningxia Province]], and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]]. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China's [[Taklamakan Desert]].<ref name=\"USG Types of Dunes\">{{cite web|title=Types of Dunes|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|accessdate=8 March 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314161113/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSee lunettes and parabolic dunes, below, for dunes similar to crescent-shaped ones.\n\n=====Transverse dunes=====\nAbundant barchan dunes may merge into barchanoid ridges, which then grade into linear (or slightly sinuous) transverse dunes, so called because they lie transverse, or across, the wind direction, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the ridge crest.<ref name=Mangimeli/>\n\n====Seif or longitudinal dunes====\nSeif dunes are linear (or slightly sinuous) dunes with two slip faces.<ref name=Mangimeli/> The two slip faces make them sharp-crested. They are called ''seif'' dunes after the Arabic word for \"sword\". They may be more than 160 kilometres (100 miles) long, and thus easily visible in satellite images (see illustrations).\n\nSeif dunes are associated with bidirectional winds. The long axes and ridges of these dunes extend along the resultant direction of sand movement (hence the name \"longitudinal\").<ref name=seif_terminology>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_460-2 |chapter=Longitudinal Dunes (or Linear Dunes) |title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms |pages=1\u201311 |year=2014 |last1=Radebaugh |first1=Jani |last2=Sharma |first2=Priyanka |last3=Korteniemi |first3=Jarmo |last4=Fitzsimmons |first4=Kathryn E. |isbn=978-1-4614-9213-9 }}</ref> Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes.<ref name=\"USG Types of Dunes\"/>\n\nFormation is debated. Bagnold, in ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]'', suggested that some seif dunes form when a barchan dune moves into a bidirectional wind regime, and one arm or wing of the crescent elongates. Others suggest that seif dunes are formed by [[vortex|vortices]] in a unidirectional wind.<ref name=Mangimeli/> In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes, barchans may be formed, because the wind is constrained to be unidirectional by the dunes.\n\n<!-- The first image (Rub' al Khali) would be better rotated 90 degrees clockwise to match it with the contrasting image to the right --> \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Rub' al Khali (Arabian Empty Quarter) sand dunes imaged by Terra (EOS AM-1).jpg|alt = On the left, more barchany dunes, with the crescent arms pointing towards the bottom edge of the image and slightly rightwards.

They range up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast [[Erg (landform)|erg]], called the [[Rub' al Khali]] or Empty Quarter, contains seif dunes that stretch for almost 200&nbsp;km and reach heights of over 300&nbsp;m.\n\nLinear [[loess]] hills known as [[paha (landform)|pahas]] are superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] under [[permafrost]] conditions dominated by sparse [[tundra]] vegetation.\n\n====Star====\nRadially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the [[sand sea]]s, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast [[Badain Jaran Desert]] of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.\n\n====Dome====\nOval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface. Dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.\n\n=====Lunettes=====\nFixed crescentic dunes that form on the leeward margins of [[Dry lake|playas]] and river valleys in arid and semiarid regions in response to the direction (s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5&nbsp;km long, 1&nbsp;km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.<ref>[[Charles Rowland Twidale|Twidale, C.R.]] & Campbell, E.M.

These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12&nbsp;km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, [[blowout (geology)|blowout]], or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.\n\nIn plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slipfaces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.\n\nThese dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them\u2014grasses, shrubs, and trees\u2014help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.\n\nMost parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.\n\nSimple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.\n\nParabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.\n\nThe grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5&nbsp;mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.\n\nA type of extensive parabolic dune that lacks discernible slipfaces and has mostly coarse grained sand is known as a ''zibar''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85728-017-3|pages=395\u2013396|edition=2. impr.}}</ref> The term zibar comes from the [[Arabic]] word to describe \"rolling transverse ridges ... with a hard surface\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85728-017-3|pages=395|edition=2. impr.}}</ref> The dunes are small, have low relief, and can be found in many places across the planet from [[Wyoming]] (United States) to Saudi Arabia to Australia.

These dunes typically have major and minor slipfaces oriented in opposite directions. The minor slipfaces are usually temporary, as they appear after a reverse wind and are generally destroyed when the wind next blows in the dominant direction.<ref name=Mangimeli/>\n\n====Draas====\n[[File:350m D\u00fcne Deadvlei Sossusvlei.JPG|thumb|Dune Nine in [[Sossusvlei]], [[Namibia]], is over 300m high.]]\nDraas are very large-scale dune bedforms; they may be tens or a few hundreds of metres in height, kilometres wide, and hundreds of kilometres in length.<ref name=Mangimeli>{{Citation| publisher = U.S.A.

Draas are widespread in sand seas and are [[Cross-bedding|well-represented in the geological record]].<ref name=Lancaster/>\n\n===Dune complexity===\nAll these dune shapes may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (lager dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).<ref name=\"USGS\" /> Simple dunes are basic forms with the minimum number of slipfaces that define the geometric type. Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed. Complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.\n\n===Dune movement===\nThe sand mass of dunes can move either windward or leeward, depending on if the wind is making contact with the dune from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward. If sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. The leeward flux of sand is greater than the windward flux. Further, when the wind carrying sand particles when it hits the dune, the dune's sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit the dune without carrying sand particles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Hong|last2=Dun|first2=Hongchao|last3=Tong|first3=Ding|last4=Huang|first4=Ning|date=15 April 2017|title=Sand transportation and reverse patterns over leeward face of sand dune|journal=Geomorphology|volume=283|pages=41\u201347|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.12.030|bibcode=2017Geomo.283...41J}}</ref>\n\n===Coastal dunes===\n[[File:LIVER AAS UDLOEB I JULI 2012 (ubt)-002.JPG|thumb|Coastal dunes covered in grasses around the mouth of the Liver \u00c5 river in Denmark]]\n[[File:Newborough Dune Rejuvenation.webm|thumb|Newborough Dune Rejuvenation, [[Wales]]; video of work done by [[Natural Resources Wales]]; 2015]]\n\nCoastal dunes<ref>https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/coastal-dunes-geomorphology-25822000/</ref> form when wet sand is deposited along the coast and dries out and is blown along the beach.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=ECF |title=Coasts: an introduction to systematic geomorphology |date=1976 |publisher=Australian National University Press |location=Canberra, Australia}}</ref> Dunes form where the beach is wide enough to allow for the accumulation of wind-blown sand, and where prevailing '''onshore winds''' tend to blow sand inland.

Recent work has suggested that coastal dunes tend to evolve toward a high or low morphology depending on the growth rate of dunes relative to storm frequency.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dur\u00e1n Vinent|first=Orencio|last2=Moore|first2=Laura|date=February 2015|title=Barrier island bistability induced by biophysical interactions|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=2|pages=158\u2013162|doi=10.1038/nclimate2474|issn=1758-6798|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..158D}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Evan B.|last2=Moore|first2=Laura J.|date=2016|title=Stability and bistability in a one-dimensional model of coastal foredune height|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|volume=121|issue=5|pages=964\u2013977|doi=10.1002/2015JF003783|issn=2169-9011|bibcode=2016JGRF..121..964G|doi-access=free}}</ref> During a storm event, dunes play a significant role in minimizing wave energy as it moves onshore.

During the summer, a beach tends to take on more of a convex appearance due to gentler waves, while the same beach in the winter may take on more of a concave appearance. As a result, coastal dunes can get eroded much more quickly in the winter than in the summer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maine Sea Grant |title=Seasonal changes |url=https://www.seagrant.umaine.edu/coastal-hazards-guide/beaches-and-dunes/learn-more/seasonal-changes |website=Maine Sea Grant College Program |accessdate=4 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205003653/https://www.seagrant.umaine.edu/coastal-hazards-guide/beaches-and-dunes/learn-more/seasonal-changes |archive-date=5 December 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====Ecological succession on coastal dunes====\n\nAs a dune forms, plant [[Ecological succession|succession]] occurs. The conditions on an ''embryo dune'' are harsh, with [[salt spray]] from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting [[seaweed]], brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow [[pioneer species]] to colonize the dune. These pioneer species are [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]], [[sea wort grass]] and other sea grasses in the [[United Kingdom]]. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune\ntypically having deep roots which reach the [[water table]], [[root nodules]] that produce [[nitrogen]] compounds, and protected [[stoma]], reducing [[transpiration]]. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a [[foredune]] as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add [[nitrogen]] to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are [[Calluna|heather]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s and [[gorse]]s. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds [[humus]] to the soil and is usually replaced by [[conifer]]ous trees, which can tolerate low soil [[pH]], caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching.<ref name=Miles1985>{{Cite journal| last = Miles | first = J.| year = 1985| title = The pedogenic effects of different species and vegetation types and the implications of succession| journal = European Journal of Soil Science| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 571\u2013584| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2389.1985.tb00359.x}}</ref> Coniferous forests and [[heathland]] are common [[climax community|climax communities]] for sand dune systems.\n\nYoung dunes are called [[yellow dune]]s and dunes which have high humus content are called [[grey dune]]s. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. In Europe these plants include: creeping willow, cotton grass, [[yellow iris]], reeds, and rushes. As for vertebrates in European dunes, [[natterjack toad]]s sometimes breed here.\n\n=== Coastal dune floral adaptations ===\nDune ecosystems are extremely difficult places for plants to survive. This is due to a number of pressures related to their proximity to the ocean and confinement to growth on sandy substrates.  These include:\n* Little available soil moisture\n* Little available [[soil organic matter]]/nutrients\n* Harsh winds\n* Salt spray\n* Erosion/shifting and sometimes ephemeral substrate\n* Tidal influences\nThere are many adaptations plants have evolved to cope with these pressures:\n* Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)\n* Shallow but extensive root systems\n* Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (''Abronia spp''., Beach Primrose)\n* Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)\n* Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (''Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella'')\n* Pale leaves to reduce insolation (''Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.'')\n* Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept out to sea (''Ambrosia chamissonis'')\n\n===Nabkha dunes===\nA [[nabkha]], or coppice dune, is a small dune anchored by vegetation. They usually indicate desertification or soil erosion, and serve as nesting and burrow sites for animals.\n\n==Sub-aqueous dunes==\n{{main|Ripple marks}}\nSub-aqueous ([[underwater]]) dunes form on a bed of sand or gravel under the actions of water flow. They are ubiquitous in natural [[Channel (geography)|channels]] such as rivers and estuaries, and also form in engineered [[canal]]s and pipelines.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.powtec.2008.04.065 |title=Morphology and displacement of dunes in a closed-conduit flow |journal=Powder Technology |volume=190 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=247\u2013251 |year=2009 |last1=Franklin |first1=E.M. |last2=Charru |first2=F. |arxiv=1608.07729 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0022112011000139 |title=Subaqueous barchan dunes in turbulent shear flow.

Ripple marks preserved in sedimentary strata in the geological record can be used to determine the direction of current flow, and thus an indication of the source of the sediments.\n\nDunes on the bed of a channel significantly increase flow resistance, their presence and growth playing a major part in river [[flooding]].\n\n==Lithified dunes==\n[[File:Cross-bedding Of Sandstone Near Mt Carmel Road Zion Canyon Utah.jpg|thumb|Cross-bedding in lithified aeolian sand dunes preserved as sandstone in Zion National Park, Utah]]\nA [[Lithification|lithified]] (consolidated) sand dune is a type of [[sandstone]] that is formed when a marine or aeolian sand dune becomes compacted and hardened. Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. [[Cross-bedding|Cross-bedded]] layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in [[Zion National Park]] in the western United States.\n\nA slang term, used in the [[Southwestern United States|southwest US]], for consolidated and hardened sand dunes is \"slickrock\", a name that was introduced by pioneers of the [[Old West]] because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.\n\n==Desertification==\n{{Main|Desertification}}\nSand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by [[saltation (geology)|saltation]], where sand particles skip along the ground like a [[bouncing ball]]. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as [[creep (sand dunes)|creep]]. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing [[sheet flow]]s. In a major [[dust storm]], dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand [[avalanche]]s, falling down the [[slipface]] of the dunes\u2014that face away from the winds\u2014also move the dunes forward.\n\nSand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach uses a valuable resource and is quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats. [[Sand fence]]s might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grafals-Soto|first=Rosana|title=Effects of sand fences on coastal dune vegetation distribution|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169555X11006179|journal=Geomorphology|language=en|volume=145-146|pages=45\u201355|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2011.12.004|via=}}</ref> Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:KelsoSand.JPG|thumb|Sand blowing off a crest in the [[Kelso Dunes]] of the [[Mojave Desert]], California, USA]]\nDune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous [[rare species]] and some [[endangered species]]. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sri Lanka have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of [[sand dune stabilization]]. In the U.K., a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:D\u00fcne S-Schlag Sossusvlei.JPG|thumb|A dune in [[Sossusvlei]], in the greater [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], [[Namibia]].

Some coastal areas have one or more sets of dunes running parallel to the shoreline directly inland from the [[beach]]. In most cases, the dunes are important in protecting the land against potential ravages by storm waves from the [[sea]]. Although the most widely distributed dunes are those associated with coastal regions, the largest complexes of dunes are found inland in dry regions and associated with ancient [[lake]] or [[sea]] beds. Dunes can form under the action of water flow ([[fluvial]] processes), and on sand or [[gravel]] beds of [[river]]s, [[estuary|estuaries]] and the sea-bed.\n\nThe modern word \"dune\" came into English from French around 1790,<ref>{{cite dictionary |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/dune |title=Dune\u2014Define Dune |dictionary=[[Dictionary.com]] |access-date=1 May 2018 |publisher=[[Dictionary.com, LLC]]}}</ref> which in turn came from [[Middle Dutch]] ''d\u016bne''.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Formation==\n[[File:Saltation on sand dune.png|thumb|left|Sand hitting sand is more likely to stick; sand hitting a more coherent surface is more likely to bounce ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]). This exacerbating [[feedback loop]] helps sand accumulate into dunes.]]\nDunes are made of sand-sized particles, and may consist of quartz, calcium carbonate, snow, gypsum, or other materials. The upwind/upstream/upcurrent side of the dune is called the stoss side; the downflow side is called the lee side. Sand is pushed (creep) or bounces ([[saltation (geology)|saltation]]) up the stoss side, and slides down the lee side. A side of a dune that the sand has slid down is called a slip face (or slipface).\n\nThe [[Bagnold formula]] gives the speed at which particles can be transported.\n\n==Aeolian dunes==\n\n===Aeolian dune shapes===\nFive basic dune types are recognized: crescentic, linear, star, dome, and parabolic. Dune areas may occur in three forms: simple (isolated dunes of basic type), compound (larger dunes on which smaller dunes of same type form), and complex (combinations of different types).<ref name=\"USGS\">[https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/ Types of dunes], a [[USGS]] publication</ref>\n\n====Barchan or crescentic====\n{{main|barchan}}\n[[File:Barchan in Noachis.jpg|thumbnail|right|Isolated barchan dunes on the surface of [[Mars]]. Dominant wind direction would be from left to right.]]\nBarchan dunes are crescent-shaped mounds which are generally wider than they are long. The lee-side slipfaces are on the concave sides of the dunes. These dunes form under winds that blow consistently from one direction (unimodal winds). They form separate crescents when the sand supply is comparatively small. When the sand supply is greater, they may merge into barchanoid ridges, and then transverse dunes (see below).\n\nSome types of crescentic dunes move more quickly over [[desert]] surfaces than any other type of dune. A group of dunes moved more than 100 metres per year between 1954 and 1959 in [[China]]'s [[Ningxia Province]], and similar speeds have been recorded in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]]. The largest crescentic dunes on Earth, with mean crest-to-crest widths of more than three kilometres, are in China's [[Taklamakan Desert]].<ref name=\"USG Types of Dunes\">{{cite web|title=Types of Dunes|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|accessdate=8 March 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314161113/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/deserts/dunes/|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSee lunettes and parabolic dunes, below, for dunes similar to crescent-shaped ones.\n\n=====Transverse dunes=====\nAbundant barchan dunes may merge into barchanoid ridges, which then grade into linear (or slightly sinuous) transverse dunes, so called because they lie transverse, or across, the wind direction, with the wind blowing perpendicular to the ridge crest.<ref name=Mangimeli/>\n\n====Seif or longitudinal dunes====\nSeif dunes are linear (or slightly sinuous) dunes with two slip faces.<ref name=Mangimeli/> The two slip faces make them sharp-crested. They are called ''seif'' dunes after the Arabic word for \"sword\". They may be more than 160 kilometres (100 miles) long, and thus easily visible in satellite images (see illustrations).\n\nSeif dunes are associated with bidirectional winds. The long axes and ridges of these dunes extend along the resultant direction of sand movement (hence the name \"longitudinal\").<ref name=seif_terminology>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_460-2 |chapter=Longitudinal Dunes (or Linear Dunes) |title=Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms |pages=1\u201311 |year=2014 |last1=Radebaugh |first1=Jani |last2=Sharma |first2=Priyanka |last3=Korteniemi |first3=Jarmo |last4=Fitzsimmons |first4=Kathryn E. |isbn=978-1-4614-9213-9 }}</ref> Some linear dunes merge to form Y-shaped compound dunes.<ref name=\"USG Types of Dunes\"/>\n\nFormation is debated. Bagnold, in ''[[The Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes]]'', suggested that some seif dunes form when a barchan dune moves into a bidirectional wind regime, and one arm or wing of the crescent elongates. Others suggest that seif dunes are formed by [[vortex|vortices]] in a unidirectional wind.<ref name=Mangimeli/> In the sheltered troughs between highly developed seif dunes, barchans may be formed, because the wind is constrained to be unidirectional by the dunes.\n\n<!-- The first image (Rub' al Khali) would be better rotated 90 degrees clockwise to match it with the contrasting image to the right --> \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Rub' al Khali (Arabian Empty Quarter) sand dunes imaged by Terra (EOS AM-1).jpg|alt = On the left, more barchany dunes, with the crescent arms pointing towards the bottom edge of the image and slightly rightwards.

They range up to {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} in length. In the southern third of the Arabian Peninsula, a vast [[Erg (landform)|erg]], called the [[Rub' al Khali]] or Empty Quarter, contains seif dunes that stretch for almost 200&nbsp;km and reach heights of over 300&nbsp;m.\n\nLinear [[loess]] hills known as [[paha (landform)|pahas]] are superficially similar. These hills appear to have been formed during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] under [[permafrost]] conditions dominated by sparse [[tundra]] vegetation.\n\n====Star====\nRadially symmetrical, star dunes are pyramidal sand mounds with slipfaces on three or more arms that radiate from the high center of the mound. They tend to accumulate in areas with multidirectional wind regimes. Star dunes grow upward rather than laterally. They dominate the [[Grand Erg Oriental]] of the Sahara. In other deserts, they occur around the margins of the [[sand sea]]s, particularly near topographic barriers. In the southeast [[Badain Jaran Desert]] of China, the star dunes are up to 500 metres tall and may be the tallest dunes on Earth.\n\n====Dome====\nOval or circular mounds that generally lack a slipface. Dome dunes are rare and occur at the far upwind margins of sand seas.\n\n=====Lunettes=====\nFixed crescentic dunes that form on the leeward margins of [[Dry lake|playas]] and river valleys in arid and semiarid regions in response to the direction (s) of prevailing winds, are known as lunettes, source-bordering dunes, bourrelets and clay dunes. They may be composed of clay, silt, sand, or gypsum, eroded from the basin floor or shore, transported up the concave side of the dune, and deposited on the convex side. Examples in Australia are up to 6.5&nbsp;km long, 1&nbsp;km wide, and up to 50 metres high. They also occur in southern and West Africa, and in parts of the western United States, especially Texas.<ref>[[Charles Rowland Twidale|Twidale, C.R.]] & Campbell, E.M.

These dunes are formed from blowout dunes where the erosion of vegetated sand leads to a U-shaped depression. The elongated arms are held in place by vegetation; the largest arm known on Earth reaches 12&nbsp;km. Sometimes these dunes are called U-shaped, [[blowout (geology)|blowout]], or hairpin dunes, and they are well known in coastal deserts. Unlike crescent shaped dunes, their crests point upwind. The bulk of the sand in the dune migrates forward.\n\nIn plan view, these are U-shaped or V-shaped mounds of well-sorted, very fine to medium sand with elongated arms that extend upwind behind the central part of the dune. There are slipfaces that often occur on the outer side of the nose and on the outer slopes of the arms.\n\nThese dunes often occur in semiarid areas where the precipitation is retained in the lower parts of the dune and underlying soils. The stability of the dunes was once attributed to the vegetative cover but recent research has pointed to water as the main source of parabolic dune stability. The vegetation that covers them\u2014grasses, shrubs, and trees\u2014help anchor the trailing arms. In inland deserts, parabolic dunes commonly originate and extend downwind from blowouts in sand sheets only partly anchored by vegetation. They can also originate from beach sands and extend inland into vegetated areas in coastal zones and on shores of large lakes.\n\nMost parabolic dunes do not reach heights higher than a few tens of metres except at their nose, where vegetation stops or slows the advance of accumulating sand.\n\nSimple parabolic dunes have only one set of arms that trail upwind, behind the leading nose. Compound parabolic dunes are coalesced features with several sets of trailing arms. Complex parabolic dunes include subsidiary superposed or coalesced forms, usually of barchanoid or linear shapes.\n\nParabolic dunes, like crescent dunes, occur in areas where very strong winds are mostly unidirectional. Although these dunes are found in areas now characterized by variable wind speeds, the effective winds associated with the growth and migration of both the parabolic and crescent dunes probably are the most consistent in wind direction.\n\nThe grain size for these well-sorted, very fine to medium sands is about 0.06 to 0.5&nbsp;mm. Parabolic dunes have loose sand and steep slopes only on their outer flanks. The inner slopes are mostly well packed and anchored by vegetation, as are the corridors between individual dunes. Because all dune arms are oriented in the same direction, and, the inter-dune corridors are generally swept clear of loose sand, the corridors can usually be traversed in between the trailing arms of the dune. However to cross straight over the dune by going over the trailing arms, can be very difficult. Also, traversing the nose is very difficult as well because the nose is usually made up of loose sand without much if any vegetation.\n\nA type of extensive parabolic dune that lacks discernible slipfaces and has mostly coarse grained sand is known as a ''zibar''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85728-017-3|pages=395\u2013396|edition=2. impr.}}</ref> The term zibar comes from the [[Arabic]] word to describe \"rolling transverse ridges ... with a hard surface\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Goudie|first=Ron Cooke; Andrew Warren; Andrew|title=Desert geomorphology|year=1996|publisher=UCL Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85728-017-3|pages=395|edition=2. impr.}}</ref> The dunes are small, have low relief, and can be found in many places across the planet from [[Wyoming]] (United States) to Saudi Arabia to Australia.

Compound dunes are large dunes on which smaller dunes of similar type and slipface orientation are superimposed. Complex dunes are combinations of two or more dune types. A crescentic dune with a star dune superimposed on its crest is the most common complex dune. Simple dunes represent a wind regime that has not changed in intensity or direction since the formation of the dune, while compound and complex dunes suggest that the intensity and direction of the wind has changed.\n\n===Dune movement===\nThe sand mass of dunes can move either windward or leeward, depending on if the wind is making contact with the dune from below or above its apogee. If wind hits from above, the sand particles move leeward. If sand hits from below, sand particles move windward. The leeward flux of sand is greater than the windward flux. Further, when the wind carrying sand particles when it hits the dune, the dune's sand particles will saltate more than if the wind had hit the dune without carrying sand particles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jiang|first=Hong|last2=Dun|first2=Hongchao|last3=Tong|first3=Ding|last4=Huang|first4=Ning|date=15 April 2017|title=Sand transportation and reverse patterns over leeward face of sand dune|journal=Geomorphology|volume=283|pages=41\u201347|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.12.030|bibcode=2017Geomo.283...41J}}</ref>\n\n===Coastal dunes===\n[[File:LIVER AAS UDLOEB I JULI 2012 (ubt)-002.JPG|thumb|Coastal dunes covered in grasses around the mouth of the Liver \u00c5 river in Denmark]]\n[[File:Newborough Dune Rejuvenation.webm|thumb|Newborough Dune Rejuvenation, [[Wales]]; video of work done by [[Natural Resources Wales]]; 2015]]\n\nCoastal dunes<ref>https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/coastal-dunes-geomorphology-25822000/</ref> form when wet sand is deposited along the coast and dries out and is blown along the beach.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bird |first1=ECF |title=Coasts: an introduction to systematic geomorphology |date=1976 |publisher=Australian National University Press |location=Canberra, Australia}}</ref> Dunes form where the beach is wide enough to allow for the accumulation of wind-blown sand, and where prevailing '''onshore winds''' tend to blow sand inland.

The conditions on an ''embryo dune'' are harsh, with [[salt spray]] from the sea carried on strong winds. The dune is well drained and often dry, and composed of calcium carbonate from seashells. Rotting [[seaweed]], brought in by storm waves adds nutrients to allow [[pioneer species]] to colonize the dune. These pioneer species are [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|marram grass]], [[sea wort grass]] and other sea grasses in the [[United Kingdom]]. These plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the foredune\ntypically having deep roots which reach the [[water table]], [[root nodules]] that produce [[nitrogen]] compounds, and protected [[stoma]], reducing [[transpiration]]. Also, the deep roots bind the sand together, and the dune grows into a [[foredune]] as more sand is blown over the grasses. The grasses add [[nitrogen]] to the soil, meaning other, less hardy plants can then colonize the dunes. Typically these are [[Calluna|heather]], [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s and [[gorse]]s. These too are adapted to the low soil water content and have small, prickly leaves which reduce transpiration. Heather adds [[humus]] to the soil and is usually replaced by [[conifer]]ous trees, which can tolerate low soil [[pH]], caused by the accumulation and decomposition of organic matter with nitrate leaching.<ref name=Miles1985>{{Cite journal| last = Miles | first = J.| year = 1985| title = The pedogenic effects of different species and vegetation types and the implications of succession| journal = European Journal of Soil Science| volume = 36| issue = 4| pages = 571\u2013584| doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2389.1985.tb00359.x}}</ref> Coniferous forests and [[heathland]] are common [[climax community|climax communities]] for sand dune systems.\n\nYoung dunes are called [[yellow dune]]s and dunes which have high humus content are called [[grey dune]]s. Leaching occurs on the dunes, washing humus into the slacks, and the slacks may be much more developed than the exposed tops of the dunes. It is usually in the slacks that more rare species are developed and there is a tendency for the dune slacks soil to be waterlogged and where only marsh plants can survive. In Europe these plants include: creeping willow, cotton grass, [[yellow iris]], reeds, and rushes. As for vertebrates in European dunes, [[natterjack toad]]s sometimes breed here.\n\n=== Coastal dune floral adaptations ===\nDune ecosystems are extremely difficult places for plants to survive. This is due to a number of pressures related to their proximity to the ocean and confinement to growth on sandy substrates.  These include:\n* Little available soil moisture\n* Little available [[soil organic matter]]/nutrients\n* Harsh winds\n* Salt spray\n* Erosion/shifting and sometimes ephemeral substrate\n* Tidal influences\nThere are many adaptations plants have evolved to cope with these pressures:\n* Deep taproot to reach water table (Pink Sand Verbena)\n* Shallow but extensive root systems\n* Prostrate growth form to avoid wind/salt spray (''Abronia spp''., Beach Primrose)\n* Krummholz growth form (Monterrey Cypress-not a dune plant but deals with similar pressures)\n* Thickened cuticle/Succulence to reduce moisture loss and reduce salt uptake (''Ambrosia/Abronia spp., Calystegia soldanella'')\n* Pale leaves to reduce insolation (''Artemisia/Ambrosia spp.'')\n* Thorny/Spiky seeds to ensure establishment in vicinity of parent, reduces chances of being blown away or swept out to sea (''Ambrosia chamissonis'')\n\n===Nabkha dunes===\nA [[nabkha]], or coppice dune, is a small dune anchored by vegetation.

Once in this form, water passing through the rock can carry and deposit minerals, which can alter the color of the rock. [[Cross-bedding|Cross-bedded]] layers of stacks of lithified dunes can produce the cross-hatching patterns, such as those seen in [[Zion National Park]] in the western United States.\n\nA slang term, used in the [[Southwestern United States|southwest US]], for consolidated and hardened sand dunes is \"slickrock\", a name that was introduced by pioneers of the [[Old West]] because their steel-rimmed wagon wheels could not gain traction on the rock.\n\n==Desertification==\n{{Main|Desertification}}\nSand dunes can have a negative impact on humans when they encroach on human habitats. Sand dunes move via a few different means, all of them helped along by wind. One way that dunes can move is by [[saltation (geology)|saltation]], where sand particles skip along the ground like a [[bouncing ball]]. When these skipping particles land, they may knock into other particles and cause them to move as well, in a process known as [[creep (sand dunes)|creep]]. With slightly stronger winds, particles collide in mid-air, causing [[sheet flow]]s. In a major [[dust storm]], dunes may move tens of metres through such sheet flows. Also as in the case of snow, sand [[avalanche]]s, falling down the [[slipface]] of the dunes\u2014that face away from the winds\u2014also move the dunes forward.\n\nSand threatens buildings and crops in Africa, the Middle East, and China. Drenching sand dunes with oil stops their migration, but this approach uses a valuable resource and is quite destructive to the dunes' animal habitats. [[Sand fence]]s might also slow their movement to a crawl, but geologists are still analyzing results for the optimum fence designs.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Preventing sand dunes from overwhelming towns, villages, and agricultural areas has become a priority for the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Planting dunes with vegetation also helps to stabilise them.\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:KelsoSand.JPG|thumb|Sand blowing off a crest in the [[Kelso Dunes]] of the [[Mojave Desert]], California, USA]]\nDune habitats provide niches for highly specialized plants and animals, including numerous [[rare species]] and some [[endangered species]]. Due to widespread human population expansion, dunes face destruction through land development and recreational usages, as well as alteration to prevent the encroachment of sand onto inhabited areas. Some countries, notably the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Sri Lanka have developed significant programs of dune protection through the use of [[sand dune stabilization]]. In the U.K., a [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] has been developed to assess dunes loss and to prevent future dunes destruction.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Africa===\n[[File:D\u00fcne S-Schlag Sossusvlei.JPG|thumb|A dune in [[Sossusvlei]], in the greater [[Namib-Naukluft National Park]], [[Namibia]].

It was designed by Regency architect [[John Soane|Sir John Soane]] using an innovative and influential method of illumination. Dulwich is the oldest public art gallery in England and was made an independent charitable trust in 1994. Until this time the gallery was part of [[Alleyn's College of God's Gift]], a charitable foundation established by the actor, entrepreneur and philanthropist [[Edward Alleyn]] in the early-17th century. The acquisition of artworks by its founders and bequests from its many patrons resulted in Dulwich Picture Gallery housing one of the country's finest collections of [[Old Masters]], especially rich in French, Italian and Spanish [[Baroque]] paintings and in British portraits from Tudor times to the 19th century.\n\nThe Dulwich Picture Gallery and its mausoleum are [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade II*]] on the [[National Heritage List for England]].<ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1385543|desc=Dulwich Picture Gallery and Mausoleum|access-date=18 December 2017|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n==History==\n\n===Early history of the gallery===\n[[File:Dulwich Picture Gallery 04.JPG|thumb|Entrance|left]]\nEdward Alleyn (1566\u20131626) was an actor who became an entrepreneur in Elizabethan theatre. His commercial interests in the Rose and Fortune Theatres (a major competitor to the [[Globe Theatre]]), gave him sufficient wealth to acquire the Manor of Dulwich in 1605.<ref>Cerasano, S.P. ''Edward Alleyn: 1556\u20131626'', pp.11\u201331.</ref> He founded a college at Dulwich, 'the College of God's Gift', and endowed it with his estate. It was a school for boys and next to it were almshouses for the local poor. The college became three separate beneficiary schools \u2013 [[Dulwich College]], [[Alleyn's School]], and [[James Allen's Girls' School]], named after an early 18th-century headmaster.<ref>Beresford, R. ''Dulwich Picture Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue'', p.16. {{ISBN|090629018X}}</ref> The college, the attached almshouses and chapel survive next to the gallery on [[Gallery Road]], although its exterior has undergone extensive renovation.\n\nAlleyn bequeathed the college of a collection of works including portraits of the kings and queens of England. The college retained connections with the theatre and in 1686, the actor [[William Cartwright (actor)|William Cartwright]] (1606\u20131686) bequeathed a collection of 239 pictures, of which 80 are now identifiable at Dulwich. In the 18th century, the collection was displayed on the first floor of the wing of the Old College. It attracted few additions during this period, and recorded descriptions of the gallery suggest disappointment and apathy from its visitors. The art historian and Whig politician [[Horace Walpole]] wrote that he saw \"a hundred mouldy portraits among apostles sibyls and kings of England\".\n\n===Later history \u2013 Bourgeois, Desenfans and Sir John Soane===\n[[File:Sandby, Paul - Noel Desenfans and Sir Francis Bourgeois - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Bourgeois]] and No\u00ebl Desenfans]]\n\nThe Dulwich collection was improved in size and quality by Sir [[Francis Bourgeois]] (1753\u20131811), originally from Switzerland, and his business partner, Frenchman No\u00ebl Desenfans (1744\u20131807). Their involvement saw the Gallery make significant steps towards its present state, and they are credited as founders of Dulwich Picture Gallery. They ran an art dealership in London and in 1790 were commissioned by the King of [[the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus Augustus]], to assemble a national collection for Poland to encourage fine arts in his country. Desenfans had lobbied the British Government to create a similar British national collection and offered to contribute to it, but was unenthusiastically received. Touring around Europe buying [[fine art]], Bourgeois and Desenfans took five years to assemble the collection, but by 1795 the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had been [[History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|partitioned]] and no longer existed.\n\nBourgeois and Desenfans attempted to sell the collection but were unsuccessful. Instead, they sold small pieces to fund the purchase of other important works and kept the collection in Desenfans' house in Charlotte Street. After the death of Desenfans in 1807, Bourgeois inherited the collection. He commissioned Sir John Soane to design and construct a [[mausoleum]] at Desenfans' house, but was unable to secure the freehold. Bourgeois bequeathed his collection to the College of God's Gift on the advice of the actor [[John Philip Kemble]], a friend of both dealers. Bourgeois left instructions in his will for the construction of a gallery in Dulwich, designed by Soane, in which to display the collection. It was next to the original college buildings by the chapel. He also left \u00a32,000 for construction costs and \u00a34,000 was contributed by Desenfan's widow.\n\nThe gallery was opened to students of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1815, two years before the official opening to the public, the delay  due to a problem with the gallery's heating system. It became a popular venue for copyists from London schools of art. Its collection was frequented by many cultural figures over the next hundred years, many of whom first visited as students, including [[John Constable]], [[William Etty]], [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], and later [[Vincent van Gogh]]. [[Charles Dickens]] mentions Dulwich Picture Gallery in his novel ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', as [[Samuel Pickwick]], the novel's protagonist, is a visitor to the gallery in his retirement.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Jacob III de Gheyn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rembrandt]], ''[[Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III]]''.]]\n\nIn the early hours of 31 December, 1966, eight paintings were stolen, three by [[Rembrandt]], ''A Girl at the Window'', a version of'' Portrait of Titus'' and his ''[[Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III]]'', a fellow artist, three by [[Rubens]], ''Three Women with a Cornucopia'', ''St. Barbara and The Three Graces''; and one, ''A Lady Playing on the Clavicord'' by [[Gerrit Dou]] and ''Susannah and the Elders'' by [[Adam Elsheimer]]. They were worth at least \u00a33 million but a reward of just \u00a31,000 was offered for their return. Within a few days all the paintings were recovered after an investigation led by [[Detective Superintendent]] Charles Hewett, who had previously investigated suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]]. Michael Hall, an unemployed ambulance driver, was the only one of the thieves caught and was sentenced to five years in prison.<ref>Hugh McLeave, ''Rogues in the Gallery: The Modern Plague of Art Thefts'', C&M Online Media, Inc. {{ISBN|0-917990-82-X}}</ref>\n\nRembrandt's small early ''[[Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III]]'' (1632) has been stolen and recovered four times and is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most frequently stolen artwork in the world.<ref name=\"Baynes\">{{cite news|last=Baynes|first=Chris|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rembrandt-paintings-theft-dulwich-picture-gallery-met-police-london-a9203616.html|title=Intruder breaks into gallery to steal priceless Rembrandt paintings|work=The Independent|date=14 November 2019|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref> Last stolen in 1983, it was recovered from a left-luggage office in <!-- M\u00fcnster (1986 LA Times source: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-09-mn-5563-story.html), not Munich as previously stated -->the Federal Republic of Germany in 1986; returned anonymously; found on the back of a bicycle; and discovered under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham, south London.<ref name=\"Karim\">{{cite news|last1=Karim|first1=Fariha|last2=Simpson|first2=John|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/rembrandts-left-in-gallery-grounds-as-art-heist-thwarted-mksvdc66d?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307|title=Rembrandts left in gallery grounds as art heist thwarted|work=The Times|date=15 November 2019|access-date=15 November 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Since 2010, the painting has been guarded by an upgraded security system.<ref name=\"Baynes\" /> In November 2019, During the ''Rembrandt's Light'' exhibition featuring loans works from the [[Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, thieves attempted to steal two of the paintings.

In 1835 [[William Linley]] (1771\u20131835) \u2014 last of [[Thomas Linley the elder#Children|a musical and theatrical family]], (many of whom had connections to Dulwich College) and brother-in-law to playwright [[Richard Sheridan]] \u2014 bequeathed his collection of family portraits to the gallery. Among these paintings were works by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Archer James Oliver]], [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]] and [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]].\n\nThe portraitist and Royal Academician [[William Beechey]] (1753\u20131839) donated a picture of the gallery's founder Bourgeois he had painted on the back of a picture by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1836 adding two images to the collection, although only one can be shown at a time. In 2012, the side of the canvas on display is by Reynolds.\n\nBritish portrait art became better represented due to the benefaction of [[Charles Fairfax Murray]], a [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter, collector and dealer. A group of 40 pictures were donated by Murray in 1911 and others followed in 1915 and 1917\u201318.\n\n==Gallery design==\n[[File:Dr C Vogtherr on Dulwich Picture Gallery.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the gallery by [[Christoph Vogtherr]]]]\nDulwich Picture Gallery's design and architecture comprising a series of interlinked rooms lit by natural light through overhead [[Skylight (window)|skylight]]s has been the primary influence on art gallery design ever since. Soane designed the sky lights to illuminate the paintings indirectly. Soane's design was unrelated to traditional architectural practice or schools of architecture. Instead of constructing a facade with the [[stucco]] [[porticos]] favoured by many contemporary architects, he opted to use uninterrupted raw brick, a feature subsequently adopted by many 20th-century art galleries. The architect [[Philip Johnson]] [1906\u20132005] said \"Soane has taught us how to display paintings\".\n\nBefore Soane settled on his final design, he proposed a number of other ideas around a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] belonging to the Alleyn's charitable foundation to the south of the college buildings. The schemes proved too ambitious and only the gallery was built, conceived as one wing of the quadrangle. The mausoleum was Soane's idea, as Bourgeois had merely indicated a desire to be buried in the college chapel. Soane recalled Bourgeois' desire to construct a mausoleum in Desenfan's home and his design was axiomatic to that of the Charlotte Street house. Bourgeois and Desenfans, along with Desenfans' wife, who died in 1815, are buried in the gallery's mausoleum. [[Alms house]]s constructed by Soane along the west side of the gallery were converted into exhibition space by [[Charles Barry, Jr.]] in 1880 and an eastward extension was built to designs by E S Hall between 1908 and 1938.\n\nOn 12 July 1944, during [[World War II]], the mausoleum and west wing galleries were badly damaged by a German V1 flying bomb and bones were scattered across the lawn in front of the gallery. The three [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in the mausoleum now contain approximately a [[skeleton]] each. The buildings were refurbished by [[Austin Vernon and Partners]] and re-opened by [[the Queen Mother]] on 27 April 1953.<ref name=Telegraph20090907 >{{cite news |title=Russell Vernon  |date=7 September 2009 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/6151989/Russell-Vernon.html}}</ref>\n\nA modernist cafe, education rooms, disabled access and lecture theatre by [[Rick Mather]] were added in 1999. At the same time parts of Soane's original design were restored and the latest refurbishment was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 25 May 2000.<ref name=Telegraph20090220 >{{cite news |title=Overhauled but understated |last=Worsley|first=Giles|date=23 May 2000 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4720779/Overhauled-but-understated.html}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<Gallery mode=packed>\nImage:Dulwich picture gallery at sunset.jpg|Exterior view\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery TQ3373 142.jpg|Dulwich Picture Gallery exterior looking north\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery exterior.jpg|Exterior \u2013 east frontage\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery.jpg|Mausoleum\nImage:Dulwich-picture-gallery-interior.JPG|The main gallery\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery mausoleum.jpg|Inside the mausoleum\n</Gallery>\n\n==Collection==\n[[File:Pynacker, Adam -

The acquisition of artworks by its founders and bequests from its many patrons resulted in Dulwich Picture Gallery housing one of the country's finest collections of [[Old Masters]], especially rich in French, Italian and Spanish [[Baroque]] paintings and in British portraits from Tudor times to the 19th century.\n\nThe Dulwich Picture Gallery and its mausoleum are [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade II*]] on the [[National Heritage List for England]].<ref name=NHLE>{{NHLE|num=1385543|desc=Dulwich Picture Gallery and Mausoleum|access-date=18 December 2017|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n==History==\n\n===Early history of the gallery===\n[[File:Dulwich Picture Gallery 04.JPG|thumb|Entrance|left]]\nEdward Alleyn (1566\u20131626) was an actor who became an entrepreneur in Elizabethan theatre. His commercial interests in the Rose and Fortune Theatres (a major competitor to the [[Globe Theatre]]), gave him sufficient wealth to acquire the Manor of Dulwich in 1605.<ref>Cerasano, S.P. ''Edward Alleyn: 1556\u20131626'', pp.11\u201331.</ref> He founded a college at Dulwich, 'the College of God's Gift', and endowed it with his estate. It was a school for boys and next to it were almshouses for the local poor. The college became three separate beneficiary schools \u2013 [[Dulwich College]], [[Alleyn's School]], and [[James Allen's Girls' School]], named after an early 18th-century headmaster.<ref>Beresford, R. ''Dulwich Picture Gallery: Complete Illustrated Catalogue'', p.16. {{ISBN|090629018X}}</ref> The college, the attached almshouses and chapel survive next to the gallery on [[Gallery Road]], although its exterior has undergone extensive renovation.\n\nAlleyn bequeathed the college of a collection of works including portraits of the kings and queens of England. The college retained connections with the theatre and in 1686, the actor [[William Cartwright (actor)|William Cartwright]] (1606\u20131686) bequeathed a collection of 239 pictures, of which 80 are now identifiable at Dulwich. In the 18th century, the collection was displayed on the first floor of the wing of the Old College. It attracted few additions during this period, and recorded descriptions of the gallery suggest disappointment and apathy from its visitors. The art historian and Whig politician [[Horace Walpole]] wrote that he saw \"a hundred mouldy portraits among apostles sibyls and kings of England\".\n\n===Later history \u2013 Bourgeois, Desenfans and Sir John Soane===\n[[File:Sandby, Paul - Noel Desenfans and Sir Francis Bourgeois - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Bourgeois]] and No\u00ebl Desenfans]]\n\nThe Dulwich collection was improved in size and quality by Sir [[Francis Bourgeois]] (1753\u20131811), originally from Switzerland, and his business partner, Frenchman No\u00ebl Desenfans (1744\u20131807). Their involvement saw the Gallery make significant steps towards its present state, and they are credited as founders of Dulwich Picture Gallery. They ran an art dealership in London and in 1790 were commissioned by the King of [[the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanislaus Augustus]], to assemble a national collection for Poland to encourage fine arts in his country. Desenfans had lobbied the British Government to create a similar British national collection and offered to contribute to it, but was unenthusiastically received. Touring around Europe buying [[fine art]], Bourgeois and Desenfans took five years to assemble the collection, but by 1795 the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth had been [[History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|partitioned]] and no longer existed.\n\nBourgeois and Desenfans attempted to sell the collection but were unsuccessful. Instead, they sold small pieces to fund the purchase of other important works and kept the collection in Desenfans' house in Charlotte Street. After the death of Desenfans in 1807, Bourgeois inherited the collection. He commissioned Sir John Soane to design and construct a [[mausoleum]] at Desenfans' house, but was unable to secure the freehold. Bourgeois bequeathed his collection to the College of God's Gift on the advice of the actor [[John Philip Kemble]], a friend of both dealers. Bourgeois left instructions in his will for the construction of a gallery in Dulwich, designed by Soane, in which to display the collection. It was next to the original college buildings by the chapel. He also left \u00a32,000 for construction costs and \u00a34,000 was contributed by Desenfan's widow.\n\nThe gallery was opened to students of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1815, two years before the official opening to the public, the delay  due to a problem with the gallery's heating system. It became a popular venue for copyists from London schools of art. Its collection was frequented by many cultural figures over the next hundred years, many of whom first visited as students, including [[John Constable]], [[William Etty]], [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], and later [[Vincent van Gogh]]. [[Charles Dickens]] mentions Dulwich Picture Gallery in his novel ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', as [[Samuel Pickwick]], the novel's protagonist, is a visitor to the gallery in his retirement.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn - Jacob III de Gheyn - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rembrandt]], ''[[Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III]]''.]]\n\nIn the early hours of 31 December 1966 eight paintings were stolen, three by [[Rembrandt]], ''A Girl at the Window'', a version of'' Portrait of Titus'' and his ''[[Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III]]'', a fellow artist, three by [[Rubens]], ''Three Women with a Cornucopia'', ''St. Barbara and The Three Graces''; and one, ''A Lady Playing on the Clavicord'' by [[Gerrit Dou]] and ''Susannah and the Elders'' by [[Adam Elsheimer]]. They were worth at least \u00a33 million but a reward of just \u00a31,000 was offered for their return. Within a few days all the paintings were recovered after an investigation led by [[Detective Superintendent]] Charles Hewett, who had previously investigated suspected [[serial killer]] [[John Bodkin Adams|Dr John Bodkin Adams]]. Michael Hall, an unemployed ambulance driver, was the only one of the thieves caught and was sentenced to five years in prison.<ref>Hugh McLeave, ''Rogues in the Gallery: The Modern Plague of Art Thefts'', C&M Online Media, Inc. {{ISBN|0-917990-82-X}}</ref>\n\nRembrandt's small early ''[[Portrait of Jacob de Gheyn III]]'' (1632) has been stolen and recovered four times and is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most frequently stolen artwork in the world.<ref name=\"Baynes\">{{cite news|last=Baynes|first=Chris|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/rembrandt-paintings-theft-dulwich-picture-gallery-met-police-london-a9203616.html|title=Intruder breaks into gallery to steal priceless Rembrandt paintings|work=The Independent|date=14 November 2019|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref> Last stolen in 1983, it was recovered from a left-luggage office in <!-- M\u00fcnster (1986 LA Times source: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-09-mn-5563-story.html), not Munich as previously stated -->the Federal Republic of Germany in 1986; returned anonymously; found on the back of a bicycle; and discovered under a bench in a graveyard in Streatham, south London.<ref name=\"Karim\">{{cite news|last1=Karim|first1=Fariha|last2=Simpson|first2=John|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/rembrandts-left-in-gallery-grounds-as-art-heist-thwarted-mksvdc66d?ni-statuscode=acsaz-307|title=Rembrandts left in gallery grounds as art heist thwarted|work=The Times|date=15 November 2019|access-date=15 November 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Since 2010, the painting has been guarded by an upgraded security system.<ref name=\"Baynes\" /> In November 2019, During the ''Rembrandt's Light'' exhibition featuring loans works from the [[Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, thieves attempted to steal two of the paintings.

In 1835 [[William Linley]] (1771\u20131835) \u2014 last of [[Thomas Linley the elder#Children|a musical and theatrical family]], (many of whom had connections to Dulwich College) and brother-in-law to playwright [[Richard Sheridan]] \u2014 bequeathed his collection of family portraits to the gallery. Among these paintings were works by [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Archer James Oliver]], [[James Lonsdale (painter)|James Lonsdale]] and [[Sir Thomas Lawrence]].\n\nThe portraitist and Royal Academician [[William Beechey]] (1753\u20131839) donated a picture of the gallery's founder Bourgeois he had painted on the back of a picture by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in 1836 adding two images to the collection, although only one can be shown at a time. In 2012, the side of the canvas on display is by Reynolds.\n\nBritish portrait art became better represented due to the benefaction of [[Charles Fairfax Murray]], a [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter, collector and dealer. A group of 40 pictures were donated by Murray in 1911 and others followed in 1915 and 1917\u201318.\n\n==Gallery design==\n[[File:Dr C Vogtherr on Dulwich Picture Gallery.ogg|thumb|Audio description of the gallery by [[Christoph Vogtherr]]]]\nDulwich Picture Gallery's design and architecture comprising a series of interlinked rooms lit by natural light through overhead [[Skylight (window)|skylight]]s has been the primary influence on art gallery design ever since. Soane designed the sky lights to illuminate the paintings indirectly. Soane's design was unrelated to traditional architectural practice or schools of architecture. Instead of constructing a facade with the [[stucco]] [[porticos]] favoured by many contemporary architects, he opted to use uninterrupted raw brick, a feature subsequently adopted by many 20th-century art galleries. The architect [[Philip Johnson]] [1906\u20132005] said \"Soane has taught us how to display paintings\".\n\nBefore Soane settled on his final design, he proposed a number of other ideas around a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] belonging to the Alleyn's charitable foundation to the south of the college buildings. The schemes proved too ambitious and only the gallery was built, conceived as one wing of the quadrangle. The mausoleum was Soane's idea, as Bourgeois had merely indicated a desire to be buried in the college chapel. Soane recalled Bourgeois' desire to construct a mausoleum in Desenfan's home and his design was axiomatic to that of the Charlotte Street house. Bourgeois and Desenfans, along with Desenfans' wife, who died in 1815, are buried in the gallery's mausoleum. [[Alms house]]s constructed by Soane along the west side of the gallery were converted into exhibition space by [[Charles Barry, Jr.]] in 1880 and an eastward extension was built to designs by E S Hall between 1908 and 1938.\n\nOn 12 July 1944, during [[World War II]], the mausoleum and west wing galleries were badly damaged by a German V1 flying bomb and bones were scattered across the lawn in front of the gallery. The three [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in the mausoleum now contain approximately a [[skeleton]] each. The buildings were refurbished by [[Austin Vernon and Partners]] and re-opened by [[the Queen Mother]] on 27 April 1953.<ref name=Telegraph20090907 >{{cite news |title=Russell Vernon  |date=7 September 2009 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/6151989/Russell-Vernon.html}}</ref>\n\nA modernist cafe, education rooms, disabled access and lecture theatre by [[Rick Mather]] were added in 1999. At the same time parts of Soane's original design were restored and the latest refurbishment was opened by [[Queen Elizabeth II]] on 25 May 2000.<ref name=Telegraph20090220 >{{cite news |title=Overhauled but understated |last=Worsley|first=Giles|date=23 May 2000 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4720779/Overhauled-but-understated.html}}</ref>\n\n\n\n<Gallery mode=packed>\nImage:Dulwich picture gallery at sunset.jpg|Exterior view\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery TQ3373 142.jpg|Dulwich Picture Gallery exterior looking north\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery exterior.jpg|Exterior \u2013 east frontage\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery.jpg|Mausoleum\nImage:Dulwich-picture-gallery-interior.JPG|The main gallery\nImage:Dulwich Picture Gallery mausoleum.jpg|Inside the mausoleum\n</Gallery>\n\n==Collection==\n[[File:Pynacker, Adam -

Then, the term was used by Bengali patriotic songs like ''Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo'', by [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and ''Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy'', by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=nomo+nomo+nomo+bangladesh+momo&start=0 | title=Google}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144200/http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* '''Bangalees''', an [[exonym]] for [[Bengalis]], was used between 1972 and 1978 by the Constitution of Bangladesh for all citizens of Bangladesh, despite 2% of the population being indigenous and immigrant non-Bengalis. Under President [[Ziaur Rahman]], the constitutional term was changed to ''Bangladeshi'', as part of efforts to promote [[Bangladeshi nationalism]].<ref name=\"Murshid 2001 165\"/>\n* '''East Bengalis''', a term used in reference to Bangladesh being a political unit based on the [[Partition of Bengal (disambiguation)|\nPartition of Bengal]]. The territory was known as ''East Bengal'' twice in the 20th century. It was used for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in the [[British Raj]] between 1906 and 1912. It was again used for the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]'s province of [[East Bengal]] between 1947 and 1955.\n* '''Bangals''', a term used informally in neighboring [[India]] to refer to Bangladeshis. ''[[Bangal]]'' is also the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] term for ''Bengal''. In [[West Bengal]], ''Bangal'' is widely used among upper-class subgroups to differentiate families from Bangladesh, the opposite then being ''[[Ghoti people|Ghoti]]'', which once referred to people from West Bengal.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe region of Bengal was settled by people of diverse origins, including [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic]] ancestry, with the most ancient settlements traced back to 4000 YBP.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia| isbn=9781598846607| last1=Minahan| first1=James B| date=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Bengalis===\n[[File:BD Dance.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi artists performing in a dance show.]]\nApproximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are [[Bengalis]]. East Bengal was a prosperous [[melting pot]] for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of [[Bengali dialects|dialects]].\n\n90% of the population are [[Bengali Muslim]]s (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest [[Islam by country|Muslim majority country]] after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after [[Arab Muslims]]. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiya]] branches. [[Bengali Hindus]] are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 10\u201312 million. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. There are an estimated 400,000 [[Bengali Christians]] and 500,000 [[Bengali Buddhists]].\n\nThe Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division.\n\n===Non-Bengali Muslims===\nAn estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali [[Muslim]] immigrants from different parts of [[South Asia]].

It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory.

The individual [[nuclear family]] often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (''ghor''). Above the ''bari'' level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.<ref name=rs>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Rural Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\nA significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \"the society\" (''shomaj'' or ''milat''). Among the functions of a ''shomaj'' might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a [[mullah]]. An informal council of ''shomaj'' elders (''matabdars'' or ''shordars'') settles village disputes. Factional competition between the ''motobdars'' is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.<ref name=rs/>\n\nGroups of homes in a village are called ''Paras'', and each ''para'' has its own name. Several ''paras'' constitute a ''mauza'', the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common [[thatched]] [[bamboo]] huts.<ref name=rs/>\n\nAlthough farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.\n\n==Urban society==\n[[File:Dhaka Skyline at Night.jpg|thumb|300px|View of downtown [[Dhaka]], the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populated cities]]\nIn 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> [[Dhaka]] is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous [[megacities]]. Other important cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Jessore]], [[Barisal]], [[Comilla]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Mymensingh]]. Most urban centers are rural administrative [[town]]s. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of [[upazila]]s.<ref name=us>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Urban Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\n==Identity==\nBangladesh is noted for [[cultural pluralism]] within a [[Bengali Muslim]] majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The [[Bengali language]] is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced [[socialism]] under a secular parliamentary system. [[Military coups in Bangladesh|Military coups]] ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the [[free market]] and promoted moderate [[Islamism]]. In 1988, [[Islam]] was made the [[state religion]]. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of [[Secularity|separation of mosque and state]] in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=BANGLADESH|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities.<ref name=\"state.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=United States Department of State|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace treaty]] in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect [[adivasi]] land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of ''Bangalee'' as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Bangladesh}}\nCulture of Bangladesh has evolved with influences from diverse social societies. Bangladesh's main religions are Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism,  which have played a critical part in influencing the country's culture.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Wikipedia in Bangla.svg|thumb|The word ''Wikipedia'' written in the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]]]\nThe official language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. [[Bengali dialects]] vary between different regions of Bangladesh.\n\nThe oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at [[Mahasthangarh]] and is written in the [[Brahmi script]]. The language is [[Magadhi Prakrit]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mahasthan_Brahmi_Inscription |title = Mahasthan Brahmi Inscription - Banglapedia}}</ref> The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and it's written from [[Apabhramsa]], between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]], but later became distinct. It became an official language of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocabulary from [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Bengali is the [[List of languages by the number of native speakers|10th most spoken language in the world]]. The language was modernized during the [[Bengali Renaissance]] in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], Assamese, Odia and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The indigenous [[Bengali alphabet]]s descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.\n\nThe [[Bengali Language Movement]] in East Pakistan was a key catalyst for forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by [[UNESCO]] as [[International Mother Language Day]], as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.\n\nBangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including [[Santhali language|Santhali]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Marma language|Marma]], Chakma and [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bisnupriya Manipuri]].\n\n=== Surnames ===\n{{Main|Bengali name}}\nBangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origins. Bangladeshi Hindus have Sanskritized Bengali surnames. Many Bangladeshi Christians have Portuguese surnames. Buddhists have a mixture of Bengali and Tibeto-Burman surnames.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bangladeshis]]\n* [[Bangladeshi diaspora]]\n* [[Demographics of

Then, the term was used by Bengali patriotic songs like ''Namo Namo Namo Bangladesh Momo'', by [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and ''Aaji Bangladesher Hridoy'', by [[Rabindranath Tagore]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.google.de/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=nomo+nomo+nomo+bangladesh+momo&start=0 | title=Google}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=20 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017144200/http://www.geetabitan.com/lyrics/A/aaji-bangladesher-hridoy.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n* '''Bangalees''', an [[exonym]] for [[Bengalis]], was used between 1972 and 1978 by the Constitution of Bangladesh for all citizens of Bangladesh, despite 2% of the population being indigenous and immigrant non-Bengalis. Under President [[Ziaur Rahman]], the constitutional term was changed to ''Bangladeshi'', as part of efforts to promote [[Bangladeshi nationalism]].<ref name=\"Murshid 2001 165\"/>\n* '''East Bengalis''', a term used in reference to Bangladesh being a political unit based on the [[Partition of Bengal (disambiguation)|\nPartition of Bengal]]. The territory was known as ''East Bengal'' twice in the 20th century. It was used for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] in the [[British Raj]] between 1906 and 1912. It was again used for the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]'s province of [[East Bengal]] between 1947 and 1955.\n* '''Bangals''', a term used informally in neighboring [[India]] to refer to Bangladeshis. ''[[Bangal]]'' is also the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] term for ''Bengal''. In [[West Bengal]], ''Bangal'' is widely used among upper-class subgroups to differentiate families from Bangladesh, the opposite then being ''[[Ghoti people|Ghoti]]'', which once referred to people from West Bengal.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe region of Bengal was settled by people of diverse origins, including [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]], [[Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic]] ancestry, with the most ancient settlements traced back to 4000 YBP.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia: An Encyclopedia| isbn=9781598846607| last1=Minahan| first1=James B| date=30 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Bengalis===\n[[File:BD Dance.jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi artists performing in a dance show.]]\nApproximately 98% of the Bangladeshi population are [[Bengalis]]. East Bengal was a prosperous [[melting pot]] for centuries. It witnessed a synthesis of Islamic, North Indian and indigenous Bengali cultures. Today, Bengalis enjoy strong cultural homogeneity with a common standardized language and a variety of [[Bengali dialects|dialects]].\n\n90% of the population are [[Bengali Muslim]]s (146 million). This makes Bangladesh the world's third largest [[Islam by country|Muslim majority country]] after [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]]. Bengali Muslims also make up the world's second largest Muslim ethnic group after [[Arab Muslims]]. Most Bangladeshi Muslims are member of the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam. There are significant minorities of the [[Shia]] and [[Ahmadiya]] branches. [[Bengali Hindus]] are the largest minority of Bangladesh, with a population between 10\u201312 million. Bangladesh has the third largest Hindu population in the world after [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. There are an estimated 400,000 [[Bengali Christians]] and 500,000 [[Bengali Buddhists]].\n\nThe Bengali population is concentrated in Bengal delta, the coastal areas of Chittagong Division and the river valleys of Sylhet Division.\n\n===Non-Bengali Muslims===\nAn estimated 3 million Bangladeshi citizens are non-Bengali [[Muslim]] immigrants from different parts of [[South Asia]].

It was an exclusive zone for Tibeto-Burman tribes in [[Bengal Presidency|Bengal]] during the [[British Raj]]. Today, the area makes up 10% of Bangladesh's territory. It is home to several [[indigenous people|indigenous]] ethnic groups in the three hill districts of [[Rangamati]], [[Bandarban]] and [[Khagrachari]]. The three largest communities in the region have a [[Raja]] as their tribal chief who is recognized by the Government of Bangladesh.\n\n* The [[Chakma people]] are the largest tribe of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and the second largest indigenous ethnic group of Bangladesh after Bengalis. A [[Tibeto-Burman]] community, they have been greatly influenced by [[Bengali culture]], including in their native [[Chakma language]], a branch of the [[Bengali-Assamese languages]].

The individual [[nuclear family]] often is submerged in the larger unit and might be known as the house (''ghor''). Above the ''bari'' level, patrilineal kin ties are linked into sequentially larger groups based on real, fictional, or assumed relationships.<ref name=rs>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Rural Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\nA significant unit larger than that of close kin is the voluntary religious and mutual benefit association known as \"the society\" (''shomaj'' or ''milat''). Among the functions of a ''shomaj'' might be the maintenance of a Mosque and support of a [[mullah]]. An informal council of ''shomaj'' elders (''matabdars'' or ''shordars'') settles village disputes. Factional competition between the ''motobdars'' is a major dynamic of social and political interaction.<ref name=rs/>\n\nGroups of homes in a village are called ''Paras'', and each ''para'' has its own name. Several ''paras'' constitute a ''mauza'', the basic revenue and census survey unit. The traditional character of rural villages was changing in the latter half of the 20th century with the addition of brick structures of one or more stories scattered among the more common [[thatched]] [[bamboo]] huts.<ref name=rs/>\n\nAlthough farming has traditionally ranked among the most desirable occupations, villagers in the 1980s began to encourage their children to leave the increasingly overcrowded countryside to seek more secure employment in the towns. Traditional sources of prestige, such as landholding, distinguished lineage, and religious piety were beginning to be replaced by modern education, higher income, and steadier work. These changes, however, did not prevent rural poverty from increasing greatly.\n\n==Urban society==\n[[File:Dhaka Skyline at Night.jpg|thumb|300px|View of downtown [[Dhaka]], the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populated cities]]\nIn 2015, 34% of Bangladeshis lived in cities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2212.html|title=The World Factbook \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> [[Dhaka]] is the largest city in Bangladesh and one of the world's most populous [[megacities]]. Other important cities include [[Chittagong]], [[Sylhet]], [[Khulna]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Jessore]], [[Barisal]], [[Comilla]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Mymensingh]]. Most urban centers are rural administrative [[town]]s. Urban centers grew in number and population during the 1980s as a result of an administrative decentralization program that featured the creation of [[upazila]]s.<ref name=us>Rahim, Enayetur. \"Urban Society\". In Heitzman & Worden.</ref>\n\n==Identity==\nBangladesh is noted for [[cultural pluralism]] within a [[Bengali Muslim]] majority. Traditional Bengali secularism has been an important contributor to the nation's society and ethos. The [[Bengali language]] is a fundamental element of Bangladeshi identity. It is a secular language which evolved between the 7th and 10th centuries, with an indigenous alphabet, and unites people of different faiths and regions. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] sowed the seeds of East Pakistani nationalism, ultimately culminating in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. Since independence, the relationship between religion and the state has been controversial. Between 1972 and 1975, Bangladesh experienced [[socialism]] under a secular parliamentary system. [[Military coups in Bangladesh|Military coups]] ushered a sixteen-year presidential regime, which restored the [[free market]] and promoted moderate [[Islamism]]. In 1988, [[Islam]] was made the [[state religion]]. In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle of [[Secularity|separation of mosque and state]] in the constitution, although Islam remains the state religion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=BANGLADESH|last=|first=|date=|website=state.gov|publisher=United States Department of State|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> The government generally respects freedom of religion and ensures protection for minorities.<ref name=\"state.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/171752.pdf|title=United States Department of State|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> Another debate on national identity concerns attitudes towards the Chittagong Hill Tracts. A low-level insurgency took place in the region to demand constitutional autonomy against Bengali settlements. Despite a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord|peace treaty]] in 1997, the Bangladeshi government is yet to implement many of its commitments to protect [[adivasi]] land rights. However, the deletion in 1977 of ''Bangalee'' as the nationality term for the country's citizens, in order to be inclusive of non-Bengali minorities, also reflects attempts to build a more cosmopolitan Bangladeshi society.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Culture of Bangladesh}}\nCulture of Bangladesh has evolved with influences from diverse social societies. Bangladesh's main religions are Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism,  which have played a critical part in influencing the country's culture.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Languages of Bangladesh}}\n[[File:Wikipedia in Bangla.svg|thumb|The word ''Wikipedia'' written in the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]]]\nThe official language of Bangladesh is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which is shared with the neighboring Indian states of West Bengal, Assam, and Tripura. [[Bengali dialects]] vary between different regions of Bangladesh.\n\nThe oldest literary inscription in Bangladesh dates back to the 3rd century BCE. It was found at [[Mahasthangarh]] and is written in the [[Brahmi script]]. The language is [[Magadhi Prakrit]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Mahasthan_Brahmi_Inscription |title = Mahasthan Brahmi Inscription - Banglapedia}}</ref> The Bengali language developed from Magadhi Prakrit, and it's written from [[Apabhramsa]], between the 7th and 10th centuries. It once formed a single eastern [[Indo-Aryan language]] with [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]], but later became distinct. It became an official language of the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], where it was spoken as the main vernacular language. It absorbed vocabulary from [[Arabic]], [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]]. Bengali is the [[List of languages by the number of native speakers|10th most spoken language in the world]]. The language was modernized during the [[Bengali Renaissance]] in the 19th century. It has influenced other languages in the region, including [[Chakma language|Chakma]], [[Rohingya language|Rohingya]], Assamese, Odia and [[Nepali language|Nepali]]. The indigenous [[Bengali alphabet]]s descended from Brahmi serves as the Bengali script.\n\nThe [[Bengali Language Movement]] in East Pakistan was a key catalyst for forming Bangladeshi identity. It is commemorated by [[UNESCO]] as [[International Mother Language Day]], as part of worldwide efforts to preserve linguistic heritage.\n\nBangladesh is also home to number of minority indigenous languages, including [[Santhali language|Santhali]], [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Marma language|Marma]], Chakma and [[Bishnupriya Manipuri language|Bisnupriya Manipuri]].\n\n=== Surnames ===\n{{Main|Bengali name}}\nBangladeshis Muslims typically but not exclusively carry surnames that have [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] origins.
