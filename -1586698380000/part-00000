Moved to Greece to help defend against a German invasion, the battalion participated in the [[Battle of Greece]] but was evacuated at the conclusion of the fighting in the country. It then fought in the [[North African Campaign]] and suffered heavy losses during [[Operation Crusader]], when it was effectively destroyed by the [[15th Panzer Division]]. From December 1941 to February 1942 the battalion was brought back up to strength before being transferred to Syria. It returned to Egypt in March 1942 and suffered heavy casualties during the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].\n\nAfter the fighting in North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion participated in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at [[Cassino]]. It finished the war in [[Trieste]], and remained there to counter the presence of [[Yugoslav partisans]] that had entered the city. After the withdrawal of the partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to [[Florence]] while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.\n\n==Formation==\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the [[2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=16}} Following consultation with the British government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be in the form of an infantry division, the [[2nd New Zealand Division]], which would require nine battalions of infantry.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=19}} Consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=16}}\n\nThe 25th Battalion was the eighth such unit{{#tag:ref|The numbering of the battalions raised for the 2NZEF followed that of the existing 17 infantry battalions of the [[Territorial Force (New Zealand)|Territorial Force]]. Thus, the first battalion formed for the 2NZEF was the [[18th Battalion (New Zealand)|18th Battalion]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=21}}|group=Note}} raised for the 2NZEF and was formed on 15 May 1940 at [[Trentham Military Camp]] with personnel drawn largely from [[Wellington]], [[Hawke's Bay]] and the [[Taranaki region]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=1}} With an establishment of around 780 men,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=6}} it was organised into four rifle companies, a headquarters company consisting of specialised personnel such as signals and a battalion headquarters. It was one of three infantry battalions{{#tag:ref|The other two infantry battalions were the [[24th Battalion (New Zealand)|24th]] and [[26th Battalion (New Zealand)|26th]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=57}}|group=Note}} that were part of what was initially known as the Third Echelon of the 2NZEF and which would later be designated the [[6th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|6th Infantry Brigade]], one of three infantry brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=1}}{{#tag:ref|The other two were the [[4th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|4th]] and [[5th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|5th]] Brigades. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigades were Territorial Force formations.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=21}}|group=Note}}\n\nUnder the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Allan Wilder, who had served with the [[Wellington Mounted Rifles]] during the [[First World War]],{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=1}} the battalion embarked for active service aboard the [[Cunard Line|Cunard liner]] [[RMS Mauretania (1938)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] on 27 August 1940.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=6}} After transferring to the [[Orient Steam Navigation Company|Orient liner]] [[SS Ormonde|SS ''Ormonde'']] at [[Bombay]],{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=11}} the battalion arrived in the Middle East on 29 September and immediately commenced intensive training at [[Maadi Camp]], the 2NZEF base near the town of [[Maadi]], in Egypt.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=15\u201316}}\n[[File:Maadi Military Camp.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white photograph of a desert landscape, with huts in the mid-distance and the walls of a city in the far distance|For a period in 1940, the 25th Battalion was based at Maadi Camp, seen here in 1941 with Cairo in the background]]\n\n==Greece==\nThe British Government anticipated an [[Battle of Greece|invasion of Greece]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in 1941 and decided to send troops to support the Greeks, who were [[Greco-Italian War|already engaged]] against the Italians in [[Albania]]. The 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of Allied units dispatched to Greece in early March.{{sfn|McClymont|1959|p=103}} The 6th Infantry Brigade was tasked with the defence of the coastal portion of the [[Aliakmon]] Line in northern Greece, with the 25th Battalion preparing and manning the defences around Agios Ilias.{{sfn|McClymont|1959|p=136}}\n\nOn 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and their advance was so rapid that it quickly threatened to outflank the Aliakmon Line. The brigade had to abandon its positions and was withdrawn to the Olympus Pass on 9 April.  This marked the beginning of a gradual retreat down the country, during which a series of rearguard actions were fought by elements of the division.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=208}} The battalion [[Battle of Thermopylae (1941)|fought off a sharp attack]] by the German [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]] on its positions around [[Thermopylae]] on 24 April, its only major engagement of the campaign in Greece, before it successfully disengaged later that day.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=62\u201363}} It was evacuated from Greece on 29 April along with the rest of the 6th Brigade, the 4th and 5th Brigades having been taken off beaches to the east of [[Athens]]. While the latter brigades disembarked at [[Crete]], the 6th Brigade continued onto Egypt.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=74}}\n\nCasualties during the 25th Battalion's campaign in Greece amounted to nearly 30 killed and wounded with 150 personnel captured and made prisoners of war.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=638}} The majority of the captured personnel were from the battalion's reinforcement company, which had been left in Athens when the 6th Brigade moved up to the Aliakmon Line, as well as a truckload of infantrymen that had been misdirected to [[Kalamata]] during the retreat. One soldier managed to escape and eventually make his way to Turkey by sea, an act for which he was later awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=75}}\n\n==North Africa==\nBy late May, and after a period of training and refitting, the 25th Battalion was back up to full strength and moved to Kantara West, near the [[Suez Canal]]. Here, along with the rest of the 6th Brigade, the battalion manned defences against a possible attack from German [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'']] (paratroopers), [[Battle of Crete|recent events]] in Crete demonstrating the threat these forces could pose.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=78\u201379}}  The battalion shifted to the [[Baggush Box]], near [[Mersa Matruh]] and to the west of Alexandria, in September 1941. At the same time, its commander, Wilder, was promoted to [[brigadier]] and given command of the New Zealand Training Group at Maadi Camp. The battalion's new commander was Lieutenant Colonel Gifford McNaught who had recently been involved in the fighting on Crete before being evacuated.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=83}} At Baggush, the battalion improved the defences in the area and underwent intensive training in open desert warfare.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=84}}\n\nThis training was in preparation for the 2nd New Zealand Division's role in the upcoming [[Operation Crusader]], which was planned to lift the [[siege of Tobruk]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=192\u2013193}} The New Zealanders were to be one of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|8th Army]]'s infantry divisions that were to surround and capture the main strong points along the front while the armoured divisions were to seek out and engage ''[[Generalleutnant]]''{{#tag:ref|The rank of ''generalleutnant'' is equivalent to that of [[major general]] in the [[United States Army]].{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=197}}|group=Note}} [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]].

At daybreak, they stopped and bivouacked in a [[wadi]]. Units of the Afrika Korps, later discovered to be its headquarters element, moved into the wadi from the far end and this initiated a battle in which the battalion took several prisoners.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nThe 6th Brigade moved on quickly to take Point 175, which was held by German forces. Point 175 marked the start of the Sidi Rezegh escarpment, {{convert|40|km|mi}} from Tobruk.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=389}} Arriving a few hours after their initial contact with the enemy earlier in the morning, the 25th Battalion made its first attempt to capture Point 175, having received orders to do so from the brigade's commander, Brigadier [[Harold Barrowclough]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=103}} Initial impressions that Point 175 was only lightly defended proved incorrect and the attack needed additional support with two companies of the 24th Battalion and a squadron of [[Valentine tank]]s from [[8th Royal Tank Regiment]] called upon to assist. After initially proceeding well, a German counterattack caused significant casualties amongst the battalion and the remaining two companies of the 24th Battalion moved forward that evening to help secure the little ground that had been won.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=215\u2013217}} Lieutenant Colonel Clayden Shuttleworth, commander of the 24th Battalion, took over command of the overall position following the wounding and subsequent evacuation of McNaught.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=218}} The losses incurred by 25th Battalion on this day were 100 dead, 125 wounded, and another 100 made prisoners-of-war.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=22}}\n\nIt was not until 27 November that all of Sidi Rezegh was under the control of the New Zealanders,{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=390}} with the 25th Battalion at little more than company strength following the events of 23 November.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=225}} Barrowclough made the 25th Battalion, together with the [[21st Battalion (New Zealand)|21st Battalion]] which had been moved to Sidi Rezegh, his brigade reserve.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=229}} However, Rommel had inflicted a significant defeat on the British armour and was now returning to the Tobruk area with his forces. The 6th Brigade was strung out along Sidi Rezegh in pockets, vulnerable to a counter-attack, and elements of the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] made contact on 28 November.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=390}}\n\nBy 30 November, the 6th Brigade was surrounded and the Afrika Korps, including the Italian [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|Ariete Division]], began attacking after midday with tanks and infantry. Despite the support of anti-tank guns, the New Zealanders were overrun. Shuttleworth was made a prisoner-of-war along with his surviving company commanders.{{#tag:ref|Shuttleworth was later recognised for his services in the Middle East with the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35492|date=17 March 1942|page=1261}}</ref> He died in May 1945, shortly after being released from a prisoner-of-camp.{{sfn|Burdon|1953|p=1}}|group=Note}} The survivors of the 25th Battalion, now commanded by Major Henry Burton, the sole surviving company commander, had been moved into reserve a few days previously and managed to withdraw before Sidi Rezegh was overrun.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===Syria===\n[[File:Soldiers troutfishing, Syria, 1942.jpg|thumb|Soldiers trout fishing using rifles near the Syrian-Turkish border, 1942]]\nThe battalion was reformed at Baggush from those who had escaped capture at Sidi Rezegh (about 300-odd) and other personnel who had been left out of battle, along with replacements from New Zealand. The battalion's second-in-command, Major C.D.A. George, who had been left behind at Baggush when the New Zealanders moved into Libya, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became its commander.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=158\u2013159}} The battalion was stationed at Baggush until late January 1942 before being moved to Maadi.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=162}} Shortly afterwards it was called into [[Cairo]] for four days to increase the Allied presence there and counter potential unrest amongst the civilian population of the city. Once tensions decreased it returned to Maadi,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=163}} and resumed training and this included practice in amphibious operations.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=259}}\n\nFrom late February to mid-March, the 2nd New Zealand Division was transferred to Syria. The Allied high command was concerned that the Middle East was at risk from an invasion by the Germans and the New Zealanders were part of the force tasked with blocking their likely route from the Caucasus.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=391}} The 25th Battalion was stationed close to the border with Turkey, near the town of [[Idlib]], and its platoons manned frontier posts for several weeks.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=167\u2013168}} The battalion later shifted to the Djedeide fortress area where it would prepare defences.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=172}} However, following the attack on the 8th Army's Gazala Line by [[Panzer Army Africa]], the 2nd New Zealand Division was recalled to Egypt. By the end of June, the 25th Battalion, along with the rest of the 6th Brigade, was setting up camp in the Alamein area.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\n===Egypt===\nThe 2nd New Zealand Division was dispatched to the lines of [[El Alamein]] and while the 4th and 5th Brigades went south to Minqar Qaim, the 6th Brigade, now commanded by Brigadier [[George Herbert Clifton|George Clifton]], was initially held in reserve before being ordered to man the Kaponga Box at Bab el Qattara. Arriving on 28 June, the 25th Battalion guarded the western side of the box, while the 24th and 26th Battalions were responsible for the northern and southern sides respectively.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=176\u2013178}} The brigade remained here, watching first the retreating British stream by and then the Germans, at a distance, for several days before moving to Amiriya.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=290\u2013292}} It missed the action of 14\u201315 July at [[Ruweisat Ridge]] which saw the destruction of a large part of the 4th and 5th Brigades when, after securing the ridge, no armour was available to defend a counterattack by the Germans.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=391\u2013392}}  The 6th Brigade was recalled back to the El Alamein lines to relieve what was left of the 4th Brigade. A few days later, it was involved in a night-time attack on the El Mrier Depression. The aim was to secure the depression to create a route through which British armour could penetrate.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=309\u2013311}} The brigade, with the 25th Battalion as its reserve,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=191\u2013192}} successfully achieved its objective and was consolidating its positions when the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] attacked on 22 July.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=391\u2013392}}\n\nAt daylight, German tanks caught the 24th and 25th Battalions, positioned in the relatively shallow El Mrier Depression together with 6th Brigade headquarters, by surprise. Firing from the edge of a low cliff overlooking the depression, the Germans caused heavy losses amongst the 24th and 25th Battalions before passing through their positions in pursuit of the British armour. George, the battalion's commander, was captured along with 149 others. Over 200 other men were also killed or wounded.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=202\u2013203}} The survivors, back under the command of Burton who was once again the senior surviving company commander, were aggrieved at the lack of armoured support.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=204}} The 6th Brigade moved to the southern section of the Alamein line where it manned defensive positions during the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Battle of Alam Halfa]], Rommel's failed attempt to cut off the 8th Army.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} The battalion at this time numbered 362 personnel, which included one company which had been left back at Maadi and brought forward to rejoin the survivors of the El Mrier battle.{{sfn|Scoullar|1955|p=374}} Burton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the battalion until 12 September at which time he went on leave and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bonifant.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=220}}{{#tag:ref|Burton, a veteran of the First World War, later commanded 2NZEF training units.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=102}}|group=Note}}\n\nThe 8th Army was now under the command of General [[Bernard Montgomery]], who was planning for offensive operations against the Panzer Army Africa, which had formed a defensive position at Alamein.  Minus its 4th Brigade, which had incurred significant losses at Ruweisat Ridge and had been withdrawn from the front so it could be converted to armour,{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=317}} the 2nd New Zealand Division was to play a major role in the forthcoming attack. In the first of its three phases, beginning on 23 October, the New Zealanders advanced behind a creeping artillery barrage which commenced at 9:40 pm and quickly attained all its objectives and began consolidating them.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} Bonifant was wounded during a bombing raid the day after the attack and was later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his role in the battle.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=237}}\n\nThe New Zealanders were withdrawn from their positions four days later and remained out of the fighting while the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] took up the offensive in the northern sector of the front. Along with two British infantry brigades, the 2nd New Zealand Division resumed the fight on 2 November in Operation Supercharge, which was intended to break the frontlines in the south. The German defences collapsed and on 4 November they began retreating with the New Zealanders in pursuit.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} The [[9th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Brigade]] was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division in support, and led the initial advance along with the 6th Brigade{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=244}} but rain turned the ground boggy and halted the advance temporarily before it could resume on 8 November.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=246}} In mid-November, the division was withdrawn for rest and re-organisation{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} and shortly afterwards Bonifant, recovered from the wounds that he had received on 24 October, resumed command of the battalion.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=247}}\n\n===Advance into Libya and Tunisia===\nAfter a month engaged in reorganisation and training at Sidi Azeiz,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=248}} the New Zealanders re-entered the campaign in mid-December at El Agheila in an attempt to trap the Panzer Army Africa.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=394\u2013395}} On 11 December, the division carried out a flanking move to the south and west, led by the 6th Brigade with the 25th Battalion on the right of the advance. The move was unopposed for five days until the evening of 15 December, when a reconnaissance element that included the brigade's commander, Brigadier [[William Gentry]], came under fire from a ridge. The 25th Battalion supported the 24th Battalion's subsequent attack on the ridge{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=250\u2013253}} but it was found that the trap had failed, with the Germans slipping through the gap between the 5th and 6th Brigades. A second attempt to trap the Germans was made at [[Nofaliya|Nofilia]] a few days later but this also failed when the rearguard prevented the 5th Brigade from closing the road along which the retreat was being made. The advance continued and on 23 January 1943, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered [[Tripoli]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=364\u2013368}} Shortly after reaching the city, Bonifant was given command of the [[Divisional Cavalry Regiment (New Zealand)|New Zealand Divisional Cavalry]] with Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Morten taking over the 25th Battalion. Initially stationed outside of Tripoli, it moved into the city proper later in February with the rest of the 6th Brigade as part of the occupying force.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=263\u2013265}}\n\nIn the meantime, the Panzer Army Africa had withdrawn to the [[Mareth Line]] in Tunisia{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=394\u2013395}} and following a failed attack by the Germans on the 8th Army at [[Medenine]] in early March, the Allied response was for the New Zealanders, along with British and Free French forces, to drive forward to the [[Tebaga Gap]] south of the Mareth Line. On 21 March, the 6th Brigade mounted a night-time attack on a feature known as Point 201, which was defended by Italian forces. The attack was on a two battalion frontage, with the 25th Battalion on the left and tasked with the capture of Point 201 itself, and the 26th Battalion making a corresponding movement forward.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=373\u2013374}}  Although the objective was achieved with just 50 casualties, of whom 11 were killed, many more were incurred the following day due to artillery fire on Point 201, which was quite exposed.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=279\u2013280}} The breach that the attacking battalions made was not exploited by the supporting British armour.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=373\u2013374}}\n[[File:Signpost on road to Enfidaville, 1943.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photograph of a man in military uniform and hat inspecting a sign with a man in Arab clothing riding a donkey watching on; the sign reads \"Stop!

The 6th Brigade, with the 25th Battalion in reserve, was to attack north of the Takrouna\u2013Enfidaville road, flanking 5th Brigade's attack on Takrouna.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=382\u2013383}} The attack commenced on the evening of 19 April; while the 6th Brigade easily secured its objectives, the 5th Brigade struggled and it took two days for Takrouna to fall.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=384\u2013385}} Shortly afterwards, the 25th Battalion was temporarily attached to the 5th Brigade, and relieved its [[23rd Battalion (New Zealand)|23rd Battalion]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=388}} It remained on the frontlines to keep pressure on the enemy while other Allied units broke through to Tunis elsewhere on the front. In early May, the [[Axis powers|Axis forces]] in North Africa surrendered and the 2nd New Zealand Division began to return to Egypt.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=390\u2013391}}\n\n==Italy==\nWith the close of the North African campaign in May 1943, the Allies' attention then turned to the [[European theatre of World War II|European Theatre of Operations]]. Despite a preference amongst some sections of the New Zealand government for the 2nd New Zealand Division to be redeployed in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Theatre of Operations]], it was decided that the division, having served with the 8th Army throughout the desert campaign would remain in Europe and take part in the fighting in Italy.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=246}} Having been based in Maadi Camp since early June,{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=393}} the battalion left Egypt on 6 October as part of the division's shift to Italy and reached [[Taranto]] three days later.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=318\u2013319}}\n\nThe 2nd New Zealand Division, now including the fully armoured [[4th New Zealand Armoured Brigade|4th Brigade]] with three regiments of [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tanks]],{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=394}} moved to the banks of the [[Sangro River]] later in the month and the 6th Brigade was scheduled to mount a night crossing on 21 November. Two companies of the 24th Battalion had crossed the previous night to reconnoitre the opposite bank but the attack was postponed due to bad weather.{{sfn|Burdon|1953|pp=200\u2013201}} The brigade eventually crossed, with the 25th Battalion in the centre, on 27 November. As the river was forded on foot, several personnel disrobed for the crossing. Although briefly disturbed during the crossing by a German machinegun, there were no casualties, and the battalion pushed forward and seized its objective, a range of hills over {{convert|900|m|yds}} beyond the river.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=333\u2013336}}\n\n===Orsogna===\nIn the following weeks, the battalion was involved in the 6th Brigade's attack on [[Orsogna]], as part of the [[Moro River Campaign]].{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=249}}  The 25th Battalion made the initial attack on Orsogna on the evening of 2 December, which was launched without the use of supporting armour as Brigadier [[Graham Beresford Parkinson|Graham Parkinson]], commander of the 6th Brigade, did not anticipate any difficulty. The leading platoons penetrated into the town square but soon robust defence, supported by German tanks of the [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Panzer Division]], forced them back. Two platoons of infantry were captured. Two tank troops from the [[18th Battalion (New Zealand)|18th Armoured Regiment]] were ordered forward but by the time they had reached the outskirts of Orsogna, the infantry were withdrawing from the town.{{sfn|Plowman|2010|pp=60\u201363}} The battalion supported further attacks on Orsogna by the 5th Infantry Brigade in the following days,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=351\u2013352}} but the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=249}} Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December{{sfn|Plowman|2010|p=139}} and the 6th Brigade maintained its sector with two battalions, rotating the 24th, 25th and 26th Battalions out of the line in three-day spells.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=360\u2013361}} During this time, Morten fell ill and was medically evacuated. The battalion's second-in-command, Major [[Edward Norman (bishop)|Edward Norman]], was made its commander in Morten's stead.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=362}} The New Zealanders withdrew from the area altogether on 13 January 1944.{{sfn|Plowman|2010|p=147}}\n\n===Cassino===\n[[File:Peter McIntyre, Into Cassino, May 1944 (14031034048).jpg|thumb|right|A depiction of the fighting at Cassino by the official war artist of the 2NZEF, [[Peter McIntyre (artist)|Peter McIntyre]]]]\nFollowing its withdrawal from the Orsogna area, the 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of divisions that were transferred from the British Eighth Army to the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]], then engaged on the western side of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. This was part of an overall strategy to breach the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front. Together with the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Division]] and supporting British and American artillery, the division became part of the newly formed New Zealand Corps, under the command of the New Zealand divisional commander, [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Sir Bernard Freyberg]]. The corps moved to [[Cassino]], the defenders of which had [[Battle of Monte Cassino|resisted]] American forces for several weeks.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=249}} In the interim, the 25th Battalion had rested for several days in the Volturno valley, {{convert|50|mi|km}} from Cassino. During this time it received some reinforcements, although these were not enough to bring it up to full strength.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=374\u2013376}}\n\nBy mid-February, Morten had recovered from his illness and resumed command of the battalion{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=374}} which, along with the rest of the division, was moved forward to the south of Cassino, taking over part of the sector of the [[36th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 36th Infantry Division]] with the 6th Brigade in reserve.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=377\u2013378}} An initial attack on Cassino, which involved the 4th Indian Division, the [[M\u0101ori Battalion|28th Maori Battalion]] and New Zealand engineers, was mounted on 15 February but failed due to a lack of air and armoured support.{{sfn|Harper|Tonkin-Covell|2013|pp=17\u201319}} Two days later, the 5th Brigade attempted to capture the town's railway station but this too failed.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=379\u2013380}}\n\nIt was soon to be the 6th Brigade's turn. It moved out of its reserve positions and relieved the [[133rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|133rd Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Division]], positioned nearly {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north of Cassino. The 24th and 25th Battalions manned the front lines, uncomfortably exposed to machinegun fire from an overlooking ridge.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=379\u2013381}} It was planned for the 6th Brigade to mount its attack on Cassino on 24 February but rainfall delayed it by over three weeks.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=385}} In the interim, command of the 25th Battalion passed to Lieutenant Colonel John McDuff, who replaced Major Norman, who in turn had taken over from Morten who, earlier in the month, had once again fallen ill and been evacuated.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=388}} When the 6th Brigade's attack finally commenced, on 15 March, the town had been thoroughly shelled and bombed during the intervening period. Supported by the [[19th Battalion (New Zealand)|19th Armoured Regiment]], the 25th Battalion pushed into Cassino.{{sfn|Harper|Tonkin-Covell|2013|pp=20\u201322}} The 25th Battalion was tasked with capturing the western side of the town up to the Continental Hotel whereupon the 26th Battalion was to take up the advance.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=392}} However, it was unable to achieve its objectives;{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=398}} the Germans defended strongly, assisted by the rubble that hampered the easy movement of the supporting armour.{{sfn|Harper|Tonkin-Covell|2013|pp=20\u201322}} After spending 16 March consolidating what gains it had made, the next day a further attempt was made but this was again largely unsuccessful with each of the 25th Battalion's rifle companies being whittled down to strengths of around 50 men.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=412}} The other battalions of the 6th Brigade were in a similar state but Parkinson, now commanding the 2nd New Zealand Division, was reluctant to commit more infantry to the battle.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=460\u2013461}} However, he finally ordered the 5th Brigade into the town on 20 March and the 25th Battalion was withdrawn to a secondary defensive position.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=412\u2013413}} The 5th Brigade was no more successful than the 6th Brigade and was reduced to simply holding what ground it had gained amongst the rubble of Cassino.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=466}}\n\n[[File:25th Battalion infantry moving towards Florence, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of men wearing military uniforms marching along a dirt road with a grove of trees in the background|New Zealand infantry moving along the road towards Florence]]\n\nOn 26 March, the New Zealand Corps disbanded and Freyberg reverted to command of the division{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=469}} which, a few days later, began to disengage from Cassino. The 6th Brigade was withdrawn on 1 April and the 25th Battalion moved {{convert|24|km|mi}} to the south. Casualties amongst the battalion amounted to 220 personnel killed or wounded in action{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=419}} and it was left to [[II Corps (Poland)|II Polish Corps]] to capture Cassino in mid-May.{{sfn|Harper|Tonkin-Covell|2013|pp=20\u201322}} In June, McDuff was made commander of the Advance Base of 2NZEF, and Norman, promoted to lieutenant colonel, took up permanent command of 25th Battalion.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=444\u2013445}} The 2nd New Zealand Division was held in reserve until 9 July, having spent the intervening period recuperating in Avezzano, and assigned to [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=475}} The infantry brigades advanced onto [[Florence]] and duly entered the city in August. After this, the 2nd New Zealand Division was transferred to [[I Canadian Corps]], then on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic Coast]], and advanced up to [[Rimini]].{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=251}}\n\nDuring the advance, the 25th Battalion formed a \"Battalion Battle Group\"; this included a squadron of Shermans from [[20th Armoured Regiment (New Zealand)|20th Armoured Regiment]], a platoon of machineguns and heavy mortars, and an anti-tank troop. The 24th Battalion was similarly expanded, and these two battle groups alternated as the advance guard of 6th Brigade, which in turn led the division in a series of river crossings throughout September up to and beyond Rimini.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=482\u2013483}} The 5th Brigade took over the advance at the end of September and the 25th Battalion was withdrawn into reserve for a rest.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=513}} After a week, the battalion re-entered the front lines, taking over the positions of the 21st Battalion in preparation for an assault across the Fiumicino River by the 24th and 26th Battalions; the 25th was to be held in reserve.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=514\u2013515}} However, weather delayed the attack and it was abandoned altogether when the Canadians took over the sector.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=518}}\n\nLater in October, the New Zealanders were relieved and sent to [[Fabriano]] for rest and recuperation. During this time, the division was reorganised, with each of the infantry brigades expanding from three to four battalions.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=506\u2013507}} It reentered the frontlines, near the town of [[Faenza]], in late November, under [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]]. The following month, the battalion crossed the [[Lamone (river)|Lamone River]] and joined the other infantry battalions of the 6th Brigade in attacks in and around Faenza.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=510}}  Along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it then wintered along the [[Senio River]], remaining there until March 1945.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=518}}\n\n===Advance to Trieste===\n[[File:25th Battalion infantry during the attack on the Senio River, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of a dirt road along which men wearing military uniforms are walking; smoke is rising from amongst trees in the distance|Infantry of the 25th Battalion following closely behind their flame throwing tanks in the attack on the Senio River]]\nOn 9 April, the 2nd New Zealand Division crossed the Senio River. The crossing was carried out by the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades, with the 25th Battalion on the right of the 6th Brigade's frontage, alongside the 24th Battalion. The battalion had armoured support, including a squadron of the [[20th Battalion (New Zealand)|20th Armoured Regiment]] which was under its direct command. The crossing, covered by artillery, fighter bombers, and flamethrowers, was achieved with minimal opposition; nearly 60 Germans were captured by the leading companies.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=589\u2013591}} Despite suffering casualties due to being accidentally bombed by Allied bombers, the battalion continued to lead the advance of the 6th Brigade to the [[Santerno]], which it crossed on 11 April.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=596\u2013597}} Ordered to continue its advance to the Scolo Sillaro, the battalion established a bridgehead over which tanks were able to cross. It was relieved by the 23rd Battalion on 16 April, leaving the 25th Battalion as the brigade reserve. Since beginning its attack across the Senio, the battalion had advanced {{convert|23|km|mi}}, taken at least 68 prisoners-of-war and inflicted numerous casualties on the enemy for the loss of 14 men killed in action.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=605\u2013606}}\n\nAfter a few days out of the line, the battalion resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, a few days later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A. Barnett, who was promoted to lieutenant colonel.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=608}} The advance continued, effectively unopposed, with the 25th Battalion leading.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=609}} Despite expecting the worst, it crossed the [[Po River]] with minimal difficulty on 25 April and the [[Adige River]] was traversed the next day, again with relative ease.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=611\u2013612}} The 9th Infantry Brigade then took over the advance, with the 6th Brigade taking over as the divisional reserve.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=613}} Although the war was nearly over, care was still required as the battalion moved forward through the towns of [[Padua]] and [[Gorizia]],{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=616\u2013617}} before the surrender of all German forces in Italy on 2 May.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=613}}\n\nOn 4 May, the 25th Battalion moved to the village of [[Sgonico]], just to the north of [[Trieste]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=618\u2013619}} Along with other elements of the 2nd New Zealand Division, the battalion remained in and around Trieste for several weeks to counter the presence of [[Yugoslav partisans]], who had laid claim to the city. In mid-June the partisans withdrew from the city and several weeks later the New Zealand government decided that the division would not be required for service in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theatre of Operations]]. In early August, the battalion began demobilisation with long serving men leaving for New Zealand via [[Bari]] while the remaining personnel withdrew to wintering positions near Florence.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=622\u2013623}} In October, Barnett took over command of what was left of the 6th Brigade.

Moved to Greece to help defend against a German invasion, the battalion participated in the [[Battle of Greece]] but was evacuated at the conclusion of the fighting in the country. It then fought in the [[North African Campaign]] and suffered heavy losses during [[Operation Crusader]], when it was effectively destroyed by the [[15th Panzer Division]]. From December 1941 to February 1942 the battalion was brought back up to strength before being transferred to Syria. It returned to Egypt in March 1942 and suffered heavy casualties during the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].\n\nAfter the fighting in North Africa ceased in 1943, the 25th Battalion participated in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian Campaign]], fighting in actions at Orsogna and later at [[Cassino]]. It finished the war in [[Trieste]], and remained there to counter the presence of [[Yugoslav partisans]] that had entered the city. After the withdrawal of the partisans several weeks later, the battalion moved to [[Florence]] while its long-serving personnel began returning to New Zealand. Not required for service in the Pacific theatre of operations, the battalion was disestablished in late 1945.\n\n==Formation==\nFollowing the outbreak of the Second World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the [[2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force]] (2NZEF), for service at home and abroad.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=16}} Following consultation with the British government, it was decided that the main New Zealand contribution to the war effort would be in the form of an infantry division, the [[2nd New Zealand Division]], which would require nine battalions of infantry.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=19}} Consequently, several infantry battalions were formed from 1939 to 1940 with New Zealand volunteers.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=16}}\n\nThe 25th Battalion was the eighth such unit{{#tag:ref|The numbering of the battalions raised for the 2NZEF followed that of the existing 17 infantry battalions of the [[Territorial Force (New Zealand)|Territorial Force]]. Thus, the first battalion formed for the 2NZEF was the [[18th Battalion (New Zealand)|18th Battalion]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=21}}|group=Note}} raised for the 2NZEF and was formed on 15 May 1940 at [[Trentham Military Camp]] with personnel drawn largely from [[Wellington]], [[Hawke's Bay]] and the [[Taranaki region]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=1}} With an establishment of around 780 men,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=6}} it was organised into four rifle companies, a headquarters company consisting of specialised personnel such as signals and a battalion headquarters. It was one of three infantry battalions{{#tag:ref|The other two infantry battalions were the [[24th Battalion (New Zealand)|24th]] and [[26th Battalion (New Zealand)|26th]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=57}}|group=Note}} that were part of what was initially known as the Third Echelon of the 2NZEF and which would later be designated the [[6th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|6th Infantry Brigade]], one of three infantry brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=1}}{{#tag:ref|The other two were the [[4th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|4th]] and [[5th Infantry Brigade (New Zealand)|5th]] Brigades. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigades were Territorial Force formations.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=21}}|group=Note}}\n\nUnder the command of [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Allan Wilder, who had served with the [[Wellington Mounted Rifles]] during the [[First World War]],{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=1}} the battalion embarked for active service aboard the [[Cunard Line|Cunard liner]] [[RMS Mauretania (1938)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] on 27 August 1940.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=6}} After transferring to the [[Orient Steam Navigation Company|Orient liner]] [[SS Ormonde|SS ''Ormonde'']] at [[Bombay]],{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=11}} the battalion arrived in the Middle East on 29 September and immediately commenced intensive training at [[Maadi Camp]], the 2NZEF base near the town of [[Maadi]], in Egypt.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=15\u201316}}\n[[File:Maadi Military Camp.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white photograph of a desert landscape, with huts in the mid-distance and the walls of a city in the far distance|For a period in 1940, the 25th Battalion was based at Maadi Camp, seen here in 1941 with Cairo in the background]]\n\n==Greece==\nThe British Government anticipated an [[Battle of Greece|invasion of Greece]] by the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] in 1941 and decided to send troops to support the Greeks, who were [[Greco-Italian War|already engaged]] against the Italians in [[Albania]]. The 2nd New Zealand Division was one of a number of Allied units dispatched to Greece in early March.{{sfn|McClymont|1959|p=103}} The 6th Infantry Brigade was tasked with the defence of the coastal portion of the [[Aliakmon]] Line in northern Greece, with the 25th Battalion preparing and manning the defences around Agios Ilias.{{sfn|McClymont|1959|p=136}}\n\nOn 6 April, the Germans invaded Greece and their advance was so rapid that it quickly threatened to outflank the Aliakmon Line. The brigade had to abandon its positions and was withdrawn to the Olympus Pass on 9 April.  This marked the beginning of a gradual retreat down the country, during which a series of rearguard actions were fought by elements of the division.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=208}} The battalion [[Battle of Thermopylae (1941)|fought off a sharp attack]] by the German [[5th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|5th Panzer Division]] on its positions around [[Thermopylae]] on 24 April, its only major engagement of the campaign in Greece, before it successfully disengaged later that day.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=62\u201363}} It was evacuated from Greece on 29 April along with the rest of the 6th Brigade, the 4th and 5th Brigades having been taken off beaches to the east of [[Athens]]. While the latter brigades disembarked at [[Crete]], the 6th Brigade continued onto Egypt.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=74}}\n\nCasualties during the 25th Battalion's campaign in Greece amounted to nearly 30 killed and wounded with 150 personnel captured and made prisoners of war.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=638}} The majority of the captured personnel were from the battalion's reinforcement company, which had been left in Athens when the 6th Brigade moved up to the Aliakmon Line, as well as a truckload of infantrymen that had been misdirected to [[Kalamata]] during the retreat. One soldier managed to escape and eventually make his way to Turkey by sea, an act for which he was later awarded the [[Distinguished Conduct Medal]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=75}}\n\n==North Africa==\nBy late May, and after a period of training and refitting, the 25th Battalion was back up to full strength and moved to Kantara West, near the [[Suez Canal]]. Here, along with the rest of the 6th Brigade, the battalion manned defences against a possible attack from German [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|''Fallschirmj\u00e4ger'']] (paratroopers), [[Battle of Crete|recent events]] in Crete demonstrating the threat these forces could pose.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=78\u201379}}  The battalion shifted to the [[Baggush Box]], near [[Mersa Matruh]] and to the west of Alexandria, in September 1941. At the same time, its commander, Wilder, was promoted to [[brigadier]] and given command of the New Zealand Training Group at Maadi Camp. The battalion's new commander was Lieutenant Colonel Gifford McNaught who had recently been involved in the fighting on Crete before being evacuated.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=83}} At Baggush, the battalion improved the defences in the area and underwent intensive training in open desert warfare.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=84}}\n\nThis training was in preparation for the 2nd New Zealand Division's role in the upcoming [[Operation Crusader]], which was planned to lift the [[siege of Tobruk]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=192\u2013193}} The New Zealanders were to be one of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|8th Army]]'s infantry divisions that were to surround and capture the main strong points along the front while the armoured divisions were to seek out and engage ''[[Generalleutnant]]''{{#tag:ref|The rank of ''generalleutnant'' is equivalent to that of [[major general]] in the [[United States Army]].{{sfn|Mitcham|2007|p=197}}|group=Note}} [[Erwin Rommel]]'s [[Afrika Korps]].

At daybreak, they stopped and bivouacked in a [[wadi]]. Units of the Afrika Korps, later discovered to be its headquarters element, moved into the wadi from the far end and this initiated a battle in which the battalion took several prisoners.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nThe 6th Brigade moved on quickly to take Point 175, which was held by German forces. Point 175 marked the start of the Sidi Rezegh escarpment, {{convert|40|km|mi}} from Tobruk.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=389}} Arriving a few hours after their initial contact with the enemy earlier in the morning, the 25th Battalion made its first attempt to capture Point 175, having received orders to do so from the brigade's commander, Brigadier [[Harold Barrowclough]].{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=103}} Initial impressions that Point 175 was only lightly defended proved incorrect and the attack needed additional support with two companies of the 24th Battalion and a squadron of [[Valentine tank]]s from [[8th Royal Tank Regiment]] called upon to assist. After initially proceeding well, a German counterattack caused significant casualties amongst the battalion and the remaining two companies of the 24th Battalion moved forward that evening to help secure the little ground that had been won.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=215\u2013217}} Lieutenant Colonel Clayden Shuttleworth, commander of the 24th Battalion, took over command of the overall position following the wounding and subsequent evacuation of McNaught.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=218}} The losses incurred by 25th Battalion on this day were 100 dead, 125 wounded, and another 100 made prisoners-of-war.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=22}}\n\nIt was not until 27 November that all of Sidi Rezegh was under the control of the New Zealanders,{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=390}} with the 25th Battalion at little more than company strength following the events of 23 November.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=225}} Barrowclough made the 25th Battalion, together with the [[21st Battalion (New Zealand)|21st Battalion]] which had been moved to Sidi Rezegh, his brigade reserve.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=229}} However, Rommel had inflicted a significant defeat on the British armour and was now returning to the Tobruk area with his forces. The 6th Brigade was strung out along Sidi Rezegh in pockets, vulnerable to a counter-attack, and elements of the [[15th Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|15th Panzer Division]] made contact on 28 November.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=390}}\n\nBy 30 November, the 6th Brigade was surrounded and the Afrika Korps, including the Italian [[132nd Armoured Division Ariete|Ariete Division]], began attacking after midday with tanks and infantry. Despite the support of anti-tank guns, the New Zealanders were overrun. Shuttleworth was made a prisoner-of-war along with his surviving company commanders.{{#tag:ref|Shuttleworth was later recognised for his services in the Middle East with the [[Distinguished Service Order]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=35492|date=17 March 1942|page=1261}}</ref> He died in May 1945, shortly after being released from a prisoner-of-camp.{{sfn|Burdon|1953|p=1}}|group=Note}} The survivors of the 25th Battalion, now commanded by Major Henry Burton, the sole surviving company commander, had been moved into reserve a few days previously and managed to withdraw before Sidi Rezegh was overrun.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=156\u2013157}}\n\n===Syria===\n[[File:Soldiers troutfishing, Syria, 1942.jpg|thumb|Soldiers trout fishing using rifles near the Syrian-Turkish border, 1942]]\nThe battalion was reformed at Baggush from those who had escaped capture at Sidi Rezegh (about 300-odd) and other personnel who had been left out of battle, along with replacements from New Zealand. The battalion's second-in-command, Major C.D.A. George, who had been left behind at Baggush when the New Zealanders moved into Libya, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became its commander.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=158\u2013159}} The battalion was stationed at Baggush until late January 1942 before being moved to Maadi.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=162}} Shortly afterwards it was called into [[Cairo]] for four days to increase the Allied presence there and counter potential unrest amongst the civilian population of the city. Once tensions decreased it returned to Maadi,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=163}} and resumed training and this included practice in amphibious operations.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=259}}\n\nFrom late February to mid-March, the 2nd New Zealand Division was transferred to Syria. The Allied high command was concerned that the Middle East was at risk from an invasion by the Germans and the New Zealanders were part of the force tasked with blocking their likely route from the Caucasus.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=391}} The 25th Battalion was stationed close to the border with Turkey, near the town of [[Idlib]], and its platoons manned frontier posts for several weeks.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=167\u2013168}} The battalion later shifted to the Djedeide fortress area where it would prepare defences.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=172}} However, following the attack on the 8th Army's Gazala Line by [[Panzer Army Africa]], the 2nd New Zealand Division was recalled to Egypt. By the end of June, the 25th Battalion, along with the rest of the 6th Brigade, was setting up camp in the Alamein area.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=174\u2013175}}\n\n===Egypt===\nThe 2nd New Zealand Division was dispatched to the lines of [[El Alamein]] and while the 4th and 5th Brigades went south to Minqar Qaim, the 6th Brigade, now commanded by Brigadier [[George Herbert Clifton|George Clifton]], was initially held in reserve before being ordered to man the Kaponga Box at Bab el Qattara. Arriving on 28 June, the 25th Battalion guarded the western side of the box, while the 24th and 26th Battalions were responsible for the northern and southern sides respectively.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=176\u2013178}} The brigade remained here, watching first the retreating British stream by and then the Germans, at a distance, for several days before moving to Amiriya.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=290\u2013292}} It missed the action of 14\u201315 July at [[Ruweisat Ridge]] which saw the destruction of a large part of the 4th and 5th Brigades when, after securing the ridge, no armour was available to defend a counterattack by the Germans.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=391\u2013392}}  The 6th Brigade was recalled back to the El Alamein lines to relieve what was left of the 4th Brigade. A few days later, it was involved in a night-time attack on the El Mrier Depression. The aim was to secure the depression to create a route through which British armour could penetrate.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=309\u2013311}} The brigade, with the 25th Battalion as its reserve,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=191\u2013192}} successfully achieved its objective and was consolidating its positions when the [[21st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|21st Panzer Division]] attacked on 22 July.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=391\u2013392}}\n\nAt daylight, German tanks caught the 24th and 25th Battalions, positioned in the relatively shallow El Mrier Depression together with 6th Brigade headquarters, by surprise. Firing from the edge of a low cliff overlooking the depression, the Germans caused heavy losses amongst the 24th and 25th Battalions before passing through their positions in pursuit of the British armour. George, the battalion's commander, was captured along with 149 others. Over 200 other men were also killed or wounded.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=202\u2013203}} The survivors, back under the command of Burton who was once again the senior surviving company commander, were aggrieved at the lack of armoured support.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=204}} The 6th Brigade moved to the southern section of the Alamein line where it manned defensive positions during the [[Battle of Alam el Halfa|Battle of Alam Halfa]], Rommel's failed attempt to cut off the 8th Army.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} The battalion at this time numbered 362 personnel, which included one company which had been left back at Maadi and brought forward to rejoin the survivors of the El Mrier battle.{{sfn|Scoullar|1955|p=374}} Burton, promoted to lieutenant colonel, commanded the battalion until 12 September at which time he went on leave and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Ian Bonifant.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=220}}{{#tag:ref|Burton, a veteran of the First World War, later commanded 2NZEF training units.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=102}}|group=Note}}\n\nThe 8th Army was now under the command of General [[Bernard Montgomery]], who was planning for offensive operations against the Panzer Army Africa, which had formed a defensive position at Alamein.  Minus its 4th Brigade, which had incurred significant losses at Ruweisat Ridge and had been withdrawn from the front so it could be converted to armour,{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=317}} the 2nd New Zealand Division was to play a major role in the forthcoming attack. In the first of its three phases, beginning on 23 October, the New Zealanders advanced behind a creeping artillery barrage which commenced at 9:40 pm and quickly attained all its objectives and began consolidating them.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} Bonifant was wounded during a bombing raid the day after the attack and was later awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) for his role in the battle.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=237}}\n\nThe New Zealanders were withdrawn from their positions four days later and remained out of the fighting while the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]] took up the offensive in the northern sector of the front. Along with two British infantry brigades, the 2nd New Zealand Division resumed the fight on 2 November in Operation Supercharge, which was intended to break the frontlines in the south. The German defences collapsed and on 4 November they began retreating with the New Zealanders in pursuit.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} The [[9th Armoured Brigade (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Brigade]] was attached to the 2nd New Zealand Division in support, and led the initial advance along with the 6th Brigade{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=244}} but rain turned the ground boggy and halted the advance temporarily before it could resume on 8 November.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=246}} In mid-November, the division was withdrawn for rest and re-organisation{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=392\u2013393}} and shortly afterwards Bonifant, recovered from the wounds that he had received on 24 October, resumed command of the battalion.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=247}}\n\n===Advance into Libya and Tunisia===\nAfter a month engaged in reorganisation and training at Sidi Azeiz,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=248}} the New Zealanders re-entered the campaign in mid-December at El Agheila in an attempt to trap the Panzer Army Africa.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|pp=394\u2013395}} On 11 December, the division carried out a flanking move to the south and west, led by the 6th Brigade with the 25th Battalion on the right of the advance. The move was unopposed for five days until the evening of 15 December, when a reconnaissance element that included the brigade's commander, Brigadier [[William Gentry]], came under fire from a ridge. The 25th Battalion supported the 24th Battalion's subsequent attack on the ridge{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=250\u2013253}} but it was found that the trap had failed, with the Germans slipping through the gap between the 5th and 6th Brigades. A second attempt to trap the Germans was made at [[Nofaliya|Nofilia]] a few days later but this also failed when the rearguard prevented the 5th Brigade from closing the road along which the retreat was being made. The advance continued and on 23 January 1943, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered [[Tripoli]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=364\u2013368}} Shortly after reaching the city, Bonifant was given command of the [[Divisional Cavalry Regiment (New Zealand)|New Zealand Divisional Cavalry]] with Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Morten taking over the 25th Battalion.

On 21 March, the 6th Brigade mounted a night-time attack on a feature known as Point 201, which was defended by Italian forces. The attack was on a two battalion frontage, with the 25th Battalion on the left and tasked with the capture of Point 201 itself, and the 26th Battalion making a corresponding movement forward.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=373\u2013374}}  Although the objective was achieved with just 50 casualties, of whom 11 were killed, many more were incurred the following day due to artillery fire on Point 201, which was quite exposed.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=279\u2013280}} The breach that the attacking battalions made was not exploited by the supporting British armour.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=373\u2013374}}\n[[File:Signpost on road to Enfidaville, 1943.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A black and white photograph of a man in military uniform and hat inspecting a sign with a man in Arab clothing riding a donkey watching on; the sign reads \"Stop!

The 6th Brigade, with the 25th Battalion in reserve, was to attack north of the Takrouna\u2013Enfidaville road, flanking 5th Brigade's attack on Takrouna.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=382\u2013383}} The attack commenced on the evening of 19 April; while the 6th Brigade easily secured its objectives, the 5th Brigade struggled and it took two days for Takrouna to fall.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=384\u2013385}} Shortly afterwards, the 25th Battalion was temporarily attached to the 5th Brigade, and relieved its [[23rd Battalion (New Zealand)|23rd Battalion]].{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=388}} It remained on the frontlines to keep pressure on the enemy while other Allied units broke through to Tunis elsewhere on the front.

Two companies of the 24th Battalion had crossed the previous night to reconnoitre the opposite bank but the attack was postponed due to bad weather.{{sfn|Burdon|1953|pp=200\u2013201}} The brigade eventually crossed, with the 25th Battalion in the centre, on 27 November. As the river was forded on foot, several personnel disrobed for the crossing.

The leading platoons penetrated into the town square but soon robust defence, supported by German tanks of the [[23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|26th Panzer Division]], forced them back. Two platoons of infantry were captured. Two tank troops from the [[18th Battalion (New Zealand)|18th Armoured Regiment]] were ordered forward but by the time they had reached the outskirts of Orsogna, the infantry were withdrawing from the town.{{sfn|Plowman|2010|pp=60\u201363}} The battalion supported further attacks on Orsogna by the 5th Infantry Brigade in the following days,{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=351\u2013352}} but the German defences were too strong and the attack soon faded into a stalemate, with a number of back and forth actions as winter set in.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=249}} Offensive operations around Orsogna ceased in late December{{sfn|Plowman|2010|p=139}} and the 6th Brigade maintained its sector with two battalions, rotating the 24th, 25th and 26th Battalions out of the line in three-day spells.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=360\u2013361}} During this time, Morten fell ill and was medically evacuated.

This was part of an overall strategy to breach the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and break an otherwise deadlocked Italian front. Together with the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Indian Division]] and supporting British and American artillery, the division became part of the newly formed New Zealand Corps, under the command of the New Zealand divisional commander, [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Sir Bernard Freyberg]]. The corps moved to [[Cassino]], the defenders of which had [[Battle of Monte Cassino|resisted]] American forces for several weeks.{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=249}} In the interim, the 25th Battalion had rested for several days in the Volturno valley, {{convert|50|mi|km}} from Cassino.

It moved out of its reserve positions and relieved the [[133rd Infantry Regiment (United States)|133rd Infantry Regiment]], part of the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 34th Infantry Division]], positioned nearly {{convert|2|km|mi}} to the north of Cassino. The 24th and 25th Battalions manned the front lines, uncomfortably exposed to machinegun fire from an overlooking ridge.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=379\u2013381}} It was planned for the 6th Brigade to mount its attack on Cassino on 24 February but rainfall delayed it by over three weeks.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=385}} In the interim, command of the 25th Battalion passed to Lieutenant Colonel John McDuff, who replaced Major Norman, who in turn had taken over from Morten who, earlier in the month, had once again fallen ill and been evacuated.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=388}} When the 6th Brigade's attack finally commenced, on 15 March, the town had been thoroughly shelled and bombed during the intervening period.

After this, the 2nd New Zealand Division was transferred to [[I Canadian Corps]], then on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic Coast]], and advanced up to [[Rimini]].{{sfn|McGibbon|2000|p=251}}\n\nDuring the advance, the 25th Battalion formed a \"Battalion Battle Group\"; this included a squadron of Shermans from [[20th Armoured Regiment (New Zealand)|20th Armoured Regiment]], a platoon of machineguns and heavy mortars, and an anti-tank troop. The 24th Battalion was similarly expanded, and these two battle groups alternated as the advance guard of 6th Brigade, which in turn led the division in a series of river crossings throughout September up to and beyond Rimini.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=482\u2013483}} The 5th Brigade took over the advance at the end of September and the 25th Battalion was withdrawn into reserve for a rest.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=513}} After a week, the battalion re-entered the front lines, taking over the positions of the 21st Battalion in preparation for an assault across the Fiumicino River by the 24th and 26th Battalions; the 25th was to be held in reserve.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=514\u2013515}} However, weather delayed the attack and it was abandoned altogether when the Canadians took over the sector.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|p=518}}\n\nLater in October, the New Zealanders were relieved and sent to [[Fabriano]] for rest and recuperation. During this time, the division was reorganised, with each of the infantry brigades expanding from three to four battalions.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|pp=506\u2013507}} It reentered the frontlines, near the town of [[Faenza]], in late November, under [[V Corps (United Kingdom)|V Corps]]. The following month, the battalion crossed the [[Lamone (river)|Lamone River]] and joined the other infantry battalions of the 6th Brigade in attacks in and around Faenza.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=510}}  Along with the rest of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it then wintered along the [[Senio River]], remaining there until March 1945.{{sfn|Pugsley|2014|p=518}}\n\n===Advance to Trieste===\n[[File:25th Battalion infantry during the attack on the Senio River, 1945.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A black and white photograph of a dirt road along which men wearing military uniforms are walking; smoke is rising from amongst trees in the distance|Infantry of the 25th Battalion following closely behind their flame throwing tanks in the attack on the Senio River]]\nOn 9 April, the 2nd New Zealand Division crossed the Senio River. The crossing was carried out by the 5th and 6th Infantry Brigades, with the 25th Battalion on the right of the 6th Brigade's frontage, alongside the 24th Battalion. The battalion had armoured support, including a squadron of the [[20th Battalion (New Zealand)|20th Armoured Regiment]] which was under its direct command. The crossing, covered by artillery, fighter bombers, and flamethrowers, was achieved with minimal opposition; nearly 60 Germans were captured by the leading companies.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=589\u2013591}} Despite suffering casualties due to being accidentally bombed by Allied bombers, the battalion continued to lead the advance of the 6th Brigade to the [[Santerno]], which it crossed on 11 April.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=596\u2013597}} Ordered to continue its advance to the Scolo Sillaro, the battalion established a bridgehead over which tanks were able to cross. It was relieved by the 23rd Battalion on 16 April, leaving the 25th Battalion as the brigade reserve. Since beginning its attack across the Senio, the battalion had advanced {{convert|23|km|mi}}, taken at least 68 prisoners-of-war and inflicted numerous casualties on the enemy for the loss of 14 men killed in action.{{sfn|Puttick|1960|pp=605\u2013606}}\n\nAfter a few days out of the line, the battalion resumed its advance on 20 April with the 6th Brigade, still as its reserve. However, a few days later the vehicle in which Norman, the battalion's commander, was travelling ran over a landmine. Norman was wounded and had to be medically evacuated. He was replaced by the second-in-command of the 26th Battalion, Major A.

The LCM of more than two integers is also well-defined: it is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.\n\n== Overview ==\nA [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 \u00d7 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of \u22125 and \u22122 as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nIn this article we will denote the least common multiple of two integers ''a'' and ''b'' as lcm(''a'', ''b'').\n\nSome older textbooks use [''a'', ''b''].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=56}}</ref>\n\nThe programming language [[J (programming language)|J]] uses a*.b\n\n=== Example ===\nWhat is the LCM of 4 and 6?\n\nMultiples of 4 are:\n\n: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, ...\n\nand the multiples of 6 are:\n\n: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, ...\n\n''Common multiples'' of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:\n\n: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ....\n\nSo, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers 4 and 6, their ''least common multiple'' is&nbsp;12.\n\n== Applications ==\nWhen adding, subtracting, or comparing [[vulgar fraction]]s, it is useful to find the least common multiple of the denominators, often called the [[lowest common denominator]], because each of the fractions can be expressed as a fraction with this denominator. For instance,\n\n:<math>{2\\over21}+{1\\over6}={4\\over42}+{7\\over42}={11\\over42}</math>\n\nwhere the denominator 42 was used because it is the least common multiple of 21 and 6.\n\n=== Gears problem ===\nSuppose there are two [[Gear|meshing gears]] in a [[machine]], having ''m'' and ''n'' teeth, respectively, and the gears are marked by a line segment drawn from the center of the first gear to the center of the second gear. When the gears begin rotating, we can determine how many rotations the first gear must complete to realign the line segment by making use of LCM(''m'', ''n''). The first gear must complete LCM(''m'', ''n'')/''m'' rotations for the realignment. By that time, the second gear will have made LCM(''m'', ''n'')/''n'' rotations.\n\n===Planetary alignment===\nSuppose there are three planets revolving around a star which take ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' units of time respectively to complete their orbits. Assume that ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' are integers. Assuming the planets started moving around the star after an initial linear alignment, all the planets attain a linear alignment again after LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'') units of time. At this time, the first, second and third planet will have completed LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')/''l'', LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')/''m'' and LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')/''n'' orbits respectively around the star.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/weekly/6Page41.pdf|title=nasa spacemath|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Calculation ==\n\n=== Using the greatest common divisor ===\nThe following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{|a\\cdot b|}{\\gcd(a,b)}.</math>\n\nThis formula is also valid when exactly one of ''a'' and ''b'' is 0, since gcd(''a'', 0) = |''a''|. However, if both ''a'' and ''b'' are 0, this formula would cause [[division by zero]]; lcm(0, 0) = 0 is a special case.\n\nThere are fast [[algorithm]]s for computing the GCD that do not require the numbers to be [[Integer_factorization|factored]], such as the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. To return to the example above,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)\n={21\\cdot6\\over\\gcd(21,6)}\n={21\\cdot6\\over\\gcd(3,6)}\n={21\\cdot 6\\over 3}= \\frac{126}{3} = 42.</math>\n\nBecause gcd(''a'', ''b'') is a divisor of both ''a'' and ''b'', it is more efficient to compute the LCM by dividing ''before'' multiplying:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\left({|a|\\over\\gcd(a,b)}\\right)\\cdot |b|=\\left({|b|\\over\\gcd(a,b)}\\right)\\cdot |a|.</math>\n\nThis reduces the size of one input for both the division and the multiplication, and reduces the required storage needed for intermediate results (overflow in the ''a''\u00d7''b'' computation). Because gcd(''a'', ''b'') is a divisor of both ''a'' and ''b'', the division is guaranteed to yield an integer, so the intermediate result can be stored in an integer. Done this way, the previous example becomes:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)={21\\over\\gcd(21,6)}\\cdot6={21\\over\\gcd(3,6)}\\cdot6={21\\over3}\\cdot6=7\\cdot6=42.</math>\n\n=== Using prime factorization ===\nThe [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization theorem]] says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written in only one way as a product of [[prime number]]s. The prime numbers can be considered as the atomic elements which, when combined together, make up a [[composite number]].\n\nFor example:\n\n:<math>90 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5. </math>\n\nHere we have the composite number 90 made up of one atom of the prime number 2, two atoms of the prime number 3 and one atom of the prime number 5.\n\nThis knowledge can be used to find the LCM of a set of numbers.\n\nExample: Find the value of lcm(8,9,21).\n\nFirst, factor each number and express it as a product of prime number [[Power (mathematics)|powers]].\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n8 & = 2^3 \\\\\n9 & = 3^2 \\\\\n21 & = 3^1 \\cdot 7^1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together. The highest power of the three prime numbers 2, 3, and 7 is 2<sup>3</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup>, and 7<sup>1</sup>, respectively. Thus,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(8,9,21) = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 = 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 = 504. </math>\n\nThis method is not as efficient as reducing to the greatest common divisor, since there is no known general efficient algorithm for [[integer factorization]], but is useful for illustrating concepts.\n\nThis method can be illustrated using a [[Venn diagram]] as follows.  Find the [[prime factorization]] of each of the two numbers.  Put the prime factors into a Venn diagram with one circle for each of the two numbers, and ''all'' factors they share in common in the intersection.  To find the LCM, just multiply all of the prime numbers in the diagram.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n: 48 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3,\n: 180 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5,\n\nand what they share in common is two \"2\"s and a \"3\":\n\n:[[Image:least common multiple.svg|400px]]\n\n: Least common multiple = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 720\n: Greatest common divisor = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nThis also works for the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), except that instead of multiplying all of the numbers in the Venn diagram, one multiplies only the prime factors that are in the intersection.  Thus the GCD of 48 and 180 is 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.\n\n=== Using a simple algorithm ===\nThis method works easily for finding the LCM of several integers.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nLet there be a finite sequence of positive integers ''X'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), ''n'' > 1. The algorithm proceeds in steps as follows: on each step ''m'' it examines and updates the sequence ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> = (''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>, ''x''<sub>2</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>), ''X''<sup>(1)</sup> = ''X'', where ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> is the ''m''th iteration of ''X'', that is, ''X'' at step ''m'' of the algorithm, etc. The purpose of the examination is to pick the least (perhaps, one of many) element of the sequence ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup>. Assuming ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(''m'')</sup> is the selected element, the sequence ''X''<sup>(''m''+1)</sup> is defined as\n\n: ''x''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>(''m''+1)</sup> = ''x''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>, ''k'' \u2260 ''k''<sub>0</sub>\n: ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(''m''+1)</sup> = ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(''m'')</sup> + ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(1)</sup>.\n\nIn other words, the least element is increased by the corresponding ''x'' whereas the rest of the elements pass from ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> to ''X''<sup>(''m''+1)</sup> unchanged.\n\nThe algorithm stops when all elements in sequence ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> are equal. Their common value ''L'' is exactly LCM(''X'').\n\nFor example, if ''X'' = ''X''<sup>(1)</sup> = (3, 4, 6), the steps in the algorithm produce:\n:''X''<sup>(2)</sup> = (6, 4, 6)\n:''X''<sup>(3)</sup> = (6, 8, 6)\n:''X''<sup>(4)</sup> = (6, 8, 12) - by choosing the second 6\n:''X''<sup>(5)</sup> = (9, 8, 12)\n:''X''<sup>(6)</sup> = (9, 12, 12)\n:''X''<sup>(7)</sup> = (12, 12, 12)  so LCM = 12.\n\n=== Using the table-method ===\nThis method works for any number of numbers. One begins by listing all of the numbers vertically in a table (in this example 4, 7, 12, 21, and 42):\n<div style=\"font-family: monospace;\">\n:  4\n:  7\n: 12\n: 21\n: 42\n</div>\nThe process begins by dividing all of the numbers by 2.  If 2 divides any of them evenly, write 2 in a new column at the top of the table and the result of division by 2 of each number in the space to the right in this new column. If a number is not evenly divisible, just rewrite the number again.  If 2 does not divide evenly into any of the numbers, repeat this procedure with the next largest prime number, 3 (see below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! ''x''\n! 2\n|-\n| 4\n| 2\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n|-\n| 12\n| 6\n|-\n| 21\n| 21\n|-\n| 42\n| 21\n|}\n\nNow, assuming that 2 did divide at least one number (as in this example), check if 2 divides again:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! ''x''\n! 2\n! 2\n|-\n| 4\n| 2\n| 1\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n| 7\n|-\n| 12\n| 6\n| 3\n|-\n| 21\n| 21\n| 21\n|-\n| 42\n| 21\n| 21\n|}\n\nOnce 2 no longer divides any number in the current column, repeat the procedure by dividing by the next larger prime, 3.  Once 3 no longer divides, try the next larger primes, 5 then 7, etc. The process ends when all of the numbers have been reduced to 1 (the column under the last prime divisor consists only of 1's).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! ''x''\n! 2\n! 2\n! 3\n! 7\n|-\n| 4\n| 2\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n| 7\n| 7\n| 1\n|-\n| 12\n| 6\n| 3\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| 21\n| 21\n| 21\n| 7\n| 1\n|-\n| 42\n| 21\n| 21\n| 7\n| 1\n|}\n\nNow, multiply the numbers in the top row to obtain the LCM.  In this case, it is {{nowrap|1=2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;84}}. \n\nAs a general computational algorithm, the above is quite inefficient. One would never want to implement it in software: it takes too many steps, and requires too much storage space.  A far more efficient numerical algorithm can be obtained simply by using [[Euclid's algorithm]] to compute the gcd first, and then obtaining the lcm by division.\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n=== Fundamental theorem of arithmetic ===\nAccording to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] a positive integer is the product of [[prime number]]s, and, except for their order, this representation is unique:\n\n:<math>n=2^{n_2} 3^{n_3} 5^{n_5} 7^{n_7} \\cdots = \\prod_p p^{n_p},</math>\n\nwhere the exponents ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''n''<sub>3</sub>, ... are non-negative integers; for example, 84 = 2<sup>2</sup> 3<sup>1</sup> 5<sup>0</sup> 7<sup>1</sup> 11<sup>0</sup> 13<sup>0</sup> ...\n\nGiven two positive integers {{nowrap| <math>\\;a=\\prod_p p^{a_p}</math> and <math>\\;b=\\prod_p p^{b_p}</math>}} their least common multiple and greatest common divisor are given by the formulas\n\n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) = \\prod_p p^{\\min(a_p, b_p)}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = \\prod_p p^{\\max(a_p, b_p)}.</math>\n\nSince\n:<math>\\min(x,y) + \\max(x,y) = x+y,</math>\nthis gives\n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = a\\,b.</math>\n\nIn fact, every rational number can be written uniquely as the product of primes if negative exponents are allowed. When this is done, the above formulas remain valid. For example:\n:<math>\\begin{array}{llll} 4 = 2^2 3^0, & 6 = 2^1 3^1, &  \\gcd(4, 6) = 2^1 3^0 = 2, & \\operatorname{lcm}(4,6) = 2^2  3^1 = 12.\\\\[8pt]\n\\tfrac{1}{3}=2^0 3^{-1} 5^0,&\\tfrac{2}{5}=2^1 3^0 5^{-1}, & \\gcd(\\tfrac13, \\tfrac25)= 2^0 3^{-1} 5^{-1} = \\tfrac{1}{15}, &\\operatorname{lcm}(\\tfrac13, \\tfrac25) = 2^1 3^0 5^0 = 2, \\\\[8pt]\n\\tfrac{1}{6}=2^{-1} 3^{-1} ,&\\tfrac{3}{4}=2^{-2} 3^1, & \\gcd(\\tfrac16, \\tfrac34)= 2^{-2} 3^{-1} = \\tfrac{1}{12}, &\\operatorname{lcm}(\\tfrac16, \\tfrac34) = 2^{-1} 3^1 = \\tfrac{3}{2}. \\end{array}</math>\n\n=== Lattice-theoretic ===\nThe positive integers may be [[partially ordered]] by divisibility: if ''a'' divides ''b'' (that is, if ''b'' is an integer multiple of ''a'') write ''a'' \u2264  ''b'' (or equivalently, ''b'' \u2265 ''a''). (Forget the usual magnitude-based definition of \u2264  in this section - it is not used.)\n\nUnder this ordering, the positive integers become a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] with [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] given by the gcd and [[join (mathematics)|join]] given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts to checking that lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a [[duality (order theory)|duality]] between them:\n\n:'''If a formula involving integer variables, gcd, lcm, \u2264 and \u2265  is true, then the formula obtained by switching  gcd with lcm and switching  \u2265  with \u2264 is also true. ''' (Remember \u2264  is defined as divides).\n\nThe following pairs of dual formulas are special cases of general lattice-theoretic identities.\n\n{| style=\"margin:0;\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|\n;[[commutative operation|Commutative laws]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \\operatorname{lcm}(b, a),</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, b) =\\gcd( b, a).</math>\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[associativity|Associative laws]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,\\operatorname{lcm}(b, c)) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a , b),c),</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, \\gcd(b, c)) = \\gcd(\\gcd(a,b), c).</math>\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[Absorption law]]s:\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a, \\gcd(a,b)) = a,</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, \\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)) = a.</math>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"margin:0;\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|\n;[[Idempotent|Idempotent laws]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a, a) = a,</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, a) = a.</math>\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[Lattice (order)#Connection between the two definitions|Define divides in terms of lcm and gcd]]\n:<math>a \\ge b \\iff a = \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b),</math>\n:<math>a \\le b \\iff a = \\gcd(a,b).</math>\n|}\n\nIt can also be shown<ref>The next three formulas are from Landau, Ex.

A common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' is an element ''m'' of ''R'' such that both ''a'' and ''b'' divide ''m'' (that is, there exist elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''R'' such that ''ax'' = ''m'' and ''by'' = ''m''). A least common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' is a common multiple that is minimal in the sense that for any other common multiple ''n'' of ''a'' and ''b'', ''m'' divides&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIn general, two elements in a commutative ring can have no least common multiple or more than one. However, any two least common multiples of the same pair of elements are [[Unit (ring theory)|associates]]. In a [[unique factorization domain]], any two elements have a least common multiple. In a [[principal ideal domain]], the least common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' can be characterised as a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by ''a'' and ''b'' (the intersection of a collection of ideals is always an ideal).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anomalous cancellation]]\n*[[Chebyshev function]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation\n  | last1 = Crandall  | first1 = Richard\n  | last2 = Pomerance  | first2 = Carl\n  | title = Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective\n  | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]\n  | location = New York\n  | year = 2001\n  | isbn = 0-387-94777-9\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8KZ4RQufxhYC&printsec=frontcover}}\n*{{citation\n  | last1 = Hardy  | first1 = G.

The LCM of more than two integers is also well-defined: it is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by each of them.\n\n== Overview ==\nA [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] of a number is the product of that number and an integer. For example, 10 is a multiple of 5 because 5 \u00d7 2 = 10, so 10 is divisible by 5 and 2. Because 10 is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both 5 and 2, it is the least common multiple of 5 and 2. By the same principle, 10 is the least common multiple of \u22125 and \u22122 as well.\n\n=== Notation ===\nIn this article we will denote the least common multiple of two integers ''a'' and ''b'' as lcm(''a'', ''b'').\n\nSome older textbooks use [''a'', ''b''].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=56}}</ref>\n\nThe programming language [[J (programming language)|J]] uses a*.b\n\n=== Example ===\nWhat is the LCM of 4 and 6?\n\nMultiples of 4 are:\n\n: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, ...\n\nand the multiples of 6 are:\n\n: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, ...\n\n''Common multiples'' of 4 and 6 are simply the numbers that are in both lists:\n\n: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, ....\n\nSo, from this list of the first few common multiples of the numbers 4 and 6, their ''least common multiple'' is&nbsp;12.\n\n== Applications ==\nWhen adding, subtracting, or comparing [[vulgar fraction]]s, it is useful to find the least common multiple of the denominators, often called the [[lowest common denominator]], because each of the fractions can be expressed as a fraction with this denominator. For instance,\n\n:<math>{2\\over21}+{1\\over6}={4\\over42}+{7\\over42}={11\\over42}</math>\n\nwhere the denominator 42 was used because it is the least common multiple of 21 and 6.\n\n=== Gears problem ===\nSuppose there are two [[Gear|meshing gears]] in a [[machine]], having ''m'' and ''n'' teeth, respectively, and the gears are marked by a line segment drawn from the center of the first gear to the center of the second gear. When the gears begin rotating, we can determine how many rotations the first gear must complete to realign the line segment by making use of LCM(''m'', ''n''). The first gear must complete LCM(''m'', ''n'')/''m'' rotations for the realignment. By that time, the second gear will have made LCM(''m'', ''n'')/''n'' rotations.\n\n===Planetary alignment===\nSuppose there are three planets revolving around a star which take ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' units of time respectively to complete their orbits. Assume that ''l'', ''m'' and ''n'' are integers. Assuming the planets started moving around the star after an initial linear alignment, all the planets attain a linear alignment again after LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'') units of time. At this time, the first, second and third planet will have completed LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')/''l'', LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')/''m'' and LCM(''l'', ''m'', ''n'')/''n'' orbits respectively around the star.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacemath.gsfc.nasa.gov/weekly/6Page41.pdf|title=nasa spacemath|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Calculation ==\n\n=== Using the greatest common divisor ===\nThe following formula reduces the problem of computing the least common multiple to the problem of computing the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), also known as the greatest common factor:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\frac{|a\\cdot b|}{\\gcd(a,b)}.</math>\n\nThis formula is also valid when exactly one of ''a'' and ''b'' is 0, since gcd(''a'', 0) = |''a''|. However, if both ''a'' and ''b'' are 0, this formula would cause [[division by zero]]; lcm(0, 0) = 0 is a special case.\n\nThere are fast [[algorithm]]s for computing the GCD that do not require the numbers to be [[Integer_factorization|factored]], such as the [[Euclidean algorithm]]. To return to the example above,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)\n={21\\cdot6\\over\\gcd(21,6)}\n={21\\cdot6\\over\\gcd(3,6)}\n={21\\cdot 6\\over 3}= \\frac{126}{3} = 42.</math>\n\nBecause gcd(''a'', ''b'') is a divisor of both ''a'' and ''b'', it is more efficient to compute the LCM by dividing ''before'' multiplying:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)=\\left({|a|\\over\\gcd(a,b)}\\right)\\cdot |b|=\\left({|b|\\over\\gcd(a,b)}\\right)\\cdot |a|.</math>\n\nThis reduces the size of one input for both the division and the multiplication, and reduces the required storage needed for intermediate results (overflow in the ''a''\u00d7''b'' computation). Because gcd(''a'', ''b'') is a divisor of both ''a'' and ''b'', the division is guaranteed to yield an integer, so the intermediate result can be stored in an integer. Done this way, the previous example becomes:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(21,6)={21\\over\\gcd(21,6)}\\cdot6={21\\over\\gcd(3,6)}\\cdot6={21\\over3}\\cdot6=7\\cdot6=42.</math>\n\n=== Using prime factorization ===\nThe [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|unique factorization theorem]] says that every positive integer greater than 1 can be written in only one way as a product of [[prime number]]s. The prime numbers can be considered as the atomic elements which, when combined together, make up a [[composite number]].\n\nFor example:\n\n:<math>90 = 2^1 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^1 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5. </math>\n\nHere we have the composite number 90 made up of one atom of the prime number 2, two atoms of the prime number 3 and one atom of the prime number 5.\n\nThis knowledge can be used to find the LCM of a set of numbers.\n\nExample: Find the value of lcm(8,9,21).\n\nFirst, factor each number and express it as a product of prime number [[Power (mathematics)|powers]].\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n8 & = 2^3 \\\\\n9 & = 3^2 \\\\\n21 & = 3^1 \\cdot 7^1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe lcm will be the product of multiplying the highest power of each prime number together. The highest power of the three prime numbers 2, 3, and 7 is 2<sup>3</sup>, 3<sup>2</sup>, and 7<sup>1</sup>, respectively. Thus,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(8,9,21) = 2^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 = 8 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 7 = 504. </math>\n\nThis method is not as efficient as reducing to the greatest common divisor, since there is no known general efficient algorithm for [[integer factorization]], but is useful for illustrating concepts.\n\nThis method can be illustrated using a [[Venn diagram]] as follows.  Find the [[prime factorization]] of each of the two numbers.  Put the prime factors into a Venn diagram with one circle for each of the two numbers, and ''all'' factors they share in common in the intersection.  To find the LCM, just multiply all of the prime numbers in the diagram.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n: 48 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3,\n: 180 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5,\n\nand what they share in common is two \"2\"s and a \"3\":\n\n:[[Image:least common multiple.svg|400px]]\n\n: Least common multiple = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 = 720\n: Greatest common divisor = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 3 = 12\n\nThis also works for the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD), except that instead of multiplying all of the numbers in the Venn diagram, one multiplies only the prime factors that are in the intersection.  Thus the GCD of 48 and 180 is 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;12.\n\n=== Using a simple algorithm ===\nThis method works easily for finding the LCM of several integers.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nLet there be a finite sequence of positive integers ''X'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>), ''n'' > 1. The algorithm proceeds in steps as follows: on each step ''m'' it examines and updates the sequence ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> = (''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>, ''x''<sub>2</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>), ''X''<sup>(1)</sup> = ''X'', where ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> is the ''m''th iteration of ''X'', that is, ''X'' at step ''m'' of the algorithm, etc. The purpose of the examination is to pick the least (perhaps, one of many) element of the sequence ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup>. Assuming ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(''m'')</sup> is the selected element, the sequence ''X''<sup>(''m''+1)</sup> is defined as\n\n: ''x''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>(''m''+1)</sup> = ''x''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>(''m'')</sup>, ''k'' \u2260 ''k''<sub>0</sub>\n: ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(''m''+1)</sup> = ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(''m'')</sup> + ''x''<sub>''k''<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>(1)</sup>.\n\nIn other words, the least element is increased by the corresponding ''x'' whereas the rest of the elements pass from ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> to ''X''<sup>(''m''+1)</sup> unchanged.\n\nThe algorithm stops when all elements in sequence ''X''<sup>(''m'')</sup> are equal. Their common value ''L'' is exactly LCM(''X'').\n\nFor example, if ''X'' = ''X''<sup>(1)</sup> = (3, 4, 6), the steps in the algorithm produce:\n:''X''<sup>(2)</sup> = (6, 4, 6)\n:''X''<sup>(3)</sup> = (6, 8, 6)\n:''X''<sup>(4)</sup> = (6, 8, 12) - by choosing the second 6\n:''X''<sup>(5)</sup> = (9, 8, 12)\n:''X''<sup>(6)</sup> = (9, 12, 12)\n:''X''<sup>(7)</sup> = (12, 12, 12)  so LCM = 12.\n\n=== Using the table-method ===\nThis method works for any number of numbers. One begins by listing all of the numbers vertically in a table (in this example 4, 7, 12, 21, and 42):\n<div style=\"font-family: monospace;\">\n:  4\n:  7\n: 12\n: 21\n: 42\n</div>\nThe process begins by dividing all of the numbers by 2.  If 2 divides any of them evenly, write 2 in a new column at the top of the table and the result of division by 2 of each number in the space to the right in this new column. If a number is not evenly divisible, just rewrite the number again.  If 2 does not divide evenly into any of the numbers, repeat this procedure with the next largest prime number, 3 (see below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! ''x''\n! 2\n|-\n| 4\n| 2\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n|-\n| 12\n| 6\n|-\n| 21\n| 21\n|-\n| 42\n| 21\n|}\n\nNow, assuming that 2 did divide at least one number (as in this example), check if 2 divides again:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! ''x''\n! 2\n! 2\n|-\n| 4\n| 2\n| 1\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n| 7\n|-\n| 12\n| 6\n| 3\n|-\n| 21\n| 21\n| 21\n|-\n| 42\n| 21\n| 21\n|}\n\nOnce 2 no longer divides any number in the current column, repeat the procedure by dividing by the next larger prime, 3.  Once 3 no longer divides, try the next larger primes, 5 then 7, etc. The process ends when all of the numbers have been reduced to 1 (the column under the last prime divisor consists only of 1's).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! ''x''\n! 2\n! 2\n! 3\n! 7\n|-\n| 4\n| 2\n| 1\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| 7\n| 7\n| 7\n| 7\n| 1\n|-\n| 12\n| 6\n| 3\n| 1\n| 1\n|-\n| 21\n| 21\n| 21\n| 7\n| 1\n|-\n| 42\n| 21\n| 21\n| 7\n| 1\n|}\n\nNow, multiply the numbers in the top row to obtain the LCM.  In this case, it is {{nowrap|1=2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7&nbsp;=&nbsp;84}}. \n\nAs a general computational algorithm, the above is quite inefficient. One would never want to implement it in software: it takes too many steps, and requires too much storage space.  A far more efficient numerical algorithm can be obtained simply by using [[Euclid's algorithm]] to compute the gcd first, and then obtaining the lcm by division.\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n=== Fundamental theorem of arithmetic ===\nAccording to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] a positive integer is the product of [[prime number]]s, and, except for their order, this representation is unique:\n\n:<math>n=2^{n_2} 3^{n_3} 5^{n_5} 7^{n_7} \\cdots = \\prod_p p^{n_p},</math>\n\nwhere the exponents ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''n''<sub>3</sub>, ... are non-negative integers; for example, 84 = 2<sup>2</sup> 3<sup>1</sup> 5<sup>0</sup> 7<sup>1</sup> 11<sup>0</sup> 13<sup>0</sup> ...\n\nGiven two positive integers {{nowrap| <math>\\;a=\\prod_p p^{a_p}</math> and <math>\\;b=\\prod_p p^{b_p}</math>}} their least common multiple and greatest common divisor are given by the formulas\n\n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) = \\prod_p p^{\\min(a_p, b_p)}</math>\nand\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = \\prod_p p^{\\max(a_p, b_p)}.</math>\n\nSince\n:<math>\\min(x,y) + \\max(x,y) = x+y,</math>\nthis gives\n:<math>\\gcd(a,b) \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = a\\,b.</math>\n\nIn fact, every rational number can be written uniquely as the product of primes if negative exponents are allowed. When this is done, the above formulas remain valid. For example:\n:<math>\\begin{array}{llll} 4 = 2^2 3^0, & 6 = 2^1 3^1, &  \\gcd(4, 6) = 2^1 3^0 = 2, & \\operatorname{lcm}(4,6) = 2^2  3^1 = 12.\\\\[8pt]\n\\tfrac{1}{3}=2^0 3^{-1} 5^0,&\\tfrac{2}{5}=2^1 3^0 5^{-1}, & \\gcd(\\tfrac13, \\tfrac25)= 2^0 3^{-1} 5^{-1} = \\tfrac{1}{15}, &\\operatorname{lcm}(\\tfrac13, \\tfrac25) = 2^1 3^0 5^0 = 2, \\\\[8pt]\n\\tfrac{1}{6}=2^{-1} 3^{-1} ,&\\tfrac{3}{4}=2^{-2} 3^1, & \\gcd(\\tfrac16, \\tfrac34)= 2^{-2} 3^{-1} = \\tfrac{1}{12}, &\\operatorname{lcm}(\\tfrac16, \\tfrac34) = 2^{-1} 3^1 = \\tfrac{3}{2}. \\end{array}</math>\n\n=== Lattice-theoretic ===\nThe positive integers may be [[partially ordered]] by divisibility: if ''a'' divides ''b'' (that is, if ''b'' is an integer multiple of ''a'') write ''a'' \u2264  ''b'' (or equivalently, ''b'' \u2265 ''a''). (Forget the usual magnitude-based definition of \u2264  in this section - it is not used.)\n\nUnder this ordering, the positive integers become a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] with [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] given by the gcd and [[join (mathematics)|join]] given by the lcm. The proof is straightforward, if a bit tedious; it amounts to checking that lcm and gcd satisfy the axioms for meet and join. Putting the lcm and gcd into this more general context establishes a [[duality (order theory)|duality]] between them:\n\n:'''If a formula involving integer variables, gcd, lcm, \u2264 and \u2265  is true, then the formula obtained by switching  gcd with lcm and switching  \u2265  with \u2264 is also true. ''' (Remember \u2264  is defined as divides).\n\nThe following pairs of dual formulas are special cases of general lattice-theoretic identities.\n\n{| style=\"margin:0;\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|\n;[[commutative operation|Commutative laws]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \\operatorname{lcm}(b, a),</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, b) =\\gcd( b, a).</math>\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[associativity|Associative laws]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,\\operatorname{lcm}(b, c)) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a , b),c),</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, \\gcd(b, c)) = \\gcd(\\gcd(a,b), c).</math>\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[Absorption law]]s:\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a, \\gcd(a,b)) = a,</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, \\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)) = a.</math>\n|}\n\n{| style=\"margin:0;\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|\n;[[Idempotent|Idempotent laws]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a, a) = a,</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a, a) = a.</math>\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|\n;[[Lattice (order)#Connection between the two definitions|Define divides in terms of lcm and gcd]]\n:<math>a \\ge b \\iff a = \\operatorname{lcm}(a,b),</math>\n:<math>a \\le b \\iff a = \\gcd(a,b).</math>\n|}\n\nIt can also be shown<ref>The next three formulas are from Landau, Ex. III.3, p. 254</ref> that this lattice is [[distributive lattice|distributive]], that is, lcm distributes over gcd and, dually, that gcd distributes over lcm:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{lcm}(a,\\gcd(b,c)) = \\gcd(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b),\\operatorname{lcm}(a,c)),</math>\n:<math>\\gcd(a,\\operatorname{lcm}(b,c)) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\gcd(a,b),\\gcd(a,c)).</math>\n\nThis identity is self-dual:\n:<math>\\gcd(\\operatorname{lcm}(a,b),\\operatorname{lcm}(b,c),\\operatorname{lcm}(a,c))=\\operatorname{lcm}(\\gcd(a,b),\\gcd(b,c),\\gcd(a,c)).</math>\n\n=== Other ===\n* Let ''D'' be the product of ''\u03c9''(''D'') distinct prime numbers (that is, ''D'' is [[squarefree]]).\n\nThen<ref>Crandall & Pomerance, ex. 2.4, p. 101.</ref>\n\n:<math>|\\{(x,y)\\;:\\; \\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)=D\\}|= 3^{\\omega(D)},</math>\n\nwhere the absolute bars || denote the cardinality of a set.\n\n* If none of <math>a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_r</math> is zero, then\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{lcm}(a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_r) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{lcm}(a_1, a_2, \\ldots , a_{r-1}), a_r). </math><ref>{{harvtxt|Long|1972|p=41}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Pettofrezzo|Byrkit|1970|p=58}}</ref>\n\n== In commutative rings ==\nThe least common multiple can be defined generally over [[commutative ring]]s as follows: Let ''a'' and ''b'' be elements of a commutative ring ''R''. A common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' is an element ''m'' of ''R'' such that both ''a'' and ''b'' divide ''m'' (that is, there exist elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''R'' such that ''ax'' = ''m'' and ''by'' = ''m''). A least common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' is a common multiple that is minimal in the sense that for any other common multiple ''n'' of ''a'' and ''b'', ''m'' divides&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIn general, two elements in a commutative ring can have no least common multiple or more than one. However, any two least common multiples of the same pair of elements are [[Unit (ring theory)|associates]]. In a [[unique factorization domain]], any two elements have a least common multiple. In a [[principal ideal domain]], the least common multiple of ''a'' and ''b'' can be characterised as a generator of the intersection of the ideals generated by ''a'' and ''b'' (the intersection of a collection of ideals is always an ideal).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anomalous cancellation]]\n*[[Chebyshev function]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation\n  | last1 = Crandall  | first1 = Richard\n  | last2 = Pomerance  | first2 = Carl\n  | title = Prime Numbers: A Computational Perspective\n  | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]\n  | location = New York\n  | year = 2001\n  | isbn = 0-387-94777-9\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=8KZ4RQufxhYC&printsec=frontcover}}\n*{{citation\n  | last1 = Hardy  | first1 = G.

[[James Boswell]] records a conversation between Johnson and other members of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]], around the time of the statue's sale, in which [[Edmund Burke]] exclaimed \"A thousand guineas!

IV: \"As the ancients have left us but five animals of equal merit with their human figures, namely, the [[Barberini collection|Barberini goat]], the [[Porcellino|Tuscan boar]], the [[House of Mattei|Mattei]] eagle, the eagle at [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry-hill]], and Mr. Jennings's, now Mr. Duncombe's dog...\".</ref> with replicas that were thought to make \"a most noble appearance in a gentleman's hall\", in [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Johnson]]'s words.\n\n==\"The Dog of Alcibiades\"==\nA story in [[Plutarch]]'s life of [[Alcibiades]] tells of the statesman owning a large, handsome dog whose tail Alcibiades cut off so as to invoke pity from the Athenians and distract them from his worse deeds.<ref name=plut/>  The broken tail of this sculpture led Jennings to link it to this story, calling it \"the dog of Alcibiades\";<ref>The similar dogs in the [[Vatican Museums]] have unbroken tails; they were also found at Monte Cagnuolo, by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] in 1774, \"within the precincts of the villa of [[Antoninus Pius]]\", according to Sir [[Henry Ellis (librarian)|Henry Ellis]], ''The Townley Gallery of Classical Sculpture at the British Museum'', vol. 1 1846:302, Rm VI, no 52 (A group of two grayhounds at play).</ref> under this title a pair of copies<ref>The design was reversed to make a pair.</ref> in [[Portland stone]] were installed by [[Robert Adam]] at [[Newby Hall]], Yorkshire, about 1780, and in the later 19th century a pair in [[cast stone]] were set in the gardens at [[Basildon Park]], Bedfordshire.<ref>John P.S.

The dog was soon afterwards sold at Phillips for \u00a31000 to the Rt Hon [[Charles Duncombe, 1st Baron Feversham|Charles Duncombe]]. [[James Boswell]] records a conversation between Johnson and other members of the [[The Club (dining club)|Literary Club]], around the time of the statue's sale, in which [[Edmund Burke]] exclaimed \"A thousand guineas! The representation of no animal whatever is worth so much\", to which Dr Johnson replied \"Sir, it is not the worth of the thing, but the skill in forming it, which is so highly estimated. Every thing that enlarges the sphere of human powers, that shews man he can do what he thought he could not do, is valuable.\"<ref>Boswell, ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'', under date 3 April 1778.</ref>\n\nFor 150 years the sculpture stood guard in the entrance hall of [[Duncombe Park]], the family mansion in [[Yorkshire]]; it was enthusiastically described there in 1859: \"Among the statues in this apartment is particularly noticed an excellent antique sculpture, representing the Dog of Alcibiades, said to be the work of [[Myron]], a Grecian sculptor\".<ref>T. Whellan, ''History and Topography of the City of York: and the North Riding'' Volume 2, 1859:250.</ref> It remained there, away from public view, until 1925.  In that year, [[inheritance tax]]es forced the Duncombes to rent out the hall to Queen Mary's School for Girls, whose pupils were rumoured to feed the dog unwanted [[Marmite]] sandwiches.\n\n==The British Museum==\nIt was finally sold by Thomas Duncombe's descendant [[Charles Anthony Peter Duncombe, 6th Baron Feversham|Charles Anthony Peter Duncombe]], 6th [[Baron Feversham]], in 2001.  The Sarah Campbell Blaffer Foundation at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] had attempted to purchase it (the sculpture had been shown in the US in the 1980s), at the price of $950,000, but the [[export bar|granting of an export licence was deferred]] by the UK government.  The [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[National Art Collections Fund]], British Museum Friends, Duthie Fund, Ready Bequest, Caryatid Fund, Mrs Barbara G. Fleischman, Mr Frank A. Ladd and the Ready Bequest had already pledged funds to help \"save it for the nation\".   With the sculpture on temporary display in its [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]], the delay on the export allowed the [[British Museum]] enough time to raise the remaining \u00a3662,297 through a public appeal, and thus to acquire it permanently.  It is now on permanent display in gallery 22 of the Museum, B. 2001.1010.1.<ref name=brit/>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=brit>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=467443&partid=1 The Jennings Dog / The Duncombe Dog / The Dog of Alcibiades] Trustees of the British Museum [n.d.] Accessed October 2011.</ref>\n\n<ref name=pliny>Pliny the Elder [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/34*.html#38  ''Natural History'' XXXIV.38]</ref>\n\n<ref name=plut>Plutarch [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alcibiades*.html#9 ''Alcibiades'', 9]</ref>\n\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Export of Works of Art 2000-2001 (2002) by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (Case 36)\n* [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/canes/jennings.html Encyclopaedia Romana]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165948/http://www.diggingsonline.com/pages/rese/journa1/samp53.htm Diggings Online]\n* {{cite news\n | first = Maev\n | last = Kennedy\n | authorlink =\n | author =\n | coauthors =\n | title = Give a dog a bone\n | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,,530887,00.html\n | work = [[The Guardian]]\n | date = 2 August 2001\n | accessdate = 2007-07-04\n }}\n* {{cite news\n | first = Susie\n | last = Green\n | authorlink =\n | author =\n | coauthors =\n | title = Hound dog days\n | url = https://www.theguardian.com/weekend/story/0,,593866,00.html\n | work = [[The Guardian]]\n | date = 17 November 2001\n | accessdate = 2007-07-04\n }}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2011}}\n\n{{British Museum}}\n\n[[Category:Sculptures of dogs]]\n[[Category:Greek and Roman objects in the British Museum]]\n[[Category:Public art]]\n[[Category:Roman copies of 2nd-century BC Greek sculptures]]\n[[Category:Archaeological discoveries in Italy]]\n", "name_user": "Mrrash", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e\"The Dog of Alcibiades\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennings_Dog"}
