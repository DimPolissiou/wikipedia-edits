Philippines]] in the [[Calabarzon]] [[Regions of the Philippines|region]] located in the south of [[Luzon]] island. The province was named after [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the second [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|President]] of the Philippines and the first to be freely elected. [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] is the provincial capital, seat of the provincial government and the most populous city of the province, but is governed independently as a highly urbanized city. To distinguish the province from [[Quezon City]], it is sometimes called '''Quezon Province'''.\n\nQuezon is southeast of [[Metro Manila]] and is bordered by the provinces of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] to the north, [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] and [[Batangas]] to the west and the provinces of [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] to the east. Part of Quezon lies on an [[isthmus]] connecting the [[Bicol Peninsula]] to the main part of Luzon. The province also includes the [[Polillo Islands]] in the [[Philippine Sea]]. Some marine parts of the [[Verde Island Passage]], the center of the center of world's marine biodiversity, are also in the province.\n\nA major tourism draw to the province is [[Mount Banahaw]]. The mountain is surrounded by spiritual mysticism with many [[Religion in the Philippines#Anitism|Anitist]] adherents, Christian cults, and Christian organizations staying on the mountain.  The mountain was also one of the most sacred sites for pre-colonial [[Tagalog people]] before the arrival of the Spanish. Numerous [[pilgrim]]s visit the mountain especially during [[Holy Week]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precolonial Period ===\nArchaeological excavations in the province attest to its rich precolonial past. Archaeological materials including burial jars, human bones, shell midden and pot shreds have been discovered at different sites in Bondoc Peninsula including the towns of San Narciso, San Andres, Mulanay and Catanauan. The most recent excavations were conducted in [[Catanauan]] by the Catanauan Archeological and Heritage Project.\n\nAccording to the preliminary report released by the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project, several excavations were conducted in the 1930s. One of the excavations was conducted in San Narciso where archaeologists found burial jars. The site, inspected by Ricardo Galang, resulted in the discovery of burial jars near the coast. Galang also went to San Andres where excavations yielded 14th and 15th century ceramics as well as shell bracelets and beads. According to the journal as well, at a site named Tala, archaeologists discovered a glazed Chinese jar containing bone fragments from the early Ming dynasty. Looking at other archaeological sites located in adjacent areas like Marinduque and Masbate, it can be inferred that these excavations date back to the metal period of the archipelago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paz, Victor.

Kamhantik in the town of Mulanay, 15 limestone coffins were discovered. Carbon dating on a human tooth found it to be at least 1,000 years old. According to the archaeologists, the village is proof that the ancient inhabitants of the area practiced a more sophisticated way of life. Metal tools are believed to have been used to carve the coffins, and this is the first of its kind discovered in the archipelago. The remains are said to date back to the 10th to 14th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/9556537/1000-year-old-village-found-in-Philippines.html|title=1,000-year-old village found in Philippines|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501190743/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/9556537/1000-year-old-village-found-in-Philippines.html|archivedate=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Spanish Period ===\n[[File:Philippine territorial map 1880.PNG|thumb|Philippine Territorial Map, 1880]]\nOriginally, what now forms Quezon was divided among the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], and [[Nueva Ecija]]. However, at different points in time, the boundaries of Quezon changed and included parts of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Marinduque]], and [[Camarines Norte]]. At the early period of Spanish colonization, the province of Aurora was called El Principe, Infanta was called Binangonan de Lampon and southern Quezon was called Kalilayan. The first European to explore the area was [[Juan de Salcedo]] in 1571\u20131572, during his expedition from Laguna to [[Camarines (province)|Camarines]] provinces.<ref name=\"QuezonGovPH-History\">{{cite web|title=History of Quezon Province|url=http://www.quezon.gov.ph/homepage/?info=quezonhistory|website=Provincial Government of Quezon|accessdate=4 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001223830/http://www.quezon.gov.ph/homepage/?info=quezonhistory|archivedate=1 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BalitaPH\">{{cite news|last1=Ramos|first1=Lily O.|title=Quezon province\u2019s impressive historical and cultural heritage|url=http://balita.ph/2012/07/18/quezon-provinces-impressive-historical-and-cultural-heritage/|accessdate=4 April 2016|work=Balita.ph|date=18 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1574, Father Diego de Oropesa founded the town of Bumaka, now known as the municipality of Gumaca.<ref name=\"QuezonGovPH-History\" />\n\nIn 1591, the province was created and was called ''Kaliraya'' or ''Kalilayan'', after the capital town which later became [[Unisan, Quezon|Unisan]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aurora.ph/mobile/history.html|title=Aurora, Philippines \u2013 History|website=www.aurora.ph|language=en|access-date=2017-02-07|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208033623/http://www.aurora.ph/mobile/history.html|archivedate=2017-02-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1595, The Diocese of C\u00e1ceres was established by Pope Clement VIII as a suffragan of Manila. The diocese covered the entire Bicolandia region plus the towns in Kalilayan, and the Contracosta towns. At that time, the towns on the eastern seaboard were pertained to as the Contracosta and included towns from Mauban, Binangonan de Lampon, to El Principe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://caceres-naga.org/about-us/the-archdiocese/|title=The Archdiocese {{!}} Archdiocese of Caceres|website=caceres-naga.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208034712/http://caceres-naga.org/about-us/the-archdiocese/|archivedate=2017-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe destruction of Kalilayan in 1604 by a big fleet of Moro pirates caused the inhabitants to transfer to ''Palsabangon'' ([[Pagbilao, Quezon|Pagbilao]]). Depredation and plunder by the [[Moro people|Moros]] from Jolo and Brunei were rampant during the 1600s. Slavery is one reason for the proliferation of these raids. A padron for Calilaya was ordered after Tayabas suffered severely from Moro raids. It is said that 187 people were either captured or killed while 400 people fled. Fear from these raids are the primary reason as to the permanent movement of settlements along the coast further inland as well as a general decline in population. Frequent invasions by the moros disrupted the food production in the province, affecting the nutrition of its inhabitants. Maternal malnutrition was even cited as one of the primary causes of infant mortality at that time. By 1701, the previously densely settled coastal areas of the province, was described as consisting of rancherias whose inhabitants depended on wild products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines|last=Newson|first=Linda|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832728|location=Hawaii|pages=147}}</ref>\n\nIn 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor General Fausto Cruzat.

Bartolome Galan in 1823, he describes the economy of the province. According to his report, Tayabas had poor soil and the terrain is hilly which meant that conditions were not that suitable for agriculture compared to other places. The people grew upland rice, wheat, beans and vegetables. Surplus rice was sold in San Pablo and Majayjay during Mondays, the market day of those towns. Cattle breeding was rampant in towns like Tayabas, Pagbilao, Tiaong, and Sariaya. Also, unlike other provinces, haciendas were not so many in Tayabas.

Santa Cruz, Laguna was the entrepot for all goods going to the capital. The people from Lucban made products of buri and pandan leaves like hats, sleeping mata and the like which they traded. They, along with the people of Mauban also went to Polillo, at that time part of Nueva Ecija, to buy sea slugs, shells and beeswax. Being a rich agricultural area, the town of Tayabas traded rice, coconuts, and panocha with nearby towns of Majayjay, Lucban, Sariaya, Pagbilao,  Mauban, Gumaca, and Atimonan. In turn, they traded fish from Pagbilao, rice from Sariaya, and high quality abaca products from Mauban and Atimonan. Lucban, as well as Tayabas, benefitted greatly from the high commercial activity of Chinese and Chinese mestizos in the pueblos.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nGumaca, being a town with little arable land depended heavily on the sea. They collected sea slugs, and tortoise shell from Alabat and traded with the [[mountain people]] there for beeswax in exchange for clothing. They even sometimes ventured to Burias Island in the Ragay Gulf in search for these goods. These products were then sent to Tayabas for shipment to Manila. Gumaca also traded items from nearby pueblos like vinegar and clothing for gold and abaca from Naga in the Bicol region.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nIt was also around this time that the Confradia de San Jose was active in the province, caused by the growing inequality between the poor and the upper classes.

The province, under General [[Miguel Malvar]], was also among the earliest to join the [[Philippine Revolution]].

Insurgents from neighboring provinces of Laguna and Batangas often use Tayabas as their base of operations as well as their source of supplies. An insurgent government, with connections to Gen. Malvar and Pedro Caballes was even said to be based in Infanta. This has led the American in charge, Brigadier-General J.F. Bell to decide to return to Tayabas with a larger contingent. Bell acknowledged the importance of the ports of Tayabas as sources of supplies to the insurrection such that he believed that closing all the ports in the province might convince the leaders of the resistance to surrender.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Masterpiece of Counterguerrilla Warfare: BG J.

These barangays are Kagtalaba, Plaridel, Kabuluan, Don Tomas, Guitol, Tabugon, Maualawin, Patag Ibaba and Patag Iraya.

The Chief delineated the border as follows:<blockquote>\"Starting from the peak of Mt. Labo as a common corner between the provinces of Tayabas, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte thence a straight line is drawn to the peak of Mt. Cadig; ''thence a straight line is drawn to the point of intersection of the inter-provincial road between Camarines Norte and Tayabas with the Tabugon River; thence, following the course of the river to its mouth at Basiad Bay.\"''<ref name=\":7\" /></blockquote>In the legal dispute, Quezon raised two points of contention. First is that Act 2711 already delineated the boundaries of the province. Second is that the Chief of the Executive Bureau had no power nor authority to change the boundaries of the province. Regarding the first issue, the court stated that it is true that Act 2711 delineated the boundary but it did not delineate the entirety of the boundary. The point on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay was never specifically located, thus, needing further delineation. On the second issue, the court stated that the Chief did not alter the borders in any way. The Chief worked with the requirement that the point be on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay. He was also acting on the consideration of Act 2809, the Act establishing Camarines Norte, which states that Camarines Norte be established with the borders it had before merging with Camarines Sur. The court then ruled in favor of Camarines Norte and ordered the provincial government of Quezon to transfer all its authority and jurisdiction to the former.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBy 2001, the Provincial Government of Quezon, this time represented by Governor Eduardo Rodriguez, the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte, as represented by Governor Roy Padilla, went back to court. Even with the judgment on the 1989 case was executory by 1990, the provincial government of Quezon did not abide by the court's ruling. In 1991, a DENR technical team conducted a survey of the area and erected a monument marker to delineate the boundary of the area. However, by October 1991, Quezon Governor Eduardo Rodriguez and Calauag Mayor Julio Lim caused the removal of the marker. Throughout the proceedings, several government agencies including the Department of Budget and Management, Comelec, as well as the Philippine Statistics Authority recognized the jurisdiction of the town of [[Santa Elena, Camarines Norte]] over the 9 barangays. In 2000, Judge Regino held Governor Rodriguez and Mayor Lim guilty of contempt, with a maximum imprisonment of 6 months as well as a fine of 1,000 pesos for the erection of a new boundary marker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/oct2001/80796.htm|title=Province of Camarines Norte vs Province of Quezon : 80796 : October 11, 2001 : J.

These people, though seem as uncivilized by some, have a very rich culture. Some forms of their art include body scarification. The Aeta cause wound on their skin in various parts of their body including back, arms, legs, hands, calves and abdomen. They then irritate them during healing using fire, lime and other materials to form scars. They also bore holes on their septum and then proceed to decorate it with a sliver of bamboo.

There are the dominant ''Tagalog language'', the ''Manide language'' in the east and a small portion in the north, the ''Agta Dumagat Umiray'' language in the north and a small area in the center, the already-extinct ''Katabaga language'' which used to be in the south, and the endangered Alabat Agta in Alabat island. The province primarily speaks Tagalog dialect called ''Tayabas Tagalog'' that resembles a dominant part of [[Batangas Tagalog]] with a heavy mixture of [[Bikol languages|Bicolano]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words. Its presence is stronger in towns in [[Aurora (Province)|Aurora]], First, Third (Bondoc Peninsula) and Fourth Districts of the Province.\n\nIn 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages is the ''[[Alabat Island]] Agta'' language. The language was classified as ''Critically Endangered'', meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218184822/http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|archivedate=18 December 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nMajority of Quezon's inhabitants practice Roman Catholicism and other Christian denominations like [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]].

Philippines|region]] located in the south of [[Luzon]] island. The province was named after [[Manuel L. Quezon]], the second [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|President]] of the Philippines and the first to be freely elected. [[Lucena, Philippines|Lucena]] is the provincial capital, seat of the provincial government and the most populous city of the province, but is governed independently as a highly urbanized city. To distinguish the province from [[Quezon City]], it is sometimes called '''Quezon Province'''.\n\nQuezon is southeast of [[Metro Manila]] and is bordered by the provinces of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]] to the north, [[Bulacan]], [[Rizal]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] and [[Batangas]] to the west and the provinces of [[Camarines Norte]] and [[Camarines Sur]] to the east. Part of Quezon lies on an [[isthmus]] connecting the [[Bicol Peninsula]] to the main part of Luzon. The province also includes the [[Polillo Islands]] in the [[Philippine Sea]]. Some marine parts of the [[Verde Island Passage]], the center of the center of world's marine biodiversity, are also in the province.\n\nA major tourism draw to the province is [[Mount Banahaw]]. The mountain is surrounded by spiritual mysticism with many [[Religion in the Philippines#Anitism|Anitist]] adherents, Christian cults, and Christian organizations staying on the mountain.  The mountain was also one of the most sacred sites for pre-colonial [[Tagalog people]] before the arrival of the Spanish. Numerous [[pilgrim]]s visit the mountain especially during [[Holy Week]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Precolonial Period ===\nArchaeological excavations in the province attest to its rich precolonial past. Archaeological materials including burial jars, human bones, shell midden and pot shreds have been discovered at different sites in Bondoc Peninsula including the towns of San Narciso, San Andres, Mulanay and Catanauan. The most recent excavations were conducted in [[Catanauan]] by the Catanauan Archeological and Heritage Project.\n\nAccording to the preliminary report released by the Catanauan Archaeological and Heritage Project, several excavations were conducted in the 1930s. One of the excavations was conducted in San Narciso where archaeologists found burial jars. The site, inspected by Ricardo Galang, resulted in the discovery of burial jars near the coast. Galang also went to San Andres where excavations yielded 14th and 15th century ceramics as well as shell bracelets and beads. According to the journal as well, at a site named Tala, archaeologists discovered a glazed Chinese jar containing bone fragments from the early Ming dynasty. Looking at other archaeological sites located in adjacent areas like Marinduque and Masbate, it can be inferred that these excavations date back to the metal period of the archipelago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Paz, Victor.

Kamhantik in the town of Mulanay, 15 limestone coffins were discovered. Carbon dating on a human tooth found it to be at least 1,000 years old. According to the archaeologists, the village is proof that the ancient inhabitants of the area practiced a more sophisticated way of life. Metal tools are believed to have been used to carve the coffins, and this is the first of its kind discovered in the archipelago. The remains are said to date back to the 10th to 14th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/9556537/1000-year-old-village-found-in-Philippines.html|title=1,000-year-old village found in Philippines|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501190743/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/9556537/1000-year-old-village-found-in-Philippines.html|archivedate=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Spanish Period ===\n[[File:Philippine territorial map 1880.PNG|thumb|Philippine Territorial Map, 1880]]\nOriginally, what now forms Quezon was divided among the provinces of [[Batangas]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], and [[Nueva Ecija]]. However, at different points in time, the boundaries of Quezon changed and included parts of [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Marinduque]], and [[Camarines Norte]]. At the early period of Spanish colonization, the province of Aurora was called El Principe, Infanta was called Binangonan de Lampon and southern Quezon was called Kalilayan.

The diocese covered the entire Bicolandia region plus the towns in Kalilayan, and the Contracosta towns. At that time, the towns on the eastern seaboard were pertained to as the Contracosta and included towns from Mauban, Binangonan de Lampon, to El Principe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://caceres-naga.org/about-us/the-archdiocese/|title=The Archdiocese {{!}} Archdiocese of Caceres|website=caceres-naga.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-07|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208034712/http://caceres-naga.org/about-us/the-archdiocese/|archivedate=2017-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe destruction of Kalilayan in 1604 by a big fleet of Moro pirates caused the inhabitants to transfer to ''Palsabangon'' ([[Pagbilao, Quezon|Pagbilao]]). Depredation and plunder by the [[Moro people|Moros]] from Jolo and Brunei were rampant during the 1600s. Slavery is one reason for the proliferation of these raids. A padron for Calilaya was ordered after Tayabas suffered severely from Moro raids. It is said that 187 people were either captured or killed while 400 people fled. Fear from these raids are the primary reason as to the permanent movement of settlements along the coast further inland as well as a general decline in population. Frequent invasions by the moros disrupted the food production in the province, affecting the nutrition of its inhabitants. Maternal malnutrition was even cited as one of the primary causes of infant mortality at that time. By 1701, the previously densely settled coastal areas of the province, was described as consisting of rancherias whose inhabitants depended on wild products.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conquest and Pestilence in the Early Spanish Philippines|last=Newson|first=Linda|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2009|isbn=9780824832728|location=Hawaii|pages=147}}</ref>\n\nIn 1705, the Military Comandancia of Nueva Ecija was created and was governed by Governor General Fausto Cruzat.

Bartolome Galan in 1823, he describes the economy of the province. According to his report, Tayabas had poor soil and the terrain is hilly which meant that conditions were not that suitable for agriculture compared to other places. The people grew upland rice, wheat, beans and vegetables. Surplus rice was sold in San Pablo and Majayjay during Mondays, the market day of those towns. Cattle breeding was rampant in towns like Tayabas, Pagbilao, Tiaong, and Sariaya. Also, unlike other provinces, haciendas were not so many in Tayabas. Instead, residents owned most of their own land.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|title=Reading Southeast Asia|last=Shiraishi|first=Takashi|publisher=Cornell University|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=128\u2013130}}</ref>\n\nThe people of Tayabas, as in other areas, are actively trading with Manila. Santa Cruz, Laguna was the entrepot for all goods going to the capital. The people from Lucban made products of buri and pandan leaves like hats, sleeping mata and the like which they traded. They, along with the people of Mauban also went to Polillo, at that time part of Nueva Ecija, to buy sea slugs, shells and beeswax. Being a rich agricultural area, the town of Tayabas traded rice, coconuts, and panocha with nearby towns of Majayjay, Lucban, Sariaya, Pagbilao,  Mauban, Gumaca, and Atimonan. In turn, they traded fish from Pagbilao, rice from Sariaya, and high quality abaca products from Mauban and Atimonan. Lucban, as well as Tayabas, benefitted greatly from the high commercial activity of Chinese and Chinese mestizos in the pueblos.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nGumaca, being a town with little arable land depended heavily on the sea. They collected sea slugs, and tortoise shell from Alabat and traded with the [[mountain people]] there for beeswax in exchange for clothing. They even sometimes ventured to Burias Island in the Ragay Gulf in search for these goods. These products were then sent to Tayabas for shipment to Manila.

The most important event in the history of the province was the [[Confradia Revolt]] in 1841, which was led by the famous [[Lucban, Quezon|Lucbano]], Apolinario de la Cruz, popularly known as [[Hermano Pule]]. The province, under General [[Miguel Malvar]], was also among the earliest to join the [[Philippine Revolution]].

Insurgents from neighboring provinces of Laguna and Batangas often use Tayabas as their base of operations as well as their source of supplies. An insurgent government, with connections to Gen. Malvar and Pedro Caballes was even said to be based in Infanta. This has led the American in charge, Brigadier-General J.F. Bell to decide to return to Tayabas with a larger contingent. Bell acknowledged the importance of the ports of Tayabas as sources of supplies to the insurrection such that he believed that closing all the ports in the province might convince the leaders of the resistance to surrender.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Masterpiece of Counterguerrilla Warfare: BG J.

These barangays are Kagtalaba, Plaridel, Kabuluan, Don Tomas, Guitol, Tabugon, Maualawin, Patag Ibaba and Patag Iraya. The boundary dispute originated from Act 2711 or the Revised Administrative Code which was enacted in 1917.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1989/nov1989/gr_80796_1989.html|title=G.R.

From Mount Cadig it extends along the crest of a mountain range, a distance of 50 kilometers, more or less, to a peak known as Mount Labo; thence in a southwesterly direction, a distance of 25 kilometers, more or less, to a prominent stone monument at the source or headwaters of the Pasay River, thence along the meandering course of said river in a southerly direction, a distance of 1\u00bd kilometers, more or less, to the Gulf of Ragay.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/1917/03/10/act-no-2711/|title=An Act Amending the Administrative Code|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120923192557/http://www.gov.ph/1917/03/10/act-no-2711/|archive-date=2012-09-23|url-status=dead|access-date=7 February 2017}}</ref></blockquote>In 1922, the then Chief of the Executive Bureau, acted upon the authority of the Secretary of the Interior.<ref name=\":7\" /> This ruling by the then chief was never implemented even with repeated efforts of the provincial government of Camarines Norte and the Secretary of Interior. The Chief delineated the border as follows:<blockquote>\"Starting from the peak of Mt. Labo as a common corner between the provinces of Tayabas, Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte thence a straight line is drawn to the peak of Mt. Cadig; ''thence a straight line is drawn to the point of intersection of the inter-provincial road between Camarines Norte and Tayabas with the Tabugon River; thence, following the course of the river to its mouth at Basiad Bay.\"''<ref name=\":7\" /></blockquote>In the legal dispute, Quezon raised two points of contention. First is that Act 2711 already delineated the boundaries of the province. Second is that the Chief of the Executive Bureau had no power nor authority to change the boundaries of the province. Regarding the first issue, the court stated that it is true that Act 2711 delineated the boundary but it did not delineate the entirety of the boundary. The point on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay was never specifically located, thus, needing further delineation. On the second issue, the court stated that the Chief did not alter the borders in any way. The Chief worked with the requirement that the point be on the eastern shore of Basiad Bay. He was also acting on the consideration of Act 2809, the Act establishing Camarines Norte, which states that Camarines Norte be established with the borders it had before merging with Camarines Sur. The court then ruled in favor of Camarines Norte and ordered the provincial government of Quezon to transfer all its authority and jurisdiction to the former.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nBy 2001, the Provincial Government of Quezon, this time represented by Governor Eduardo Rodriguez, the Provincial Government of Camarines Norte, as represented by Governor Roy Padilla, went back to court. Even with the judgment on the 1989 case was executory by 1990, the provincial government of Quezon did not abide by the court's ruling. In 1991, a DENR technical team conducted a survey of the area and erected a monument marker to delineate the boundary of the area. However, by October 1991, Quezon Governor Eduardo Rodriguez and Calauag Mayor Julio Lim caused the removal of the marker. Throughout the proceedings, several government agencies including the Department of Budget and Management, Comelec, as well as the Philippine Statistics Authority recognized the jurisdiction of the town of [[Santa Elena, Camarines Norte]] over the 9 barangays. In 2000, Judge Regino held Governor Rodriguez and Mayor Lim guilty of contempt, with a maximum imprisonment of 6 months as well as a fine of 1,000 pesos for the erection of a new boundary marker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/2001/oct2001/80796.htm|title=Province of Camarines Norte vs Province of Quezon : 80796 : October 11, 2001 : J.

These people, though seem as uncivilized by some, have a very rich culture. Some forms of their art include body scarification. The Aeta cause wound on their skin in various parts of their body including back, arms, legs, hands, calves and abdomen. They then irritate them during healing using fire, lime and other materials to form scars. They also bore holes on their septum and then proceed to decorate it with a sliver of bamboo.

There are the dominant ''Tagalog language'', the ''Manide language'' in the east and a small portion in the north, the ''Agta Dumagat Umiray'' language in the north and a small area in the center, the already-extinct ''Katabaga language'' which used to be in the south, and the endangered Alabat Agta in Alabat island. The province primarily speaks Tagalog dialect called ''Tayabas Tagalog'' that resembles a dominant part of [[Batangas Tagalog]] with a heavy mixture of [[Bikol languages|Bicolano]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words. Its presence is stronger in towns in [[Aurora (Province)|Aurora]], First, Third (Bondoc Peninsula) and Fourth Districts of the Province.\n\nIn 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd world volume of Endangered Languages in the World, where 3 critically endangered languages were in the Philippines. One of these languages is the ''[[Alabat Island]] Agta'' language. The language was classified as ''Critically Endangered'', meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren anymore.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|title=UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in danger|website=www.unesco.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218184822/http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php|archivedate=18 December 2016|url-status=live|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Religion ===\nMajority of Quezon's inhabitants practice Roman Catholicism and other Christian denominations like [[Iglesia Filipina Independiente]].
