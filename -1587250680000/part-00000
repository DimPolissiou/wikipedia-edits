In the final week before the revised deadline, that ratifying resolution, however, was defeated in the [[Florida Senate]] by a vote of 16 to 22. Even if Florida had ratified the ERA, the proposed amendment would still have fallen short of the required 38.\n\nAccording to research by Jules B.

On January 25, 1982, however, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] the lower court's decision, thus signaling to the legislatures of still-unratified states that they may continue consideration of ERA during their spring 1982 legislative sessions.\n\nAfter the disputed June 30, 1982, extended deadline had come and gone, the Supreme Court, at the beginning of its new term, on October 4, 1982, in the separate case of ''NOW v.

The Court stated: \"We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.\"<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286 Coleman v.

The Court stated: \"We think that, in accordance with this historic precedent, the question of the efficacy of ratifications by state legislatures, in the light of previous rejection or attempted withdrawal, should be regarded as a political question pertaining to the political departments, with the ultimate authority in the Congress in the exercise of its control over the promulgation of the adoption of the amendment.\"<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13916201793014079286 Coleman v.

She was born in a [[barrio]] of [[Santiago]], and lived in poverty throughout her life, working as a [[seamstress]] from an early age. At the time the War of the Pacific began she was only 13 years old, and had been orphaned and twice widowed. Her second husband was executed by the [[Bolivia]]n military for killing a soldier. She tried to pass herself as a man and enlist as a soldier in the [[Chilean Army]]. This failed, but she was given a position as an unofficial [[cantini\u00e8re]] and [[military nurse]], marching alongside the infantrymen to sell food and drink, and caring for the wounded after battles.\n\nDespite being given a noncombatant role, she fought alongside the men of her unit in the battles of the Tarapac\u00e1 Campaign in late 1879, at [[Battle of Pisagua|Pisagua]] and [[Battle of San Francisco|San Francisco]]. Her valor in these battles and her care for wounded men drew the attention of Chilean commander-in-chief [[Manuel Baquedano]], who provided her with official recognition and the rank of a [[sergeant]]. She continued to serve in the army for the duration of the war and was famously courageous at the [[Battle of Tacna]] in 1880. After the war, she returned to civilian life and died in obscurity, aged only 25. Now considered one of Chile's greatest heroes of the war, her service only became widely known after her death.\n\n== Early life ==\nMorales was born on 1 April 1865 in La Chimba, a [[barrio]] on the [[Mapocho River]] in [[Santiago de Chile]], the daughter of carpenter Ventura Morales and Marta Infante.<ref>{{cite book|title= Historia did\u00e1ctica de Chile crono-antol\u00f3gica: desde la \u00e9poca precolombina hasta 1973|first=Manuel|last= Escala Escobar|first2=Carlos |last2=Fortin|first3= Fernando|last3= Fuentealba Jim\u00e9nez\n|publisher=Ediciones Hern\u00e1ndez-Blanco|year=1985|edition=2nd}}</ref> Her father died when she was young, and she moved with her mother to [[Valparaiso]].

She was born in a [[barrio]] of [[Santiago]], and lived in poverty throughout her life, working as a [[seamstress]] from an early age. At the time the War of the Pacific began she was only 13 years old, and had been orphaned and twice widowed. Her second husband was executed by the [[Bolivia]]n military for killing a soldier. She tried to pass herself as a man and enlist as a soldier in the [[Chilean Army]]. This failed, but she was given a position as an unofficial [[cantini\u00e8re]] and [[military nurse]], marching alongside the infantrymen to sell food and drink, and caring for the wounded after battles.\n\nDespite being given a noncombatant role, she fought alongside the men of her unit in the battles of the Tarapac\u00e1 Campaign in late 1879, at [[Battle of Pisagua|Pisagua]] and [[Battle of San Francisco|San Francisco]]. Her valor in these battles and her care for wounded men drew the attention of Chilean commander-in-chief [[Manuel Baquedano]], who provided her with official recognition and the rank of a [[sergeant]]. She continued to serve in the army for the duration of the war and was famously courageous at the [[Battle of Tacna]] in 1880. After the war, she returned to civilian life and died in obscurity, aged only 25. Now considered one of Chile's greatest heroes of the war, her service only became widely known after her death.\n\n== Early life ==\nMorales was born on 1 April 1865 in La Chimba, a [[barrio]] on the [[Mapocho River]] in [[Santiago de Chile]], the daughter of carpenter Ventura Morales and Marta Infante.<ref>{{cite book|title= Historia did\u00e1ctica de Chile crono-antol\u00f3gica: desde la \u00e9poca precolombina hasta 1973|first=Manuel|last= Escala Escobar|first2=Carlos |last2=Fortin|first3= Fernando|last3= Fuentealba Jim\u00e9nez\n|publisher=Ediciones Hern\u00e1ndez-Blanco|year=1985|edition=2nd}}</ref> Her father died when she was young, and she moved with her mother to [[Valparaiso]].

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltsby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltsby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n==== Character ====\n!\n=== Off-Off Broadway (2015) ===\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2016) ===\nThe Elektra Theater\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2017) ===\nNew World Stages\n!\n=== Entertainment Quarter (2019) ===\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=NME|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile. The title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The next month, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews {{!}} Any Decent Music |url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=AnyDecentMusic? |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple's first release since ''[[The Idler Wheel...]]'' in 2012. Apple began recording the album in 2015, producing and performing it alongside Amy Aileen Wood, [[Sebastian Steinberg]] and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]]. It features a percussive sound, and lyrically explores \"not being afraid to speak\".  The album received universal critical acclaim upon its release, becoming the first album in review aggregator [[Metacritic]]'s history to receive a weighted average score of 100 upon its initial release.\n\n==Background and recording==\nIn 2012, Apple began conceptualising a new album, considering a [[concept album]] based on her home in [[Venice Beach]] or the [[Pando (tree)|Pando]] in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members [[Sebastian Steinberg]], Amy Aileen Wood and [[Dav\u00edd Garza]].<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/> They began writing and rehearsing in Apple's [[Venice Beach]] home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.<ref name=\"newyorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/23/fiona-apples-art-of-radical-sensitivity|title=Fiona Apple's Art of Radical Sensitivity|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|author-link=Emily Nussbaum|website=[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]|date=March 16, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the [[Sonic Ranch]] studio in rural Texas, with little success. A few months later, after returning to Venice Beach, they began making progress, with Apple recording long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects. Apple's vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound.<ref name=\"VultureProfile\"/><ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with ''[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]'', explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released \"a million years ago\" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/fiona-apple-is-still-calling-bullshit.html|title=Fiona Apple Is Still Calling Bullshit|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=[[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]]|date=September 25, 2019|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive response brought Apple back on track.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being \"artwork and stuff\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-soon/|title=Fiona Apple says new album will \"be done soon\"|last=Bacior|first=Robin|website=Consequence of Sound|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2020/01/fiona-apple-new-album-updates.html|title=15 Minutes With Fiona Apple|last=Handler|first=Rachel|website=Vulture|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref> On March 9, 2020, she revealed that she had finished recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fiona-apple-reveals-her-new-album-is-finished-2622233|title=Fiona Apple reveals her new album is finished|last=Langford|first=Jackson|website=NME|date=March 9, 2020|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe album's sound is percussive and raw. Songs feature looped sections, and sudden tempo changes. Apple's long-time bassist [[Sebastian Steinberg]] compared the album to Apple's 2012 song \"Hot Knife\", describing it as \"very raw and unslick\". Lyrically, Apple identified its main theme as \"not being afraid to speak\". She also explores her complex social relationships with other women.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/>\n\n==Release==\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' profile. The title, ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'', is a quote from the British-Irish crime drama television series ''[[The Fall (TV series)|The Fall]]'', where the protagonist, a sex-crimes investigator portrayed by [[Gillian Anderson]], recites the phrase while investigating a crime scene where a woman was tortured.<ref name=\"newyorker\"/> The next month, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/fiona-apple-releasing-new-album-fetch-the-bolt-cutters-this-month/|title=Fiona Apple Releasing New Album ''Fetch the Bolt Cutters'' This Month|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=April 1, 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| AOTY = 95/100<ref name=\"aoty\">{{cite web |title=Fiona Apple - Fetch the Bolt Cutters - Reviews |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/224348-fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters.php |publisher=Album of The Year |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| ADM = 9.1/10<ref name=\"adm\">{{cite web |title=Fetch The Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple reviews {{!}} Any Decent Music |url=http://www.anydecentmusic.com/review/11368/Fiona-Apple-Fetch-The-Bolt-Cutters.aspx |publisher=AnyDecentMusic? |accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| MC = 100/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/fetch-the-bolt-cutters/fiona-apple|title=Fetch the Bolt Cutters by Fiona Apple Reviews and Tracks|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|access-date=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The A.V.

[[Princess Maria Antonia Koh\u00e1ry]] was a Hungarian Noble, whose daughter and heiress married Ferdinand\u2019s grandfather, [[Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Ferdinand was raised in his grandfathers Catholic faith and baptised in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]] on 27 February, having as godparents [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Maximilian of Austria]] and his wife [[Princess Charlotte of Belgium]].<ref>Archiv der Domkirche St. Stephan, Wien, Taufbuch 1860-1865</ref> He grew up in the cosmopolitan environment of [[Austro-Hungarian]] high nobility and also in their ancestral lands in [[Hungary]] and in Germany. The House of [[Koh\u00e1ry]] descended from an immensely wealthy Upper Hungarian noble family, who held the princely lands of [[\u010cabra\u010f Castle|\u010cabra\u010f]] and Sitno in present-day [[Slovakia]], among others. The family's property was augmented by [[Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]]' remarkable dowry.<ref>Constant, ''Foxy Ferdinand, 1861-1948, Tsar of Bulgaria'' (1979).</ref>\n\nThe son of [[Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince August of Saxe-Coburg]] and his wife [[Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]], daughter of King [[Louis Philippe I of the French]], Ferdinand was a grandnephew of [[Ernst I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Ernest I]], Duke of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], first king of the Belgians. His father August was a brother of King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]], and also a first cousin to [[Queen Victoria]], her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]], [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]] and her brother [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. These last two, Leopold and Carlota, were also first cousins of Ferdinand I's through his mother, a princess of Orl\u00e9ans. This made the Belgian siblings his first cousins, as well as his first cousins once removed. Indeed, the House of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] had contrived to occupy, either by marriage or by direct election, several European thrones in the course of the 19th century. Following the family trend, Ferdinand was himself to found the royal dynasty of Bulgaria.<ref>Constant, ''Foxy Ferdinand, 1861-1948, Tsar of Bulgaria'' (1979).</ref>\n\n==Prince of Bulgaria==\n[[File:The Nine Sovereigns at Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Sovereigns at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], photographed on 20 May 1910.

Seated, from left to right: [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|King Alfonso XIII of Spain]], [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|King Frederick VIII of Denmark]].]]\n\nThe previous ruling prince of Bulgaria, [[Alexander of Battenberg]], had abdicated in 1886 after a [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1886|pro-Russian coup]], only seven years after he had been elected.<ref name=\"Finestone227\">[[#Finestone1981|Finestone, 1981, ''The Last Courts of Europe'']], p 227</ref> Ferdinand, who was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian army, was elected Prince of autonomous [[Bulgaria]] by its Grand National Assembly on 7 July 1887 in the [[Gregorian calendar]] (the \"New Style\" used hereinafter).<ref name=\"Finestone227\"/> In desperate attempts to prevent Russian occupation of Bulgaria, the throne had been previously offered, before Ferdinand's acceptance, to princes from Denmark to the Caucasus and even to the King of Romania.<ref name=\"Louda297\">[[#Louda1981|Louda, 1981, ''Lines of Succession'']], p 297</ref> The Russian tsar himself had nominated his aide, [[Niko I Dadiani|Nichols Dadian of Mingrelia]], but his candidacy was rejected by the Bulgarians. Ferdinand's accession was greeted with disbelief in many of the royal houses of Europe; [[Queen Victoria]], his father's first cousin, stated to her Prime Minister, \"He is totally unfit&nbsp;... delicate, eccentric and effeminate&nbsp;... Should be stopped at once.\"<ref name=\"Aronson83\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 83</ref> To the amazement of his initial detractors, Ferdinand generally made a good account of himself during the first two decades of his reign.<ref name=\"Aronson83\"/>\n\nBulgaria's domestic political life was dominated during the early years of Ferdinand's reign by liberal party leader [[Stefan Stambolov]], whose independent foreign policy saw a marked cooling in relations with Russia, formerly seen as Bulgaria's protector.\n\nStambolov's fall (May 1894) and subsequent assassination -likely planned by Ferdinand- (July 1895) paved the way for a reconciliation of Bulgaria with Russia, effected in February 1896 with Ferdinand's decision to convert his infant son, Prince Boris, from [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity. However, this move earned him the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives, particularly that of his uncle, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n==Tsar of Bulgaria==\nOn 5 October 1908 (celebrated on 22 September), Ferdinand proclaimed Bulgaria's ''de jure'' independence from the Ottoman Empire (though the country had been ''de facto'' independent since 1878). He also proclaimed Bulgaria a kingdom, and assumed the title of ''tsar''\u2014a deliberate nod to the rulers of the earlier Bulgarian states.<ref name=\"Louda297\"/> However, while the title ''tsar'' was translated as \"emperor\" in the First and Second Bulgarian empires, it was translated as \"[[king]]\" under Ferdinand and his successors.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/tsar Tsar] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref> The [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence]] was proclaimed by him at the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|Holy Forty Martyrs Church]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], and was recognized by Turkey and the other European powers.<ref name=\"Louda297\"/> The [[Tarnovo Constitution]] was retained, with the word \"prince\" replaced by the word \"tsar.\"\n\nFerdinand was known for being quite a character. On a visit to [[List of German monarchs|German Emperor]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], his second cousin once removed, in 1909, Ferdinand was leaning out of a window of the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace in Potsdam]] when the Emperor came up behind him and slapped him on the bottom. Ferdinand was affronted by the gesture but the Kaiser arrogantly refused to apologize. Ferdinand however exacted his revenge by awarding a valuable arms contract he had intended to give to the [[Krupp]]'s factory in [[Essen]] to French arms manufacturer [[Schneider Electric|Schneider-Creusot]].<ref name=\"Aronson8-9\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], pp 8\u20139</ref> Another incident occurred on his journey to the funeral of his second cousin, King [[Edward VII]] in 1910. A tussle broke out over where his private railway carriage would be positioned in relation to the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. The Archduke won out, having his carriage positioned directly behind the engine. Ferdinand's was placed directly behind. Realising the dining car of the train was behind his own carriage, Ferdinand obtained his revenge on the Archduke by refusing him entry through his own carriage to the dining car.<ref name=\"Aronson7\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 7</ref> On 15 July the same year during a visit to Belgium Ferdinand also became the first head of state to fly in an airplane.<ref>{{cite web|title=King up in Aeroplane: Ferdinand of Bulgaria First Monarch to Do It \u2013 Sons Fly Also|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/07/16/102043617.pdf|work=New York Times website|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2010-07-17|page=1|format=Adobe Acrobat|date=16 July 1910}}</ref>\n\n==Balkan Wars==\n{{Main|Balkan Wars}}\nLike many other rulers before him, Ferdinand desired the creation of a \"new [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]\".<ref name=\"Aronson86\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 86</ref> In 1912, Ferdinand joined the other Balkan states in an assault on the Ottoman Empire to free occupied territories.

The [[Great Powers]] insisted on the creation of an [[independent Albania]].<ref name=\"Louda297\"/> Though the [[Balkan League]] allies had fought together against the common enemy in the [[First Balkan War]], that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original documents for the Balkan League, Serbia  had been pressured by Bulgaria to hand over most of [[Vardar Macedonia]] after it had freed it from Turkish rule. However Serbia, in response to the new Albanian state receiving territory in the north that it had expected to gain for itself, said that it would keep possession of the areas that its forces had occupied. Soon after, Bulgaria began the [[Second Balkan War]] when it invaded its recent allies Serbia and Greece to seize disputed areas, before being attacked itself by Romania and the Ottoman Empire. Although Bulgaria was defeated, the 1913 [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] granted the Kingdom some territorial gains. A [[Western Thrace|tiny area of land]] giving access to the [[Aegean Sea]] was secured.<ref name=\"Louda297\"/><!-- note from AusTerrapin: I am assuming that the ibid reference was to Louda p297 (immediately prior in text), not to Aronson p 87 (immediately prior in reference list), however I didn\u2019t have access to the sources to confirm -->\n\n==First World War and abdication==\n{{Main|Bulgaria during World War I}}\n[[File:WilhelmFerdinandSofia.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] and Tsar Ferdinand in Sofia, 1916]]\nOn 11 October 1915, the Bulgarian army [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|attacked Serbia]] after signing a treaty with [[Austria-Hungary]] and Germany stating that Bulgaria would gain the territory it sought at the expense of Serbia. While he was not an admirer of German Emperor Wilhelm II or [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]] [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Josef I]]&mdash;whom he described as \"that idiot, that old dotard of a Francis Joseph\".<ref name=\"Aronson126\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 126</ref>&mdash;Ferdinand wanted additional territorial gains after the humiliation of the Balkan Wars. This also entailed forming an alliance with his former enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This ranging of his country with the Central Powers made him a de facto supporter of Germany\u2019s war aims and was not well received by the Allies. [[Edmund Gosse]] wrote:\n\n\u201cIn this war, where the ranks of the enemy present to us so many formidable, sinister, and shocking figures, there is one, and perhaps but one, which is purely ridiculous. If we had the heart to relieve our strained feelings by laughter, it would be at the gross Coburg traitor, with his bodyguard of assassins and his hidden coat-of-mail, his shaking hands and his painted face. The world has never seen a meaner scoundrel, and we may almost bring ourselves to pity the Kaiser, whom circumstances have forced to accept on equal terms a potentate so verminous.\u201d\n\nDuring the initial phase of World War I, the Tsardom of Bulgaria achieved several decisive victories over its enemies and laid claim to the disputed territories of Macedonia after Serbia's defeat. For the next two years, the Bulgarian army shifted its focus towards repelling Allied advances from nearby Greece. They were also partially involved in the 1916 conquest of neighboring Romania, now ruled by another [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], who was also Ferdinand's second cousin once removed.\n\nTo save the Bulgarian monarchy after multiple military setbacks in 1918, Tsar Ferdinand [[abdication|abdicated]] in favour of his eldest son, who became Tsar [[Boris III]] on 3 October 1918.<ref name=\"Palmer206\">[[#Palmer1978|Palmer, 1978, ''The Kaiser'']], p 206</ref> Under new leadership, Bulgaria surrendered to the Allies and, as a consequence, lost not only the additional territory it had fought for in the major conflict, but also the territory it had won after the Balkan Wars giving access to the Aegean Sea.<ref name=\"Palmer206\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:KingFerdinand I Portrait.jpg|thumb|WWI-era portrait of Ferdinand I]]\nFerdinand entered a marriage of convenience<ref>Constant, 1986, \u2018\u2019Foxy Ferdinand\u2019\u2019, p 143</ref> with Princess [[Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma]], daughter of [[Robert I, Duke of Parma]] and [[Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1849\u20131882)|Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], on 20 April 1893 at the Villa Pianore in [[Lucca]]. The marriage produced four children:\n* [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] (1894\u20131943)\n* [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Kyril]] (1895\u20131945)\n* [[Princess Eudoxia of Bulgaria|Eudoxia]] (1898\u20131985)\n* [[Princess Nadezhda of Bulgaria|Nadezhda]] (1899\u20131958).\n\nMarie Louise died on 31 January 1899 after giving birth to her youngest daughter. Ferdinand did not think about remarriage until his mother, Princess Cl\u00e9mentine died in 1907. To satisfy dynastic obligations and to provide his children with a mother figure, Ferdinand married [[Princess Eleonore Reuss of K\u00f6stritz]], on 28 February 1908.<ref>Aronson, p 85.</ref>  Neither romantic love or physical attraction played any role, and Ferdinand treated her as no more than a member of the household, and showed scant regard.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">St\u00e9phane Groueff, \u2018\u2019Crown of Thorns: The Reign of King Boris III of Bulgaria, 1918-1943\u2019\u2019, Madison Books, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn his private relations, Ferdinand was a somewhat hedonistic individual. [[Bisexual]] throughout his life, up until early middle age his inclination was more towards women.<ref name=\"Constant\">Constant, Stephen ''Foxy Ferdinand, 1861\u20131948, Tsar of Bulgaria'', Sidgwick and Jackson, 1979, pp. 96, 266.</ref> He enjoyed affairs with a number of women of humble position, siring a number of illegitimate children whom he then supported financially.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In his later life, rumours abounded of Ferdinand's trysts with lieutenants and valets. His regular holidays on [[Capri]], then a popular holiday destination with wealthy [[epicenity|epicenes]], were common knowledge in royal courts throughout Europe.<ref name=\"Constant\" /> In 1895 an interview given by the embittered former Prime Minister, [[Stefan Stambolov]] to the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'' created a nine-day scandal across Europe, when he focused strongly on his personal witness of Ferdinand's homosexual interests.<ref>Perry, Duncan M. ''Stefan Stambolov and the Emergence of Modern Bulgaria: 1870-1895'', Duke University, 1993, p216.</ref>\n\n==Exile and death==\nAfter his abdication, Ferdinand returned to live in [[Coburg]], Germany. He had managed to salvage much of his fortune and was able to live in some style.<ref name=\"Aronson201\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 201</ref> He saw his being in exile simply as one of the hazards of kingship.<ref name=\"Aronson201\"/> He commented, \"Kings in exile are more philosophic under reverses than ordinary individuals; but our philosophy is primarily the result of tradition and breeding, and do not forget that pride is an important item in the making of a monarch. We are disciplined from the day of our birth and taught the avoidance of all outward signs of emotion. The skeleton sits forever with us at the feast. It may mean murder, it may mean abdication, but it serves always to remind us of the unexpected. Therefore we are prepared and nothing comes in the nature of a catastrophe. The main thing in life is to support any condition of bodily or spiritual exile with dignity. If one sups with sorrow, one need not invite the world to see you eat.\"<ref name=\"Aronson175\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 175</ref> He was pleased that the throne could pass to his son. Ferdinand was not displeased with exile and spent much of his time devoted to artistic endeavors, gardening, travel and natural history.\n\nHowever, he would live to see the collapse of everything he had held to be precious in life.<ref name=\"Aronson175\"/> His eldest son and successor, [[Boris III]], died under mysterious circumstances after returning from a visit to Hitler in Germany in 1943. Boris' son, [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], succeeded him only to be deposed in 1946, ending the Bulgarian monarchy. The Kingdom of Bulgaria was succeeded by the [[History of Communist Bulgaria|People's Republic of Bulgaria]], under which Ferdinand's other son, [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Kyril]], was executed. On hearing of Kyril's death he said, \"Everything is collapsing around me.\"<ref name=\"Aronson202\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 202</ref>\n\nFerdinand died a broken man in B\u00fcrglass-Schl\u00f6sschen on 10 September 1948 in [[Coburg (district)|Coburg]], Germany, cradle of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty. He was the last surviving grandchild of [[Louis Philippe I|Louis-Philippe of France]]. His final wish was to be buried in Bulgaria.

[[Princess Maria Antonia Koh\u00e1ry]] was a Hungarian Noble, whose daughter and heiress married Ferdinand\u2019s grandfather, [[Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Ferdinand was raised in his grandfathers Catholic faith and baptised in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna]] on 27 February, having as godparents [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Maximilian of Austria]] and his wife [[Princess Charlotte of Belgium]].<ref>Archiv der Domkirche St. Stephan, Wien, Taufbuch 1860-1865</ref> He grew up in the cosmopolitan environment of [[Austro-Hungarian]] high nobility and also in their ancestral lands in [[Hungary]] and in Germany. The House of [[Koh\u00e1ry]] descended from an immensely wealthy Upper Hungarian noble family, who held the princely lands of [[\u010cabra\u010f Castle|\u010cabra\u010f]] and Sitno in present-day [[Slovakia]], among others. The family's property was augmented by [[Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]]' remarkable dowry.<ref>Constant, ''Foxy Ferdinand, 1861-1948, Tsar of Bulgaria'' (1979).</ref>\n\nThe son of [[Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince August of Saxe-Coburg]] and his wife [[Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans]], daughter of King [[Louis Philippe I of the French]], Ferdinand was a grandnephew of [[Ernst I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Ernest I]], Duke of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and of [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], first king of the Belgians. His father August was a brother of King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]], and also a first cousin to [[Queen Victoria]], her husband [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]], [[Charlotte of Belgium|Empress Carlota of Mexico]] and her brother [[Leopold II of Belgium]]. These last two, Leopold and Carlota, were also first cousins of Ferdinand I's through his mother, a princess of Orl\u00e9ans. This made the Belgian siblings his first cousins, as well as his first cousins once removed. Indeed, the House of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] had contrived to occupy, either by marriage or by direct election, several European thrones in the course of the 19th century. Following the family trend, Ferdinand was himself to found the royal dynasty of Bulgaria.<ref>Constant, ''Foxy Ferdinand, 1861-1948, Tsar of Bulgaria'' (1979).</ref>\n\n==Prince of Bulgaria==\n[[File:The Nine Sovereigns at Windsor for the funeral of King Edward VII.jpg|thumb|left|The Nine Sovereigns at [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] for the funeral of [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], photographed on 20 May 1910.

Ferdinand's accession was greeted with disbelief in many of the royal houses of Europe; [[Queen Victoria]], his father's first cousin, stated to her Prime Minister, \"He is totally unfit&nbsp;... delicate, eccentric and effeminate&nbsp;... Should be stopped at once.\"<ref name=\"Aronson83\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 83</ref> To the amazement of his initial detractors, Ferdinand generally made a good account of himself during the first two decades of his reign.<ref name=\"Aronson83\"/>\n\nBulgaria's domestic political life was dominated during the early years of Ferdinand's reign by liberal party leader [[Stefan Stambolov]], whose independent foreign policy saw a marked cooling in relations with Russia, formerly seen as Bulgaria's protector.\n\nStambolov's fall (May 1894) and subsequent assassination -likely planned by Ferdinand- (July 1895) paved the way for a reconciliation of Bulgaria with Russia, effected in February 1896 with Ferdinand's decision to convert his infant son, Prince Boris, from [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] to [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] Christianity. However, this move earned him the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives, particularly that of his uncle, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]].\n\n==Tsar of Bulgaria==\nOn 5 October 1908 (celebrated on 22 September), Ferdinand proclaimed Bulgaria's ''de jure'' independence from the Ottoman Empire (though the country had been ''de facto'' independent since 1878). He also proclaimed Bulgaria a kingdom, and assumed the title of ''tsar''\u2014a deliberate nod to the rulers of the earlier Bulgarian states.<ref name=\"Louda297\"/> However, while the title ''tsar'' was translated as \"emperor\" in the First and Second Bulgarian empires, it was translated as \"[[king]]\" under Ferdinand and his successors.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/tsar Tsar] at [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]</ref> The [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence]] was proclaimed by him at the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo|Holy Forty Martyrs Church]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], and was recognized by Turkey and the other European powers.<ref name=\"Louda297\"/> The [[Tarnovo Constitution]] was retained, with the word \"prince\" replaced by the word \"tsar.\"\n\nFerdinand was known for being quite a character. On a visit to [[List of German monarchs|German Emperor]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], his second cousin once removed, in 1909, Ferdinand was leaning out of a window of the [[New Palace (Potsdam)|New Palace in Potsdam]] when the Emperor came up behind him and slapped him on the bottom. Ferdinand was affronted by the gesture but the Kaiser arrogantly refused to apologize. Ferdinand however exacted his revenge by awarding a valuable arms contract he had intended to give to the [[Krupp]]'s factory in [[Essen]] to French arms manufacturer [[Schneider Electric|Schneider-Creusot]].<ref name=\"Aronson8-9\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], pp 8\u20139</ref> Another incident occurred on his journey to the funeral of his second cousin, King [[Edward VII]] in 1910. A tussle broke out over where his private railway carriage would be positioned in relation to the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]. The Archduke won out, having his carriage positioned directly behind the engine. Ferdinand's was placed directly behind. Realising the dining car of the train was behind his own carriage, Ferdinand obtained his revenge on the Archduke by refusing him entry through his own carriage to the dining car.<ref name=\"Aronson7\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 7</ref> On 15 July the same year during a visit to Belgium Ferdinand also became the first head of state to fly in an airplane.<ref>{{cite web|title=King up in Aeroplane: Ferdinand of Bulgaria First Monarch to Do It \u2013 Sons Fly Also|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/07/16/102043617.pdf|work=New York Times website|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2010-07-17|page=1|format=Adobe Acrobat|date=16 July 1910}}</ref>\n\n==Balkan Wars==\n{{Main|Balkan Wars}}\nLike many other rulers before him, Ferdinand desired the creation of a \"new [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]\".<ref name=\"Aronson86\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 86</ref> In 1912, Ferdinand joined the other Balkan states in an assault on the Ottoman Empire to free occupied territories. He saw this war as a new crusade declaring it, \"a just, great and sacred struggle of the Cross against the Crescent.\"<ref name=\"Aronson87\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 87</ref> Bulgaria contributed the most and also lost the greatest number of soldiers. The [[Great Powers]] insisted on the creation of an [[independent Albania]].<ref name=\"Louda297\"/> Though the [[Balkan League]] allies had fought together against the common enemy in the [[First Balkan War]], that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original documents for the Balkan League, Serbia  had been pressured by Bulgaria to hand over most of [[Vardar Macedonia]] after it had freed it from Turkish rule. However Serbia, in response to the new Albanian state receiving territory in the north that it had expected to gain for itself, said that it would keep possession of the areas that its forces had occupied. Soon after, Bulgaria began the [[Second Balkan War]] when it invaded its recent allies Serbia and Greece to seize disputed areas, before being attacked itself by Romania and the Ottoman Empire. Although Bulgaria was defeated, the 1913 [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] granted the Kingdom some territorial gains. A [[Western Thrace|tiny area of land]] giving access to the [[Aegean Sea]] was secured.<ref name=\"Louda297\"/><!-- note from AusTerrapin: I am assuming that the ibid reference was to Louda p297 (immediately prior in text), not to Aronson p 87 (immediately prior in reference list), however I didn\u2019t have access to the sources to confirm -->\n\n==First World War and abdication==\n{{Main|Bulgaria during World War I}}\n[[File:WilhelmFerdinandSofia.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]] and Tsar Ferdinand in Sofia, 1916]]\nOn 11 October 1915, the Bulgarian army [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|attacked Serbia]] after signing a treaty with [[Austria-Hungary]] and Germany stating that Bulgaria would gain the territory it sought at the expense of Serbia. While he was not an admirer of German Emperor Wilhelm II or [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian Emperor]] [[Franz Josef I of Austria|Franz Josef I]]&mdash;whom he described as \"that idiot, that old dotard of a Francis Joseph\".<ref name=\"Aronson126\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 126</ref>&mdash;Ferdinand wanted additional territorial gains after the humiliation of the Balkan Wars. This also entailed forming an alliance with his former enemy, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This ranging of his country with the Central Powers made him a de facto supporter of Germany\u2019s war aims and was not well received by the Allies. [[Edmund Gosse]] wrote:\n\n\u201cIn this war, where the ranks of the enemy present to us so many formidable, sinister, and shocking figures, there is one, and perhaps but one, which is purely ridiculous. If we had the heart to relieve our strained feelings by laughter, it would be at the gross Coburg traitor, with his bodyguard of assassins and his hidden coat-of-mail, his shaking hands and his painted face. The world has never seen a meaner scoundrel, and we may almost bring ourselves to pity the Kaiser, whom circumstances have forced to accept on equal terms a potentate so verminous.\u201d\n\nDuring the initial phase of World War I, the Tsardom of Bulgaria achieved several decisive victories over its enemies and laid claim to the disputed territories of Macedonia after Serbia's defeat. For the next two years, the Bulgarian army shifted its focus towards repelling Allied advances from nearby Greece. They were also partially involved in the 1916 conquest of neighboring Romania, now ruled by another [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]], who was also Ferdinand's second cousin once removed.\n\nTo save the Bulgarian monarchy after multiple military setbacks in 1918, Tsar Ferdinand [[abdication|abdicated]] in favour of his eldest son, who became Tsar [[Boris III]] on 3 October 1918.<ref name=\"Palmer206\">[[#Palmer1978|Palmer, 1978, ''The Kaiser'']], p 206</ref> Under new leadership, Bulgaria surrendered to the Allies and, as a consequence, lost not only the additional territory it had fought for in the major conflict, but also the territory it had won after the Balkan Wars giving access to the Aegean Sea.<ref name=\"Palmer206\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:KingFerdinand I Portrait.jpg|thumb|WWI-era portrait of Ferdinand I]]\nFerdinand entered a marriage of convenience<ref>Constant, 1986, \u2018\u2019Foxy Ferdinand\u2019\u2019, p 143</ref> with Princess [[Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma]], daughter of [[Robert I, Duke of Parma]] and [[Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1849\u20131882)|Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], on 20 April 1893 at the Villa Pianore in [[Lucca]]. The marriage produced four children:\n* [[Boris III of Bulgaria|Boris III]] (1894\u20131943)\n* [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Kyril]] (1895\u20131945)\n* [[Princess Eudoxia of Bulgaria|Eudoxia]] (1898\u20131985)\n* [[Princess Nadezhda of Bulgaria|Nadezhda]] (1899\u20131958).\n\nMarie Louise died on 31 January 1899 after giving birth to her youngest daughter. Ferdinand did not think about remarriage until his mother, Princess Cl\u00e9mentine died in 1907. To satisfy dynastic obligations and to provide his children with a mother figure, Ferdinand married [[Princess Eleonore Reuss of K\u00f6stritz]], on 28 February 1908.<ref>Aronson, p 85.</ref>  Neither romantic love or physical attraction played any role, and Ferdinand treated her as no more than a member of the household, and showed scant regard.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">St\u00e9phane Groueff, \u2018\u2019Crown of Thorns: The Reign of King Boris III of Bulgaria, 1918-1943\u2019\u2019, Madison Books, 1998.</ref>\n\nIn his private relations, Ferdinand was a somewhat hedonistic individual. [[Bisexual]] throughout his life, up until early middle age his inclination was more towards women.<ref name=\"Constant\">Constant, Stephen ''Foxy Ferdinand, 1861\u20131948, Tsar of Bulgaria'', Sidgwick and Jackson, 1979, pp. 96, 266.</ref> He enjoyed affairs with a number of women of humble position, siring a number of illegitimate children whom he then supported financially.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In his later life, rumours abounded of Ferdinand's trysts with lieutenants and valets. His regular holidays on [[Capri]], then a popular holiday destination with wealthy [[epicenity|epicenes]], were common knowledge in royal courts throughout Europe.<ref name=\"Constant\" /> In 1895 an interview given by the embittered former Prime Minister, [[Stefan Stambolov]] to the ''Frankfurter Zeitung'' created a nine-day scandal across Europe, when he focused strongly on his personal witness of Ferdinand's homosexual interests.<ref>Perry, Duncan M. ''Stefan Stambolov and the Emergence of Modern Bulgaria: 1870-1895'', Duke University, 1993, p216.</ref>\n\n==Exile and death==\nAfter his abdication, Ferdinand returned to live in [[Coburg]], Germany. He had managed to salvage much of his fortune and was able to live in some style.<ref name=\"Aronson201\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 201</ref> He saw his being in exile simply as one of the hazards of kingship.<ref name=\"Aronson201\"/> He commented, \"Kings in exile are more philosophic under reverses than ordinary individuals; but our philosophy is primarily the result of tradition and breeding, and do not forget that pride is an important item in the making of a monarch. We are disciplined from the day of our birth and taught the avoidance of all outward signs of emotion. The skeleton sits forever with us at the feast. It may mean murder, it may mean abdication, but it serves always to remind us of the unexpected. Therefore we are prepared and nothing comes in the nature of a catastrophe. The main thing in life is to support any condition of bodily or spiritual exile with dignity. If one sups with sorrow, one need not invite the world to see you eat.\"<ref name=\"Aronson175\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 175</ref> He was pleased that the throne could pass to his son. Ferdinand was not displeased with exile and spent much of his time devoted to artistic endeavors, gardening, travel and natural history.\n\nHowever, he would live to see the collapse of everything he had held to be precious in life.<ref name=\"Aronson175\"/> His eldest son and successor, [[Boris III]], died under mysterious circumstances after returning from a visit to Hitler in Germany in 1943. Boris' son, [[Simeon Saxe-Coburg-Gotha|Simeon II]], succeeded him only to be deposed in 1946, ending the Bulgarian monarchy. The Kingdom of Bulgaria was succeeded by the [[History of Communist Bulgaria|People's Republic of Bulgaria]], under which Ferdinand's other son, [[Prince Kiril of Bulgaria|Kyril]], was executed. On hearing of Kyril's death he said, \"Everything is collapsing around me.\"<ref name=\"Aronson202\">[[#Aronson1986|Aronson, 1986, ''Crowns In Conflict'']], p 202</ref>\n\nFerdinand died a broken man in B\u00fcrglass-Schl\u00f6sschen on 10 September 1948 in [[Coburg (district)|Coburg]], Germany, cradle of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty. He was the last surviving grandchild of Louis-Philippe of France. His final wish was to be buried in Bulgaria.

Government bodies are dominantly made up of men which feminist and women activists argue that certain policies will be overlooked or not implemented at all because women's opinions are missing from this debate. Policies that are implemented that reflect feminist institutionalism, must go through a process of outside women fighting for their cause. Implementation of feminist policies entails energy from movements and activists while also creating allies within the government who become a crucial factor to getting an issue on the policy agenda.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe type of government that is in power at the time of these policy decisions plays a factor in which policies will and will not be implemented.

In Canada and the United Kingdom it is difficult for women to operate within the bureaucracy for fear of being looked at as biased and also women may feel a sense of tension towards them as advocating for women has not been welcomed in these institutions.<ref name=\":6\" /> In contrast the Australian government, especially between 1975-1995, feminists pushed for the state and federal government to create women's policy agencies in which they were able to work, through this they were able to make policies to confront issues of child care, budget, pensions and violence against women.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Quotas ===\nQuotas are one of the most frequently used policies that are put in place to aid feminist institutionalist. Quotas touch multiple domains of institutions to help bring more women into the work sphere and help them attain higher positions within the government. Recently more countries around the world have started to adopt quotas, with more than 100 countries putting quotas in place.<ref name=\":5\" /> Quotas are also supported by the international community, the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[African Union]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] have all put quotas in place that aim to have 30% women in all political bodies in the past 10 years.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGender and party quotas are put in place to not only increase the number of women that will be holding office positions but is a way to design the selection process in such a way that they are able to identify not just suitable candidates but suitable female candidates.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bjarnegard|first=Elin|last2=Kenny|year=2016|title=Comparing Candidate Selection : A Feminist Institutionalist Approach|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-289268|journal=Government and Opposition|volume=51|issue=3|pages=370\u2013392|via=|doi=10.1017/gov.2016.4}}</ref> Quota policies that target the increase in women having a position in office can be traced back to the UN [[Fourth World Conference on Women|Fourth World Conference of Women]]<ref name=\":5\" /> where women's issues were discussed on the agenda. These quotas have achieved significant increase in the actual number of women holding office.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Government Branches ==\nWomen are underrepresented in government institutions compared to the number of men represented in the same institutions. Women have had lower levels of descriptive representation in both the executive and legislative branches of the government,<ref name=\":2\" /> due to this these systems should be regarded and analyzed as such. Women have been positioned as outsiders to these government institutions leaving them incapable of having access to political power.<ref name=\":7\" /> Men have access to a homosocial capital that is used in order to build networks and gain power within this hierarchy, and in contrast women do not have the same access to this crucial capital.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nQuota laws are commonly used in government framework to increase the number of female candidates and female legislators. Quotas can either be implemented and regulated by the government or they can be voluntarily taken on, party quotas are taken on voluntarily by parties that commit to reaching a certain number of women within its candidates.<ref name=\":5\" /> The right kind of quota law placed with the right set of conditions can generate significant increases in the election of female candidates,<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Baldez|first=Lisa|author-link=Lisa Baldez|year=2006|title=The Pros and Cons of Gender Quota Laws : What Happens When You Kick Men Out and Let Women In?|url=|journal=Critical Perspective on Gender and Politics|volume=2|pages=101\u2013128|doi=10.1017/s1743923x06221019}}</ref> which allows for greater representation across various institutions. Countries such as Rwanda have stated that women must hold at least 30% of political positions,<ref name=\":8\" /> other countries have also put into effect reserved seats which requires that a minimum number of candidates must be female instead of a percentage, guaranteeing that women will be elected.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nPolitical parties are gendered organizations within government institutions, they are characterized by traditional concepts of gender relations.<ref name=\":7\" /> The role that women play within political parties are affected by that parties character, structure and ideology and how open they are to including women within their framework.<ref name=\":2\" /> Feminist institutionalist see females as crucial actors in initiating change within these institutions. Having more women in these institutions acts as a resource for other women to feel more comfortable and operate better within these positions.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Critiques of Feminist Institutionalism ==\nFeminist Institutionalism is often critiqued for having its limitations and not always benefiting those involved. Feminist institutional work often focuses on gender specific policies and institutions<ref name=\":9\" /> and has neglected to explore other outlets. Although feminist institutionalism is growing, institutional arenas remain dominated by men even with measures such as quotas and legislation being put in place,<ref name=\":9\" /> allowing for critique that these measures may not be effective. In some countries there has been little change recorded or countries have experienced setbacks with the number of women that are elected to national assemblies.<ref name=\":5\" /> Feminist institutionalists are critiqued for not having an influence inside institutions. Once they are elected into certain positions or placed in positions of power, women still have to abide by old rules, limiting the amount of change they can accomplish.<ref name=\":8\" /> It has also been critiqued that shifts within institutions are not permanent,<ref name=\":6\" /> thus any change or policies put in place by feminist institutionalists can be removed and altered.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Institutionalism]]\n[[Category:Feminist theory]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=August 2017}}\n\n'''Feminist institutionalism''' is a [[New institutionalism|new institutionalist]] approach that looks at how gender norms operate within institutions and how institutional processes construct and maintain gender power dynamics.

The election of different governments have downgraded feminist institutional status and their position in such a way that their ability to shape policy has become insignificant.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Chappell|first=Louise|year=2006|title=Comparing Political Institutions : Revealing the Gendered 'Logic of appropriateness'|url=|journal=Politics & Gender|volume=2|issue=2|pages=223\u2013235|doi=10.1017/S1743923X06221044}}</ref> Shifting government comes with a change in opinions which can either move these feminist policies forward or push them aside. In Canada and the United Kingdom it is difficult for women to operate within the bureaucracy for fear of being looked at as biased and also women may feel a sense of tension towards them as advocating for women has not been welcomed in these institutions.<ref name=\":6\" /> In contrast the Australian government, especially between 1975-1995, feminists pushed for the state and federal government to create women's policy agencies in which they were able to work, through this they were able to make policies to confront issues of child care, budget, pensions and violence against women.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Quotas ===\nQuotas are one of the most frequently used policies that are put in place to aid feminist institutionalist. Quotas touch multiple domains of institutions to help bring more women into the work sphere and help them attain higher positions within the government. Recently more countries around the world have started to adopt quotas, with more than 100 countries putting quotas in place.<ref name=\":5\" /> Quotas are also supported by the international community, the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[African Union]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]] have all put quotas in place that aim to have 30% women in all political bodies in the past 10 years.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGender and party quotas are put in place to not only increase the number of women that will be holding office positions but is a way to design the selection process in such a way that they are able to identify not just suitable candidates but suitable female candidates.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bjarnegard|first=Elin|last2=Kenny|year=2016|title=Comparing Candidate Selection : A Feminist Institutionalist Approach|url=http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-289268|journal=Government and Opposition|volume=51|issue=3|pages=370\u2013392|via=|doi=10.1017/gov.2016.4}}</ref> Quota policies that target the increase in women having a position in office can be traced back to the UN [[Fourth World Conference on Women|Fourth World Conference of Women]]<ref name=\":5\" /> where women's issues were discussed on the agenda. These quotas have achieved significant increase in the actual number of women holding office.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Government Branches ==\nWomen are underrepresented in government institutions compared to the number of men represented in the same institutions. Women have had lower levels of descriptive representation in both the executive and legislative branches of the government,<ref name=\":2\" /> due to this these systems should be regarded and analyzed as such. Women have been positioned as outsiders to these government institutions leaving them incapable of having access to political power.<ref name=\":7\" /> Men have access to a homosocial capital that is used in order to build networks and gain power within this hierarchy, and in contrast women do not have the same access to this crucial capital.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nQuota laws are commonly used in government framework to increase the number of female candidates and female legislators. Quotas can either be implemented and regulated by the government or they can be voluntarily taken on, party quotas are taken on voluntarily by parties that commit to reaching a certain number of women within its candidates.<ref name=\":5\" /> The right kind of quota law placed with the right set of conditions can generate significant increases in the election of female candidates,<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Baldez|first=Lisa|year=2006|title=The Pros and Cons of Gender Quota Laws : What Happens When You Kick Men Out and Let Women In?|url=|journal=Critical Perspective on Gender and Politics|volume=2|pages=101\u2013128|doi=10.1017/s1743923x06221019}}</ref> which allows for greater representation across various institutions. Countries such as Rwanda have stated that women must hold at least 30% of political positions,<ref name=\":8\" /> other countries have also put into effect reserved seats which requires that a minimum number of candidates must be female instead of a percentage, guaranteeing that women will be elected.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nPolitical parties are gendered organizations within government institutions, they are characterized by traditional concepts of gender relations.<ref name=\":7\" /> The role that women play within political parties are affected by that parties character, structure and ideology and how open they are to including women within their framework.<ref name=\":2\" /> Feminist institutionalist see females as crucial actors in initiating change within these institutions. Having more women in these institutions acts as a resource for other women to feel more comfortable and operate better within these positions.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Critiques of Feminist Institutionalism ==\nFeminist Institutionalism is often critiqued for having its limitations and not always benefiting those involved. Feminist institutional work often focuses on gender specific policies and institutions<ref name=\":9\" /> and has neglected to explore other outlets. Although feminist institutionalism is growing, institutional arenas remain dominated by men even with measures such as quotas and legislation being put in place,<ref name=\":9\" /> allowing for critique that these measures may not be effective. In some countries there has been little change recorded or countries have experienced setbacks with the number of women that are elected to national assemblies.<ref name=\":5\" /> Feminist institutionalists are critiqued for not having an influence inside institutions. Once they are elected into certain positions or placed in positions of power, women still have to abide by old rules, limiting the amount of change they can accomplish.<ref name=\":8\" /> It has also been critiqued that shifts within institutions are not permanent,<ref name=\":6\" /> thus any change or policies put in place by feminist institutionalists can be removed and altered.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Institutionalism]]\n[[Category:Feminist theory]]\n", "name_user": "Astrophobe", "label": "safe", "comment": "+link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_institutionalism"}
