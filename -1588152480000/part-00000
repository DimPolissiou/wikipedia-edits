The election of [[William McKinley]] in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]] was marked by a resurgence of Republican dominance that lasted (except for 1912 and 1916) until 1932. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the [[Panic of 1893]] and that Republicans would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit.<ref>Walter Dean Burnham, \"Periodization schemes and 'party systems': the 'system of 1896' as a case in point.\" ''Social Science History'' 10.3 (1986): 263\u2013314.</ref>\n\nThe Republican Civil War era program included free homestead farms, a federally subsidized transcontinental railroad, a national banking system, a large national debt, land grants for higher education, a new national banking system, a wartime income tax and permanent high tariffs to promote industrial growth and high wages.

Roosevelt controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Blacks moved into the Democratic Party during the [[New Deal]] era. After Roosevelt took office in 1933, New Deal legislation sailed through Congress and the economy moved sharply upward from its nadir in early 1933. However, long-term unemployment remained a drag until 1940. In the 1934 midterm elections, 10 Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving the GOP with only 25 senators against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives likewise had overwhelming Democratic majorities.<ref>Lewis Gould, ''Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans '' (2003) pp 271-308.</ref>\n\nThe Republican Party factionalized into a majority \"Old Right\" (based in the Midwest) and a liberal wing based in the Northeast that supported much of the New Deal. The Old Right sharply attacked the \"Second New Deal\" and said it represented class warfare and socialism. Roosevelt was re-elected in a landslide in 1936; however, as his second term began, the economy declined, strikes soared, and he failed to take control of the Supreme Court or to purge the Southern conservatives from the Democratic Party. Republicans made a major comeback in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1938|1938 elections]] and had new rising stars such as [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio on the right and [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York on the left.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469618968/the-roots-of-modern-conservatism|title=The Roots of Modern Conservatism {{!}} Michael Bowen|website=University of North Carolina Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522220118/https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469618968/the-roots-of-modern-conservatism/|archive-date=May 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Southern conservatives joined with most Republicans to form the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964.

Roosevelt won a third and fourth term in 1940 and 1944, respectively.

Nash]] argues: <blockquote>Unlike the \"moderate\", internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the \"Roosevelt Revolution\" and the essential premises of President Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary. Anti-collectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and \"me-too\" Republicans from within.<ref>Quote on p. 261 {{cite journal |jstor = 2702450|title = The Republican Right from Taft to Reagan|last1 = Nash|first1 = George H.|last2 = Reinhard|first2 = David W.|journal = Reviews in American History|volume = 12|issue = 2|pages = 261\u2013265|year = 1984|doi = 10.2307/2702450}} Nash references David W.

However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \"combative\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned.

Republicans, mainly at the state level, argue that the restrictions (such as purging voter rolls, limiting voting locations, and prosecuting double voting) are vital to prevent [[voter fraud]], claiming that voter fraud is an underestimated issue in elections. However, research has indicated that voter fraud is very uncommon, as civil and voting rights organizations often accuse Republicans of enacting restrictions to influence elections in the party's favor. Many laws or regulations restricting voting enacted by Republicans have been successfully challenged in court, with court rulings striking down such regulations and accusing Republicans of

They argue that Gingrich instilled a \"combative\" approach in the Republican Party, where hateful language and hyper-partisanship became commonplace, and where democratic norms were abandoned. Gingrich frequently questioned the [[patriotism]] of Democrats, called them corrupt, compared them to fascists, and accused them of wanting to destroy the United States. Gingrich was also involved in several major government shutdowns.<ref name=\"How Democracies Die\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions|title=How a Democracy Dies|work=The New Republic|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181211105538/https://newrepublic.com/article/145916/democracy-dies-donald-trump-contempt-for-american-political-institutions|archive-date=December 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems|title='How Democracies Die' Authors Say Trump Is A Symptom Of 'Deeper Problems'|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181208011203/https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579670528/how-democracies-die-authors-say-trump-is-a-symptom-of-deeper-problems|archive-date=December 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/|title=The rising pressures on American democracy|date=2018-01-29|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130201624/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/the-rising-pressures-on-american-democracy/|archive-date=November 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nScholars have also characterized Mitch McConnell's tenure as Senate Minority Leader and Senate Majority Leader during the Obama presidency as one where obstructionism reached all-time highs.<ref name=\"The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate\">{{Cite book|title=The Senate Syndrome: The Evolution of Procedural Warfare in the Modern U.S. Senate|last=Smith|first=Steven|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=|page=287}}</ref> Political scientists have referred to McConnell's use of the filibuster as \"constitutional hardball\", referring to the misuse of procedural tools in a way that undermines democracy.<ref name=\"Glassman 2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/12/11/wisconsins-and-michigans-legislatures-are-trying-to-weaken-incoming-governors-should-you-be-worried/|title=Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan want to weaken incoming Democratic governors.

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

During the tryouts in [[Detroit]], [[Gower Champion]] invited [[Charles Strouse]] and [[Lee Adams]] to consult on improvements to the musical. [[David Merrick]] was aware of their involvement, but Jerry Herman was not, even though Strouse was under impression that Herman knew about it. Strouse and Adams suggested re-working the ending of Act I, wrote a new song \"Before the Parade Passes By\" and sent it to Champion.

It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard.

Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

(film)|Hello Dolly!]]'' by [[20th Century Fox]], which won three Academy Awards, including [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Score of a Musical Picture]] and was nominated in four other categories, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] at the [[42nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==History==\nThe plot of ''Hello, Dolly!'' originated in the 1835 English play ''A Day Well Spent'' by [[John Oxenford]], which [[Johann Nestroy]] adapted into the farce ''[[Einen Jux will er sich machen]]'' (''He Will Go on a Spree'' or ''He'll Have Himself a Good Time''). [[Thornton Wilder]] adapted Nestroy's play into his 1938 farcical play ''The Merchant of Yonkers''. That play was a flop, so he revised it and retitled it as ''[[The Matchmaker]]'' in 1955, expanding the role of Dolly (played by [[Ruth Gordon]]).<ref name=London2008>[http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Theatre-Review/hello-dolly-new-wimbledon-theatre-review \"Hello Dolly! \u2013 New Wimbledon Theatre\"] IndieLondon, March 2008</ref>  ''The Matchmaker'' became a hit and was much revived and made into [[The Matchmaker (1958 film)|a 1958 film]] starring [[Shirley Booth]]. However, the 1891 musical ''[[A Trip to Chinatown]]'' also features a meddlesome widow who strives to bring romance to several couples and to herself in a big city restaurant.<ref>Saltzman, Simon.

Dolly makes a living through what she calls \"meddling\" \u2013 matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and [[mandolin]] lessons (\"I Put My Hand In\").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to [[Yonkers, New York]] to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.\n\nHorace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because \"It Takes a Woman\" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and \"accidentally\" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.\n\nCornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the [[polka]] competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (\"Put on Your Sunday Clothes\").\n\nIrene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (\"Ribbons Down My Back\").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of ''the'' Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics \"Alamo, remember the Alamo!\" (\"Motherhood March\"). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.\n\nDolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (\"Dancing\").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life \"Before the Parade Passes By\".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening.\n\n===Act II===\n[[File:Carol Channing Hello Dolly 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Milo Boulton and [[Carol Channing]] in one of several national tours, 1966 ]]\nCornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got \"Elegance\".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be \"twice as lightning\" (\"The Waiters' Gallop\").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.\n\nCornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (\"Hello, Dolly!\") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during \"The [[Polka]] Contest\", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.\n\nCornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (\"It Only Takes A Moment\"). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him \"So Long, Dearie\", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.\n\nThe next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: \"Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.\"  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll \"never go away again\" (\"Hello, Dolly\" (reprise)).\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dolly Gallagher Levi''': A widow in her middle years who has decided to begin her life again.

In his review of the opening night performance, ''[[The New York Times]]'' theatre critic Howard Taubman wrote\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' ... has qualities of freshness and imagination that are rare in the run of our machine-made musicals. It transmutes the broadly stylized mood of a mettlesome farce into the gusto and colors of the musical stage. ...  Mr. Herman's songs are brisk and pointed and always tuneful ... a shrewdly mischievous performance by Carol Channing. ...  Making the necessary reservations for the unnecessary vulgar and frenzied touches, one is glad to welcome ''Hello, Dolly!'' for its warmth, color and high spirits.<ref>Taubman, Howard. [http://theater2.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?html_title=&tols_title=HELLO,%20DOLLY!%20(PLAY)&pdate=19640117&byline=By%20HOWARD%20TAUBMAN&id=1077011430206 \"Hello Dolly!\"]. ''The New York Times'', 1964</ref></blockquote>\n\nJohn Chapman of the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' lauded Carol Channing's performance, declaring her \"the most outgoing woman on the musical stage today \u2013 big and warm, all eyes and smiles, in love with everybody in the theatre and possessing a unique voice ranging somewhat upward from a ''basso profundo''.\"  He also wrote, \"I wouldn't say that Jerry Herman's score is memorable.\"<ref name=Suskin>Suskin, Steven. ''Opening Night on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Golden Era of the Musical Theatre'', pp. 297\u2013301. Schirmer Books, New York, 1990. {{ISBN|0-02-872625-1}}</ref> [[New York Post]] critic Richard Watts, Jr., wrote,\n\n<blockquote>The fact that [''Hello, Dolly!''] seems to me short on charm, warmth, and the intangible quality of distinction in no way alters my conviction that it will be an enormous popular success. Herman has composed a score that is always pleasant and agreeably tuneful, although the only number that comes to mind at the moment is the lively title song. His lyrics could be called serviceable.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', [[Walter Kerr]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>''Hello, Dolly!'' is a musical comedy dream, with Carol Channing the girl of it. ... Channing opens wide her big-as-millstone eyes, spreads her white-gloved arms in ecstatic abandon, trots out on a circular runway that surrounds the orchestra, and proceeds to dance rings around the conductor. ... With hair like orange sea foam, a contralto like a horse's neighing, and a confidential swagger, [she is] a musical comedy performer with all the blowzy glamor of the girls on the sheet music of 1916.</blockquote>\n\nKerr perceived deficiencies in the libretto, though, stating that the \"lines are not always as funny as Miss Channing makes them\".<ref name=Suskin/> John McClain of the [[New York Journal American]] particularly praised the staging of the musical, saying that\n\n<blockquote>Gower Champion deserves the big gong for performance beyond the call of duty. Seldom has a corps of dancers brought so much style and excitement to a production which could easily have been pedestrian. ... It is difficult to describe the emotion [the song \"Hello, Dolly!\"] produces. Last night the audience nearly tore up the seats as she led the parade of waiters in a series of encores over the semi-circular runway that extends around the orchestra pit out into the audience, ... a tribute to the personal appeal of Miss Channing and the magical inventiveness of Mr. Champion's staging.<ref name=Suskin/></blockquote>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:95%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Year\n! style=\"width:25%;\"| Award \n! style=\"width:40%;\"| Category\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Nominee\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Result\n|-\n| rowspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1964\n| [[New York Drama Critics Circle|New York Drama Critics Circle Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramacritics.org/dc_pastawards.html#1964 \"New York Drama Critics Past Awards, 1964\"] dramacritics.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| Best Musical\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"11\"| [[Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=2810 \" 'Hello Dolly' Listing, 1964\u20131970\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 \"Tony Awards, 1964\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105101119/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1964 |date=2012-01-05 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153433.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1964\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| colspan=\"2\"| [[Tony Award for Best Musical|Best Musical]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Book of a Musical|Best Book of a Musical]]\n| [[Michael Stewart (playwright)|Michael Stewart]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]]\n| [[Carol Channing]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical]]\n| [[Charles Nelson Reilly]]\n| {{nom}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]\n| [[Jerry Herman]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award|Best Producer of a Musical]]\n| [[David Merrick]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical|Best Direction of a Musical]]\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Gower Champion]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Conductor and Musical Director|Best Conductor and Musical Director]]\n| Shepard Coleman\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Scenic Design|Best Scenic Design]]\n| [[Oliver Smith (designer)|Oliver Smith]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| [[Tony Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]]\n| [[Freddy Wittop]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1968\n| [[Special Tony Award]]<ref>[http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 \"Tony Awards, 1968\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407225811/http://www2.broadwayworld.com/tonyawardsyear.cfm?year=1968 |date=2016-04-07 }} broadwayworld.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=30650 \"Pearl Bailey Listing, Awards and Nominations\"] Internet Broadway Database, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0153442.html \"Tony Award Winners, 1968\"] infoplease.com, accessed March 29, 2012</ref>\n| Special Award\n| [[Pearl Bailey]]\n| {{won}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1970\n| [[Drama Desk Award]]<ref>[http://www.dramadesk.org/1969_1970dd.html \"Drama Desk, 1969\u20131970\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} dramadesk.org, accessed March 29, 2012</ref><ref>Flinn, Caryl.

It is commonly found throughout New Zealand and as far south as the [[Auckland Islands]]. It grows from sea level up to about {{Convert|1000|m|abbr = on}}, particularly alongside creeks and rivers. It is easily recognised in its native environment by the characteristic appearance of its bark, which peels spontaneously, hanging in red papery strips to show a pale bark underneath. Its scientific name, ''excorticata'', reflects this distinctive property.\n\n''Fuchsia excorticata'' is the largest member of the genus ''[[Fuchsia]]'', growing to a height of {{Convert|15|m|4 = -1|abbr = on}}. It is unusual among New Zealand trees in being [[deciduous]] in the southern parts of its range. The introduction of the [[common brushtail possum]] to New Zealand precipitated a serious decline in this species, particularly where large concentrations of the possum are present. ''F. excorticata'' appears to be one of the possum's preferred food sources, and they will browse individual trees to the point of [[defoliation]] after which the trees will die. The small dark purple berry is sweet and juicy. It was favoured by M\u0101ori who, unusually, gave the fruit its own name of ''k\u014dnini''; it was also eaten by European settlers in jams and puddings.\n\n==Description==\n\n''Fuchsia excorticata'' is the largest species of ''[[Fuchsia]]'' in the world. This species differs in appearances from others in New Zealand. This species is deciduous, found most commonly in tree or shrub form. It typically grows to an average height of 12 meters high. It is distinguishable by a noticeably light brown/orange bark, which is extremely thin and paper like, peeling in strips.<ref name=\"Flora of New Zealand\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nzflora/factsheet/Taxon/Fuchsia-exorticata.html |title= ''Fuchsia exorticata'' (J.R.

Leaves of ''Fuchsia excorticata'' have a smooth epidermis with the exception of the margin and veins. The leaf margin is serrated with small teeth. Leaf colour can vary the upper side generally being dark green and the underside being paler and more silver in colour. Leaves can sometimes be suffused with red or purple colouring. ''Fuchsia excorticata'' is uncommon for its characteristic of being [[deciduous]] in southern areas of [[New Zealand]], where the majority of its competing species are large [[evergreen]] species. Therefore, in the winter months ''Fuchsia excorticata'' is conspicuous by being found with few to no leaves.\n\n===Flowers===\nFlowers are usually bright red to purple in colour and often emerge from the main stem. Flowers are solitary and pendulous. The four showy sepals tend to be 5-16&nbsp;mm long. Filaments tending to range from 7-12&nbsp;mm in length and purplish in colour.

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament from a Nazi base.<ref name=\"Canary\" /> In early January 2020, filming took place outside the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], England,<ref name=\"Oxford\" /> as well as

Marvel had met with multiple screenwriters, and was believed to be focusing on the character [[Sersi]].<ref name=\"FeigeApr2018\" /> Marvel set [[Matthew K. Firpo|Matthew]] and Ryan Firpo to write the script a month later,<ref name=\"Firpos\" /> with their outline including a love story between the characters Sersi and [[Ikaris]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In June, Feige said Marvel was interested in exploring the \"ancient aliens kind of sci-fi trope\" of the Eternals being the inspiration for myths and legends throughout the history of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU).<ref name=\"FeigeJun2018\" />\n\nDuring late August, Marvel's director search for ''The Eternals'' narrowed to a shortlist that included [[Chlo\u00e9 Zhao]]\u2014who had also been in the running to direct Marvel's ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020)\u2014[[Nicole Kassell]], [[Travis Knight]], and the pair of Cristina Gallego and [[Ciro Guerra]].<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> Zhao was chosen to direct the film a month later, with Marvel moving quickly to secure her after being impressed by a meeting with her that made them concerned she might take on a different big-studio project instead.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /><ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> Marvel considered ''The Eternals'' to be a \"perfect transition\" into its next phase of films along with projects such as ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' (2019),<ref name=\"Zhao2\" /> as it allowed the studio to cast a diverse group of actors to portray the various Eternals.<ref name=\"Zhao\" /> In February 2019, Feige reiterated that Marvel was interested in the characters due to Kirby's \"immense, amazing epic with ''Eternals'' that spans tens of thousands of years\" in the comics; because they wanted to create more ensemble films \"from the start\" like ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' (2014), rather than building up to an ensemble crossover as they did with ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012); and to introduce \"characters that the majority of the world has never heard of\" as they did with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]].<ref name=\"FeigeFeb2019\" />\n\n===Pre-production===\n[[Angelina Jolie]] joined the cast in March 2019, reportedly as Sersi,<ref name=\"Jolie\" /><ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /> with [[Kumail Nanjiani]] and [[Ma Dong-seok|Don Lee]] cast in undisclosed roles the next month.<ref name=\"Nanjiani\" /><ref name=\"Ma\" /> At that time, the film was expected to feature Marvel Studios' first gay superhero.<ref name=\"Ma2\" /> In May, [[Richard Madden]] entered negotiations for the role of Ikaris,<ref name=\"MaddenTalks\" /> and by the following month, [[Salma Hayek]] had entered early negotiations for an undisclosed role.<ref name=\"Hayek\" /> In July, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that the cast included Jolie, Madden, and [[Millie Bobby Brown]],<ref name=\"Brown\" /> but Brown quickly denied that she had been cast.<ref name=\"NoBrown\" /> Later that month at [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Feige officially announced the film, with a release date of November 6, 2020. He confirmed the casting of Jolie, Nanjiani, Lee, Madden, and Hayek, revealing their roles to be [[Thena]], [[Kingo Sunen|Kingo]], [[Forgotten One (comics)|Gilgamesh]], Ikaris, and [[Ajak]], and also announced the casting of [[Lauren Ridloff]] as [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], [[Brian Tyree Henry]] as [[Phastos]], and [[Lia McHugh]] as [[Sprite (Eternal)|Sprite]].<ref name=\"McHugh\" /> Following the announcement, Feige confirmed that one of these characters would be an LGBTQ character in the film;<ref name=\"LGBTQ\" /> actor [[Haaz Sleiman]] later revealed that Phastos is the superhero that is depicted as gay in the film, with Sleiman portraying the character's husband. The pair have a child in the film. Sleiman felt it was \"important [for the film] to show how loving and beautiful a queer family can be\" rather than the \"sexual or rebellious\" depiction of queer people in some previous media.<ref name=\"SleimanNewNowNext\" />\n\n===Filming===\nBy the film's official announcement in July 2019, [[principal photography]] had begun at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], England.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"PinewoodStudios\" /> [[Ben Davis (cinematographer)|Ben Davis]] served as director of photography.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> The following month, [[Gemma Chan]] and [[Barry Keoghan]] were in talks to join the cast.<ref name=\"Chan\" /><ref name=\"Keoghan\" /> Chan previously portrayed [[Doctor Minerva|Minn-Erva]] in ''Captain Marvel'', but reports noted that she was potentially being looked at by Marvel to play a separate character in this film.<ref name=\"Chan\" /> Chan and Keoghan were confirmed to be cast at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23 Expo]] in August, in the roles of Sersi and [[Druig]], respectively, along with [[Kit Harington]] as [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref name=\"D232019\" /> By early November, filming took place in the [[Canary Islands]]. The filming crew, including Jolie and Madden, had to be evacuated from a shooting location on the island of [[Fuerteventura]] due to an explosive device found there, thought to be a remnant armament

One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off.

In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone, confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n

In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone, confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Episode 7\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = Episode 9\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = Episode 10\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe series is written by [[Song Ji-na]]'s son Jin Han-sae, directed by {{illm|Kim Jin-min|ko|\uae40\uc9c4\ubbfc (\uc5f0\ucd9c\uac00)}} (''[[Time Between Dog and Wolf]]'', ''[[Road No. 1]]'', ''[[Lawless Lawyer]]''), and produced by Studio 329, the same company behind [[YouTube Premium]]'s first and only Korean original series ''[[Top Management (TV series)|Top Management]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming ended on August 6, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=So-hee|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20190807164206994|date=August 7, 2019|work=Daum|title=\uae40\ub3d9\ud76c, '\uc778\uac04\uc218\uc5c5' \ucd2c\uc601 \ub05d \"\ud568\uaed8 \ud574\uc900 \uc2a4\ud15d\ub4e4 \uac10\uc0ac\ud574\uc694\"|language=ko|accessdate=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://www.netflix.com/title/80990668 Extracurricular]'' on [[Netflix]]\n* {{IMDb title|tt10262630}}\n* {{Hancinema drama|Human_Lessons}}\n\n{{Netflix original series}}\n\n[[Category:Korean-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:2020s South Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2020 South Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Teen drama television series]]\n[[Category:South Korean crime television series]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in television]]\n", "name_user": "Seokgjin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEpisodes:he is mostly called Mr. Lee", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_(TV_series)"}
