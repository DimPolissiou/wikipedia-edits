A lawful combatant is a person who commits belligerent acts, and, when captured, is treated as a POW. An ''unlawful combatant'' is someone who commits belligerent acts but does not qualify for POW status under GCIII Articles 4 and 5.\n\n{{quote|Article 4\n\nA. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:\n\n:1. Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces.\n\n:2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]], belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]], provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfill the following conditions:\n\n::(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;\n::(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;\n::(c) That of carrying arms openly;\n::(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.\n\n:3. Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.\n\n:4. Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to the annexed model.\n\n:5. Members of crews [of civil ships and aircraft], who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.\n\n:6. Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.\n\nB.

The critical distinction is that a \"lawful combatant\" (defined above) cannot be held personally responsible for violations of civilian laws that are permissible under the laws and customs of war; and if captured, a lawful combatant must be treated as a prisoner of war by the enemy under the conditions laid down in the Third Geneva Convention.\n\nIf there is any doubt about whether a detained alleged combatant is a \"lawful combatant\" then the combatant must be held as a prisoner of war until his or her status has been determined by \"a competent tribunal\".<ref>The ICRC [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Commentary on Article 5] says on the issue of ''competent tribunal'' that \"At Geneva in 1949, it was first proposed that for the sake of precision the term 'responsible authority' should be replaced by 'military tribunal' (11). This amendment was based on the view that decisions which might have the gravest consequences should Hot {{sic}} be left to a single person, who might often be of subordinate rank. The matter should be taken to a court, as persons taking part in the fight without the right to do may be prosecuted for murder or attempted murder, and might even be sentenced to capital punishment (12). This suggestion was not unanimously accepted, however, as it was felt that to bring a person before a military tribunal might have more serious consequences than a decision to deprive him of the benefits afforded by the Convention (13). A further amendment was therefore made to the Stockholm text stipulating that a decision regarding persons whose status was in doubt would be taken by a 'competent tribunal', and not specifically a military tribunal.<br>\nAnother change was made in the text of the paragraph, as drafted at Stockholm, in order to specify that it applies to cases of doubt as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4 (14). The clarification contained in Article 4 should, of course, reduce the number of doubtful cases in any future conflict.<br>\nIt therefore seems to us that this provision should not be interpreted too restrictively; the reference in the Convention to 'a belligerent act' relates to the principle which motivated the person who committed it, and not merely the manner in which the act was committed\".\n* (11) [(2) p.77] See ' Final Record of the Diplomatic Conference\nof Geneva of 1949, ' Vol. II-A, p. 388;\n* (12) [(3) p.77] Ibid., Vol. III, p. 63, No. 95;\n* (13) [(4) p.77] Ibid., Vol. II-B, p. 270;\n* (14) [(5) p.77] Ibid., pp. 270-271;\n</ref> If that tribunal rules that a combatant is an \"unlawful combatant\" then the person's status changes to that of a civilian which may give them some rights under the Fourth Geneva Convention.<ref name=\"bpg\">[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/usa/pow-bck.htm#P56_11515 Background Paper on Geneva Conventions and Persons Held by U.S. Forces] by \"[[Human Rights Watch]] Press\" footnote 1: International Committee of the Red Cross, ''Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (Geneva: 1958), p. 51 (emphasis in original).

Persons protected by the Convention are those who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they are not nationals.\n\nNationals of a State which is not bound by the Convention are not protected by it. Nationals of a neutral State who find themselves in the territory of a belligerent State, and nationals of a co-belligerent State, shall not be regarded as protected persons while the State of which they are nationals has normal diplomatic representation in the State in whose hands they are.}}\n\nIf the individual fulfills the criteria as a protected person, they are entitled to all the protections mentioned in GCIV. In a war zone, a national of a neutral state, with normal diplomatic representation, is not a protected person under GCIV.\n\nIf a combatant does not qualify as a POW, then, if they qualify as a protected person, they receive all the rights which a non-combatant civilian receives under GCIV, but the party to the conflict may invoke Articles of GCIV to curtail those rights. The relevant Articles are 5 and 42.\n\n{{quote|Part I.

In this case, the \"unlawful combatant\" does not have rights under the present Convention as granting them those rights would be prejudicial to the security of the concerned state.

In this, Congress invoked the [[War Powers Resolution]] and stated:\n\n<blockquote>That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.<ref>US Congress' joint resolution of 18 September 2001 [http://news.findlaw.com/wp/docs/terrorism/sjres23.es.html Authorization for Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\")]; public law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224</ref></blockquote>\n\nUsing the authorization granted to him by Congress, on 13 November 2001, [[George W.

The order also specifies that the detainees are to be treated humanely.\n\nThe length of time for which a detention of such individuals can continue before being tried by a military tribunal is not specified in the military order. The military order uses the term \"detainees\" to describe the individuals detained under the military order. The U.S. administration chooses to describe the detainees held under the military order as \"'''illegal enemy combatants'''\".\n\nWith the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], some lawyers in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s Office of Legal Counsel and in the office of [[White House]] counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] advised President Bush that he did not have to comply with the Geneva Conventions in handling detainees in the War on Terrorism.

The foreign detainees are held in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] established for the purpose at the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], [[Cuba]]. Guantanamo was chosen because, although it is under the ''de facto'' control of the United States administration, it is not a [[sovereignty|sovereign territory]] of the United States, and a previous Supreme Court ruling ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]'' in 1950 had ruled that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over enemy aliens held outside the USA.\n\nIn ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that \"the U.S. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cuba's ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas\",<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=03-334 Rasul et al. v. Bush, President of the United States])</ref> and that as the United States had complete jurisdiction, the federal courts have the authority under the federal ''habeas corpus'' statute to decide whether foreign nationals (non-U.S. citizens) held in Guantanamo Bay were rightfully imprisoned. This ruling largely overturned the judicial advantage for the U.S. administration of using the Naval Base that ''Johnson v. Eisentrager'' seemed to have conferred.\n\n==== Legal challenges ====\nThere have been a number of legal challenges made on behalf of the detainees held in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and in other places. These include:\n* On 30 July 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Rasul v. Bush, that it did not have jurisdiction because Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is not a [[United States territory#Dependent areas of the United States|sovereign territory]] of the United States. This decision was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the decision, (along with a related case in March 2003 \u2014 see [[Al-Odah v. United States]]). ''Rasul v. Bush'' was appealed to the United States Supreme Court on 2 September 2003.\n* On 10 November 2003, the United States Supreme Court announced that it would decide on appeals by Afghan war detainees who challenge their continued incarceration at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as being unlawful, (See [[Rasul v. Bush]]).\n* On 10 January 2004, 175 members of both [[United Kingdom Parliament|houses of Parliament in the UK]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae|amici curiae]]'' brief to support the detainees' access to US jurisdiction.\n* On 28 June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Rasul v. Bush'' that detainees in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base could turn to U.S. courts to challenge their confinement, but can also be held without charges or trial.\n* On 7 July 2004, In response to the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon announced that cases would be reviewed by military tribunals, in compliance with Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3867067.stm Q&A: US Supreme Court Guantanamo ruling], BBC 8 July 2004</ref><ref name=DOD-News>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2005/01/sec-050119-dod01.htm DoD News: Combatant Status Review Tribunals Update] No. 057-05, 19 January 2005</ref>\n* On 8 November 2004, a federal court halted the proceeding of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, 34, of Yemen.

On 23 September 2004, the United States Justice Department agreed to release Hamdi to [[Saudi Arabia]], where he is also a citizen, on the condition that he gave up his U.S. citizenship. The deal also bars Hamdi from visiting certain countries and to inform Saudi officials if he plans to leave the kingdom. He was a party to a Supreme Court decision ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' which issued a decision on 28 June 2004, repudiating the U.S. government's unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend the constitutional protections of individual liberty of a U.S. citizen. The Court recognized the power of the government to detain unlawful combatants, but ruled that detainees must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge. Though no single opinion of the Court commanded a majority, eight of the nine justices of the Court agreed that the [[Executive Branch]] does not have the power to hold indefinitely a U.S. citizen without basic due process protections enforceable through judicial review.\n\nOn 8 May 2002, [[Jos\u00e9 Padilla (prisoner)|Jos\u00e9 Padilla]], also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, was arrested by [[FBI]] agents at [[Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare International Airport]] and held as material witness on the warrant issued in [[New York State]] about the 2001 9/11 attacks. On 9 June 2002 President Bush issued an order to Secretary Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an \"enemy combatant\". The order justified the detention by leaning on the AUMF which authorized the President to \"use all necessary force against those nations, organizations, or ''persons''\" and in the opinion of the administration a U.S. citizen can be an enemy combatant (this was decided by the United States Supreme Court in the case of ''Ex parte Quirin'').<ref>[http://www.law.syr.edu/academics/centers/insct/Military%20Force%20-%20Padilla.asp Authorization for Use of Military Force: Padilla v.

The court declared that New York State, where the case was originally filed, was an improper venue and that the case should have been filed in South Carolina, where Padilla was being held.\n* On 28 February 2005, in [[Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]], U.S. District Judge [[Henry Floyd (judge)|Henry Floyd]] ordered the Bush administration to either charge Padilla or release him.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/politics/01terror.html?ex=1111899600&en=4bade73e4d6a651f&ei=5070 Judge Says Terror Suspect Can't Be Held as an Enemy Combatant] The [[New York Times]] 1 March 2005</ref> He relied on the Supreme Court's ruling in the parallel enemy combatant case of Yaser Hamdi (''Hamdi v.

Their ruling, decided 9 September 2005, was that \"the President does possess such authority pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution enacted by Congress in the wake of the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed\".<ref>Jos\u00e9 Padilla Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals 19 July, 9 September 2005</ref>\n* In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (29 June 2006) the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule on the subject of unlawful combatant status but did reaffirm that the U.S. is bound by the Geneva Conventions. Most notably it said that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, regarding the treatment of detainees, applies to all prisoners in the War on Terror.\n\n====Combatant Status Review Tribunal====\n{{wikisource|Combatant Status Review Tribunal (fact sheet of 17 October 2006)}}\n\nFollowing the ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''-ruling (November 2004) the Bush administration has begun using Combatant Status Review Tribunals to determine the status of detainees. By doing so the obligation under Article 5 of the GCIII was to be addressed.\n\nHowever, critics maintain these CSRTs are inadequate to warrant acceptance as \"competent tribunal\". Their principal arguments are:\n* The CSRT conducted rudimentary proceedings\n* The CSRT afforded detainees few basic protections\n* Many detainees lacked counsel\n* The CSRT also informed detainees only of general charges against them, while the details on which the CSRT premised enemy combatant status decisions were classified.\n* Detainees had no right to present witnesses or to cross-examine government witnesses.\nNotable cases pointed to by critics as demonstrating the flawed nature of the procedure include: [[Mustafa Ait Idir]], [[Moazzam Begg]], [[Murat Kurnaz]], [[Feroz Abbasi]], and [[Martin Mubanga]]. A comment by legal experts states:\n\n<blockquote>It appears ... that the procedures of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not qualify as status determination under the Third Geneva Convention. ... The fact that no status determination had taken place according to the Third Geneva Convention was sufficient reason for a judge from the District Court of Columbia dealing with a habeas petition, to stay proceedings before a military commission. Judge Robertson in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld held that the Third Geneva Convention, which he considered selfexecuting, had not been complied with since a Combatant Status Review Tribunal could not be considered a 'competent tribunal' pursuant to article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.<ref>[http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/publish/articles/000003/article.pdf Guant\u00e1namo Bay: A Reflection On The Legal Status And Rights Of \u2018Unlawful Enemy Combatants\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218001849/http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/publish/articles/000003/article.pdf |date=18 February 2006 }} [[PDF]] by Terry Gill and Elies van Sliedregt in the [http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/ Utrecht Law Review] or</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[James Crisfield]], the legal advisor to the Tribunals, offered his legal opinion, that CSRT \"do not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified as a prisoner of war \u2014 only whether the detainee satisfies the definition of 'enemy combatant'\".<ref name=ApCsrt>[http://wid.ap.org/documents/detainees/moazzambegg.pdf Moazzam Begg's dossier (.pdf)] from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, hosted by [[Associated Press]]</ref> Determining whether a captive should be classified as a prisoner of war is the sole purpose of a competent tribunal.\n\nAnalysis of these Tribunals by two lawyers for Guananamo detainees, Professor [[Mark P.

Among its more controversial provisions, the law stipulates that a non United States citizen held as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination may not seek [[habeas corpus]] relief. Such detainees must simply wait until the military convene a detainee status review tribunal (under the procedures described in the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]]).\n\nImmediately after Bush signed the Act into law, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] notified the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] that the Court no longer had jurisdiction over a combined ''habeas'' case that it had been considering since 2004. A notice dated the following day listed 196 other pending habeas cases for which it made the same claim.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/19/AR2006101901692.html?nav=rss_nation/special \"Court Told It Lacks Power in Detainee Cases\", ''Washington Post'']</ref>\n\nOf the first three war crimes cases brought against Guantanamo Bay detainees under the Military Commissions Act, one resulted in a [[plea bargain]] and the two others were dismissed on [[jurisdiction]]al grounds.\n\nOn 4 June 2007, in two separate cases, military tribunals dismissed charges against detainees who had been designated as \"enemy combatants\" but not as \"unlawful enemy combatants\". The first case was that of [[Omar Khadr]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] who had been designated as an \"enemy combatant\" in 2004. Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Peter Brownback]] ruled that the military tribunals, created to deal with \"unlawful enemy combatants\", had no jurisdiction over detainees who had been designated only as \"enemy combatants\".

They have, however, been frequently used at least since the beginning of the last century in legal literature, military manuals and case law. The connotations given to these terms and their consequences for the applicable protection regime are not always very clear.</blockquote>\n\nHuman Rights Watch have pointed out that in a judgement, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia interpreted the International Committee of the Red Cross, ''Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (Geneva: 1958) to mean that:\n\n<blockquote>there is no gap between the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. If an individual is not entitled to the protection of the Third Convention as a prisoner of war ... he or she necessarily falls within the ambit of [the Fourth Convention], provided that its article 4 requirements [defining a protected person] are satisfied.<ref name=\"bpg\" /></blockquote>\n\nThis does not mean that the status of unlawful combatant does not exist because in the opinion of the ICRC \"If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents ...

A lawful combatant is a person who commits belligerent acts, and, when captured, is treated as a POW. An ''unlawful combatant'' is someone who commits belligerent acts but does not qualify for POW status under GCIII Articles 4 and 5.\n\n{{quote|Article 4\n\nA. Prisoners of war, in the sense of the present Convention, are persons belonging to one of the following categories, who have fallen into the power of the enemy:\n\n:1. Members of the [[armed forces]] of a Party to the conflict as well as members of [[militias]] or [[Military volunteer|volunteer corps]] forming part of such armed forces.\n\n:2. Members of other militias and members of other volunteer corps, including those of organized [[resistance movements]], belonging to a Party to the conflict and operating in or outside their own territory, even if this [[Military occupation|territory is occupied]], provided that such militias or volunteer corps, including such organized resistance movements, fulfill the following conditions:\n\n::(a) That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;\n::(b) That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;\n::(c) That of carrying arms openly;\n::(d) That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.\n\n:3. Members of regular armed forces who profess allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power.\n\n:4. Persons who accompany the armed forces without actually being members thereof, such as civilian members of [[military aircraft]] crews, [[war correspondent]]s, supply contractors, members of labour units or of services responsible for the welfare of the armed forces, provided that they have received authorization from the armed forces which they accompany, who shall provide them for that purpose with an identity card similar to the annexed model.\n\n:5. Members of crews [of civil ships and aircraft], who do not benefit by more favourable treatment under any other provisions of international law.\n\n:6. Inhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units, provided they carry arms openly and respect the laws and customs of war.\n\nB. The following shall likewise be treated as prisoners of war under the present Convention:\n\n:1. Persons belonging, or having belonged, to the armed forces of the occupied country ...\n\n: ...\n\nArticle 5\n\n: ...\n\n:Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.\n}}\n\nThese terms thus divide combatants in a war zone into two classes: those in armies and organised militias and the like ('''lawful combatants'''), and those who are not. The critical distinction is that a \"lawful combatant\" (defined above) cannot be held personally responsible for violations of civilian laws that are permissible under the laws and customs of war; and if captured, a lawful combatant must be treated as a prisoner of war by the enemy under the conditions laid down in the Third Geneva Convention.\n\nIf there is any doubt about whether a detained alleged combatant is a \"lawful combatant\" then the combatant must be held as a prisoner of war until his or her status has been determined by \"a competent tribunal\".<ref>The ICRC [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Commentary on Article 5] says on the issue of ''competent tribunal'' that \"At Geneva in 1949, it was first proposed that for the sake of precision the term 'responsible authority' should be replaced by 'military tribunal' (11). This amendment was based on the view that decisions which might have the gravest consequences should Hot {{sic}} be left to a single person, who might often be of subordinate rank. The matter should be taken to a court, as persons taking part in the fight without the right to do may be prosecuted for murder or attempted murder, and might even be sentenced to capital punishment (12). This suggestion was not unanimously accepted, however, as it was felt that to bring a person before a military tribunal might have more serious consequences than a decision to deprive him of the benefits afforded by the Convention (13). A further amendment was therefore made to the Stockholm text stipulating that a decision regarding persons whose status was in doubt would be taken by a 'competent tribunal', and not specifically a military tribunal.<br>\nAnother change was made in the text of the paragraph, as drafted at Stockholm, in order to specify that it applies to cases of doubt as to whether persons having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4 (14). The clarification contained in Article 4 should, of course, reduce the number of doubtful cases in any future conflict.<br>\nIt therefore seems to us that this provision should not be interpreted too restrictively; the reference in the Convention to 'a belligerent act' relates to the principle which motivated the person who committed it, and not merely the manner in which the act was committed\".\n* (11) [(2) p.77] See ' Final Record of the Diplomatic Conference\nof Geneva of 1949, ' Vol. II-A, p. 388;\n* (12) [(3) p.77] Ibid., Vol. III, p. 63, No. 95;\n* (13) [(4) p.77] Ibid., Vol. II-B, p. 270;\n* (14) [(5) p.77] Ibid., pp. 270-271;\n</ref> If that tribunal rules that a combatant is an \"unlawful combatant\" then the person's status changes to that of a civilian which may give them some rights under the Fourth Geneva Convention.<ref name=\"bpg\">[http://hrw.org/backgrounder/usa/pow-bck.htm#P56_11515 Background Paper on Geneva Conventions and Persons Held by U.S. Forces] by \"[[Human Rights Watch]] Press\" footnote 1: International Committee of the Red Cross, ''Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (Geneva: 1958), p. 51 (emphasis in original). The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, charged with prosecuting war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the recent conflicts in the Balkans, has explicitly affirmed this principle in a 1998 judgment, stating that \"there is no gap between the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions.

In a war zone, a national of a neutral state, with normal diplomatic representation, is not a protected person under GCIV.\n\nIf a combatant does not qualify as a POW, then, if they qualify as a protected person, they receive all the rights which a non-combatant civilian receives under GCIV, but the party to the conflict may invoke Articles of GCIV to curtail those rights. The relevant Articles are 5 and 42.\n\n{{quote|Part I.

In this case, the \"unlawful combatant\" does not have rights under the present Convention as granting them those rights would be prejudicial to the security of the concerned state.

In this, Congress invoked the [[War Powers Resolution]] and stated:\n\n<blockquote>That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.<ref>US Congress' joint resolution of 18 September 2001 [http://news.findlaw.com/wp/docs/terrorism/sjres23.es.html Authorization for Use of Military Force (\"AUMF\")]; public law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224</ref></blockquote>\n\nUsing the authorization granted to him by Congress, on 13 November 2001, [[George W.

The order also specifies that the detainees are to be treated humanely.\n\nThe length of time for which a detention of such individuals can continue before being tried by a military tribunal is not specified in the military order. The military order uses the term \"detainees\" to describe the individuals detained under the military order. The U.S. administration chooses to describe the detainees held under the military order as \"'''illegal enemy combatants'''\".\n\nWith the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], some lawyers in the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s Office of Legal Counsel and in the office of [[White House]] counsel [[Alberto Gonzales]] advised President Bush that he did not have to comply with the Geneva Conventions in handling detainees in the War on Terrorism.

The foreign detainees are held in the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] established for the purpose at the [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], [[Cuba]]. Guantanamo was chosen because, although it is under the ''de facto'' control of the United States administration, it is not a [[sovereignty|sovereign territory]] of the United States, and a previous Supreme Court ruling ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]'' in 1950 had ruled that U.S. courts had no jurisdiction over enemy aliens held outside the USA.\n\nIn ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that \"the U.S. Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, Naval Base, which the United States occupies under a lease and treaty recognizing Cuba's ultimate sovereignty, but giving this country complete jurisdiction and control for so long as it does not abandon the leased areas\",<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=000&invol=03-334 Rasul et al. v. Bush, President of the United States])</ref> and that as the United States had complete jurisdiction, the federal courts have the authority under the federal ''habeas corpus'' statute to decide whether foreign nationals (non-U.S. citizens) held in Guantanamo Bay were rightfully imprisoned. This ruling largely overturned the judicial advantage for the U.S. administration of using the Naval Base that ''Johnson v. Eisentrager'' seemed to have conferred.\n\n==== Legal challenges ====\nThere have been a number of legal challenges made on behalf of the detainees held in Guantanamo Bay detention camp and in other places. These include:\n* On 30 July 2002, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in Rasul v. Bush, that it did not have jurisdiction because Guantanamo Bay Naval Base is not a [[United States territory#Dependent areas of the United States|sovereign territory]] of the United States. This decision was appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the decision, (along with a related case in March 2003 \u2014 see [[Al-Odah v. United States]]). ''Rasul v. Bush'' was appealed to the United States Supreme Court on 2 September 2003.\n* On 10 November 2003, the United States Supreme Court announced that it would decide on appeals by Afghan war detainees who challenge their continued incarceration at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base as being unlawful, (See [[Rasul v. Bush]]).\n* On 10 January 2004, 175 members of both [[United Kingdom Parliament|houses of Parliament in the UK]] filed an ''[[amicus curiae|amici curiae]]'' brief to support the detainees' access to US jurisdiction.\n* On 28 June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Rasul v. Bush'' that detainees in Guantanamo Bay Naval Base could turn to U.S. courts to challenge their confinement, but can also be held without charges or trial.\n* On 7 July 2004, In response to the Supreme Court ruling, the Pentagon announced that cases would be reviewed by military tribunals, in compliance with Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3867067.stm Q&A: US Supreme Court Guantanamo ruling], BBC 8 July 2004</ref><ref name=DOD-News>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/library/news/2005/01/sec-050119-dod01.htm DoD News: Combatant Status Review Tribunals Update] No. 057-05, 19 January 2005</ref>\n* On 8 November 2004, a federal court halted the proceeding of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, 34, of Yemen.

On 23 September 2004, the United States Justice Department agreed to release Hamdi to [[Saudi Arabia]], where he is also a citizen, on the condition that he gave up his U.S. citizenship. The deal also bars Hamdi from visiting certain countries and to inform Saudi officials if he plans to leave the kingdom. He was a party to a Supreme Court decision ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' which issued a decision on 28 June 2004, repudiating the U.S. government's unilateral assertion of executive authority to suspend the constitutional protections of individual liberty of a U.S. citizen. The Court recognized the power of the government to detain unlawful combatants, but ruled that detainees must have the ability to challenge their detention before an impartial judge. Though no single opinion of the Court commanded a majority, eight of the nine justices of the Court agreed that the [[Executive Branch]] does not have the power to hold indefinitely a U.S. citizen without basic due process protections enforceable through judicial review.\n\nOn 8 May 2002, [[Jos\u00e9 Padilla (prisoner)|Jos\u00e9 Padilla]], also known as Abdullah al-Muhajir, was arrested by [[FBI]] agents at [[Chicago]]'s [[O'Hare International Airport]] and held as material witness on the warrant issued in [[New York State]] about the 2001 9/11 attacks. On 9 June 2002 President Bush issued an order to Secretary Rumsfeld to detain Padilla as an \"enemy combatant\". The order justified the detention by leaning on the AUMF which authorized the President to \"use all necessary force against those nations, organizations, or ''persons''\" and in the opinion of the administration a U.S. citizen can be an enemy combatant (this was decided by the United States Supreme Court in the case of ''Ex parte Quirin'').<ref>[http://www.law.syr.edu/academics/centers/insct/Military%20Force%20-%20Padilla.asp Authorization for Use of Military Force: Padilla v.

The court declared that New York State, where the case was originally filed, was an improper venue and that the case should have been filed in South Carolina, where Padilla was being held.\n* On 28 February 2005, in [[Spartanburg]], [[South Carolina]], U.S. District Judge [[Henry Floyd (judge)|Henry Floyd]] ordered the Bush administration to either charge Padilla or release him.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/01/politics/01terror.html?ex=1111899600&en=4bade73e4d6a651f&ei=5070 Judge Says Terror Suspect Can't Be Held as an Enemy Combatant] The [[New York Times]] 1 March 2005</ref> He relied on the Supreme Court's ruling in the parallel enemy combatant case of Yaser Hamdi (''Hamdi v.

Their ruling, decided 9 September 2005, was that \"the President does possess such authority pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force Joint Resolution enacted by Congress in the wake of the attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is reversed\".<ref>Jos\u00e9 Padilla Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals 19 July, 9 September 2005</ref>\n* In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (29 June 2006) the U.S. Supreme Court did not rule on the subject of unlawful combatant status but did reaffirm that the U.S. is bound by the Geneva Conventions. Most notably it said that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, regarding the treatment of detainees, applies to all prisoners in the War on Terror.\n\n====Combatant Status Review Tribunal====\n{{wikisource|Combatant Status Review Tribunal (fact sheet of 17 October 2006)}}\n\nFollowing the ''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''-ruling (November 2004) the Bush administration has begun using Combatant Status Review Tribunals to determine the status of detainees. By doing so the obligation under Article 5 of the GCIII was to be addressed.\n\nHowever, critics maintain these CSRTs are inadequate to warrant acceptance as \"competent tribunal\". Their principal arguments are:\n* The CSRT conducted rudimentary proceedings\n* The CSRT afforded detainees few basic protections\n* Many detainees lacked counsel\n* The CSRT also informed detainees only of general charges against them, while the details on which the CSRT premised enemy combatant status decisions were classified.\n* Detainees had no right to present witnesses or to cross-examine government witnesses.\nNotable cases pointed to by critics as demonstrating the flawed nature of the procedure include: [[Mustafa Ait Idir]], [[Moazzam Begg]], [[Murat Kurnaz]], [[Feroz Abbasi]], and [[Martin Mubanga]]. A comment by legal experts states:\n\n<blockquote>It appears ... that the procedures of the Combatant Status Review Tribunals do not qualify as status determination under the Third Geneva Convention. ... The fact that no status determination had taken place according to the Third Geneva Convention was sufficient reason for a judge from the District Court of Columbia dealing with a habeas petition, to stay proceedings before a military commission. Judge Robertson in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld held that the Third Geneva Convention, which he considered selfexecuting, had not been complied with since a Combatant Status Review Tribunal could not be considered a 'competent tribunal' pursuant to article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention.<ref>[http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/publish/articles/000003/article.pdf Guant\u00e1namo Bay: A Reflection On The Legal Status And Rights Of \u2018Unlawful Enemy Combatants\u2019] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218001849/http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/publish/articles/000003/article.pdf |date=18 February 2006 }} [[PDF]] by Terry Gill and Elies van Sliedregt in the [http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/ Utrecht Law Review] or</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[James Crisfield]], the legal advisor to the Tribunals, offered his legal opinion, that CSRT \"do not have the discretion to determine that a detainee should be classified as a prisoner of war \u2014 only whether the detainee satisfies the definition of 'enemy combatant'\".<ref name=ApCsrt>[http://wid.ap.org/documents/detainees/moazzambegg.pdf Moazzam Begg's dossier (.pdf)] from his Combatant Status Review Tribunal, hosted by [[Associated Press]]</ref> Determining whether a captive should be classified as a prisoner of war is the sole purpose of a competent tribunal.\n\nAnalysis of these Tribunals by two lawyers for Guananamo detainees, Professor [[Mark P.

Among its more controversial provisions, the law stipulates that a non United States citizen held as an enemy combatant or is awaiting such determination may not seek [[habeas corpus]] relief. Such detainees must simply wait until the military convene a detainee status review tribunal (under the procedures described in the [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]]).\n\nImmediately after Bush signed the Act into law, the [[U.S. Justice Department]] notified the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia]] that the Court no longer had jurisdiction over a combined ''habeas'' case that it had been considering since 2004.

The first case was that of [[Omar Khadr]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] who had been designated as an \"enemy combatant\" in 2004. Khadr was accused of throwing a grenade during a firefight in Afghanistan in 2002. [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Peter Brownback]] ruled that the military tribunals, created to deal with \"unlawful enemy combatants\", had no jurisdiction over detainees who had been designated only as \"enemy combatants\".

They have, however, been frequently used at least since the beginning of the last century in legal literature, military manuals and case law. The connotations given to these terms and their consequences for the applicable protection regime are not always very clear.</blockquote>\n\nHuman Rights Watch have pointed out that in a judgement, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia interpreted the International Committee of the Red Cross, ''Commentary: IV Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (Geneva: 1958) to mean that:\n\n<blockquote>there is no gap between the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions. If an individual is not entitled to the protection of the Third Convention as a prisoner of war ... he or she necessarily falls within the ambit of [the Fourth Convention], provided that its article 4 requirements [defining a protected person] are satisfied.<ref name=\"bpg\" /></blockquote>\n\nThis does not mean that the status of unlawful combatant does not exist because in the opinion of the ICRC \"If civilians directly engage in hostilities, they are considered 'unlawful' or 'unprivileged' combatants or belligerents ...

When the area that is now Nottingham was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon]] chieftain \"Snot\", he named the [[Human settlement|settlement]] \"Snottingham\" (the homestead of Snot's people, where ''inga'' = the people of; ''ham'' = homestead),<ref>{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|date=20 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960908-6|page=350|author=David Mills}}</ref> and the area east of the city, also settled by Saxons, was called \"Snottington\" (the suffix ''ton'' = farmstead settlement).<ref name=\"woodwork\">{{cite web|title=Ancient woodwork in Sneinton parish church|url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/whatnall1928/sneinton_church.htm|publisher=Nottinghamshire History|accessdate=11 March 2014|author=Percy Whatnall|year=1928}}</ref> Sneinton is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]], where is referred to as \"Notintone\", which represents the [[Normans|Norman]] pronunciation of an Anglo-Saxon placename, with the \"Sn\" dropped in favour of \"N\", which was easier to say in the [[Norman language]].<ref name=\"sneinton1\">{{cite web|title=Sneinton then and now: Name|url=http://www.nottshistory.org.uk/articles/mellorsarticles/sneinton1.htm|accessdate=8 March 2014|author=Robert Mellors|publisher=Nottinghamshire History|year=1914}}</ref> The Norman pronunciation of \"Nottingham\" stuck, whereas their pronunciation of \"Notintone\" did not.<ref name=\"woodwork\" /> In the years between 1086 and 1599, \"Sneinton\" [[language change|became]] the agreed way of spelling the village name.<ref name=\"sneinton1\" />\n\n=== Industrial era ===\n\nUntil the 19th century Sneinton was no more than a [[village]], standing on a high [[ridge]] about a mile east of Nottingham town centre overlooking the [[valley]] of the [[River Trent]]. The village was to change dramatically when the principal [[landowner]] of the time, the [[Charles Pierrepont, 1st Earl Manvers|First Earl Manvers]], sold off the land between Nottingham and Sneinton to developers. Housing was built on the land in which Nottingham's factory workers lived. [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building regulations]] at that time where somewhat lax, and so the new landscape was to become a [[slum]].

Workshops organised by The Festival Group take place in the run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to be creative around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of [[arts]]-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a [[parade]] held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment.\n\n== Sites of interest ==\n[[File:Green's windmill.jpg|left|thumb|Green's Mill was built in Sneinton in 1807, damaged by fire in 1947, and restored in the 1980s as a tourist attraction]]\nThere are several [[Urban park|park]]s and [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]s within Sneinton, such as Belvoir Park and the Dale Allotments, but by far the largest [[urban open space|green space]] is Colwick Woods. Colwick Woods lies to the east of Sneinton, and, at 50 hectares or 123 acres, is almost as large as Sneinton itself. It is a mixture of [[grassland]] and [[ancient woodland]], and forms a [[Local Nature Reserve]] and a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref name=\"friends\">{{cite web|title=Friends of Colwick Woods: About|url=http://www.friendsofcolwickwoods.co.uk/about.html|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>  The ancient woodland is a habitat for [[indicator species]] such as dogs mercury and [[ramsons]]. The site is rich in mammal species including both species of [[pipistrelle]] and [[noctule bat]].<ref name=\"friends\" /> [[Right of way (public throughway)|Public rights of way]] are marked out across the site, along with [[desire path]]s that run throughout the woods. The woods and meadows, unusually close to a city centre, are very popular with local people for [[outdoor activities]] including walking, mountain biking, and other activities.\n\nSteep hills are a characteristic feature of most of the site, and [[wheelchair access]] is only from Greenwood Road into the open grassland. Greenwood Dale High School shares a boundary with the reserve and educational events have been held in partnership with the school including photographic scavenger hunts and sapling collection. Open days are held in the summer allowing the public to be actively involved with the reserve. Colwick Woods has an active Friends Group who meet regularly to discuss the condition of the site and carry out [[wildlife conservation]] activities in the woods.<ref name=\"friends\" />\n\n[[Green's Mill, Sneinton|Green's Mill]] is a restored and working 19th century [[tower mill|tower windmill]], located at the top of Belvoir Hill, overlooking the city of Nottingham. Built in the early 1800s for the [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] of [[wheat]] into [[flour]], it remained in use until the 1860s. It was renovated in the 1980s and is now part of a science centre, which together have become a local [[tourist attraction]].\n\n[[File:Sneinton Dragon.jpg|thumb|upright|The Sneinton Dragon]]\nThe Sneinton Dragon is a large [[sculpture]] that stands at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage.

The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the [[Christmas]] period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There are also three other [[List of public art in Nottingham#Sneinton|sculptures in Sneinton]].\n\n==Transport==\nThe main [[High Street]] through the village is Sneinton Dale. Many of the residential streets in Sneinton are named after battles and generals of the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Amos|first=Denise|title=The Boer War|url=http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/events/boerwar/boerwarstructural.htm|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref> Sneinton is bounded to the north by the B686 (Carlton Road), and to the west and south by the [[A612 road]] (Manvers Street and Colwick Loop Road) which runs from Nottingham to [[Newark-on-Trent]]. [[Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway|The railway]] to [[Netherfield, Nottinghamshire|Netherfield]] and [[Grantham]] runs through Sneinton but it has not had a station since [[Nottingham Racecourse railway station|the Racecourse station]] shut in 1959. The [[Nottingham Suburban Railway]] connected Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with [[Daybrook]], but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1954. [[Tram]]lines once ran down Carlton Road.\n\n'''Buses'''\n* 43: Nottingham - Sneinton Dale - Bakersfield\n* 44: Nottingham - Sneinton - Colwick - Netherfield - Gedling\n\n== Education ==\nSneinton has six [[primary school]] providers, William Booth Primary School, Edale Rise Primary and Nursery School, Sneinton St Stephen's CofE Primary School, Windmill L.E.A.D. Academy, the Iona School, and [[The Nottingham Academy]] (operating from the former Jesse Boot Primary School). Nottingham Academy also runs the only [[secondary school]] in the area, on the sites of the former Greenwood Dale and Elliot Durham Schools.

Sneinton  now lies within the [[unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] of Nottingham, having been part of Nottinghamshire until 1877.\n\nSneinton has existed as a village since at least 1086, but remained relatively unchanged up until the [[industrial era]], when the population dramatically expanded. Further [[social change]] in the [[post-war period]] left Sneinton with a [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] character.

The village was to change dramatically when the principal [[landowner]] of the time, the [[Charles Pierrepont, 1st Earl Manvers|First Earl Manvers]], sold off the land between Nottingham and Sneinton to developers. Housing was built on the land in which Nottingham's factory workers lived. [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building regulations]] at that time where somewhat lax, and so the new landscape was to become a [[slum]].

This [[urban regeneration]] project has been called \"Nottingham Eastside\" by developers, but the start date has been pushed back numerous times, due to a lack of funding amidst the [[Great Recession]]. The Eastside development ties in with [[Nottingham City Council]]'s ambitions to develop the south eastern part of the city centre into a \"Creative Quarter\". The area includes the Lace Market, Hockley, Broadmarsh East, the Eastside Island site and BioCity, the project aims at creating growth and jobs. In July 2012, the government contributed \u00a325 million towards a \u00a345 million [[venture capital]] fund, mainly targeted at the Creative Quarter.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18721971| title=Nottingham plans creative hub with 'City Deal' cash| date=5 July 2012| work=BBC| accessdate=28 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:Live band in the Hermitage Square 2007.jpg|thumb|A live band plays in the Hermitage Square in 2007]]\nThe art gallery [[Trade (gallery)|Trade]] is one of a number of projects at One Thoresby St, listed as one of \"the world's best secret art galleries\" by Alexander Farquharson of [[Nottingham Contemporary]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/the-worlds-best-secret-art-galleries-2365943.html | title=The world's best secret art galleries  | newspaper=[[The Independent]] | date=8 October 2011}}</ref> Sneinton Dale was previously the site of an [[art deco]] [[movie theater|film house]] called Dale Cinema, which operated from 1932 to 1957.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Film-lovers-choice-50-cinemas-screen-industry/story-21293175-detail/story.html |title=Film lovers in Nottingham had choice of 50 cinemas during screen industry heyday |date=26 June 2014 |publisher=Nottingham Post |accessdate=23 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129090806/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Film-lovers-choice-50-cinemas-screen-industry/story-21293175-detail/story.html |archive-date=29 November 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are around a dozen [[pub|public houses]] in Sneinton, the oldest of which is The Lord Nelson, sited in a 500-year-old building which was originally a coaching inn called The Hornbuckles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trailsofalesandtales.blogspot.co.uk/2013/07/a-survey-of-sneinton.html |title=A Survey of Sneinton |date=12 July 2013 |author=Aaron Bulley |publisher=Trails of Ales & Tales |accessdate=23 November 2014 }}</ref> The studios of regional [[radio station]] [[Gem 106]] are nearby on the City Link.\n\n=== Festival ===\n{{main|Sneinton Festival}}\nEvery July, Sneinton [[Sneinton Festival|holds a festival]] organised around a different theme. The first festival was held in 1995, and is run by a [[Volunteering|volunteer]] group made up of local residents, representatives of local organisations, [[community group]]s, schools, church, youth and play groups, artists, musicians, performers and local project workers. Since 2002, the group has been supported and coordinated by the Sneinton Community Project.\n\nThe Sneinton Festival has three elements: initial [[workshop]]s, a week-long [[festival]], and the final [[carnival]]. Workshops organised by The Festival Group take place in the run-up to the festival, and bring young people together to be creative around the year's theme, building the artwork, decorations and costumes, as well as holding dance and performance workshops. The Festival Week begins on a Saturday, and involves seven days of [[arts]]-based free and open events held in and around Sneinton. Festival Week culminates in a [[parade]] held on Carnival Day, on the next Saturday. The Carnival Parade includes floats, fancy dress, costumes, samba bands, jazz bands, youth bands, dancers, and a variety of other event performers. The festival then continues in the Hermitage Square when the parade arrives, and features an afternoon of free and diverse entertainment.\n\n== Sites of interest ==\n[[File:Green's windmill.jpg|left|thumb|Green's Mill was built in Sneinton in 1807, damaged by fire in 1947, and restored in the 1980s as a tourist attraction]]\nThere are several [[Urban park|park]]s and [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]s within Sneinton, such as Belvoir Park and the Dale Allotments, but by far the largest [[urban open space|green space]] is Colwick Woods. Colwick Woods lies to the east of Sneinton, and, at 50 hectares or 123 acres, is almost as large as Sneinton itself. It is a mixture of [[grassland]] and [[ancient woodland]], and forms a [[Local Nature Reserve]] and a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].<ref name=\"friends\">{{cite web|title=Friends of Colwick Woods: About|url=http://www.friendsofcolwickwoods.co.uk/about.html|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>  The ancient woodland is a habitat for [[indicator species]] such as dogs mercury and [[ramsons]]. The site is rich in mammal species including both species of [[pipistrelle]] and [[noctule bat]].<ref name=\"friends\" /> [[Right of way (public throughway)|Public rights of way]] are marked out across the site, along with [[desire path]]s that run throughout the woods. The woods and meadows, unusually close to a city centre, are very popular with local people for [[outdoor activities]] including walking, mountain biking, and other activities.\n\nSteep hills are a characteristic feature of most of the site, and [[wheelchair access]] is only from Greenwood Road into the open grassland. Greenwood Dale High School shares a boundary with the reserve and educational events have been held in partnership with the school including photographic scavenger hunts and sapling collection. Open days are held in the summer allowing the public to be actively involved with the reserve. Colwick Woods has an active Friends Group who meet regularly to discuss the condition of the site and carry out [[wildlife conservation]] activities in the woods.<ref name=\"friends\" />\n\n[[Green's Mill, Sneinton|Green's Mill]] is a restored and working 19th century [[tower mill|tower windmill]], located at the top of Belvoir Hill, overlooking the city of Nottingham. Built in the early 1800s for the [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] of [[wheat]] into [[flour]], it remained in use until the 1860s. It was renovated in the 1980s and is now part of a science centre, which together have become a local [[tourist attraction]].\n\n[[File:Sneinton Dragon.jpg|thumb|upright|The Sneinton Dragon]]\nThe Sneinton Dragon is a large [[sculpture]] that stands at the junction of Colwick Loop Road and Sneinton Hermitage. Made from [[stainless steel]], it was created by local craftsman Robert Stubley after residents of Sneinton were asked by the Renewal Trust what they would like to see as a piece of public art to represent their area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dragon discovered in Sneinton|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/11/357181.html|publisher=UK Indymedia|accessdate=8 March 2014|author=Alan Lodge|date=28 November 2006}}</ref> It was commissioned by Nottingham City Council and was unveiled on 21 November 2006. The dragon stands 7 feet tall, has a wingspan of 15 feet and took 3 months to finish. During the [[Christmas]] period the dragon receives a Santa hat, which often disappears within days. There are also three other [[List of public art in Nottingham#Sneinton|sculptures in Sneinton]].\n\n==Transport==\nThe main [[High Street]] through the village is Sneinton Dale. Many of the residential streets in Sneinton are named after battles and generals of the [[Second Boer War]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Amos|first=Denise|title=The Boer War|url=http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/events/boerwar/boerwarstructural.htm|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref> Sneinton is bounded to the north by the B686 (Carlton Road), and to the west and south by the [[A612 road]] (Manvers Street and Colwick Loop Road) which runs from Nottingham to [[Newark-on-Trent]]. [[Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway|The railway]] to [[Netherfield, Nottinghamshire|Netherfield]] and [[Grantham]] runs through Sneinton but it has not had a station since [[Nottingham Racecourse railway station|the Racecourse station]] shut in 1959. The [[Nottingham Suburban Railway]] connected Trent Lane junction in Sneinton with [[Daybrook]], but bomb damage closed the Sneinton end in 1941 and the line ceased operations completely in 1954. [[Tram]]lines once ran down Carlton Road.\n\n'''Buses'''\n* 43: Nottingham - Sneinton Dale - Bakersfield\n* 44: Nottingham - Sneinton - Colwick - Netherfield - Gedling\n\n== Education ==\nSneinton has six [[primary school]] providers, William Booth Primary School, Edale Rise Primary and Nursery School, Sneinton St Stephen's CofE Primary School, Windmill L.E.A.D. Academy, the Iona School, and [[The Nottingham Academy]] (operating from the former Jesse Boot Primary School). Nottingham Academy also runs the only [[secondary school]] in the area, on the sites of the former Greenwood Dale and Elliot Durham Schools. Sneinton has a [[public library]], which can be found on Sneinton Dale (at the former Sneinton Police Station site).\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:St_Stephens_Church,_Sneinton_-_geograph.org.uk_-_318414.jpg|thumb|[[St. Stephen's Church, Sneinton|St. Stephen's Church]], the parish church of Sneinton]]\n{{bar box\n|title=Religion in Sneinton (Ward 2011)<ref name=\"religion\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nottinghaminsight.org.uk/d/183148|title= Dales Nottingham 2011 Census Data|accessdate=9 April 2018|publisher=Nottingham City Council}}</ref>\n|titlebar=\n|left1=religion\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Christianity]]|Red|41.3}}\n{{bar percent|[[Buddhism]]|Yellow|0.4}}\n{{bar percent|[[Hinduism]]|Orange|0.8}}\n{{bar percent|[[Judaism]]|Blue|0.1}}\n{{bar percent|[[Islam]]|Green|19.9}}\n{{bar percent|[[Sikhism]]|Magenta|0.5}}\n{{bar percent|Others|Gray|0.5}}\n{{bar percent|[[Irreligion|No Religion]]|Black|29.3}}\n{{bar percent|Unknown / None|Brown|7.3}}\n}}\nThe religious life of Sneinton reflects the diversity of its inhabitants.

It was written entirely in [[C++]] and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently. Many applications were pre-installed in the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] of the Newton (making for quick start-up) and to save on [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and [[flash memory]] storage for user applications.\n\nIts use of ParaGraph's [[handwriting recognition]] engine has been noted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as a pioneering implementation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\n==Features==\nNewton OS features many interface elements that the [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh system software]] didn't have at the time, such as drawers and the \"poof\" animation. An animation similar to this is found in [[Mac OS X]], and parts of the Newton's handwriting recognition system have been implemented as [[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]] in Mac OS X.\n\n*Sound responsive \u2014 Clicking menus and icons makes a sound; this feature was later introduced in [[Mac OS 8]].\n*Icons - Similar to the Macintosh Desktop metaphor, Newton OS uses icons to open applications.\n*Tabbed documents \u2014 Similar to [[tab (GUI)|tabbed browsing]] in today's browsers and Apple's [[At Ease]] interface, documents titles appear in a small tab at the top right hand of the screen.\n*Screen rotation \u2014 In Newton 2.0, the screen can be rotated to be used for drawing or word processing.\n*File documents \u2014 Notes and Drawings can be categorized. E.g. Fun, Business, Personal, etc.\n*Print documents \u2014 Documents on the Newton can be printed.\n*Send documents \u2014 Documents can be sent to another Newton via Infrared technology or sent using the Internet by E-Mail, or faxed.\n*Menus \u2014 Similar to menus seen in Mac OS, but menu titles are instead presented at the bottom of the screen in small rectangles, making them similar to buttons with attached \"pop-up\" menus.\n\nMany features of the Newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of [[Pen computing]].<ref>[http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/penhist.html Notes on the (relatively unknown) History of Pen-based Computing]</ref><ref>[http://user.erols.com/rwservices/biblio.html Annotated Bibliography in Pen Computing]</ref><ref>{{YouTube|4xnqKdWMa_8|Notes on the History of Pen-based Computing}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\nShortly after the [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]]'s release in 1993, developers were not paying much attention to the new Newton OS API and were still more interested in developing for the Macintosh and Windows platforms. It was not until two years later that developers saw a potential market available to them in creating software for Newton OS. Several programs were made by third-party developers, including software to enhance the disappointing  hand writing recognition technology of Newton OS 1.x.\n\n'''The basic software that came with Newton OS:'''\n\n*'''Works''' \u2014 A program for drawing and word processing, with typical capabilities such as: rulers, margins, page breaks, formatting, printing, spell checking and find & replace tools.\n*'''[[Apple Newton#Notes|Notes]]''' \u2014 Used for checklists, as well as both drawing and writing in the same program either with a newton keyboard or a stylus pen.\n*'''[[Apple Newton#Dates|Dates]]''' \u2014 Calendar program where you can schedule appointments and other special events.\n*'''[[Apple Newton#Names|Names]]''' \u2014 Program for storing extensive contacts information in a flexible format.\n*'''Formulas''' \u2014 Program that offers metric conversions, currency conversions, loan and [[mortgage calculator]]s, etc.\n*'''Calculator''' \u2014 A basic calculator with square root, percentage, MR, M+ and M- functions additional to the basic functions found on a calculator.\n*'''Clock''' \u2014 A small floating window type application, known as a desktop accessory on the Macintosh. The Newton clock also includes features for an alarm, minute timer and the date.\n*'''Book Reader''' \u2014 Support for displaying electronic books is built in.\n\n==Version history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date released\n!OS version\n|-\n|August 3, 1993\n|1.0\n|-\n|October 30, 1993\n|1.1\n|-\n|?\n|1.2\n|-\n|March 4, 1994\n|1.3\n|-\n|March 14, 1996\n|2.0\n|-\n|March 21, 1997\n|2.1\n|}\n\n==Handwriting recognition==\nThe Newton uses the CalliGrapher word-based [[handwriting recognition]] engine developed by [[:ru:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444_(\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f)|ParaGraph International Inc]], led by former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist [[Stepan Pachikov]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/stepan_pachikov.html |title=Stepan Pachikov Wants to Study Your Handwriting |accessdate=February 6, 2009 |last=Calore |first=Michael |date=January 23, 2007 |publisher=WIRED |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222123409/http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/stepan_pachikov.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.msu.edu/~luckie/hallofame.htm|title=Newton Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2009| last=Luckie|first=Douglas}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest versions had weaknesses that resulted in bad publicity and reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technabob.com/blog/2007/07/20/classic-apple-moment-newton-handwriting-recognition/|title=Classic Apple Moment: Newton Handwriting Recognition}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5452193/the-story-behind-apples-newton|title=The Story Behind Apple\u2019s Newton}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023689_2025276_2025278,00.html|title=Five Gadgets Ahead of Their Time Apple Newton | date=October 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/tag/doonesbury/|title=Will the iPhone's Siri have its 'Egg freckles' moment? | work=CNN}}</ref> However, with the release of [[Apple Newton|Newton PDAs]] based upon version 2.0 of the OS, the handwriting recognition substantially improved, partially being a product of ParaGraph and an Apple-created recognizer pair: Apple's Rosetta and Mondello.

Text can also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on-screen pop-up [[QWERTY]] keyboard. With \"Shapes\", Newton can recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle, a line, a [[polygon]], etc., and it cleans them up into \"perfect\" [[Vector graphics|vector]] representations (with modifiable control points and defined [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]) of what the user is attempting to draw. \"Shapes\" and \"Sketches\" can be [[Image scaling|scaled]] or deformed once drawn. \"Ink text\" captures the user's free-hand writing but allows it to be treated somewhat like [[Handwriting recognition|recognized text]] when manipulating for later editing purposes (\"ink text\" supported [[word wrap]], could be formatted to be bold, italic, etc.).<ref>[http://www.pencomputing.com/developer/newton_20.html Pen Computing's First Look at Newton OS 2.0]</ref> At any time a user can also direct the Newton to recognize selected \"ink text\" and turn it into [[Handwriting recognition|recognized text]] (deferred recognition).

It was written entirely in [[C++]] and trimmed to be low power consuming and use the available memory efficiently. Many applications were pre-installed in the [[Read-only memory|ROM]] of the Newton (making for quick start-up) and to save on [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and [[flash memory]] storage for user applications.\n\nIts use of ParaGraph's [[handwriting recognition]] engine has been noted{{by whom|date=November 2017}} as a pioneering implementation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}.\n\n==Features==\nNewton OS features many interface elements that the [[Classic Mac OS|Macintosh system software]] didn't have at the time, such as drawers and the \"poof\" animation. An animation similar to this is found in [[Mac OS X]], and parts of the Newton's handwriting recognition system have been implemented as [[Inkwell (Macintosh)|Inkwell]] in Mac OS X.\n\n*Sound responsive \u2014 Clicking menus and icons makes a sound; this feature was later introduced in [[Mac OS 8]].\n*Icons - Similar to the Macintosh Desktop metaphor, Newton OS uses icons to open applications.\n*Tabbed documents \u2014 Similar to [[tab (GUI)|tabbed browsing]] in today's browsers and Apple's [[At Ease]] interface, documents titles appear in a small tab at the top right hand of the screen.\n*Screen rotation \u2014 In Newton 2.0, the screen can be rotated to be used for drawing or word processing.\n*File documents \u2014 Notes and Drawings can be categorized. E.g. Fun, Business, Personal, etc.\n*Print documents \u2014 Documents on the Newton can be printed.\n*Send documents \u2014 Documents can be sent to another Newton via Infrared technology or sent using the Internet by E-Mail, or faxed.\n*Menus \u2014 Similar to menus seen in Mac OS, but menu titles are instead presented at the bottom of the screen in small rectangles, making them similar to buttons with attached \"pop-up\" menus.\n\nMany features of the Newton are best appreciated in the context of the history of [[Pen computing]].<ref>[http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/penhist.html Notes on the (relatively unknown) History of Pen-based Computing]</ref><ref>[http://user.erols.com/rwservices/biblio.html Annotated Bibliography in Pen Computing]</ref><ref>{{YouTube|4xnqKdWMa_8|Notes on the History of Pen-based Computing}}</ref>\n\n==Software==\nShortly after the [[Apple Newton|Newton PDA]]'s release in 1993, developers were not paying much attention to the new Newton OS API and were still more interested in developing for the Macintosh and Windows platforms. It was not until two years later that developers saw a potential market available to them in creating software for Newton OS. Several programs were made by third-party developers, including software to enhance the disappointing  hand writing recognition technology of Newton OS 1.x.\n\n'''The basic software that came with Newton OS:'''\n\n*'''Works''' \u2014 A program for drawing and word processing, with typical capabilities such as: rulers, margins, page breaks, formatting, printing, spell checking and find & replace tools.\n*'''[[Apple Newton#Notes|Notes]]''' \u2014 Used for checklists, as well as both drawing and writing in the same program either with a newton keyboard or a stylus pen.\n*'''[[Apple Newton#Dates|Dates]]''' \u2014 Calendar program where you can schedule appointments and other special events.\n*'''[[Apple Newton#Names|Names]]''' \u2014 Program for storing extensive contacts information in a flexible format.\n*'''Formulas''' \u2014 Program that offers metric conversions, currency conversions, loan and [[mortgage calculator]]s, etc.\n*'''Calculator''' \u2014 A basic calculator with square root, percentage, MR, M+ and M- functions additional to the basic functions found on a calculator.\n*'''Clock''' \u2014 A small floating window type application, known as a desktop accessory on the Macintosh. The Newton clock also includes features for an alarm, minute timer and the date.\n*'''Book Reader''' \u2014 Support for displaying electronic books is built in.\n\n==Version history==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Date released\n!OS version\n|-\n|August 3, 1993\n|1.0\n|-\n|October 30, 1993\n|1.1\n|-\n|?\n|1.2\n|-\n|March 4, 1994\n|1.3\n|-\n|March 14, 1996\n|2.0\n|-\n|March 21, 1997\n|2.1\n|}\n\n==Handwriting recognition==\nThe Newton uses the CalliGrapher word-based [[handwriting recognition]] engine developed by [[:ru:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444_(\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f)|ParaGraph International Inc]], led by former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] scientist [[Stepan Pachikov]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/stepan_pachikov.html |title=Stepan Pachikov Wants to Study Your Handwriting |accessdate=February 6, 2009 |last=Calore |first=Michael |date=January 23, 2007 |publisher=WIRED |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222123409/http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/01/stepan_pachikov.html |archivedate=December 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.msu.edu/~luckie/hallofame.htm|title=Newton Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 6, 2009| last=Luckie|first=Douglas}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest versions had weaknesses that resulted in bad publicity and reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technabob.com/blog/2007/07/20/classic-apple-moment-newton-handwriting-recognition/|title=Classic Apple Moment: Newton Handwriting Recognition}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/5452193/the-story-behind-apples-newton|title=The Story Behind Apple\u2019s Newton}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023689_2025276_2025278,00.html|title=Five Gadgets Ahead of Their Time Apple Newton | date=October 25, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/tag/doonesbury/|title=Will the iPhone's Siri have its 'Egg freckles' moment? | work=CNN}}</ref> However, with the release of [[Apple Newton|Newton PDAs]] based upon version 2.0 of the OS, the handwriting recognition substantially improved, partially being a product of ParaGraph and an Apple-created recognizer pair: Apple's Rosetta and Mondello.

Text can also be entered by tapping with the stylus on a small on-screen pop-up [[QWERTY]] keyboard. With \"Shapes\", Newton can recognize that the user was attempting to draw a circle, a line, a [[polygon]], etc., and it cleans them up into \"perfect\" [[Vector graphics|vector]] representations (with modifiable control points and defined [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]]) of what the user is attempting to draw. \"Shapes\" and \"Sketches\" can be [[Image scaling|scaled]] or deformed once drawn. \"Ink text\" captures the user's free-hand writing but allows it to be treated somewhat like [[Handwriting recognition|recognized text]] when manipulating for later editing purposes (\"ink text\" supported [[word wrap]], could be formatted to be bold, italic, etc.).<ref>[http://www.pencomputing.com/developer/newton_20.html Pen Computing's First Look at Newton OS 2.0]</ref> At any time a user can also direct the Newton to recognize selected \"ink text\" and turn it into [[Handwriting recognition|recognized text]] (deferred recognition).

It is the first [[sequel]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the second film in the ''[[Psycho (franchise)|Psycho]]'' series. Set 22 years after the first film, it follows [[Norman Bates]] after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him. It is unrelated to the 1982 novel ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]], which he wrote as a sequel to his original novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''.\n\nIn preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a one-time student of Hitchcock, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklins's American feature film debut.<ref name=afi/> Released on June 3, 1983, ''Psycho II'' grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 3, 2018|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho2.htm|title=Psycho II}}</ref> The film was followed by ''[[Psycho III]]'' (1986).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter 22 years in a mental institution, [[Norman Bates]] has been cured of his insanity and accepted that his mother is dead. As such, the court has him released. Marion's sister Lila, who married Marion's lover Sam Loomis, vehemently protests, but her plea is dismissed. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman takes up residence in his old home behind the Bates Motel. He reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, where an old lady named [[Emma Spool]] works. After work, a young waitress at the diner, Mary Samuels, has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, has been using the motel for dealing drugs. He immediately fires Toomey.\n\nNorman's assimilation into society appears to be going well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. During a work shift, a drunk Toomey picks a fight with Norman, and he suspects him of the notes and phone calls. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death as he is packing to leave the motel.\n \nBecoming increasingly sympathetic to and impressed by Norman's fight to keep his sanity, Mary takes up permanent residence in a guest room at his house. While Norman is renovating his motel, he hears voices in the house, and enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Meanwhile, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window to have sex. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts police. Mary finds Norman in the attic and he shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff arrives and questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. After the sheriff leaves, Norman rebukes her for lying. He fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him.\n\nThat evening, Mary and Norman find a bloody rag stuffed in the toilet. Norman is horrified, believing he committed another murder, but Mary insists he is innocent. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, her mother; Lila and Mary have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norma Bates. Mary altered Norman's room and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death.\n\nDr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and tells Norman that Mary and Lila must be the ones harassing him. He also has the corpse of Norma Bates exhumed, to prove Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Norman is only partially convinced, saying the one behind everything must be his \"real mother\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary with what Dr. Raymond told him. She says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse, but Lila will not stop. Later, Norman becomes too terrified to leave his room, saying he saw his real mother in the house. Mary admits to Norman that his sanity is beginning to erode and stays to comfort him.\n\nWhile Lila is retrieving her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the cellar floor, a figure steps out of the shadows and murders her. Meanwhile, the police dredge the swamp and find a car, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. The phone rings, Norman answers, and starts speaking to \"Mother\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with Norman. While Norman debates with \"Mother\" about her command to kill Mary, Mary runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with butcher knife, in an unsuccessful bid to get Norman to \"hang up\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary plunges the butcher knife into his heart. Confronted by the sight of \"Mother\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Mary backs into the fruit cellar and stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. The ensuing investigation is inconclusive, but in light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as Norma Bates, the police deduce Mary most likely committed all the murders.\n\nLater, Emma Spool, the diner co-worker, visits Norman. Spool tells Norman she is his real mother, and that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Spool was institutionalized. She reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. In response, Norman strikes her in the head with a shovel, killing her. He then carries the body upstairs to Mother's room, and begins talking to himself in her voice, signifying that Norman\u2019s \u201cMother\u201d personality has once again taken control of his mind.\n\n[[File:Anthony Perkins (1983).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Anthony Perkins]] in 1983]]\n==Cast==\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]]\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Dr. Bill Raymond\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Mary \"Samuels\" Loomis\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Warren Toomey\n* [[Hugh Gillin]] as Sheriff John Hunt\n* [[Robert Alan Browne]] as Ralph Statler\n* [[Claudia Bryar]] as [[Emma Spool]]\n* Ben Hartigan as Judge\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Myrna\n* Jill Caroll as Kim\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1982, author [[Robert Bloch]] published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films.

It is the first [[sequel]] to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the second film in the ''[[Psycho (franchise)|Psycho]]'' series. Set 22 years after the first film, it follows [[Norman Bates]] after he is released from the mental institution and returns to the house and Bates Motel to continue a normal life. However, his troubled past continues to haunt him. It is unrelated to the 1982 novel ''[[Psycho II (novel)|Psycho II]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]], which he wrote as a sequel to his original novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]''.\n\nIn preparing the film, Universal hired Holland to write an entirely different screenplay, while Australian director Franklin, a one-time student of Hitchcock, was hired to direct. The film marked Franklins's American feature film debut.<ref name=afi/> Released on June 3, 1983, ''Psycho II'' grossed $34.7 million at the box office on a budget of $5 million.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=June 3, 2018|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho2.htm|title=Psycho II}}</ref> The film was followed by ''[[Psycho III]]'' (1986).\n\n==Plot==\nAfter 22 years in a mental institution, [[Norman Bates]] has been cured of his insanity and accepted that his mother is dead. As such, the court has him released. Marion's sister Lila, who married Marion's lover Sam Loomis, vehemently protests, but her plea is dismissed. Against the advice of Dr. Bill Raymond, Norman takes up residence in his old home behind the Bates Motel. He reports to a prearranged job at a nearby diner, where an old lady named [[Emma Spool]] works. After work, a young waitress at the diner, Mary Samuels, has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey, has been using the motel for dealing drugs. He immediately fires Toomey.\n\nNorman's assimilation into society appears to be going well until he begins to receive mysterious phone calls and notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. During a work shift, a drunk Toomey picks a fight with Norman, and he suspects him of the notes and phone calls. Shortly after, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death as he is packing to leave the motel.\n \nBecoming increasingly sympathetic to and impressed by Norman's fight to keep his sanity, Mary takes up permanent residence in a guest room at his house. While Norman is renovating his motel, he hears voices in the house, and enters his mother's bedroom to find it exactly as it was 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Meanwhile, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window to have sex. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts police. Mary finds Norman in the attic and he shows her his mother's bedroom, only to find it back to its state of disuse. The sheriff arrives and questions them about the boy's murder. Mary claims they were out walking together at the time. After the sheriff leaves, Norman rebukes her for lying. He fears he may have killed the boy, since Mary told him the attic was unlocked when she found him.\n\nThat evening, Mary and Norman find a bloody rag stuffed in the toilet. Norman is horrified, believing he committed another murder, but Mary insists he is innocent. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, her mother; Lila and Mary have in fact been making the phone calls and notes, even posing at the window dressed as Norma Bates. Mary altered Norman's room and locked Norman in the attic so she could change it back. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted. However, Mary's growing friendship with Norman has convinced her he is no longer capable of killing. She suspects someone else is in the house, pointing out that Norman was locked in the attic at the time of the boy's death.\n\nDr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and tells Norman that Mary and Lila must be the ones harassing him. He also has the corpse of Norma Bates exhumed, to prove Norman is not being haunted by his mother. Norman is only partially convinced, saying the one behind everything must be his \"real mother\", despite there being no record of him being adopted. Norman confronts Mary with what Dr. Raymond told him. She says that she has given up her part in Lila's ruse, but Lila will not stop. Later, Norman becomes too terrified to leave his room, saying he saw his real mother in the house. Mary admits to Norman that his sanity is beginning to erode and stays to comfort him.\n\nWhile Lila is retrieving her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the cellar floor, a figure steps out of the shadows and murders her. Meanwhile, the police dredge the swamp and find a car, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Mary runs to the house to try to convince Norman to flee. The phone rings, Norman answers, and starts speaking to \"Mother\". Mary listens in; nobody is on the line with Norman. While Norman debates with \"Mother\" about her command to kill Mary, Mary runs into the cellar and dresses up as Mother, complete with butcher knife, in an unsuccessful bid to get Norman to \"hang up\". Dr. Raymond grabs her from behind, thinking he has caught her in the act of trying to drive Norman insane, and in her fright Mary plunges the butcher knife into his heart. Confronted by the sight of \"Mother\" standing over Dr. Raymond's bloody corpse, Norman's sanity snaps and he advances upon Mary, babbling. Mary backs into the fruit cellar and stumbles upon Lila's body, buried in a pile of coal. Assuming Norman is responsible, Mary raises her knife to kill him but is shot dead by the incoming police. The ensuing investigation is inconclusive, but in light of an overheard argument between Mary and Lila, Mary's attempt to kill Norman, and her dressing as Norma Bates, the police deduce Mary most likely committed all the murders.\n\nLater, Emma Spool, the diner co-worker, visits Norman. Spool tells Norman she is his real mother, and that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Spool was institutionalized. She reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. In response, Norman strikes her in the head with a shovel, killing her. He then carries the body upstairs to Mother's room, and begins talking to himself in her voice, signifying that Norman\u2019s \u201cMother\u201d personality has once again taken control of his mind.\n\n[[File:Anthony Perkins (1983).jpg|thumb|150px|[[Anthony Perkins]] in 1983]]\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n* [[Anthony Perkins]] as [[Norman Bates]]\n* [[Vera Miles]] as [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]]\n* [[Robert Loggia]] as Dr. Bill Raymond\n* [[Meg Tilly]] as Mary \"Samuels\" Loomis\n* [[Dennis Franz]] as Warren Toomey\n* [[Hugh Gillin]] as Sheriff John Hunt\n* [[Robert Alan Browne]] as Ralph Statler\n* [[Claudia Bryar]] as [[Emma Spool]]\n* Ben Hartigan as Judge\n* [[Lee Garlington]] as Myrna\n* Jill Caroll as Kim\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1982, author [[Robert Bloch]] published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films.
