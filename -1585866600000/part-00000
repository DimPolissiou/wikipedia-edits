{"title_page": "History of the United States Coast Guard", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\nThe '''history of the [[United States Coast Guard]]''' goes back to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]].  The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. A [[Confederate Revenue-Marine]] was also formed by crewmen who left the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\nAfter the purchase of Alaska in 1867, {{USRC|Lincoln}}, with First Lieutenant George W. Moore aboard was dispatched to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to establish United States sovereignty as agent of the U.S. Collector of Customs in San Francisco.

Captain \"Hell Roaring\" [[Michael A. Healy]], captain of the [[USRC Bear|USRC ''Bear'']], greatly assisted a program that brought [[reindeer]] to Alaska to provide a steady food source for native Eskimos.<ref name=Evans131-133>Evans, pp. 131\u2013133</ref><ref name=Strobridge&Noble50-55>Strobridge and Noble, pp. 50\u201355</ref> During the winter of 1897\u20131898, First Lieutenant [[David H.

Congress awarded the three men [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s for \"heroic service rendered\" on 28 June 1902.<ref name=Evans134-139>Evans, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> During the [[Snake River gold rush]] of 1900, the Revenue Cutter Service returned destitute miners to Seattle from Alaska.\n\n===United States Lifesaving Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service]]\nA number of voluntary organizations had formed in coastal communities in the 1700s and early 1800s to assist shipwrecked mariners by means of small boats at shore-based stations, notably the [[Massachusetts Humane Society]], which was established in 1786.<ref name=Johnson4>Johnson, p. 4</ref> These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast.<ref name=Evans57>Evans, p. 57</ref><ref name=Noble(1994)20>Noble (1994), p. 20</ref> These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers.<ref name=Noble(1994)22>Noble (1994), p. 22</ref>\n\nThis system continued until February 1, 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department by [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[George S. Boutwell]].{{#tag:ref|Kimball preferred to use the term \"Revenue Marine Bureau\" and various references use either Division or Bureau to identify the entity.<ref name=Evans92>Evans, p. 92</ref>|group=Note}}<ref name=Evans91>Evans, p. 91</ref><ref name=Noble(1994)24-25</ref>Noble (1994), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Congress finally formalized the organization of the division on 3 March 1875.<ref name=King9>King, p. 9</ref> Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews.<ref name=Noble(1994)28>Noble (1994), p. 28</ref> Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially organized and Kimball volunteered to lead the service.<ref name=King9 /><ref name=Noble(1994)1>Noble (1994), p. 1</ref> Kimball held the position of superintendent until the merger of the service with the Revenue Cutter Service in 1915.<ref name=King240>King, p. 240</ref>\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe [[United States Coast Guard Academy|School of Instruction]] of the Revenue Cutter Service was established on July 31, 1876 near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used {{USRC|James C. Dobbin|1853|6}} for its training exercises. ''Dobbin'' was replaced in 1878 with {{USRC|Salmon P. Chase|1878|6}}, which was specially designed for the assignment as a training cutter.<ref name=Evans95>Evans, p. 95</ref> The School of Instruction moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut.<ref name=Evans155>Evans, p. 155</ref><ref name=Evans199>Evans, p. 199</ref> The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.<ref name=Evans198>Evans, p. 198</ref>  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began.<ref name=Evans198 /> Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the United States Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Evans199 /> In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref> A fourth year of classes was added in 1932.<ref name=Evans198 />\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n\n=== Preparation ===\nThe Coast Guard's preparations for the coming war actually started before the Declaration of War on 6 April 1917.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8>Larzelere (2003), p. 8</ref> In late 1916, the Interdepartmental Board on Coast Communications recommended that telephone communications be improved and brought to a high state of readiness all along the U.S. coastline to include lighthouses and lifesaving stations as well as other government coastal facilities.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)xvi>Larzelere (2003), p. xvi</ref>  Sensing a need for aviation, the Coast Guard sent Third Lieutenant [[Elmer Stone]] to Naval Flight Training on 21 March 1916.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)138>Larzelere (2003), p. 138</ref> On 22 March 1917 the Commandant issued a twelve-page manual titled ''Confidential Order No. 2, [[Coast Guard Mobilization Plan 1|Mobilization of the U.S. Coast Guard When Required to Operate as a Part of the U.S. Navy]]''.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)8 /> Germany had already announced a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare on 30 January 1917, on all ships trading with its enemies and included neutral shipping as targets.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3>Larzelere (2003), p. 3</ref>  U.S. merchant ships sunk before a declaration of war included the [[SS Healdton|SS ''Healdton]] and the [[SS Housatonic|SS ''Housatonic'']] and five others with the loss of 36 American lives.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)3-6>Larzelere (2003), pp. 3\u20146</ref>\n\n=== Declaration of war ===\n[[File:USCGC Tampa in port c1918.jpg|thumb|[[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USCGC ''Tampa'']] in port]]\nOn 6 April 1917, with a formal declaration of war, the Coast Guard was transferred to the operational control of the Navy. All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref> Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience. During the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=Tilley>Tilley, A History of Women in the Coast Guard, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office</ref><ref name=\"womensmemorial\">{{cite web |url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |title=Women In Military Service For America Memorial |publisher=Womensmemorial.org |date=1950-07-27 |accessdate=2013-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HZVJCcKl?url=http://www.womensmemorial.org/Education/timeline.html |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, {{USCGC|Tampa|1912|6}} parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932. In 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

Greathouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbase.com/donboyd/image/59585407|title=IN MEMORIAM for ADCMAP John Pershing Greathouse, USCG \u2013 the last enlisted Coastie pilot by Don Boyd|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredsplace.org/obit/obituary.shtml|title=Military and Veteran Benefits, News, Veteran Jobs|first=|last=Military.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===End of ocean stations, beginning of the {{convert|200|nmi|km|sigfig=2}} limit===\nOne major mission of the service, maintaining [[weather ship|Ocean Stations]], came to an end as improvements in oceanic aviation (turbojet airliners and improved radionavigation) obviated the need. However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees. The aircraft sank within 90 seconds.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GnmwMBeSLzAC |title= Adak: The Rescue of Alfa Foxtrot 586 |first=Andrew |last= Jampoler |publisher= Naval Institute Press |year= 2012 |ISBN= 9781612510743}}</ref>\n\nThe crew of Coast Guard HC-130H CGNR 1500 were instrumental in saving the lives of ten crew members from Navy P3C PD-2 \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\" (Bureau No. 159892) after that aircraft ditched in the North Pacific Ocean west of Shemya Island on 26 October 1978. Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]].

The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy.

With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast.<ref name=Evans57>Evans, p. 57</ref><ref name=Noble20>Noble, p. 20</ref> These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers.<ref name=Noble22>Noble, p. 22</ref>\n\nThis system continued until February 1, 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department by [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[George S. Boutwell]].{{#tag:ref|Kimball preferred to use the term \"Revenue Marine Bureau\" and various references use either Division or Bureau to identify the entity.<ref name=Evans92>Evans, p. 92</ref>|group=Note}}<ref name=Evans91>Evans, p. 91</ref><ref name=Noble24-25</ref>Noble, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Congress finally formalized the organization of the division on 3 March 1875.<ref name=King9>King, p. 9</ref> Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews.<ref name=Noble28>Noble, p. 28</ref> Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially organized and Kimball volunteered to lead the service.<ref name=Noble1>Noble, p. 1</ref><ref name=King9 /> Kimball held the position of superintendent until the merger of the service with the Revenue Cutter Service in 1915.<ref name=King240>King, p. 240</ref>\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe [[United States Coast Guard Academy|School of Instruction]] of the Revenue Cutter Service was established on July 31, 1876 near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used {{USRC|James C. Dobbin|1853|6}} for its training exercises. ''Dobbin'' was replaced in 1878 with {{USRC|Salmon P. Chase|1878|6}}, which was specially designed for the assignment as a training cutter.<ref name=Evans95>Evans, p. 95</ref> The School of Instruction moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut.<ref name=Evans155>Evans, p. 155</ref><ref name=Evans199>Evans, p. 199</ref> The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.<ref name=Evans198>Evans, p. 198</ref>  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began.<ref name=Evans198 /> Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the United States Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Evans199 /> In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy.

[[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.

Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref> Coast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".

In 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation. Marine inspection and navigation duties under the [[Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation]] were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]].

The crews also assessed storm damage to offshore oil platforms and refineries.  More than 2,400 personnel from all districts conducted search, rescue, response, waterway reconstitution and environmental impact assessment operations. In total, the Coast Guard air and boat rescued more than 33,500 people and assisted with the joint-agency evacuation of an additional 9,400 patients and medical personnel from hospitals in the Gulf coast region.\n\nIn May 2006, at the Change of Command ceremony when Admiral [[Thad Allen]] took over as Commandant, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W.

Although the program involves obtaining new ships and aircraft, Deepwater also involves upgraded information technology for command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR).\n\nA key part of the Deepwater system is the Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL), which is designed to replace the 378-foot (115 m) high-endurance cutters currently on duty.  This ship will have a length of 421 feet (128 m), be powered by a [[gas turbine]] engine with two auxiliary [[diesel engine]]s, and be capable of 12,000 nautical mile (22,000&nbsp;km) voyages lasting up to 60 days.  The keel laying of the {{USCGC|Bertholf}} (WMSL-750), the first ship in this class, took place in September 2004. The ship was delivered in 2008. The second keel, {{USCGC|Waesche|WMSL-751}}, was laid in 2005.\n\nAnother key vessel is the Maritime Security Cutter, Medium (WMSM), which will be 341&nbsp;ft (104 m) long, displace 2,921 long tons (2,968 metric tons), and be capable of 45-day patrols of up to 9,000 nautical miles (17,000&nbsp;km).

Throughout the history of the program, nearly 63,000 undergraduate students<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/contact/about-us/|title=About us|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> from more than 1,500 colleges and universities have participated in Semester at Sea.\n\nDuring the spring and fall semesters, up to 600 undergraduates<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/life-at-sea/our-ship/|title=Our Ship|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Semester at Sea|accessdate=|df=}}</ref> participate in the approximately 100\u2013110-day program. During this semester, the ship circumnavigates the globe, travelling from [[North America]] and heading either east across the [[Atlantic]] or west across the [[Pacific]], visiting 10 to 11 countries in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[Europe]], [[South America]], and [[North America]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey {{!}} Semester at Sea|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> Previously, the program had voyages that would sail through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal, but due to piracy concerns in the [[Gulf of Aden]], voyages now typically travel around Africa.\n\nFor many years, ISE hosted a shorter 65-day Semester at Sea program in the summer that focused on one general region of the world. In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrolment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January. Itineraries for these voyages focused on [[Central America]] and [[South America]], often transiting the [[Panama Canal]] or travelling up the [[Amazon River]]. Currently, ISE only offers fall and spring voyages.\n\n== Academics ==\nStudents attend classes on a variety of subjects and disciplines while the ship is at sea. Typically, these classes include [[humanities]] classes that are relevant to one or more of the countries on the itinerary. All students are also required to take an interdisciplinary core course, called [[Global studies|Global Studies.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215223032/https://www.semesteratsea.org/info-hub/academics/#semester-at-sea-course-information|url-status=dead|archive-date=2018-12-15|title=Course Information|format=PDF}}</ref> While in port, no classes are held and students can travel on Semester at Sea sponsored trips or independently in the country,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/in-country/|title=In-country destinations: field classes & program {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> however, travel outside the country of a port is strictly prohibited, resulting in the student's dismissal from the program.\n\nAlthough [[Colorado State University]] is the academic sponsor for the program, Semester at Sea is open to students from any university. Faculty members are drawn from colleges and universities throughout the United States and around the world, including [[Harvard University]], [[Stanford University]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Brown University]], [[Georgetown University]], [[George Washington University]], [[Boston University]], [[Bucknell University]], [[Emerson College]], [[Yale University]], [[University of Pittsburgh]], [[California Lutheran University]], [[Chapman University]], [[Bentley University]], [[Pennsylvania State University]], [[Duke University]], [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)]], [[Cornell University]], [[Jacksonville University]], [[University of Arizona]], [[University of Michigan]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Virginia]], [[University of Colorado]], [[University of Maine]], [[University of San Diego]], [[University of Southern California]], [[University of Connecticut]], [[New York University]], and [[Columbia University]].\n\nBefore arriving at a port, students receive a pre-port briefing regarding the culture and societal rules of the country they are visiting. Upon arrival at the port of call, special guest speakers, ranging from community leaders from the country to American ambassadors, give lectures to the students and faculty. The pre-port briefing and the guest lectures are intended to help prepare students for their time in the country.\n\n== Notable lecturers and guests<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/our-program/experts/|title=Faculty & Staff - your expert education team {{!}} Semester at Sea voyages|work=Semester At Sea|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref> ==\n*[[Fidel Castro]], Cuban President\n*[[Anwar Sadat]], Egyptian President\n*[[Indira Gandhi]], Indian Prime Minister\n*[[Mikhail Gorbachev]], USSR President\n*[[Corazon Aquino]], President of the Philippines\n*[[King Mohammed VI of Morocco]], King of Morocco\n*[[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]], Prince of Morocco\n*[[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Mother Teresa]], Nobel Laureate\n*[[Nelson Mandela]], First Black President of South Africa, Nobel Laureate\n*[[Arthur C.

Students are transformed from \"[[pollywog]]s\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travellers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The students on board the MV ''World Odyssey'' were rerouted to Vietnam where students received an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

In May 2011, Semester at Sea introduced a new short-term or Maymester voyage with a curriculum based around the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. These voyages lasted 26 days and offered students the opportunity to earn four to five transferable credits. However, following the Maymester 2012 voyage, Semester at Sea decided to cancel short-term voyages indefinitely due to low enrolment. Additionally, a two-week ''\"Enrichment Voyage\"'' program was previously held for continuing education participants during December and January.

In Fall 2019, Semester at Sea embarked on a new voyage that included ports such as the Netherlands, [[Poland]], the [[Kiel Canal]] Transit, [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Croatia]], Morocco, Ghana, [[Brazil]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Panama Canal]] Transit, [[Ecuador]], and [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/|title=Explore Upcoming Voyages on the MV World Odyssey|website=Semester At Sea|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-03}}</ref>\n \nThe ship docked in [[Denmark]] during Summer 2008,<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Semester at Sea \u2013 Summer 2008 Itinerary/Calendar\n |url         = http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080703042836/http://www.semesteratsea.org/voyages/current-voyage/itinerary.php\n |archivedate = 2008-07-03\n}}</ref> [[Namibia]] during Fall 2008, [[Bulgaria]] during Summer 2009, and [[Senegal]] during Fall 2015, the first time in the history of the program that Semester at Sea had visited these countries.\n\n== Traditions ==\n=== Neptune Day celebration ===\nWhen the ship crosses the equator, the students, faculty and crew of the vessel celebrate [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] Day, a maritime [[line-crossing ceremony]]. Students are transformed from \"[[Polywog|polywogs]]\" to \"shellbacks\" in an initiation ceremony, involving slime-smearing, fish-kissing, and (optional) [[head shaving|head-shaving]]. Neptune Day is one of several holidays celebrated during the voyage.\n\n=== Sea Olympics ===\nStudents aboard the ship are divided into groups named for various seas, (occasionally including [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]], [[Bering Sea|Bering]], [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], [[Red Sea|Red]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], the [[Persian Gulf]], and the [[Three Seas Initiative|Three Seas]], (for the Lifelong Learners, faculty, and children of faculty). \n\nThe student seas are generally determined by their deck and will participate in an all-day Olympic challenge. Opening ceremonies are held in the morning, and no classes are held during the challenge. Events may include synchronized swimming, pull-ups, dodgeball, trivia, a lip-sync routine, and a ship-wide relay. The teams compete for the opportunity to disembark the ship first in its final port of call as well as a celebration in the faculty/staff-only lounge.\n\n==Notable Alumni==\n*[[Joan Lunden]], F67 \u2013 TV Host\n*[[Joel Douglas]], F67 \u2013 Film Producer \u2013 ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]]''\n*[[Stephen Gaghan]], F86 \u2013 Emmy and Oscar Winning Screenwriter, ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]''\n*[[Cynthia Nixon]], S86 \u2013 Emmy Winning Actress \u2013 \"Miranda\" on TV show ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and challenged Andrew Cuomo<ref>[[Andrew Cuomo]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=October 2019}} in the 2018 New York Gubernatorial Election.\n*[[Richard Lamm]], S91 \u2013 Former Governor of [[Colorado]]\n*[[Arthur C.

However, the ship was unable to consistently meet its sailing schedule during the semester due to persistent mechanical difficulties. The ship made several unscheduled stops and had to anchor between ports while repairs were accomplished. It was decided to tow the ship to the [[South China Sea]] and anchor overnight. Captain Chang had all crew members patrolling the deck 3\u20135 feet apart with flashlights throughout the night to notify of any pirate boarding attempts. The planned stop at [[Manila|Manila, Philippines]] was canceled and the SS ''Universe'' rerouted to Singapore. Exams completed at anchor in the harbor, then the students and faculty flew to the next two planned ports of Osaka, Japan, and Shanghai, China. The ''Universe'' then met the students in Shanghai to complete the final leg of the voyage to Hong Kong.\n\nTraveling in foreign countries poses risks for all travellers and a few incidents of non-shipboard fatalities have occurred to participants of Semester at Sea. One student died in a hiking accident on a 1993 voyage, and SaS Spring 1996, five students were killed in a bus crash during a field trip in India.<ref>Hong, Peter (1996) \u201cDeaths Cloud Floating College : After Losing Children to Accidents, Parents Say Risks Weren't Publicized; Officials Defend Program\u201d,  http://articles.latimes.com/1996-06-17/local/me-15911_1_international-programs.  Accessed 2011-06-30</ref>\n\nThe Fall 1997 voyage was rerouted due to [[terrorism]] concerns. On November 12, 1997, [[Ramzi Yousef]] was convicted of masterminding the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]]. Consequently, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] issued a travel warning for American citizens in the Middle East. On November 17, 1997, while the ship was docked in [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]], and the students were in [[Egypt]], the [[Luxor massacre]] occurred. Although no students were involved, fears of further terrorism resulted in the removal of the next two ports, [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]], from the itinerary, and the ship was rerouted to [[Cyprus]] and then [[Spain]].\n\nThe Fall 2000 semester on the SS ''Universe Explorer'' had two incidents. When entering Vietnam, the ship was hit by a barge, causing damage to the hull along the side of the ship and closing student rooms. No one was injured by this incident. The SS ''Universe Explorer'' had to remain an extra day in Vietnam to be patched but subsequently continued on the journey with all passengers. While preparing to head north through the Suez Canal to Egypt, Turkey, Croatia, and Spain, the ship's captain decided to reroute due to threats against all ships in the Suez region. Instead, the Fall 2000 voyage stopped in Kenya, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nIn the Fall 2001 semester following the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], the SS ''Universe Explorer'' was redirected after its stop in [[Kobe]], [[Japan]]. The planned route \u2014 from [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], into the [[Indian Ocean]] through the [[Suez Canal]] to ports in [[Egypt]] and [[Croatia]] \u2014 was changed by the U.S. State Department. The ship's route for the semester was then rerouted south to include [[Singapore]], [[Seychelles]], and [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. While in the Indian Ocean, the ship's communication with other vessels in the Indian Ocean was limited to protect the security of the American citizens on board.\n\nOn January 26, 2005, the MV ''Explorer'' weathered a combination of three storms in the [[North Pacific]], and a {{convert|50|ft|adj=on}} [[Rogue wave|freak wave]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Storm Stories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DBGhXI586k#t=8m42s|publisher=[[The Weather Channel]]|date=January 2005}}</ref> smashed the windows of the bridge, breaking one of them, and briefly affecting the navigation systems.

The students on board the MV ''World Odyssey'' were rerouted to Vietnam where students received an extra week to make up for lost time in China. The MV ''World Odyssey'' left [[Kobe]], Japan, as scheduled on January 28, 2020, with arrival in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam]], on February 4, 2020. The ship was expected to have left [[Ho Chi Minh City]] at 0800 local time on February 16 but left 3 hours later at 1100 local time. The original itinerary had the MV ''World Odyssey'' stopping in Malaysia from February 19 to February 24 before heading to India from February 29 to March 5. Following a one-day fuel stop in Malaysia on February 19, the MV ''World Odyssey'' attempted to reroute to [[Victoria, Seychelles]] (with arrival expected on February 27 and departure on March 1). However, the evening before arrival, the Seychellois government denied the vessel entry. The MV ''World Odyssey'' then headed directly south to Mauritius and docked on February 29. The ship spent one day at port, followed by two days at sea around the island due to limited dock availability. The ship then returned to dock in [[Port Louis]] March 3\u20137. At about 0715 on March 6, students were informed of another itinerary change due to concerns of [[quarantine]] when arriving at European ports from northern Africa.

Drawing by [[Gerhard Munthe (painter)|Gerhard Munthe]]]]\nBj\u00f8rnson was born at the farmstead of [[Bj\u00f8rgan parsonage|Bj\u00f8rgan]] in [[Kvikne]], a secluded village in the [[\u00d8sterdalen]] district, some sixty miles south of [[Trondheim]]. In 1837 Bj\u00f8rnson's father [[Peder Bj\u00f8rnson]], who was the pastor of Kvikne, was transferred to the parish of [[Nesset]], outside [[Molde]] in [[Romsdal]]. It was in this scenic district that Bj\u00f8rnson spent his childhood, living at the [[Nesset Parsonage]].\n\nAfter a few years studying in the neighbouring city [[Molde]], Bj\u00f8rnson was sent at the age of 17 to Heltberg Latin School (''Heltbergs Studentfabrikk'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] to prepare for university. This was the same school that trained [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Lie]], and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje|Vinje]].\n\nBj\u00f8rnson had realized that he wanted to pursue his talent for poetry (he had written verses since age eleven). He matriculated at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1852, soon embarking upon a career as a journalist, focusing on criticism of drama.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=Nobel>{{cite web  | title = Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson \u2013 The Nobel Prize in Literature 1903  | work =  | publisher = The Nobel Foundation (From Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901\u20131967, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969.

In 1858 this was followed by ''Arne'', in 1860 by ''En glad Gut'' (A Happy Boy), and in 1868 by ''Fiskerjentene'' (The Fisher Girls). These are the most important specimens of his ''bonde-fortellinger'' or peasant tales.<ref name=PG>{{Gutenberg|no=4582|name=Bj\u00f6rnstjerne Bj\u00f6rnson|bullet=none}}. A biographical essay, 1910, by [[William Morton Payne]], a translator of various works by Bj\u00f8rnson.</ref>\n\nBj\u00f8rnson was anxious \"to create a new saga in the light of the peasant,\" as he put it, and he thought this should be done, not merely in prose fiction, but in national dramas or ''folke-stykker''. The earliest of these was a one-act piece set in the 12th century, ''Mellem Slagene'' (Between the Battles), written in 1855 and produced in 1857. He was especially influenced at this time by the study of [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen]] and [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]], during a visit to [[Copenhagen]]. ''Mellem Slagene'' was followed by ''Halte-Hulda'' (Lame Hulda) in 1858, and ''Kong Sverre'' (King Sverre) in 1861. His most important work to date was the poetic trilogy of ''[[Sigurd Slembe (trilogy)|Sigurd Slembe]]'' (Sigurd the Bad), which Bj\u00f8rnson published in 1862.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=PG/>\n\n==The mature author==\nAt the close of 1857 Bj\u00f8rnson had been appointed director of the theatre at [[Bergen]], a post which he held for two years, when he returned to [[Oslo|Christiania]]. From 1860 to 1863 he travelled widely throughout Europe. Early in 1865 he undertook the management of the Christiania theatre,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmiesing, Ann |year=2002|title=Bj\u00f8rnson and the Inner Plot of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=74|issue=4|pages=465|jstor=40920401}}</ref> and brought out his popular comedy of ''De Nygifte'' (The Newly Married) and his romantic tragedy of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in Scotland. In 1870 he published ''Poems and Songs'' and the epic cycle ''Arnljot Gelline''; the latter volume contains the ode ''Bergliot'', one of Bj\u00f8rnson's finest contributions to [[lyrical poetry]].\n\nBetween 1864 and 1874, Bj\u00f8rnson displayed a slackening of the intellectual forces very remarkable in a man of his energy; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager. This was the period of Bj\u00f8rnson's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator. In 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout [[Scandinavia]].\n\nFrom 1874 to 1876 Bj\u00f8rnson was absent from [[Norway]], and in the peace of voluntary exile he recovered his imaginative powers. His new departure as a dramatic author began with ''En fallit'' (A Bankruptcy) and ''Redakt\u00f8ren'' (The Editor) in 1874, social dramas of an extremely modern and realistic cast.\n\n==The \"national poet\"==\n[[File:Bj\u00f8rnson bldsa BB0786.jpg|thumb|Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson and Karoline Bj\u00f8rnson at Aulestad]]\nBj\u00f8rnson settled on his estate of [[Aulestad]] in [[Gausdal]]. In 1877 he published another novel, ''Magnhild'', in which his ideas on social questions were seen to be in a state of fermentation, and gave expression to his [[republicanism|republican]] sentiments in the polemical play ''Kongen'' (The King). In a later edition of the play, he prefixed an essay on \"Intellectual Freedom\" in further explanation of his position. ''Kaptejn Mansana'' (Captain Mansana), an episode of the [[Italian unification|war of Italian independence]], was written in to 1878.\n\nExtremely anxious to obtain full success on the stage, Bj\u00f8rnson concentrated his powers on a drama of social life, ''Leonarda'' (1879), which raised a violent controversy. A satirical play, ''Det nye System'' (The New System), was produced a few weeks later. Although these plays of Bj\u00f8rnson's second period were greatly discussed, few were financially successful.\n\nBj\u00f8rnson produced a social drama, ''En Handske'' (A Gauntlet), in 1883, but was unable to persuade any manager to stage it except in a modified form. In the autumn of the same year, Bj\u00f8rnson published a mystical or symbolic drama ''Over \u00c6vne'' (Beyond Powers), dealing with the abnormal features of religious excitement with extraordinary force; this was not acted until 1899, when it achieved a great success.\n\n==Political interests==\n[[File:Bj\u00f8rnson blds 01655.jpg|right|thumb|Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson in 1908]]\nFrom his youth and forwards, Bj\u00f8rnson admired [[Henrik Wergeland]], and became a vivid spokesman for the Norwegian Left-wing movement. In this respect, he supported [[Ivar Aasen]], and joined forces in the political struggles in the 1860s and 1870s. When the great monument over Henrik Wergeland were to be erected in 1881, it came to political struggle between left and right, and the left-wing got the upper hand. Bj\u00f8rnson presented the speech on behalf of Wergeland, and also honouring the constitution and the farmers.<ref name=Groendahl/>\n\nBj\u00f8rnson's political opinions had brought upon him a charge of high [[treason]], and he took refuge for a time in Germany, returning to Norway in 1882. Convinced that the theatre was practically closed to him, he turned back to the novel, and published in 1884 ''Det flager i Byen og paa Havnen'' (Flags are Flying in Town and Port), embodying his theories on heredity and education. In 1889 he printed another long and still more remarkable novel, ''Paa Guds veje'' (On God's Path), which is chiefly concerned with the same problems. The same year saw the publication of a comedy, ''Geografi og K\u00e6rlighed'' (Geography and Love), which met with success.<ref name=Groendahl/>\n\nA number of short stories, of a more or less [[didactic]] character, dealing with startling points of emotional experience, were collected and published 1894. Later plays were a political tragedy called ''Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg'' (1898), a second part of ''Over \u00c6vne'' (Beyond Powers II) (1895), ''Laboremus'' (1901), ''P\u00e5 Storhove'' (At Storhove) (1902), and ''Daglannet'' (Dag's Farm) (1904). In 1899, at the opening of the National Theatre, Bj\u00f8rnson received an ovation, and his saga-drama of King [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd the Crusader]] was performed at the opening of [[Nationaltheatret]] in Oslo.\n\nA subject which interested him greatly was the question of the [[Nynorsk|bondemaal]], the adopting of a national language for Norway distinct from the ''dansk-norsk'' (Dano-Norwegian), in which most Norwegian literature had hitherto been written. At an early stage, before 1860, Bj\u00f8rnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in [[Nynorsk|landsm\u00e5l]]. The interest, however, did not last, and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether. Afterwards, he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language. Bj\u00f8rnson's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal, and his lectures and pamphlets against the ''m\u00e5lstr\u00e6v'' in its extreme form were very effective. His attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881, as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point. Although he seems to have been supportive of [[Ivar Aasen]] and friendly towards farmers (in the peasant-novels), he later denounced this, and stated in 1899 that there was limits to a farmer's cultivation. ''I can draw a line on the wall. The farmer can cultivate himself to this level, and no more'', he wrote in 1899. Rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point, and uttered the statement in sheer anger. In 1881, he spoke of the farmer's clothing borne by Henrik Wergeland, and his opinion then states that this garment, worn by Wergeland, was \"of the most influential things\" in the initiation of the national day. Bj\u00f8rnson's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous. His father himself was a farmer's son.\nDuring the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major European papers. He attacked the French justice in the Dreyfus Affair, and he fought for the rights of children in Slovakia to learn their own mother tongue. \"To detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts,\" he wrote.\nBj\u00f8rnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the [[\u010cernov\u00e1 massacre]] under the title The greatest industry of Hungary \u2013 which was supposedly '[[Magyarization|to produce Magyars]]'.\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:En politisk telegramveksling.jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''[[Vikingen]]'' of a telegram exchange between Michelsen and Bj\u00f8rnson.]]\nBj\u00f8rnson was, from the beginning of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], a staunch supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], and, according to a contemporary, wrote \"article after article in the papers and proclaimed in every manner his belief in his innocence\". <!-- http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm -->\n\nBj\u00f8rnson was one of the original members of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], that awards the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], where he sat from 1901 to 1906.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |title=The Norwegian Nobel Committee Since 1901 |author=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=14 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619105728/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1903 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nBj\u00f8rnson had done as much as any other man to rouse Norwegian nationalistic feeling, but in 1903, on the verge of the rupture between [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], he preached conciliation and moderation to the Norwegians.

Drawing by [[Gerhard Munthe (painter)|Gerhard Munthe]]]]\nBj\u00f8rnson was born at the farmstead of [[Bj\u00f8rgan parsonage|Bj\u00f8rgan]] in [[Kvikne]], a secluded village in the [[\u00d8sterdalen]] district, some sixty miles south of [[Trondheim]]. In 1837 Bj\u00f8rnson's father [[Peder Bj\u00f8rnson]], who was the pastor of Kvikne, was transferred to the parish of [[Nesset]], outside [[Molde]] in [[Romsdal]]. It was in this scenic district that Bj\u00f8rnson spent his childhood, living at the [[Nesset Parsonage]].\n\nAfter a few years studying in the neighbouring city [[Molde]], Bj\u00f8rnson was sent at the age of 17 to Heltberg Latin School (''Heltbergs Studentfabrikk'') in [[Oslo|Christiania]] to prepare for university. This was the same school that trained [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Lie]], and [[Aasmund Olavsson Vinje|Vinje]].\n\nBj\u00f8rnson had realized that he wanted to pursue his talent for poetry (he had written verses since age eleven). He matriculated at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1852, soon embarking upon a career as a journalist, focusing on criticism of drama.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=Nobel>{{cite web  | title = Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson \u2013 The Nobel Prize in Literature 1903  | work =  | publisher = The Nobel Foundation (From Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901\u20131967, Editor Horst Frenz, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1969.

In 1858 this was followed by ''Arne'', in 1860 by ''En glad Gut'' (A Happy Boy), and in 1868 by ''Fiskerjentene'' (The Fisher Girls). These are the most important specimens of his ''bonde-fortellinger'' or peasant tales.<ref name=PG>{{Gutenberg|no=4582|name=Bj\u00f6rnstjerne Bj\u00f6rnson|bullet=none}}. A biographical essay, 1910, by [[William Morton Payne]], a translator of various works by Bj\u00f8rnson.</ref>\n\nBj\u00f8rnson was anxious \"to create a new saga in the light of the peasant,\" as he put it, and he thought this should be done, not merely in prose fiction, but in national dramas or ''folke-stykker''. The earliest of these was a one-act piece set in the 12th century, ''Mellem Slagene'' (Between the Battles), written in 1855 and produced in 1857. He was especially influenced at this time by the study of [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen]] and [[Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]], during a visit to [[Copenhagen]]. ''Mellem Slagene'' was followed by ''Halte-Hulda'' (Lame Hulda) in 1858, and ''Kong Sverre'' (King Sverre) in 1861. His most important work to date was the poetic trilogy of ''[[Sigurd Slembe (trilogy)|Sigurd Slembe]]'' (Sigurd the Bad), which Bj\u00f8rnson published in 1862.<ref name=SNL/><ref name=PG/>\n\n==The mature author==\nAt the close of 1857 Bj\u00f8rnson had been appointed director of the theatre at [[Bergen]], a post which he held for two years, when he returned to [[Oslo|Christiania]]. From 1860 to 1863 he travelled widely throughout Europe. Early in 1865 he undertook the management of the Christiania theatre,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmiesing, Ann |year=2002|title=Bj\u00f8rnson and the Inner Plot of 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=74|issue=4|pages=465|jstor=40920401}}</ref> and brought out his popular comedy of ''De Nygifte'' (The Newly Married) and his romantic tragedy of [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary Stuart]] in Scotland. In 1870 he published ''Poems and Songs'' and the epic cycle ''Arnljot Gelline''; the latter volume contains the ode ''Bergliot'', one of Bj\u00f8rnson's finest contributions to [[lyrical poetry]].\n\nBetween 1864 and 1874, Bj\u00f8rnson displayed a slackening of the intellectual forces very remarkable in a man of his energy; he was mainly occupied with politics and with his business as a theatrical manager. This was the period of Bj\u00f8rnson's most fiery propaganda as a radical agitator. In 1871 he began to supplement his journalistic work by delivering lectures throughout [[Scandinavia]].\n\nFrom 1874 to 1876 Bj\u00f8rnson was absent from [[Norway]], and in the peace of voluntary exile he recovered his imaginative powers. His new departure as a dramatic author began with ''En fallit'' (A Bankruptcy) and ''Redakt\u00f8ren'' (The Editor) in 1874, social dramas of an extremely modern and realistic cast.\n\n==The \"national poet\"==\n[[File:Bj\u00f8rnson bldsa BB0786.jpg|thumb|Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson and Karoline Bj\u00f8rnson at Aulestad]]\nBj\u00f8rnson settled on his estate of [[Aulestad]] in [[Gausdal]]. In 1877 he published another novel, ''Magnhild'', in which his ideas on social questions were seen to be in a state of fermentation, and gave expression to his [[republicanism|republican]] sentiments in the polemical play ''Kongen'' (The King). In a later edition of the play, he prefixed an essay on \"Intellectual Freedom\" in further explanation of his position. ''Kaptejn Mansana'' (Captain Mansana), an episode of the [[Italian unification|war of Italian independence]], was written in to 1878.\n\nExtremely anxious to obtain full success on the stage, Bj\u00f8rnson concentrated his powers on a drama of social life, ''Leonarda'' (1879), which raised a violent controversy. A satirical play, ''Det nye System'' (The New System), was produced a few weeks later. Although these plays of Bj\u00f8rnson's second period were greatly discussed, few were financially successful.\n\nBj\u00f8rnson produced a social drama, ''En Handske'' (A Gauntlet), in 1883, but was unable to persuade any manager to stage it except in a modified form. In the autumn of the same year, Bj\u00f8rnson published a mystical or symbolic drama ''Over \u00c6vne'' (Beyond Powers), dealing with the abnormal features of religious excitement with extraordinary force; this was not acted until 1899, when it achieved a great success.\n\n==Political interests==\n[[File:Bj\u00f8rnson blds 01655.jpg|right|thumb|Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson in 1908]]\nFrom his youth and forwards, Bj\u00f8rnson admired [[Henrik Wergeland]], and became a vivid spokesman for the Norwegian Left-wing movement. In this respect, he supported [[Ivar Aasen]], and joined forces in the political struggles in the 1860s and 1870s. When the great monument over Henrik Wergeland were to be erected in 1881, it came to political struggle between left and right, and the left-wing got the upper hand. Bj\u00f8rnson presented the speech on behalf of Wergeland, and also honouring the constitution and the farmers.<ref name=Groendahl/>\n\nBj\u00f8rnson's political opinions had brought upon him a charge of high [[treason]], and he took refuge for a time in Germany, returning to Norway in 1882. Convinced that the theatre was practically closed to him, he turned back to the novel, and published in 1884 ''Det flager i Byen og paa Havnen'' (Flags are Flying in Town and Port), embodying his theories on heredity and education. In 1889 he printed another long and still more remarkable novel, ''Paa Guds veje'' (On God's Path), which is chiefly concerned with the same problems. The same year saw the publication of a comedy, ''Geografi og K\u00e6rlighed'' (Geography and Love), which met with success.<ref name=Groendahl/>\n\nA number of short stories, of a more or less [[didactic]] character, dealing with startling points of emotional experience, were collected and published 1894. Later plays were a political tragedy called ''Paul Lange og Tora Parsberg'' (1898), a second part of ''Over \u00c6vne'' (Beyond Powers II) (1895), ''Laboremus'' (1901), ''P\u00e5 Storhove'' (At Storhove) (1902), and ''Daglannet'' (Dag's Farm) (1904). In 1899, at the opening of the National Theatre, Bj\u00f8rnson received an ovation, and his saga-drama of King [[Sigurd I of Norway|Sigurd the Crusader]] was performed at the opening of [[Nationaltheatret]] in Oslo.\n\nA subject which interested him greatly was the question of the [[Nynorsk|bondemaal]], the adopting of a national language for Norway distinct from the ''dansk-norsk'' (Dano-Norwegian), in which most Norwegian literature had hitherto been written. At an early stage, before 1860, Bj\u00f8rnson had himself experimented with at least one short story written in [[Nynorsk|landsm\u00e5l]]. The interest, however, did not last, and he soon abandoned this enterprise altogether. Afterwards, he regretted that he never felt he gained the mastery of this language. Bj\u00f8rnson's strong and sometimes rather narrow patriotism did not blind him to what he considered the fatal folly of such a proposal, and his lectures and pamphlets against the ''m\u00e5lstr\u00e6v'' in its extreme form were very effective. His attitude towards this must have changed sometime after 1881, as he still spoke on behalf of the farmers at this point. Although he seems to have been supportive of [[Ivar Aasen]] and friendly towards farmers (in the peasant-novels), he later denounced this, and stated in 1899 that there was limits to a farmer's cultivation. ''I can draw a line on the wall. The farmer can cultivate himself to this level, and no more'', he wrote in 1899. Rumour has it that he had been insulted by a farmer at some point, and uttered the statement in sheer anger. In 1881, he spoke of the farmer's clothing borne by Henrik Wergeland, and his opinion then states that this garment, worn by Wergeland, was \"of the most influential things\" in the initiation of the national day. Bj\u00f8rnson's attitude towards the farmers remain ambiguous. His father himself was a farmer's son.\nDuring the last twenty years of his life he wrote hundreds of articles in major European papers. He attacked the French justice in the Dreyfus Affair, and he fought for the rights of children in Slovakia to learn their own mother tongue. \"To detach children from their mother tongue is identical to tearing them away from their mothers breasts,\" he wrote.\nBj\u00f8rnson wrote in multiple newspapers about the [[\u010cernov\u00e1 massacre]] under the title The greatest industry of Hungary \u2013 which was supposedly '[[Magyarization|to produce Magyars]]'.\n\n==Last years==\n[[File:En politisk telegramveksling.jpg|thumb|Illustration from ''[[Vikingen]]'' of a telegram exchange between Michelsen and Bj\u00f8rnson.]]\nBj\u00f8rnson was, from the beginning of the [[Dreyfus Affair]], a staunch supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus]], and, according to a contemporary, wrote \"article after article in the papers and proclaimed in every manner his belief in his innocence\". <!-- http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13955/13955-h/13955-h.htm -->\n\nBj\u00f8rnson was one of the original members of the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], that awards the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], where he sat from 1901 to 1906.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |title=The Norwegian Nobel Committee Since 1901 |author=[[Nobel Foundation]] |accessdate=14 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619105728/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/committee/nnclist/index.html |archivedate=19 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1903 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].\n\nBj\u00f8rnson had done as much as any other man to rouse Norwegian nationalistic feeling, but in 1903, on the verge of the rupture between [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], he preached conciliation and moderation to the Norwegians.
