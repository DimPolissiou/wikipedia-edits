The state is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]] with [[Rhode Island]], east of Long Island, as well as an [[Canada\u2013United States border|international border]] with the [[Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] to the north and [[Ontario]] to the northwest. The southern part of the state is in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and includes Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower [[Hudson River Valley]]. The large [[Upstate New York]] region comprises several ranges of the wider [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in the [[North Country (New York)|Northeastern lobe]] of the state. The north\u2013south Hudson River Valley and the east\u2013west [[Mohawk River]] Valley bisect these more mountainous regions. [[Western New York]] is considered part of the [[Great Lakes region]] and borders [[Lake Ontario]], [[Lake Erie]], and [[Niagara Falls]]. The central part of the state is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular vacation and tourist destination.\n\nNew York had been inhabited by tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] and [[Jesuit missionaries]] arrived southward from [[Montreal]] for trade and [[proselytism|proselytizing]]. In 1609, the region was visited by [[Henry Hudson]] sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of [[New Netherland]], a center of trade and immigration. [[Kingdom of England|England]] seized the colony from the Dutch in 1664. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), a group of colonists of the [[Province of New York]] attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence. In the 19th century, New York's development of the interior, beginning with the [[Erie Canal]], gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the east coast and built its political and cultural ascendancy.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/nyregion/history-of-the-erie-canal.html|title=200 Years Ago, Erie Canal Got Its Start as Just a 'Ditch' |first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=June 26, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany landmarks in New York are well known, including four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: [[Times Square]], [[Central Park]], [[Niagara Falls]], and [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref name=\"Ann Shields\">{{cite web|title=The World's 50 Most Visited Tourist Attractions\u2014No. 3: Times Square, New York City\u2014Annual Visitors: 50,000,000\n |author=Ann Shields|publisher=Travel+Lesiure|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-most-visited-tourist-attractions/5\n |date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2015\n |quote=No.{{nbsp}}3 Times Square, New York City\u2014Annual Visitors: 50,000,000{{nbsp}}...

Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they targeted other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity. They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the [[Beaver Wars]]. From approximately 1640\u20131680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern-day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land. Still, afterward, the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the [[Mascouten]], Erie, [[Neutral Nation|Chonnonton]], [[Tutelo]], [[Saponi]], and [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] nations. In the 1700s, they would also merge with the Mohawk during the [[French-Indian War]] and take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in war.<ref>Editor: Alvin M.

Then, after the Revolution, a large group of them split off and returned to Ohio, becoming known as the [[Mingo]] Seneca. The current six tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy are the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, Tuscarora and Mohawk. The Iroquois fought for both sides during the revolution; afterwards many pro-British Iroquois migrated to Canada.

The success of the [[patroon]]ship of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]] (1630), which surrounded Albany and lasted until the mid-19th century, was also a key factor in the early success of the colony.

After their victory, the British occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[HMS Jersey (1736)|prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined.

Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier.\n\nSummer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s \u00b0F (25 to 29&nbsp;\u00b0C), over much of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of {{convert|-13|F|C|0}} or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and {{convert|5|F|C|0}} or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands of the Southern Tier.\n\nNew York ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es generated per person. This relative [[efficient energy use|efficient energy usage]] is primarily due to the dense, compact settlement in the New York City metropolitan area, and the state population's high rate of [[Public transport|mass transit]] use in this area and between major cities.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Breath of Fresh New York Air|author=The New York Post|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606103459/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n====Flora====\n\nSome species that can be found in this state are [[american ginseng]], [[Nitellopsis obtusa|starry stonewort]], [[Hydrilla|waterthyme]], water chestnut, [[Toxicodendron radicans|eastern poison ivy]], [[Toxicodendron vernix|poison sumac]], [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], [[Heracleum maximum|cow parsnip]] and [[Urtica dioica|common nettle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/275.html|title=Plants\u2014NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Fauna====\n\nThere are more than 20 mammal species, more than 20 bird species, some species of amphibians, and several reptile species.\n\nSpecies of mammals that are part of New York are [[white-footed mouse]], [[North American least shrew|North America least shrew]], [[little brown bat]], [[muskrat]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[eastern cottontail]], [[stoat]], [[groundhog]], [[striped skunk]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[North American river otter]], [[raccoon]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]], [[red fox]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[moose]] and [[American black bear]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/administration_pdf/mammals2.pdf|title=Mammals of NYS\u2014Conservationist Centerfold|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome species of birds in New Yok are the [[Common pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]], [[northern bobwhite]], [[ruffed grouse]], [[wild turkey]], [[blue jay]], [[eastern bluebird]], [[American robin]] and lack-capped chickadee.

Smaller notable private institutions of higher education include [[Rockefeller University]], [[Mercy College (New York)|Mercy College]], [[New York Institute of Technology]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], [[Yeshiva University]], and [[Hofstra University]]. There are also a multitude of [[postgraduate degree|postgraduate]]-level schools in New York State, including [[Medical School|medical]], [[Law School|law]], and [[engineering]] schools.\n\n[[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the service academy of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], is located just south of [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]]. The federal [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|Merchant Marine Academy]] is at [[Kings Point, New York|Kings Point]] on [[Long Island]].\n\nA number of selective private liberal arts institutions are located in New York. Among them are [[Bard College]], [[Barnard College]], [[Colgate University]], [[Hamilton College]], [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges]], [[Marist College]], [[Sarah Lawrence College]], [[Skidmore College]], [[Union College]], and [[Vassar College]]. Two of these schools, Barnard and Vassar, are members of the elite [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]], originally all women's colleges with ties to the [[Ivy League]]. Barnard is affiliated with [[Columbia University]], its Manhattan neighbor, and Vassar became coeducational in 1969 after declining an offer to merge with [[Yale University]].\n\nNew York is also home to what are widely regarded as the best performing arts schools in the world.

Engineering challenges posed by the complex terrain of the state and the unique infrastructural issues of New York City brought on by urban crowding have had to be overcome perennially. Population expansion of the state has followed the path of the early waterways, first the [[Hudson River]] and [[Mohawk River]], then the [[Erie Canal]]. In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the [[New York State Thruway]] in the 20th century.\n\nThe [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) is the department of the [[government of New York (state)|government of New York]]<ref>[[Transportation Law]] \u00a7 11. \"There shall be in the state government a department of transportation.

The NYSDOT is headquartered at 50 Wolf Road in [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]], [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ) is a joint venture between the States of New York and New Jersey and authorized by the [[US Congress]], established in 1921 through an [[interstate compact]], that oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[seaport]]s, within the geographical jurisdiction of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]].

In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways.\n[[File:JFK Plane Queue.jpg|thumb|[[John F.

Diesel-powered vehicles with a gross weight rating over 8,500&nbsp;lb that are registered in most Downstate New York counties must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in New York State must get an annual safety inspection.\n\nPortions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to [[airport terminal|terminals]] at [[John F.

It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]].\n\nThe [[Governor of New York|Governor]] is the State's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[New York Attorney General|Attorney General]], and the [[New York State Comptroller|Comptroller]]. The [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the Governor.\n\nThe [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.\n\nThe highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The [[New York City courts]] make up the largest local court system.\n\nThe [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s. There have been several movements regarding [[Partition and secession in New York|secession from the state of New York]]. Proposals have included a state of [[Long Island]], consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the [[Western New York|western counties]] of New York state; the northern counties of New York state called [[Upstate New York]]; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new [[Peconic County]] on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of [[Staten Island]] to secede from New York City.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Capital punishment===\n\n{{Main|Capital punishment in New York}}\n\n[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v.

John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from [[David Paterson|Governor Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963.

The state is bordered by [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]] to the south and [[Connecticut]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Vermont]] to the east. The state has a [[Maritime boundary|maritime border]] with [[Rhode Island]], east of Long Island, as well as an [[Canada\u2013United States border|international border]] with the [[Canadian provinces]] of [[Quebec]] to the north and [[Ontario]] to the northwest. The southern part of the state is in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] and includes Long Island and several smaller associated islands, as well as New York City and the lower [[Hudson River Valley]]. The large [[Upstate New York]] region comprises several ranges of the wider [[Appalachian Mountains]], and the [[Adirondack Mountains]] in the [[North Country (New York)|Northeastern lobe]] of the state. The north\u2013south Hudson River Valley and the east\u2013west [[Mohawk River]] Valley bisect these more mountainous regions. [[Western New York]] is considered part of the [[Great Lakes region]] and borders [[Lake Ontario]], [[Lake Erie]], and [[Niagara Falls]]. The central part of the state is dominated by the [[Finger Lakes]], a popular vacation and tourist destination.\n\nNew York had been inhabited by tribes of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] and [[Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for several hundred years by the time the earliest Europeans came to New York. [[French colonization of the Americas|French colonists]] and [[Jesuit missionaries]] arrived southward from [[Montreal]] for trade and [[proselytism|proselytizing]]. In 1609, the region was visited by [[Henry Hudson]] sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The [[Dutch people|Dutch]] built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 at the confluence of the [[Hudson River|Hudson]] and [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]] rivers, where the present-day capital of Albany later developed. The Dutch soon also settled [[New Amsterdam]] and parts of the Hudson Valley, establishing the multicultural colony of [[New Netherland]], a center of trade and immigration. [[Kingdom of England|England]] seized the colony from the Dutch in 1664. During the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783), a group of colonists of the [[Province of New York]] attempted to take control of the British colony and eventually succeeded in establishing independence. In the 19th century, New York's development of the interior, beginning with the [[Erie Canal]], gave it incomparable advantages over other regions of the east coast and built its political and cultural ascendancy.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/nyregion/history-of-the-erie-canal.html|title=200 Years Ago, Erie Canal Got Its Start as Just a 'Ditch' |first=Sam|last=Roberts|date=June 26, 2017 |work=The New York Times|access-date=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany landmarks in New York are well known, including four of the world's ten most-visited tourist attractions in 2013: [[Times Square]], [[Central Park]], [[Niagara Falls]], and [[Grand Central Terminal]].<ref name=\"Ann Shields\">{{cite web|title=The World's 50 Most Visited Tourist Attractions\u2014No. 3: Times Square, New York City\u2014Annual Visitors: 50,000,000\n |author=Ann Shields|publisher=Travel+Lesiure|url=http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-most-visited-tourist-attractions/5\n |date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=July 17, 2015\n |quote=No.{{nbsp}}3 Times Square, New York City\u2014Annual Visitors: 50,000,000{{nbsp}}...

Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they targeted other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity. They posed a major threat to the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the [[Beaver Wars]]. From approximately 1640\u20131680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern-day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquian and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. This completely changed the ethnography of the region, and most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land.

After their victory, the British occupied New York City, making it their military and political base of operations in North America for the duration of the conflict, and consequently the focus of General [[George Washington]]'s [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War|intelligence network]]. On the notorious British [[HMS Jersey (1736)|prison ships]] of [[Wallabout Bay]], more American combatants died of intentional neglect than were killed in combat in every battle of the war combined.

The state's borders include a water boundary in (clockwise from the west) two [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario]], which are connected by the [[Niagara River]]); the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]], with New York and Ontario sharing the [[Thousand Islands]] [[archipelago]] within the Saint Lawrence River, while most of its border with Quebec is on land; it shares [[Lake Champlain]] with the [[New England]] state of [[Vermont]]; the New England state of [[Massachusetts]] has mostly a land border; New York extends into [[Long Island Sound]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]], sharing a water border with [[Rhode Island]], while [[Connecticut]] has land and sea borders. Except for areas near the [[New York Harbor]], New York has a mostly land border with two [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] states, [[New Jersey]] and [[Pennsylvania]].

Upstate New York experiences warm summers, marred by only occasional, brief intervals of sultry conditions, with long and cold winters. Western New York, particularly the Tug Hill region, receives heavy [[lake-effect snow]]s, especially during the earlier portions of winter, before the surface of Lake Ontario itself is covered by ice. The summer climate is cool in the Adirondacks, Catskills, and at higher elevations of the Southern Tier.\n\nSummer daytime temperatures usually range from the upper 70s to mid-80s \u00b0F (25 to 29&nbsp;\u00b0C), over much of the state. In the majority of winter seasons, a temperature of {{convert|-13|F|C|0}} or lower can be expected in the northern highlands (Northern Plateau) and {{convert|5|F|C|0}} or colder in the southwestern and east-central highlands of the Southern Tier.\n\nNew York ranks 46th among the 50 states in the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es generated per person. This relative [[efficient energy use|efficient energy usage]] is primarily due to the dense, compact settlement in the New York City metropolitan area, and the state population's high rate of [[Public transport|mass transit]] use in this area and between major cities.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Breath of Fresh New York Air|author=The New York Post|date=June 3, 2007|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606103459/http://www.nypost.com/seven/06032007/news/regionalnews/a_breath_of_fresh_n_y__air_regionalnews_.htm|archivedate=June 6, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2007}}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n====Flora====\n\nSome species that can be found in this state are [[american ginseng]], [[Nitellopsis obtusa|starry stonewort]], [[Hydrilla|waterthyme]], water chestnut, [[Toxicodendron radicans|eastern poison ivy]], [[Toxicodendron vernix|poison sumac]], [[Heracleum mantegazzianum|giant hogweed]], [[Heracleum maximum|cow parsnip]] and [[Urtica dioica|common nettle]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/275.html|title=Plants\u2014NYS Dept. of Environmental Conservation|website=www.dec.ny.gov|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Fauna====\n\nThere are more than 20 mammal species, more than 20 bird species, some species of amphibians, and several reptile species.\n\nSpecies of mammals that are part of New York are [[white-footed mouse]], [[North American least shrew|North America least shrew]], [[little brown bat]], [[muskrat]], [[eastern gray squirrel]], [[eastern cottontail]], [[stoat]], [[groundhog]], [[striped skunk]], [[Fisher (animal)|fisher]], [[North American river otter]], [[raccoon]], [[bobcat]], [[coyote]], [[red fox]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[moose]] and [[American black bear]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/administration_pdf/mammals2.pdf|title=Mammals of NYS\u2014Conservationist Centerfold|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=December 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSome species of birds in New Yok are the [[Common pheasant|ring-necked pheasant]], [[northern bobwhite]], [[ruffed grouse]], [[wild turkey]], [[blue jay]], [[eastern bluebird]], [[American robin]] and lack-capped chickadee.

In the 19th century, railroads were constructed along the river valleys, followed by the [[New York State Thruway]] in the 20th century.\n\nThe [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT) is the department of the [[government of New York (state)|government of New York]]<ref>[[Transportation Law]] \u00a7 11. \"There shall be in the state government a department of transportation. The head of the department shall be the commissioner of transportation.\" Accessed July 19, 2015.</ref> responsible for the development and operation of [[highways]], [[Rail transport|railroads]], [[mass transit]] systems, [[port]]s, [[waterways]], and [[aviation]] facilities within New York State. The NYSDOT is headquartered at 50 Wolf Road in [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]], [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] (PANYNJ) is a joint venture between the States of New York and New Jersey and authorized by the [[US Congress]], established in 1921 through an [[interstate compact]], that oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[airport]]s, and [[seaport]]s, within the geographical jurisdiction of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]]. This {{convert|1500|sqmi|abbr=on|adj=on}} port district is generally encompassed within a {{convert|25|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} radius of the [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]].<ref name=\"PANYNJ-annual-report-2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.panynj.gov/corporate-information/pdf/annual-report-2002.pdf|title=2002 Annual Report |publisher=PANY |year=2003 |format=PDF}}.

Other cities and towns in New York have urban and regional public transportation. In Buffalo, the [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] runs the [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] light-rail system; in Rochester, the [[Rochester Subway]] operated from 1927 until 1956, but fell into disuse as state and federal investment went to highways.\n[[File:JFK Plane Queue.jpg|thumb|[[John F.

Diesel-powered vehicles with a gross weight rating over 8,500&nbsp;lb that are registered in most Downstate New York counties must get an annual emissions inspection. All vehicles registered in New York State must get an annual safety inspection.\n\nPortions of the transportation system are [[intermodal passenger transport|intermodal]], allowing travelers to switch easily from one mode of transportation to another. One of the most notable examples is [[AirTrain JFK]] which allows rail passengers to travel directly to [[airport terminal|terminals]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] as well as to the underground New York City Subway system.\n\n==Government==\n\n{{Main|Government of New York (state)}}\n{{See also|Law of New York (state)}}\n[[File:NYSCapitolPanorama.jpg|thumb|The [[New York State Capitol]] in Albany]]\n\nThe Government of New York embodies the governmental structure of the State of New York as established by the [[New York State Constitution]]. It is composed of three branches: [[executive branch|executive]], [[legislative branch|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]].\n\nThe [[Governor of New York|Governor]] is the State's chief executive and is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|Lieutenant Governor]]. Both are elected on the same ticket. Additional elected officers include the [[New York Attorney General|Attorney General]], and the [[New York State Comptroller|Comptroller]]. The [[Secretary of State of New York|Secretary of State]], formerly an elected officer, is currently appointed by the Governor.\n\nThe [[New York State Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] and consists of the [[New York State Senate]] and the [[New York State Assembly]]. The Assembly consists of 150 members, while the Senate varies in its number of members, currently having 63. The Legislature is empowered to make laws, subject to the Governor's power to [[veto]] a bill. However, the veto may be overridden by the Legislature if there is a [[supermajority|two-thirds majority]] in favor of overriding in each House. The permanent laws of a general nature are [[codification (law)|codified]] in the ''[[Consolidated Laws of New York]]''.\n\nThe highest court of appeal in the [[Judiciary of New York|Unified Court System]] is the [[New York State Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] whereas the primary [[felony]] [[trial court]] is the [[New York County Court|County Court]] (or the [[New York Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in New York City). The Supreme Court also acts as the intermediate appellate court for many cases, and the local courts handle a variety of other matters including [[small claims]], traffic ticket cases, and local [[zoning]] matters, and are the starting point for all criminal cases. The [[New York City courts]] make up the largest local court system.\n\nThe [[administrative divisions of New York|state is divided]] into counties, cities, towns, and villages, all of which are [[municipal corporation]]s with respect to their own governments, as well as various corporate entities that serve single purposes that are also local governments, such as school districts, fire districts, and [[New York state public-benefit corporations]], frequently known as ''authorities'' or ''development corporations''. Each municipal corporation is granted varying [[home rule]] powers as provided by the New York Constitution. The state also has 10 [[Indian reservation]]s. There have been several movements regarding [[Partition and secession in New York|secession from the state of New York]]. Proposals have included a state of [[Long Island]], consisting of everything on the island outside New York City; a state called Niagara, the [[Western New York|western counties]] of New York state; the northern counties of New York state called [[Upstate New York]]; making the city of New York a state; a proposal for a new [[Peconic County]] on eastern Long Island; and for the borough of [[Staten Island]] to secede from New York City.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Capital punishment===\n\n{{Main|Capital punishment in New York}}\n\n[[Capital punishment in the United States|Capital punishment]] was reintroduced in 1995 under the [[George Pataki#Death penalty|Pataki administration]], but the statute was declared unconstitutional in 2004, when the [[New York Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''[[People v.

John Taylor'', and the death row was disestablished in 2008, under executive order from [[David Paterson|Governor Paterson]]. No execution has taken place in New York since 1963.

Heavily populated suburban areas downstate, such as Westchester County and Long Island, have swung between the major parties since the 1980s, but more often than not support Democrats.\n\nNew York City is the most important source of [[political fundraising]] in the United States for both major parties. Four of the top five [[zip code]]s in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan.

An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film was shot in [[black-and-white]] with a [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and currently used aspect ratios|1.19:1 aspect ratio]]. It stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] as two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.\n\nAccording to Eggers, although the final story bears little resemblance to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\", the film began as an attempt by his brother Max Eggers to do a contemporary take on the Poe story. When the project stalled, Eggers offered to work with his brother and the project evolved into a period thriller with the Poe elements largely removed. Dafoe and Pattinson were cast as the lead characters in February 2018. [[Principal photography]] began on April 9, 2018, and lasted a total of 34 days in Leif Erikson Park in [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and inside a hangar at [[Yarmouth International Airport]] in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|72nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 19, and was theatrically released on October 18, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film was praised for its technical aspects (notably the cinematography and production design), Eggers' screenplay and direction, and the performances of the leads. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) serves a contract job as a [[Lighthouse keeper|wickie]] for four weeks on an isolated island off the coast of [[New England]], under the supervision of an irritable elderly man named Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]]). On the first day, Winslow notices a hole in his cot, finding a small [[scrimshaw]] of a [[mermaid]] within it and stuffing it in his jacket. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of giant tentacles in the lighthouse, logs floating in the water and distant images of a mermaid.\n\nOver the course of his stay, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs\u2014refueling the light, carrying heavy [[kerosene]] containers, and disposing of the two men's [[chamber pot|chamber pots]], all the while refusing to let him enter the lantern room. As the weeks progress, Winslow repeatedly encounters an aggressive one-eyed [[gull]]. Wake warns Winslow that it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is [[Sailors' superstitions|superstitious]] that they are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to the scrimshaw and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous wickie, whom Wake says died shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow reveals that he used to work in Canada as a [[Lumberjack|timberman]], but decided to change professions.\n\nThe day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the [[cistern]] to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull flies down and attacks Winslow, who grabs it and beats it to death. Soon after, the winds change direction and a storm hits the island that night. The next morning, the relief ferry does not arrive and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches it and realizes that it is a mermaid, which awakens and howls at him. He runs back into the cottage, where Wake informs him that their [[Military rations|rations]] were spoiled by the storm. Winslow inquires about the ferry, but Wake insists that weeks, in fact, have passed since it was due to arrive. They dig up a crate supposed to contain extra rations but find only more alcohol.\n\nMore days pass, the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversarial. Winslow has visions of a [[lobster trap]] containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his [[Supervisor|foreman]] who died in an accident Howard neglected to stop. Wake accuses Howard of \"spilling his beans\" and Howard tries to leave on a [[dory]], but Wake destroys it with an axe. Wake chases Howard into the cottage, but inside, Wake claims that it was Howard who attacked him. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of [[turpentine]] and [[honey]], and the storm becomes so powerful that waves crash through the cottage's windows.\n\nThe next morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has written a critical report of Howard's performance and recommended he be sacked without pay. Wake chides Howard while Howard accuses him of gaslighting and begs him to see the light in the lantern room. Wake berates Howard and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake into submission. Howard leashes Wake and buries him alive while he curses Howard to a \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] fate.\" Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and strikes him with the axe. Howard disarms Wake and kills him before ascending the lighthouse. He approaches the [[Fresnel lens]], and it stops and opens up to him. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches in, letting out distorted screams as the light brightens before slipping, breaking his leg and falling down the steps. A still-alive Howard is finally seen lying naked on the rocks and missing an eye as several gulls peck at his innards.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Lighthouse'' began as an attempt by [[Max Eggers]] to adapt \"[[The Light-House]],\" an unfinished short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. [[Robert Eggers]] became aware of his brother's effort while trying to pitch his debut feature, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', to studios. Max's project stalled, after which Robert offered to work on it based on his own vision. The final story, co-written by Robert and Max, bears no resemblance to the Poe work apart from the title.<ref name=RS1025>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-interview-898545/ |title=Drunken Sailors and Movie Stars: Robert Eggers on Making 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fear |date=October 25, 2019 |accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe literature of [[Maine]]-based writer [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] served as a significant point of reference for the dialects used in ''The Lighthouse''. Maritime and surrealistic elements from the works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] also informed the writing of the film. According to Eggers, a 19th-century incident at [[Smalls Lighthouse]] in Wales involving two lighthouse keepers (both named Thomas, as in the film) was an additional source of inspiration.<ref name=RS1025/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 2018, it was announced [[Willem Dafoe]] had been cast in the film.<ref name=DL0207>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/ |title=Willem Dafoe Alights For Robert Eggers-Directed 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415093602/https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/|archive-date=April 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dafoe had previously contacted Robert Eggers via email, expressing his admiration for ''The Witch'' and offering to work with the director in the future.

Barton interprets his reaction, stating that it \"is fairly obvious \u2013 the mermaid was never Tommy\u2019s siren. His true siren is revealed a little later.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor Dafoe, the homoeroticism in the film is blatant, but it is also used to explore what it means to be a man: \"[[Toxic masculinity]]! They\u2019re pushing each other\u2019s buttons out of fear and out of threat of who they are. And they\u2019re both guilty. They have a sense of guilt, of wrong.

As Wake is being led on all fours by Howard's rope, the scene mimics [[BDSM]] culture, but not sufficiently for Dry: \"It feels like a missed opportunity at best \u2014 and a spineless maneuver at worst \u2014 to invoke themes of dominance and submission, borrowing from queer [[fetish]] culture, without even so much as a genuine erotic exchange\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Psychoanalysis ===\nEggers admitted that he was heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Jung]]<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-lighthouse-robert-eggers-meaning-explained-ending/|title=What the hell did 'The Lighthouse' even mean?|last=Joho|first=Jess|date=October 20, 2019|website=Mashable|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>, and hoped that \"it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] would be furiously eating their popcorn\"<ref name=\":1\" />.

Winslow displays an [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] fixation on his boss Thomas, given his simultaneous fear and admiration of him. Pattinson commented on the father/son dynamic in the film, stating \"I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy\"<ref name=\":1\" />. As the film progresses, Winslow is increasingly \"looking for Willem (Defoe)'s validation\" both as a boss and as a father figure<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dim9GE891gQ|title=Robert Pattinson & Robert Eggers Break Down a Scene from 'The Lighthouse' {{!}} Fandango All Access|last=Fandango All Access|first=|date=29 Oct 2019|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>. Jealous of his access to the lighthouse which symbolizes the phallus, he must kill his father figure in order to gain it.\n\n=== Mythology ===\nEggers was inspired by sailors myths and classical mythology. After finally obtaining the light, and the knowledge of what is in the light, Howard falls to his death down the stairs of the lighthouse and his organs are plucked out by seagulls, invoking the myth of [[Prometheus]]. For Jess Joho, the lighthouse can be seen as a symbol for man's hubris in trying to overcome or conquer nature's most powerful forces. Wake was modeled on [[Proteus]], a \"prophecy-telling ocean god who serves Poseidon\". Not only is he later shown with tentacles and sea creatures stuck to his body, but \"he also makes that uncannily accurate prediction for how Ephraim will die at the end of the movie\". <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nEggers explains his mythological inspiration for the film: it's \"partially because [[Herman Melville|[Herman] Melville]] goes there and partially because I'm sure our unhealthy Jungian leanings you get into classical mythology in this movie\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-lighthouse-movie-ending-explained-twist-robert-eggers|title=Director Robert Eggers Breaks Down the Mysteries of 'The Lighthouse'|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|date=18 Oct 2019|website=Thrillist|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Alcoholism ===\nThe Lighthouse deals explicitly with [[alcoholism]]. Robert Pattinson described Winslow as being early in his sobriety at the start of the film<ref name=\":5\" />. Although Winslow denies the liquor that Wake serves him on his first night, he soon realizes that the water on the island is undrinkable due to the contamination of the water system. He quickly turns to alcohol to cope with the immense labor and his aggressive relationship with Wake.

An international co-production of the United States and Canada, the film was shot in [[black-and-white]] with a [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and currently used aspect ratios|1.19:1 aspect ratio]]. It stars [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] as two lighthouse keepers who start to lose their sanity when a storm strands them on the remote island where they are stationed.\n\nAccording to Eggers, although the final story bears little resemblance to [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s fragment \"[[The Light-House]]\", the film began as an attempt by his brother Max Eggers to do a contemporary take on the Poe story. When the project stalled, Eggers offered to work with his brother and the project evolved into a period thriller with the Poe elements largely removed. Dafoe and Pattinson were cast as the lead characters in February 2018. [[Principal photography]] began on April 9, 2018, and lasted a total of 34 days in Leif Erikson Park in [[Cape Forchu, Nova Scotia]], Canada, and inside a hangar at [[Yarmouth International Airport]] in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]].\n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[2019 Cannes Film Festival|72nd Cannes Film Festival]] on May 19, and was theatrically released on October 18, 2019, by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. The film was praised for its technical aspects (notably the cinematography and production design), Eggers' screenplay and direction, and the performances of the leads. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[92nd Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be set between 400 to 700 words only. -->\nIn the late 19th century, Ephraim Winslow ([[Robert Pattinson]]) serves a contract job as a [[Lighthouse keeper|wickie]] for four weeks on an isolated island off the coast of [[New England]], under the supervision of an irritable elderly man named Thomas Wake ([[Willem Dafoe]]). On the first day, Winslow notices a hole in his cot, finding a small [[scrimshaw]] of a [[mermaid]] within it and stuffing it in his jacket. Winslow observes Wake going up to the lighthouse's lantern room at night and stripping naked. Winslow begins experiencing visions and dreams of giant tentacles in the lighthouse, logs floating in the water and distant images of a mermaid.\n\nOver the course of his stay, Wake demands Winslow take the more taxing jobs\u2014refueling the light, carrying heavy [[kerosene]] containers, and disposing of the two men's [[chamber pot|chamber pots]], all the while refusing to let him enter the lantern room. As the weeks progress, Winslow repeatedly encounters an aggressive one-eyed [[gull]]. Wake warns Winslow that it is bad luck to kill a gull, as he is [[Sailors' superstitions|superstitious]] that they are reincarnated sailors. The weeks continue, and Winslow masturbates to the scrimshaw and continues to see Wake naked. One night at dinner, the two get to know each other and discuss Wake's previous wickie, whom Wake says died shortly after losing his sanity. Winslow reveals that he used to work in Canada as a [[Lumberjack|timberman]], but decided to change professions.\n\nThe day before Winslow is slated to leave, he notices the water pump is releasing bloody water and investigates. He checks the [[cistern]] to see a dying gull floating inside. The one-eyed seagull flies down and attacks Winslow, who grabs it and beats it to death. Soon after, the winds change direction and a storm hits the island that night. The next morning, the relief ferry does not arrive and Winslow sees a body washed up on the shore. He approaches it and realizes that it is a mermaid, which awakens and howls at him. He runs back into the cottage, where Wake informs him that their [[Military rations|rations]] were spoiled by the storm. Winslow inquires about the ferry, but Wake insists that weeks, in fact, have passed since it was due to arrive. They dig up a crate supposed to contain extra rations but find only more alcohol.\n\nMore days pass, the storm continues, and the two men grow closer while remaining adversarial. Winslow has visions of a [[lobster trap]] containing the severed, half-blinded head of Wake's previous wickie. One night, Winslow tells Wake that his real name is Thomas Howard and that he assumed the identity of Ephraim Winslow, his [[Supervisor|foreman]] who died in an accident Howard neglected to stop. Wake accuses Howard of \"spilling his beans\" and Howard tries to leave on a [[dory]], but Wake destroys it with an axe. Wake chases Howard into the cottage, but inside, Wake claims that it was Howard who attacked him. With no alcohol left, the two begin mixing spirits out of [[turpentine]] and [[honey]], and the storm becomes so powerful that waves crash through the cottage's windows.\n\nThe next morning, Howard finds Wake's logbook, in which Wake has written a critical report of Howard's performance and recommended he be sacked without pay. Wake chides Howard while Howard accuses him of gaslighting and begs him to see the light in the lantern room. Wake berates Howard and Howard attacks him. While seeing visions of the mermaid, Wake as a sea monster, and the real Winslow, Howard beats Wake into submission. Howard leashes Wake and buries him alive while he curses Howard to a \"[[Prometheus|Promethean]] fate.\" Howard takes the keys and prepares to go up to the lantern room, but Wake appears and strikes him with the axe. Howard disarms Wake and kills him before ascending the lighthouse. He approaches the [[Fresnel lens]], and it stops and opens up to him. Howard gazes into the mirrored interior in ecstasy and reaches in, letting out distorted screams as the light brightens before slipping, breaking his leg and falling down the steps. A still-alive Howard is finally seen lying naked on the rocks and missing an eye as several gulls peck at his innards.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''The Lighthouse'' began as an attempt by [[Max Eggers]] to adapt \"[[The Light-House]],\" an unfinished short story by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. [[Robert Eggers]] became aware of his brother's effort while trying to pitch his debut feature, ''[[The Witch (2015 film)|The Witch]]'', to studios. Max's project stalled, after which Robert offered to work on it based on his own vision. The final story, co-written by Robert and Max, bears no resemblance to the Poe work apart from the title.<ref name=RS1025>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-interview-898545/ |title=Drunken Sailors and Movie Stars: Robert Eggers on Making 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=David |last=Fear |date=October 25, 2019 |accessdate=November 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe literature of [[Maine]]-based writer [[Sarah Orne Jewett]] served as a significant point of reference for the dialects used in ''The Lighthouse''. Maritime and surrealistic elements from the works of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] also informed the writing of the film. According to Eggers, a 19th-century incident at [[Smalls Lighthouse]] in Wales involving two lighthouse keepers (both named Thomas, as in the film) was an additional source of inspiration.<ref name=RS1025/>\n\n===Casting===\nIn February 2018, it was announced [[Willem Dafoe]] had been cast in the film.<ref name=DL0207>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/ |title=Willem Dafoe Alights For Robert Eggers-Directed 'The Lighthouse' |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Mike |last=Fleming Jr. |date=February 7, 2018 |accessdate=April 9, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415093602/https://deadline.com/2018/02/willem-dafoe-robert-eggers-the-lighthouse-the-florida-project-a24-new-regency-1202281074/|archive-date=April 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dafoe had previously contacted Robert Eggers via email, expressing his admiration for ''The Witch'' and offering to work with the director in the future.

As Wake is being led on all fours by Howard's rope, the scene mimics [[BDSM]] culture, but not sufficiently for Dry: \"It feels like a missed opportunity at best \u2014 and a spineless maneuver at worst \u2014 to invoke themes of dominance and submission, borrowing from queer [[fetish]] culture, without even so much as a genuine erotic exchange\".<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Psychoanalysis ===\nEggers admitted that he was heavily influenced by the work of [[Carl Jung]]<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/article/the-lighthouse-robert-eggers-meaning-explained-ending/|title=What the hell did 'The Lighthouse' even mean?|last=Joho|first=Jess|date=October 20, 2019|website=Mashable|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>, and hoped that \"it\u2019s a movie where both Jung and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] would be furiously eating their popcorn\"<ref name=\":1\" />. According to Pattinson the [[Phallus|phallic]] imagery of the lighthouse is explicit, as Eggers's described it as an erect penis in the script<ref name=\":1\" />.The film was meant to include \u201ca very juvenile shot of a lighthouse moving like an erect penis and a match-cut to [Pattinson's] actual erect penis\u201d, although this cut was removed upon request by financiers<ref name=\":2\" />. Winslow displays an [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal]] fixation on his boss Thomas, given his simultaneous fear and admiration of him. Pattinson commented on the father/son dynamic in the film, stating \"I was pretty conscious of how I wanted the relationship to come across. In a lot of ways, he sort of wants a daddy\"<ref name=\":1\" />. As the film progresses, Winslow is increasingly \"looking for Willem (Defoe)'s validation\" both as a boss and as a father figure<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dim9GE891gQ|title=Robert Pattinson & Robert Eggers Break Down a Scene from 'The Lighthouse' {{!}} Fandango All Access|last=Fandango All Access|first=|date=29 Oct 2019|website=Youtube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>. Jealous of his access to the lighthouse which symbolizes the phallus, he must kill his father figure in order to gain it.\n\n=== Mythology ===\nEggers was inspired by sailors myths and classical mythology. After finally obtaining the light, and the knowledge of what is in the light, Howard falls to his death down the stairs of the lighthouse and his organs are plucked out by seagulls, invoking the myth of [[Prometheus]]. For Jess Joho, the lighthouse can be seen as a symbol for man's hubris in trying to overcome or conquer nature's most powerful forces. Wake was modeled on [[Proteus]], a \"prophecy-telling ocean god who serves Poseidon\". Not only is he later shown with tentacles and sea creatures stuck to his body, but \"he also makes that uncannily accurate prediction for how Ephraim will die at the end of the movie\". <ref name=\":4\" />\n\nEggers explains his mythological inspiration for the film: it's \"partially because [[Herman Melville|[Herman] Melville]] goes there and partially because I'm sure our unhealthy Jungian leanings you get into classical mythology in this movie\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-lighthouse-movie-ending-explained-twist-robert-eggers|title=Director Robert Eggers Breaks Down the Mysteries of 'The Lighthouse'|last=Zuckerman|first=Esther|date=18 Oct 2019|website=Thrillist|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Alcoholism ===\nThe Lighthouse deals explicitly with [[alcoholism]]. Robert Pattinson described Winslow as being early in his sobriety at the start of the film<ref name=\":5\" />. Although Winslow denies the liquor that Wake serves him on his first night, he soon realizes that the water on the island is undrinkable due to the contamination of the water system. He quickly turns to alcohol to cope with the immense labor and his aggressive relationship with Wake. Manohla Dargus of the ''New York Times'' notes that \"the men\u2019s sloppy, alcohol-saturated time together produces intimacy but also menace. They laugh, descending into riotous drunkenness and finding connection that both they and Eggers skitter around.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/movies/the-lighthouse-review.html|title=\u2018The Lighthouse\u2019 Review: Dark Nights, Troubled Souls, Hairy Men|date=16 Oct 2019|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Their alcoholism in many ways enables the homoerotic themes in the film.\n\n==Release==\n''The Lighthouse'' had its world premiere at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in the [[Directors' Fortnight]] section on May 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/ |title=Cannes: Directors' Fortnight Includes Robert Pattinson Pic 'The Lighthouse', Takashi Miike, Netflix Film 'Wounds' & Luca Guadagnino Short |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Andreas |last=Wiseman |date=April 23, 2019 |accessdate=April 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423123423/https://deadline.com/2019/04/cannes-directors-fortnight-lineup-includes-wounds-netflix-1202600277/|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also screened at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and the [[Atlantic Film Festival]] in September 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brent |title=Toronto Film Festival: 'Joker,' 'Ford v Ferrari,' 'Hustlers' Among Big Premieres |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=July 23, 2019 |date=July 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723140739/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/toronto-film-festival-joker-ford-v-ferrari-hustlers-lineup-1203275868/ |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The film was distributed by [[A24 (company)|A24]] in North America and by [[Focus Features]] internationally.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hopewell |first1=John |title=Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe's 'The Lighthouse' Wins Cannes Critics' Award |url=https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |accessdate=June 19, 2019 |work=Variety |publisher=Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media, LLC |date=May 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608234429/https://variety.com/2019/film/news/robert-pattinson-willem-defoe-the-lighthouse-critics-award-cannes-film-festival-1203225940/ |archive-date=June 8, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was released on October 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/ |title='The Lighthouse' First Trailer: Robert Pattinson, Willem Dafoe Go Mad in A24 Psychodrama |website=[[IndieWire]] |first=Zack |last=Sharf |date=July 30, 2019 |accessdate=July 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730130858/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/the-lighthouse-trailer-robert-pattinson-willem-dafoe-1202161881/|archive-date=July 30, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nIn its limited opening weekend on October 18, the film grossed $419,764 from eight theaters, for an average of $52,471 per venue.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-zombieland-double-tap-weekend-box-office-1202763525/ |title= 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' No Magic With $36M+, 'Joker' Still Stealing 2nd Place From 'Zombieland 2' With $28M+ |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=October 20, 2019 |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref> In its second weekend the film expanded to 586 theaters, grossing $3 million and finishing eighth at the box office.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://deadline.com/2019/10/joker-maleficent-2-black-and-blue-countdown-halloween-box-office-weekend-1202769043/ |title= 'Joker' Has The Edge Over 'Maleficent: Mistress Of Evil' With $18.9M In Fierce Slow Pre-Halloween B.O.
