Written by [[Jennifer Celotta]],  and directed by [[Paul Feig]], the episode first aired in the United States on November 22, 2005 on [[NBC]]. The episode guest starred [[Ken Jeong]] and [[Omi Vaidya]].\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, the company tech support employee gives [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) the ability to read his employees' emails, causing him to find out that [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) is throwing a party that Michael was not invited to. Meanwhile, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) begins to suspect that [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]])  might secretly be having a relationship.\n\nKen Jeong explained that, while all the scenes were scripted, the actors were allowed to improvise their lines during the improv shots. Omi Vaidya revealed that, during the party scenes, the cast were allowed to drink real [[beer]] and play video games on an [[Xbox 360]]. \"Email Surveillance\" received largely positive reviews from television critics. The episode earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 3.9 in the 18\u201349 demographic and was viewed by 8.3 million viewers in its original broadcast.\n\n==Plot==\nDunder Mifflin's tech support employee, [[List of characters from The Office (US T.V. series)#Sadiq|Sadiq]] ([[Omi Vaidya]]), arrives at the Scranton branch to set up a system that allows [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) to monitor his employees' emails. When everyone in the office finds out, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) worries that Michael will discover the party he is throwing that night, to which Michael is not invited. Inevitably, Michael notices and tries to get Jim to admit that he's having a party, while Jim acts nonchalantly as if nothing is happening. In order to keep [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) from exposing the party, Jim tells him that it is a surprise party for Michael.\n\n[[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) notices some things that lead her to suspect that Dwight and [[Angela Martin]] ([[Angela Kinsey]]) are dating. However, she discreetly abandons her suspicions when she asks [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis Lapin]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) if she noticed any office romances and Phyllis guesses that Pam meant her and Jim. Jim and Pam bond when she sees Jim's room for the first time and looks through his high school yearbook.\n\nAfter ruining an [[Improvisational theater|improv]] class, Michael decides to crash Jim's party, much to the staff's dismay and Dwight's na\u00efve delight. Michael awkwardly tries his hand at karaoke but Jim then joins in, easing the tension considerably. The documentary crew catches Angela and Dwight making out in Jim's backyard.\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Omi Vaidya.JPG\n| width2 = 169\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The episode co-stars [[Ken Jeong]] ''(left)'' and [[Omi Vaidya]] ''(right)''\n}}\n\n\"Email Surveillance\" was written by [[Jennifer Celotta]], making it her first writing contribution to the series.<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode |title=Email Surveillance |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (U.S. TV series) |credits=[[Jennifer Celotta]] (writer); [[Paul Feig]] (director) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=November 22, 2005 |season=2 |number=9}}</ref> This episode was the fourth episode of the series directed by [[Paul Feig]].

It first aired on July 12, 2000. The episode involved main character [[Peter Griffin]] establishing his house as an independent nation (or [[micronation]]), and then becoming under siege by the U.S. Army after invading their territory. The episode is rated [[TV-14|TV-14 DLS]] and is the only episode of the series to be animated by [[CNK International|Koko Enterprise]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes jealous of his friends who have bought luxuries with their [[tax refund]]s, and plans to build a backyard [[swimming pool]]. After learning that he has no right to build it, he attempts to acquire a [[zoning]] [[Variance (land use)|variance]] from [[City Hall]]. However, as he and [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] examine the map of Quahog, they discover that the Griffins' property is actually not incorporated into Quahog, and thus is not even a part of the [[United States]]. Peter thus declares his house to be the new independent [[micronation]] of \"Petoria\". He spends the night on a \"[[Goodwill Ambassador|goodwill]] mission\" in Quahog, drinking at the Drunken Clam, and flaunts his [[diplomatic immunity]] by committing crimes.\n\nWhile representing Petoria at the [[United Nations]] headquarters in [[New York City]], Peter and his country are humiliated by [[Kofi Annan|the Secretary General]] and other representatives because of his country's smaller size.

Following his advice, Peter \"invades\" Joe's swimming pool next door. In response to this illegal action, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] agrees to impose sanctions upon Petoria. Days later, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] surrounds Petoria.  Peter refuses to surrender, leading to conflict with his family, who are living without basic amenities due to the siege. He invites the leaders of several countries hostile to the United States over for a [[pool party]] and [[barbecue]]. Not long afterwards, Lois witnesses Stewie imitating an Arab yell, which is enough for her to defect to the U.S. with her children. Peter finally surrenders when an American missile is pointed at him. At the negotiating table with Mayor West, Peter cedes Petoria back to the U.S., but feels better when Lois offers to comfort him every night.\n\nIt is then revealed that the events of the episode were part of a film being shown to [[social studies]] students 200 years into the future, explaining the brief history of Petoria.

Written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], and directed by [[Charles McDougall]], the episode first aired in the United States on March 2, 2006 on [[NBC]].\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) helps [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) with an important speech that he is going to give. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plans a vacation to avoid [[Pam Beesly]]'s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) wedding.\n\nThe speech scene employed over 500 extras, an unusual occurrence for the series. Much of Dwight's speech is based upon a real speech by [[Italy|Italian]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]]. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. In its original broadcast, \"Dwight's Speech\" earned a Nielsen rating of 4.4 in the 18\u201349 demographic, being viewed by 8.4 million viewers.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) is named [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]] Salesman of the Year and must make a speech at an association meeting at the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]], getting some assistance from [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]). Before he leaves, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him tips on how to give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[fascism|fascist]] dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the office, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) begins to write invitations for her approaching wedding with help from [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) and [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]). Kelly talks about her dreams of getting married someday and is visibly hurt when Ryan responds to her flirtatious question about future weddings by saying he doesn't think he'll ever tie the knot; when Kelly leaves the room, Pam advises Ryan to be considerate of Kelly's feelings but Ryan curtly notes \"I know what I said.\" Jim makes plans for a vacation anywhere away from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. While that is going on, the other employees subtly duel over the thermostat. At the end of the episode, Jim tells Pam that he will be going to Australia and unfortunately, he will be missing her wedding because of it.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Benito mussolini28.jpg|Parts of Dwight's speech were taken from a speech given by [[Benito Mussolini]].|200px|thumb|right]]\n\"Dwight's Speech\" was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], making it his second directing credit after the earlier [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Christmas Party (The Office)|Christmas Party]]\".<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode| title=Dwight's Speech | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director); [[Paul Lieberstein]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=March 2, 2006 | season = 2 | number = 17}}</ref><ref name=\"episode2\">{{cite episode| title=Christmas Party | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director); [[Michael Schur]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=December 6, 2005 | season = 2 | number = 10}}</ref> \"Dwight's Speech\" was written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who plays human resources director [[Toby Flenderson]].<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> Lieberstein later revealed that Jim never went on his trip to Australia, noting \"The whole Pam thing took him by surprise, he transferred and then wasn\u2019t really up for vacation.

According to actress [[Jenna Fischer]], she and [[Kate Flannery]] stayed in character and acted out mundane talking scenes. Although they were not recorded, the dialogue was very detailed. In a guest post written for ''[[TV Guide]]'', Fischer described several of the conversations, which ranged from Pam and Meredith discussing \"the problems with the new quality-assurance computer-input program\", that the computers don't \"accept both alpha and numeric characters\", \"backlog [of] receipts dating to 2001\", and that Dunder Mifflin \"changed to all-numeric product codes in 2004 and the computer system does not allow for the earlier records.\"<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Presents-Dwights-39676.aspx |title=The Office Presents: 'Dwight's Speech' |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |last=Fischer |first=Jenna |date=March 2, 2006 |work= |publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref>\n\nThe speech scene employed over 500 extras, which was unusual for ''The Office'', and was hectic for the crew to organize.<ref name=\"Fischer\"/> Jim claims that he stole pieces of Dwight's speech from Mussolini. The first line of Dwight's speech, \"Blood alone moves the wheels of history\", is paraphrased from a speech Mussolini gave in [[Parma]] on December 13, 1914, advocating Italian entry into [[World War I]]. The actual quote is, \"It is blood which moves the wheels of history!\"<ref>Mussolini and Severino, p. 17</ref>  The line \"I say to you, and you'll understand, that it is a privilege to fight\" in turn is taken from the Mussolini's Declaration of War against the United States, where he said, \"I say, and you all feel, that it is a privilege to fight with them.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mussolini|first1=Benito|title=Translation:Declaration of War Against the United States, by Benito Mussolini.

Notable cut scenes include Dwight coming to work wearing sunglasses, Michael criticizing Dwight's speaking skills, Dwight trying to tell another joke to the office, Ryan bringing the wrong type of stamps for Pam's wedding invitations, and an extended scene of Michael's unfunny and extremely awkward speech.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=2006 |title=Deleted scenes for \"Dwight's Speech\" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Two'' Disc 2 }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn order to practice his public speaking skills, Dwight tries to convince the office that [[Brad Pitt]] was in a car accident. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) then states that it \"is [[karma]] because of what he did to [[Jennifer Aniston]].\"<ref name=\"Giant\"/> During the meeting in the break room Dwight references ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''.

Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[fascism|fascist]] dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the office, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) begins to write invitations for her approaching wedding with help from [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) and [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]). Kelly talks about her dreams of getting married someday and is visibly hurt when Ryan responds to her flirtatious question about future weddings by saying he doesn't think he'll ever tie the knot; when Kelly leaves the room, Pam advises Ryan to be considerate of Kelly's feelings but Ryan curtly notes \"I know what I said.\" Jim makes plans for a vacation anywhere away from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. While that is going on, the other employees subtly duel over the thermostat. At the end of the episode, Jim tells Pam that he will be going to Australia and unfortunately, he will be missing her wedding because of it.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Benito mussolini28.jpg|Parts of Dwight's speech were taken from a speech given by [[Benito Mussolini]].|200px|thumb|right]]\n\"Dwight's Speech\" was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], making it his second directing credit after the earlier [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Christmas Party (The Office)|Christmas Party]]\".<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode| title=Dwight's Speech | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director); [[Paul Lieberstein]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=March 2, 2006 | season = 2 | number = 17}}</ref><ref name=\"episode2\">{{cite episode| title=Christmas Party | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director); [[Michael Schur]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=December 6, 2005 | season = 2 | number = 10}}</ref> \"Dwight's Speech\" was written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who plays human resources director [[Toby Flenderson]].<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> Lieberstein later revealed that Jim never went on his trip to Australia, noting \"The whole Pam thing took him by surprise, he transferred and then wasn\u2019t really up for vacation.

According to actress [[Jenna Fischer]], she and [[Kate Flannery]] stayed in character and acted out mundane talking scenes. Although they were not recorded, the dialogue was very detailed. In a guest post written for ''[[TV Guide]]'', Fischer described several of the conversations, which ranged from Pam and Meredith discussing \"the problems with the new quality-assurance computer-input program\", that the computers don't \"accept both alpha and numeric characters\", \"backlog [of] receipts dating to 2001\", and that Dunder Mifflin \"changed to all-numeric product codes in 2004 and the computer system does not allow for the earlier records.\"<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Office-Presents-Dwights-39676.aspx |title=The Office Presents: 'Dwight's Speech' |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |last=Fischer |first=Jenna |date=March 2, 2006 |work= |publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}</ref>\n\nThe speech scene employed over 500 extras, which was unusual for ''The Office'', and was hectic for the crew to organize.<ref name=\"Fischer\"/> Jim claims that he stole pieces of Dwight's speech from Mussolini. The first line of Dwight's speech, \"Blood alone moves the wheels of history\", is paraphrased from a speech Mussolini gave in [[Parma]] on December 13, 1914, advocating Italian entry into [[World War I]]. The actual quote is, \"It is blood which moves the wheels of history!\"<ref>Mussolini and Severino, p. 17</ref>  The line \"I say to you, and you'll understand, that it is a privilege to fight\" in turn is taken from the Mussolini's Declaration of War against the United States, where he said, \"I say, and you all feel, that it is a privilege to fight with them.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mussolini|first1=Benito|title=Translation:Declaration of War Against the United States, by Benito Mussolini.

Notable cut scenes include Dwight coming to work wearing sunglasses, Michael criticizing Dwight's speaking skills, Dwight trying to tell another joke to the office, Ryan bringing the wrong type of stamps for Pam's wedding invitations, and an extended scene of Michael's unfunny and extremely awkward speech.<ref>{{cite video |people= |date=2006 |title=Deleted scenes for \"Dwight's Speech\" | medium=DVD |publisher=[[Universal Studios Home Entertainment]] |location=''The Office: Season Two'' Disc 2 }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn order to practice his public speaking skills, Dwight tries to convince the office that [[Brad Pitt]] was in a car accident. [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) then states that it \"is [[karma]] because of what he did to [[Jennifer Aniston]].\"<ref name=\"Giant\"/> During the meeting in the break room Dwight references ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]''. Michael later references the movie at the actual convention when he is filling time for Dwight.<ref name=\"Giant\"/> When Jim asks the office where he should go for vacation, Kevin tells him he should go to [[Hedonism Resorts]], describing it as \"Club Med, only everything is naked.\"<ref name=\"Giant\"/> Toby tells him he should go to [[Amsterdam]], while Creed informs him that he should go to [[Hong Kong]].

Written by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]], it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the [[United States]] on October 27, 2004, just before the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]].\n\nIn the episode, [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] protested against the use of a cow as South Park Elementary's mascot. The student body holds an election to determine a new mascot. As the election approaches, Kyle tries to convince everyone that his candidate, a giant douche, is better than Cartman's nominee, a turd sandwich. Meanwhile, Stan ends up getting [[exile]]d from South Park after refusing to vote.\n\n== Plot ==\nDuring a [[pep rally]] at South Park Elementary, a group of local [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]] protest the use of a cow as the school's mascot. The school agrees to pick a new mascot, and the students are told to vote for said new mascot. Embarrassed by the bland choices, the kids decide to fill in a joke candidate but disagree as to whether it should be a \"giant [[douche]]\" or a \"[[Feces|turd]] sandwich\". [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] rallies his friends to fill in the giant douche, and [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] gathers support for the turd sandwich.  The result is that the two joke candidates get the most votes and the students must choose between the two in an election.\n\n[[Stan Marsh|Stan]] does not see the point in voting between a giant douche and a turd sandwich as they are exactly the same in his opinion, and declares that he will not vote at all, much to everyone's dismay. Stan is equally dismayed, wondering why anyone would care about such a pointless exercise. He talks about it with his parents at dinner, but his parents are not impressed with his apathy and even get into a fight over who should win when Stan explains who the two competitors are. This results in Kyle calling on Sean \"[[Puff Daddy]]\" Combs, who intimidates Stan with a literal [[Citizen Change|Vote or Die]] campaign. Meanwhile, the campaign continues, with the turd sandwich supporters rallying against the giant douche supporters, using [[bribery]] and [[fear mongering]] to gain support.\n\nBy the time of the election, Stan agrees to vote after being chased by Combs and his associates through the streets with guns. However, he realizes Kyle only wanted him to vote in order for giant douche to win when he votes turd sandwich and Kyle demands that he change his vote. Disgusted with this electoral process, Stan once again refuses to vote. The school administration decides that Stan must be banished from the town for all eternity or until he decides that voting is important. He is spat on by the townspeople and his shirt is ripped off piece by piece before being placed on a horse, bound with a bucket over his head, and send him off into the woods with Butters's father blowing a horn to signal the horse to escort Stan.\n\nStan's horse randomly takes him to a PETA compound where he finds that PETA's members live with animals, practicing [[zoophilia]] and even interbreeding with them. Stan explains his banishment to the PETA, who tells him that an election \"is always between a douche and a turd\", because they are the only people who suck up enough to make it that far in politics. Combs shows up at the camp to kill Stan, but is distracted by a PETA member who throws a bucket of red paint on his fur coat. Combs and his posse retaliate by gunning down all the PETA members. The animals flee as they anticipate the fate of the PETA members (and do not care), and Stan manages to escape, only to suffer a minor injury on his arm.\n\nReturning to South Park, Stan is finally convinced to vote and chooses turd sandwich. Despite his vote, the giant douche still wins the vote 1410 to 36. Stan initially points out that his vote did not matter, but his parents inform their son that all votes matter even if it is for the losing side. Suddenly, [[Mr. Garrison]] runs in with the news that the PETA members have been discovered murdered. As a result, the cow is reinstated as South Park Elementary School's mascot. Randy tells Stan that ''now'' his vote did not matter, leaving an appalled expression on Stan as he went through so much for nothing.\n\n==Reception and release==\n''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' described the episode as being \"the epitome of everything great about the show\".<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/07/09/south_park_best_episode_ever_is_douche_and_turd_video.html \"Gateway Episodes: South Park\"].

{"title_page": "Battle of Aspromonte", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2008}}\n[[File:Garibaldi attacked by Italian Troops at Aspromonte..jpg|thumb|300px|Garibaldi attacked by Italian Troops at Aspromonte]]\nThe '''Battle of Aspromonte''', also known as '''The Day of Aspromonte''' (in [[Italian language|Italian]]: \"La Giornata dell'Aspromonte\"), was a battle that took place on 29 August 1862, and was an inconclusive episode of the [[Italian unification]] process. The battle is named after the mountain [[Aspromonte]] in southern [[Italy]], which is near the place where the battle occurred. In the battle, the [[Royal Italian Army]] defeated [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s army of volunteers, who were marching from [[Sicily]] towards [[Rome]], with the intent of annexing it into the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In the battle, which took place a few kilometers from [[Gambarie]], Garibaldi was wounded and taken prisoner.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Roman Question}}\nWhen [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] became the King of Italy on 17 March 1861, the newly created [[Kingdom of Italy]] did not include [[Venice]] and [[Rome]]. These \"[[Italian irredentism|unredeemed]]\" cities, as they would be called a few decades later, were a constant cause of friction in Italian politics. The dispute concerning Rome, specifically known as the \"Roman Question\", had arisen after the Italian Parliament had declared Rome capital of the Kingdom on 27 March 1861. This conflicted with [[Pope Pius IX]]'s intent to maintain his temporal control of the city.\n\nMembers of the government of the Kingdom of Italy had different perspectives on this issue, and the internal tensions that followed caused Prime Minister [[Bettino Ricasoli]] to resign in 1862. While his successor, [[Urbano Rattazzi]], was known for his disrespectful attitude towards the [[Holy See]], the Kingdom of Italy maintained a low profile on the Roman Question after Rattazzi's election.\n\nMeanwhile, General [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] reached [[Sicily]] and began to form an army, with the intent of marching on Rome. The intransigent reaction of [[France]] (which was, at the time, the most influential ally of Italy) and the Pope caused the Italian government to intervene. On 3 August, Victor Emmanuel II officially condemned Garibaldi's \"guilty impatience\", and Rattazzi sent the Royal Army, at the orders of general [[Enrico Cialdini]], to stop Garibaldi.\n\n==The battle==\n[[File:The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Garibaldi wounded on the Aspromonte (by [[Gerolamo Induno]])]]\nGaribaldi was known and respected as a hero by most Italians, including most soldiers in the Royal Army and Navy. Several actions that occurred reveal that neither Garibaldi nor his opponents were willing to enter open combat, or cause too much damage to their opponent.\n\nAlthough Garibaldi's ships had likely been detected by the Royal Navy while they were crossing the [[Strait of Messina]] to reach land in Calabria, the Royal Army only attacked when Garibaldi's army had actually reached land, possibly to keep losses to a minimum. Garibaldi himself did not immediately counter-attack the Royal Army, instead trying to circumvent it by crossing the [[Aspromonte]] mountains.\n\nGaribaldi's army marched for three days; on 28 August 1862, the leading regiment, led by Garibaldi, camped near [[Gambarie]], where the rest of his army was expected to arrive in a few days. On 29 August, before Garibaldi's army was reunited, [[Bersaglieri]] from the Royal Army reached Garibaldi's camp and attacked.\n\nGaribaldi ordered his army not to open fire \"on our brothers\", and some Bersaglieri changed sides during the battle, joining Garibaldi's volunteers. However, despite Garibaldi's order, one wing of his regiment mounted a counter-attack against the Bersaglieri. During the altercation, two bullets hit Garibaldi's [[hip]] and [[malleolus]]. A cease-fire was declared shortly thereafter, and Garibaldi surrendered.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle lasted for about ten minutes and resulted in around 15 casualties. Garibaldi, now wounded, was immediately assisted by surgeons and taken prisoner; he was later sent to the jail at [[Varignano, La Spezia|Varignano]], near [[Porto Venere]]. Garibaldi and his volunteers received amnesty on 5 October 1862; Garibaldi officially retired to [[Caprera]], where he remained for two years.\n\nThe Day of Aspromonte caused both national and international criticism towards the Italian government, and caused the debate in Italy to become even harsher. [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s party declared that, after the events of Aspromonte, any silent agreement between the Monarchy and the Republicans had been factually broken; supporters of the Monarchy maintained that the Republicans' support for such rash initiatives as Garibaldi's expedition proved that they were too irresponsible to lead the nation.

The battle is named after the mountain [[Aspromonte]] in southern [[Italy]], which is near the place where the battle occurred. In the battle, the [[Royal Italian Army]] defeated [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s army of volunteers, who were marching from [[Sicily]] towards [[Rome]], with the intent of annexing it into the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In the battle, which took place a few kilometers from [[Gambarie]], Garibaldi was wounded and taken as prisoner.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Roman Question}}\nWhen [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]] became the King of Italy on 17 March 1861, the newly created [[Kingdom of Italy]] did not include [[Venice]] and [[Rome]]. These \"[[Italian irredentism|unredeemed]]\" cities, as they would be called a few decades later, were a constant cause of friction in Italian politics. The dispute concerning Rome, specifically known as the \"Roman Question\", had arisen after the Italian Parliament had declared Rome capital of the Kingdom on 27 March 1861. This conflicted with [[Pope Pius IX]]'s intent to maintain his temporal control of the city.\n\nMembers of the government of the Kingdom of Italy had different perspectives on this issue, and the internal tensions that followed caused Prime Minister [[Bettino Ricasoli]] to resign in 1862. While his successor, [[Urbano Rattazzi]], was known for his disrespectful attitude towards the [[Holy See]], the Kingdom of Italy maintained a low profile on the Roman Question after Rattazzi's election.\n\nMeanwhile, General [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] reached [[Sicily]] and began to form an army, with the intent of marching on Rome. The intransigent reaction of [[France]] (which was, at the time, the most influential ally of Italy) and the Pope caused the Italian government to intervene. On 3 August, Victor Emmanuel II officially condemned Garibaldi's \"guilty impatience\", and Rattazzi sent the Royal Army, at the orders of general [[Enrico Cialdini]], to stop Garibaldi.\n\n==The battle==\n[[File:The Injured Garibaldi in the Aspromonte Mountains (oil on canvas).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Garibaldi wounded on the Aspromonte (by [[Gerolamo Induno]])]]\nGaribaldi was known and respected as a hero by most Italians, including most soldiers in the Royal Army and Navy. Several actions that occurred reveal that neither Garibaldi nor his opponents were willing to enter open combat, or cause too much damage to their opponent.\n\nAlthough Garibaldi's ships had likely been detected by the Royal Navy while they were crossing the [[Strait of Messina]] to reach land in Calabria, the Royal Army only attacked when Garibaldi's army had actually reached land, possibly to keep losses to a minimum. Garibaldi himself did not immediately counter-attack the Royal Army, instead trying to circumvent it by crossing the [[Aspromonte]] mountains.\n\nGaribaldi's army marched for three days; on 28 August 1862, the leading regiment, led by Garibaldi, camped near [[Gambarie]], where the rest of his army was expected to arrive in a few days. On 29 August, before Garibaldi's army was reunited, [[Bersaglieri]] from the Royal Army reached Garibaldi's camp and attacked.\n\nGaribaldi ordered his army not to open fire \"on our brothers\", and some Bersaglieri changed sides during the battle, joining Garibaldi's volunteers. However, despite Garibaldi's order, one wing of his regiment mounted a counter-attack against the Bersaglieri. During the altercation, two bullets hit Garibaldi's [[hip]] and [[malleolus]]. A cease-fire was declared shortly thereafter, and Garibaldi surrendered.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle lasted for about ten minutes and resulted in around 15 casualties. Garibaldi, now wounded, was immediately assisted by surgeons and taken as a prisoner; he was later sent to the jail at [[Varignano, La Spezia|Varignano]], near [[Porto Venere]]. Garibaldi and his volunteers received amnesty on 5 October 1862; Garibaldi officially retired to [[Caprera]], where he remained for two years.\n\nThe Day of Aspromonte caused both national and international criticism towards the Italian government, and caused the debate in Italy to become even harsher. [[Giuseppe Mazzini]]'s party declared that, after the events of Aspromonte, any silent agreement between the Monarchy and the Republicans had been factually broken; supporters of the Monarchy maintained that the Republicans' support for such rash initiatives as Garibaldi's expedition proved that they were too irresponsible to lead the nation. Commentators accused the government of betraying the Italian revolution and being more supportive of the Pope than of Italy itself.  \n\nIn 1863, Rattazzi was replaced by [[Marco Minghetti]], who leveraged on the facts of Aspromonte to negotiate a treaty with France (the [[September Convention]]), in which Italy would protect the frontiers of the [[Papal States]] against foreign attacks, and France would withdraw its troops from Rome within two years.  \n\nDespite the September Convention, annexing Rome remained an implicit objective of Italy. Garibaldi tried to march on Rome again in 1867. Eventually, the ''Questione Romana'' was solved under Italian Prime Minister [[Giovanni Lanza]], when [[Capture of Rome|Rome was finally captured]] in 1870.\n\n==In popular culture==\nA popular Italian [[nursery rhyme]], ''Garibaldi fu ferito'' (\"Garibaldi was wounded\"), set to the melody of [[Bersaglieri]]'s anthem, refers to the Battle of Aspromonte.
