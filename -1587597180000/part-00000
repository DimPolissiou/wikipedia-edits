Sinatra and Granz made a handshake deal, but negotiations broke down over price and Sinatra's desire that Granz remain head of the label. Granz sold Verve to [[MGM]] in 1961. Sinatra established [[Reprise Records]] and hired [[Mo Ostin]], an executive at Verve, to run it. At Verve, [[Creed Taylor]] was made head producer. Taylor adopted a more commercial approach, terminating several contracts. He brought [[bossa nova]] to America with the release of ''[[Jazz Samba]]'' by [[Stan Getz]] and [[Charlie Byrd]], ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'', and ''Rain Forest'' by [[Walter Wanderley]]. Verve's arrangers included [[Claus Ogerman]] and [[Oliver Nelson]]. According to Ogerman in ''Jazzletter'', he arranged 60\u201370 albums for Verve from 1963\u20131967.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjbear71.com/Ogerman/Claus-news.html |title=The Work of Claus Ogerman |publisher=Bjbear71.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-28}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Taylor supervised the creation of a [[folk music]] subsidiary named Verve Folkways, later renamed [[Verve Forecast Records|Verve Forecast]]. Taylor left Verve in 1967 to form [[CTI Records]]. Aside from jazz, Verve's catalogue included [[the Righteous Brothers]], [[the Velvet Underground]], [[Frank Zappa]] & [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], and [[the Blues Project]], as well as a series of \"Sound Impressions of an American on Tour\" records, produced in cooperation with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' Magazine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=269\u2013284|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Velvet Underground's records did not sell well initially, they went on to become a major influence in independent rock music.

He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1895 to 1897, and the [[List of Governors of New York|32nd Governor of New York]] from 1897 to 1898.\n\n==Early life==\nBlack was born near [[Limington, Maine|Limington, York County, Maine]] on March 8, 1853, one of eleven children born to Jacob, a farmer, and Charlotte B. Black. He graduated from [[Lebanon, Maine|Lebanon]] Academy in 1871, and taught school while attending [[Dartmouth College]], from which he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1875.\n\n==Start of career==\nAfter completing his education, Black moved to [[Johnstown (city), New York|Johnstown, New York]] to become editor of the ''Johnstown Journal''. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and ardent follower of [[James G. Blaine]], also from Maine, Black changed the political stance of the paper while the Democratic owner was out of town, but was promptly dismissed upon the latter's return. He then moved to [[Troy, New York]], and worked for the ''Troy Whig'' and the ''Troy Times''. While working as a night reporter, he was a clerk in the Troy post office and [[reading law|studied law]] with the firm of Robertson & Foster. Black attained [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in 1879 and began to practice in Troy.\n\nIn 1888, Black campaigned for [[Benjamin Harrison]] for president. In 1892, he campaigned for Harrison's reelection, but Harrison was defeated by former President [[Grover Cleveland]]. In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During his House term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898. A highlight of his governorship was completion of construction on the [[New York State Capitol]], which had fallen far behind schedule and had been plagued with cost overruns.\n\nLater in his term, state officials were accused of squandering more than a million dollars on a project to expand the [[Erie Canal]], which had come to be regarded as a [[boondoggle]] because of delays and excessive costs.

Among the noteworthy cases in which he was involved, Black took part in the defense of Roland B. Molineaux in the famed ''[[People v. Molineux]]'' case. After Molineaux was convicted of murder, the conviction was overturned and he won an acquittal at retrial.

In March 1894, an election day dispute between Republicans and Democrats in Troy culminated with the [[murder of Robert Ross]], a Republican. Black assisted in the prosecution of the defendants, Democrats Bartholomew \"Bat\" Shea and John McGough, who were convicted. McGough was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and Shea was executed.\n\n==U.S. House==\nLargely as a result of the Ross murder case, in November 1894, Black was elected to the [[54th United States Congress]], representing [[New York's 19th congressional district]]. He served from March 4, 1895 to January 7, 1897, when he resigned because he had been elected governor. During bhis Houe term, Black was a member of the Committee on Pacific Railroads and the Committee on Private Land Claims. He was a delegate to the [[1896 Republican National Convention]] and supported [[William McKinley]] for president.\n\n==Governor==\nBlack was elected governor [[New York state election, 1896|in 1896]] and served from January 1, 1897 to December 31, 1898.
