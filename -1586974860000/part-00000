These incarcerated individuals face limited access to medical exams and prescriptions medications compared to the general population as they are not eligible for Medicaid while incarcerated. On top of that, inmates face fees for seeking medical treatment. In 35 states, inmates have medical co-payments which come out of their commissary accounts (made up of prison job payments and contributions from their family). The copays are enforced to prevent inmates from abusing the healthcare system, however, it becomes a burden on inmates whose job makes little to no money and can become a financial strain on the family.\n\n==== Private Healthcare in Public Facilities ====\nIn some prisons, the healthcare is private which can drastically change how inmates are treated. As of 2012, more than 20 states switched over to private health care providers in order to cut back on costs.<ref name=\"publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu\">{{cite web |url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/1736-the-current-state-of-public-and-private-prison/for-students/blog/news.php|title=The Current State of Public and Private Prison Healthcare}}</ref> These states don't have to provide benefits and pension costs to state workers, since they are hiring private companies, which significantly reduces the price they pay. However, this calls into question the quality of care inmates receive and many human rights groups in addition to federal judges are investigating these private companies.\n\n==== Private Healthcare in Private Facilities ====\nThe two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic (formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America) and the CEO Group, run over 170 correctional facilities.<ref name=\"publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu\"/> In Texas, they have five facilities. These companies keep their operating costs low by using less dollars than allocated per inmate, especially in the area of Healthcare. Additionally, these companies and similar ones, avoid taking inmates over 65 or with chronic illnesses. When they can't avoid it, they improvise ways to make it hard for the inmate to receive medical care. Specifically, CoreCivic has a history of denying hospital requests and punishing inmates when they make repeated requests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-corrections-corperation-america-private-prisons-company-profile/|title=The Corrections Corporation of America, by the numbers}}</ref> Additionally, the records of private prisons are not subject to public access laws. For these reasons, access to health care in private prisons is something that must require more scrutiny.\n\n====Requesting Care====\nRequesting care in prison systems involves a simple procedural checklist that must be met in order to see any type of medical professional. Firstly, an incarnated person must fill out Sick Call Request form that should be answered within a 48-hour time period. After 48 hours, If there is no response, the person is to advance to fill out an I-60 form which states general issues faced. If the process continues to yield no approval, a Step 1 Grievance is to filled out. This level of documentation is very strictly reviewed. Continuing to hear no response for an extended period of time indicates the time to advance to a Step 2 Grievance. After these options, the prisoner may now file a lawsuit for \u2018exhausting administrative remedies.\u2019<ref name=\"texaslawhelp.org\">{{cite web |title=Requesting Medical Care in a Texas Prison |url=https://texaslawhelp.org/article/requesting-medical-care-texas-prison |website=texaslawhelp.org |accessdate=9 August 2019|date=2017-04-20 }}</ref>\n\nA Sick Call Request form is a specified form that is specific towards what was wrong with the inmate medically. The progression to an I-60 form leads to a more generalized form that addresses seeing a doctor, contact visit, address changes and the like.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is an I-60 Form? |url=http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-319091.html |website=prisontalk.com |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref> A Step 1 Grievance are very strict and viewed very critically with certain guide-lines such as: only one problem can be addressed per grievance, only one grievance per week, must be reported within 15 days, and must be written with proper language. This form alone may take up to 40 days to be processed. A Step 2 Grievance is directly reviewed by TDCJ health committee and will have a response by 35 days. If these options are still not satisfactory, the inmate is then allowed to file a lawsuit because he/she has \"exhausted administrative remedies.\"<ref name=\"texaslawhelp.org\"/>\n\nCare through these methods is possible but is still a timely cost. Depending on how the prisoner is, the time between signing a form and receiving medication can mean life or death.\n\nEven though there is a defined process for requesting medical care in prison systems, the prisoner is still trying to fill out theses forms while considered \u2018sick.\u2019 Along with this, the prisoners are expected to cover the costs associated with filing out these expensive papers. For the first healthcare visit in a year, an inmate will be charged one-hundred dollars to their trust fund. However, there are still instances where the inmate would not have to attend to cost of care such as chronic illnesses, follow-up visits, emergency treatments, and etc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Notice to Offenders $100.00 Health Care Fee |url=https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/documents/Health_Care_Fee_Notice_To_Offenders_English.pdf |website=tdjc.texas.gov |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost visits to a medical professional costs inmates $2\u20138, in which they use they copay to relief these costs. At first, this rate sounds not too harsh but an important factor to put in is how much inmates earn. For most inmates, a wage is consistent of maybe a few cents per hour. This small set could mean that it would take an inmate a very long time before a \"checkup\" can be \"bought\". Fortunately though, care is not restricted if one does not have the necessary funds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wing |first1=Nick |title=Prisons And Jails Are Forcing Inmates To Pay A Small Fortune Just To See A Doctor |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prison-jail-medical-copays_n_58f64bdbe4b0b9e9848ee23e |website=huffpost.com |accessdate=9 August 2019|date=2017-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) decided that the easiest and most cost-effective way to dole out prescription medications to inmates was to distribute it from their own pharmacy. This pharmacy is based in an unmarked building in Huntsville, TX and serves 130 facilities throughout the state, including juvenile facilities, by filling over 20,000 prescriptions per day. Orders are sent out through an electronic medical record system and are processed with custom made conveyor belts and automated machines. The pharmacy has a 24-hour next-business-day turnaround ensuring medications can get to inmates as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tmc.edu/news/2017/04/health-care-behind-bars/ | title=Health Care Behind Bars| date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=====History of Healthcare=====\nHealthcare in Texas was mostly straight forward. Not much of it was changed over time due to its simplicity. One aspect that did change was how the cost of healthcare for incarcerated persons fluctuated.\n\nAn issue that was prominent in prison systems was the associated costs with treatment. For this reason, the Correctional Managed Health Care Committee (CMHCC) was established in 1993. This committee focused their attention to the rising costs of healthcare today and how that effects inmates inside custody. The CMHCC hopes to open a statewide managed health care plan giving offenders the ability to afford care with timely access.<ref>{{cite web |title=Texas Correctional Managed Care Committee |url=https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/divisions/cmhc/index.html |website=Texas Department of Criminal Justice |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Mental Health ===\n\nThe decline of mental health treatment within detainees has become a major concern in the prison system, especially in the Texas prison departments. While the Texas Department of Criminal Justice claims that most of its facilities are capable of treating mental health issues, this does not seem to be the case.<ref>{{cite web |title=Correctional Managed Health Care Program Summary of Health Care Capabilities by Facility |url=https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/divisions/cmhc/docs/Unit_Medical_Capabilities_Summary.pdf |website=Texas Department of Criminal Justice |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref> Texas provides at least 20% of inmates mental health treatment and this small percentage could be explained by the shortage of volunteers and staff to provide these mental treatments. There is also failure to recognize mental symptoms and make a correct diagnosis for these detainees. Lack of mental aid has increased serious assaults and violent behaviors in which most of these cases have been declined by the Bureau of Prisons for \u201cprivacy reasons.\u201d Policies have been changed by the Bureau of Prisons to increase check-ins by once a month or weekly. However, the TDCJ has attempted to minimize these issues as best as it can. Detainees are offered guidelines on how to manage their stress and sanity before being released to the public. In terms of support and care, there is the Offender Grievance Program that allows offenders to communicate with faculty staff about questions, regards, or concerns associating with their sentence. In addition, the TDCJ Ombudsman Program makes referrals to an agency staff to help resolve problems and answer questions regarding a specific offender. The Peer Recovery Support Services hold classes to allow prisoners to help one another recover from their issues. Those that obtain a certificate from the program are eligible to work or volunteer as a Peer Recovery Support Specialist. This further build a community-based environment where prisoners can understand each other's mistakes and problems and cooperate as a team to provide solutions to better themselves. Specific programs are held for detainees that are of a particular background and history. The Chaplaincy Program is a nondiscriminatory program that permits prisoners to pursue their religious faiths, reconcile relationships, and strengthen families. The program offers mentoring, space for spiritual growth, pastoral care, life skill classes, accountability/support groups, etc. Similarly, the \u201cInnerChange\u201d Faith-Based- Pre-Release Program functions in the same way as the Chaplaincy Program to further help detainees recover well. For younger offenders, the Youthful Offender Program aids young offenders with special needs to the Mentally Retarded Offenders Program (MROP) or Physically Hanicapped Offenders Program (PHOP). Regular youth offenders are placed in interdisciplinary programming established on a weekly schedule, including:\n* education\n* social skills training\n* anger management\n* values development\n* goal setting\n* cognitive restructuring\n* substance abuse education\n* conflict resolution\n* aggression replacement\n* and life skills.\n\n=== Recreation and Fitness ===\n\nLeisure activities are meant for enhancing potential life skills post-release and allowing inmates an opportunity to complete one or two activities of their choice. In terms of recreation and fitness, inmates have the chance to participate in structured fitness sessions that offer regular and moderate levels of exercises monitored by staff. Staff members are to take into account the kind of activity the detainee wants to do, the amount of time spent on that activity, and given permission. These fitness sessions occur in the \u201cBig Yard,\u201d where gym equipment is stored and common past time favorites are held, such as volleyball, baseball, softball, wrestling, basketball, tennis, handball, boxing, and soccer/futbol. The yard is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence for extra supervision. During a detainee's time in prison, they are given a physical assessment that focuses on cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, body fat percentage, and dynamic strength. \nTo further sharpen community-building skills, inmates are eligible to run special fitness and health events, including:\n* Run/Walk Marathons \n* Health fairs; health book fairs\n* Nationally recognized health events\nIn addition to these health events, inmates have the opportunity to educate themselves in other health and sanity organizations. Staff will provide discussions concentrating on: \n* Weight management\n* Stress management\n* Human anatomy\n* Aerobic exercises\n* Smoking cessation\n* Back pain relief\n* Nutrition\nUltimately, prisoners are able to utilize these resources to make them better returning members of society.\n\n====Incarceration of women====\n{{see also|Incarceration of women in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Crain Unit Sign.jpg|thumb|250px|The Christina Crain Unit in Gatesville is the largest TDCJ unit housing women.]]\nThe Correctional Institutions Division has eight main facilities, including five prisons and three state jails, that [[Incarceration of women|house women]];<ref name=\"Unitdir\"/> Five of the women's units,<ref name=\"Gately\">Gately, Paul \"[http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/34929404.html Former Downtown Waco Executive Director Moved to Gatesville].\" ''[[KWTX-TV]]''.

These incarcerated individuals face limited access to medical exams and prescriptions medications compared to the general population as they are not eligible for Medicaid while incarcerated. On top of that, inmates face fees for seeking medical treatment. In 35 states, inmates have medical co-payments which come out of their commissary accounts (made up of prison job payments and contributions from their family). The copays are enforced to prevent inmates from abusing the healthcare system, however, it becomes a burden on inmates whose job makes little to no money and can become a financial strain on the family.\n\n==== Private Healthcare in Public Facilities ====\nIn some prisons, the healthcare is private which can drastically change how inmates are treated. As of 2012, more than 20 states switched over to private health care providers in order to cut back on costs.<ref name=\"publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu\">{{cite web |url=https://publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu/live/news/1736-the-current-state-of-public-and-private-prison/for-students/blog/news.php|title=The Current State of Public and Private Prison Healthcare}}</ref> These states don't have to provide benefits and pension costs to state workers, since they are hiring private companies, which significantly reduces the price they pay. However, this calls into question the quality of care inmates receive and many human rights groups in addition to federal judges are investigating these private companies.\n\n==== Private Healthcare in Private Facilities ====\nThe two largest private prison companies, CoreCivic (formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America) and the CEO Group, run over 170 correctional facilities.<ref name=\"publicpolicy.wharton.upenn.edu\"/> In Texas, they have five facilities. These companies keep their operating costs low by using less dollars than allocated per inmate, especially in the area of Healthcare. Additionally, these companies and similar ones, avoid taking inmates over 65 or with chronic illnesses. When they can't avoid it, they improvise ways to make it hard for the inmate to receive medical care. Specifically, CoreCivic has a history of denying hospital requests and punishing inmates when they make repeated requests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-corrections-corperation-america-private-prisons-company-profile/|title=The Corrections Corporation of America, by the numbers}}</ref> Additionally, the records of private prisons are not subject to public access laws. For these reasons, access to health care in private prisons is something that must require more scrutiny.\n\n====Requesting Care====\nRequesting care in prison systems involves a simple procedural checklist that must be met in order to see any type of medical professional. Firstly, an incarnated person must fill out Sick Call Request form that should be answered within a 48-hour time period. After 48 hours, If there is no response, the person is to advance to fill out an I-60 form which states general issues faced. If the process continues to yield no approval, a Step 1 Grievance is to filled out. This level of documentation is very strictly reviewed. Continuing to hear no response for an extended period of time indicates the time to advance to a Step 2 Grievance. After these options, the prisoner may now file a lawsuit for \u2018exhausting administrative remedies.\u2019<ref name=\"texaslawhelp.org\">{{cite web |title=Requesting Medical Care in a Texas Prison |url=https://texaslawhelp.org/article/requesting-medical-care-texas-prison |website=texaslawhelp.org |accessdate=9 August 2019|date=2017-04-20 }}</ref>\n\nA Sick Call Request form is a specified form that is specific towards what was wrong with the inmate medically. The progression to an I-60 form leads to a more generalized form that addresses seeing a doctor, contact visit, address changes and the like.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is an I-60 Form? |url=http://www.prisontalk.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-319091.html |website=prisontalk.com |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref> A Step 1 Grievance are very strict and viewed very critically with certain guide-lines such as: only one problem can be addressed per grievance, only one grievance per week, must be reported within 15 days, and must be written with proper language. This form alone may take up to 40 days to be processed. A Step 2 Grievance is directly reviewed by TDCJ health committee and will have a response by 35 days. If these options are still not satisfactory, the inmate is then allowed to file a lawsuit because he/she has \"exhausted administrative remedies.\"<ref name=\"texaslawhelp.org\"/>\n\nCare through these methods is possible but is still a timely cost. Depending on how the prisoner is, the time between signing a form and receiving medication can mean life or death.\n\nEven though there is a defined process for requesting medical care in prison systems, the prisoner is still trying to fill out theses forms while considered \u2018sick.\u2019 Along with this, the prisoners are expected to cover the costs associated with filing out these expensive papers. For the first healthcare visit in a year, an inmate will be charged one-hundred dollars to their trust fund. However, there are still instances where the inmate would not have to attend to cost of care such as chronic illnesses, follow-up visits, emergency treatments, and etc.<ref>{{cite web |title=Notice to Offenders $100.00 Health Care Fee |url=https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/documents/Health_Care_Fee_Notice_To_Offenders_English.pdf |website=tdjc.texas.gov |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nMost visits to a medical professional costs inmates $2\u20138, in which they use they copay to relief these costs. At first, this rate sounds not too harsh but an important factor to put in is how much inmates earn. For most inmates, a wage is consistent of maybe a few cents per hour. This small set could mean that it would take an inmate a very long time before a \"checkup\" can be \"bought\". Fortunately though, care is not restricted if one does not have the necessary funds.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wing |first1=Nick |title=Prisons And Jails Are Forcing Inmates To Pay A Small Fortune Just To See A Doctor |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/prison-jail-medical-copays_n_58f64bdbe4b0b9e9848ee23e |website=huffpost.com |accessdate=9 August 2019|date=2017-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) decided that the easiest and most cost-effective way to dole out prescription medications to inmates was to distribute it from their own pharmacy. This pharmacy is based in an unmarked building in Huntsville, TX and serves 130 facilities throughout the state, including juvenile facilities, by filling over 20,000 prescriptions per day. Orders are sent out through an electronic medical record system and are processed with custom made conveyor belts and automated machines. The pharmacy has a 24-hour next-business-day turnaround ensuring medications can get to inmates as soon as possible.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tmc.edu/news/2017/04/health-care-behind-bars/ | title=Health Care Behind Bars| date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n=====History of Healthcare=====\nHealthcare in Texas was mostly straight forward. Not much of it was changed over time due to its simplicity. One aspect that did change was how the cost of healthcare for incarcerated persons fluctuated.\n\nAn issue that was prominent in prison systems was the associated costs with treatment. For this reason, the Correctional Managed Health Care Committee (CMHCC) was established in 1993. This committee focused their attention to the rising costs of healthcare today and how that effects inmates inside custody. The CMHCC hopes to open a statewide managed health care plan giving offenders the ability to afford care with timely access.<ref>{{cite web |title=Texas Correctional Managed Care Committee |url=https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/divisions/cmhc/index.html |website=Texas Department of Criminal Justice |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Mental Health ===\n\nThe decline of mental health treatment within detainees has become a major concern in the prison system, especially in the Texas prison departments. While the Texas Department of Criminal Justice claims that most of its facilities are capable of treating mental health issues, this does not seem to be the case.<ref>{{cite web |title=Correctional Managed Health Care Program Summary of Health Care Capabilities by Facility |url=https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/divisions/cmhc/docs/Unit_Medical_Capabilities_Summary.pdf |website=Texas Department of Criminal Justice |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref> Texas provides at least 20% of inmates mental health treatment and this small percentage could be explained by the shortage of volunteers and staff to provide these mental treatments. There is also failure to recognize mental symptoms and make a correct diagnosis for these detainees. Lack of mental aid has increased serious assaults and violent behaviors in which most of these cases have been declined by the Bureau of Prisons for \u201cprivacy reasons.\u201d Policies have been changed by the Bureau of Prisons to increase check-ins by once a month or weekly. However, the TDCJ has attempted to minimize these issues as best as it can. Detainees are offered guidelines on how to manage their stress and sanity before being released to the public. In terms of support and care, there is the Offender Grievance Program that allows offenders to communicate with faculty staff about questions, regards, or concerns associating with their sentence. In addition, the TDCJ Ombudsman Program makes referrals to an agency staff to help resolve problems and answer questions regarding a specific offender. The Peer Recovery Support Services hold classes to allow prisoners to help one another recover from their issues. Those that obtain a certificate from the program are eligible to work or volunteer as a Peer Recovery Support Specialist. This further build a community-based environment where prisoners can understand each other's mistakes and problems and cooperate as a team to provide solutions to better themselves. Specific programs are held for detainees that are of a particular background and history. The Chaplaincy Program is a nondiscriminatory program that permits prisoners to pursue their religious faiths, reconcile relationships, and strengthen families. The program offers mentoring, space for spiritual growth, pastoral care, life skill classes, accountability/support groups, etc. Similarly, the \u201cInnerChange\u201d Faith-Based- Pre-Release Program functions in the same way as the Chaplaincy Program to further help detainees recover well. For younger offenders, the Youthful Offender Program aids young offenders with special needs to the Mentally Retarded Offenders Program (MROP) or Physically Hanicapped Offenders Program (PHOP). Regular youth offenders are placed in interdisciplinary programming established on a weekly schedule, including:\n* education\n* social skills training\n* anger management\n* values development\n* goal setting\n* cognitive restructuring\n* substance abuse education\n* conflict resolution\n* aggression replacement\n* and life skills.\n\n=== Recreation and Fitness ===\n\nLeisure activities are meant for enhancing potential life skills post-release and allowing inmates an opportunity to complete one or two activities of their choice. In terms of recreation and fitness, inmates have the chance to participate in structured fitness sessions that offer regular and moderate levels of exercises monitored by staff. Staff members are to take into account the kind of activity the detainee wants to do, the amount of time spent on that activity, and given permission. These fitness sessions occur in the \u201cBig Yard,\u201d where gym equipment is stored and common past time favorites are held, such as volleyball, baseball, softball, wrestling, basketball, tennis, handball, boxing, and soccer/futbol. The yard is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence for extra supervision. During a detainee's time in prison, they are given a physical assessment that focuses on cardiovascular endurance, flexibility, body fat percentage, and dynamic strength. \nTo further sharpen community-building skills, inmates are eligible to run special fitness and health events, including:\n* Run/Walk Marathons \n* Health fairs; health book fairs\n* Nationally recognized health events\nIn addition to these health events, inmates have the opportunity to educate themselves in other health and sanity organizations. Staff will provide discussions concentrating on: \n* Weight management\n* Stress management\n* Human anatomy\n* Aerobic exercises\n* Smoking cessation\n* Back pain relief\n* Nutrition\nUltimately, prisoners are able to utilize these resources to make them better returning members of society.\n\n====Incarceration of women====\n{{see also|Incarceration of women in the United States}}\n\n[[File:Crain Unit Sign.jpg|thumb|250px|The Christina Crain Unit in Gatesville is the largest TDCJ unit housing women.]]\nThe Correctional Institutions Division has eight main facilities, including five prisons and three state jails, that [[Incarceration of women|house women]];<ref name=\"Unitdir\"/> Five of the women's units,<ref name=\"Gately\">Gately, Paul \"[http://www.kwtx.com/home/headlines/34929404.html Former Downtown Waco Executive Director Moved to Gatesville].\" ''[[KWTX-TV]]''.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on January 13, 2008. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] as he saves the life of the owner of a [[fast-food restaurant]] and the owner gives him a lifetime supply of free burgers. After eating 30 burgers in a row Peter suffers a massive [[stroke]] and tries to take revenge on the restaurant.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and it was directed by [[Brian Iles]]. This is one of the episodes that did not have show creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s work in post-production because he was participating in the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007\u2013present)|Writers Guild of America strike]]. The episode guest starred [[Max Burkholder]], Denis Martel and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]. Recurring voice actors [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Ralph Garman]], [[Mark Hentemann]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[Alec Sulkin]], [[Lisa Wilhoit]] and [[John Viener]] also made appearances. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] starts collecting [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]'s mail (he calls it \"black guy mail\") while the latter is out of town. After looking through one of Cleveland's magazines devoted to mustaches, Peter decides to grow one. It quickly becomes his most prized possession, and he pretends that it gives him special abilities; for instance, convinced he can now speak Italian, he angers an Italian butcher with his mock Italian gibberish.\n\nPeter and Brian walk past McBurgertown and it's on fire. Firefighters notice Peter's mustache and give him a fire hose. Peter is reluctant to risk injury rescuing a man trapped in the building, but rationalizes \"With great mustache comes great responsibility.\" He rescues the manager from the fire, but is devastated that his mustache has been burned off. The manager later visits the Griffins to thank Peter with a lifetime supply of burgers. At the grand re-opening, Peter drowns his sense of loss with 30 burgers, causing a [[stroke]] that paralyzes the left half of his body.\n\nUnhappy about the pace of his recovery, Peter walks into a [[stem cell research]] center; he is cured of his stroke in only five minutes. Peter then tries to sue McBurgertown for causing his stroke. [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] points out that it was Peter's own fault for overindulging. Peter loses the trial because the company has more lawyers, he offered the judge a cheap bribe, and because he has no evidence that McBurgertown was at fault.\n\nStill wanting revenge, Peter drags Brian to the corporate headquarters. Peter claims that he and Brian are wealthy [[Asia]]n businessmen and asks for a tour. The company grants his request. Looking for evidence of wrongdoing that he can use, Peter asks about a room labeled \"restricted\". The tour guide says that room is off-limits, then excuses himself for a 30-minute bathroom break. Peter breaks his word that he would not go in the room, and finds that it is a slaughterhouse. Peter and Brian befriend a talking genetically-engineered cow who describes the horrors the company has inflicted. Brian offers a deal to set the cow free in exchange for the cow's help exposing McBurgertown. Realizing that Peter and Brian broke their promise, the tour guide sends two security men after them.\n\nFleeing the building in a madcap chase set to [[The Monkees]]' \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\", the cow reveals McBurgertown's practices and the bad health effects of its food to the media. The company suffers a blow from which it might not recover. The cow thanks Peter for helping.\n\nIn the [[B story]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and Brian wager that Stewie can disguise himself as a [[high school|high-schooler]] and become the most popular kid in less than a week. Taking on the name \"Zac Sawyer\", Stewie easily wins over Connie D'Amico and her clique, winning the bet. Connie and \"Zac\" drive to Anal Point to have sex, but Connie laughs at the size of his [[penis]] and drives off. The next day at school, Stewie is ostracized by everyone for his \"baby penis\", ending his popularity. Stewie approaches Connie and concedes defeat. He asks Connie for one last kiss. When Connie's eyes are closed, Stewie takes off his clothes and kisses her. He proclaims her to be a [[pedophile]] and she is arrested immediately by school security.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|140px|thumb|alt=A man with black short hair and a black shirt, with tan skin, laughs into a microphone while leaning forward.|[[Seth MacFarlane]] did not participate in the post-production of the episode.]]\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]], who has been with the show since its [[Family Guy (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref name=ya/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew;_ylt=ApqUwltmQ..ERF8wJh8qBou9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Petarded|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109002623/https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew |archivedate=2007-01-09}}</ref> It was directed by [[Brian Iles]], who would direct the episode \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\" later this season.<ref name=ya>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/mcstroke/episode/157506;_ylt=Aj0yzAdZjYuZ6igH69L.9xG9v9EF|title=Family Guy: McStroke|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/back-to-the-woods/episode/161341/castcrew;_ylt=AtX213WuR0YvUFb3PmFlJmS9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Back to the Woods|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and James Purdun acted as supervising directors for the episode.<ref name=ya/>\n\nThis is one of the episodes of ''Family Guy'' that was released after the show's creator, [[Seth MacFarlane]], joined the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007\u2013present)|Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name= tvs/> MacFarlane participated in the writing process and did record the voices of the characters he normally plays for the episode, but he did not approve or participate in any post-production done to the episode.<ref name= tvs/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actors [[Camille Guaty]], Denis Martel, [[Ted McGinley]] and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] guest starred in the episode (Montalb\u00e1n would one year later guest star in the episode [[Moon Over Isla Island]] from Seth's other show [[American Dad]]).<ref name=ya/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2008/episode-9-season-6/mcstroke/100148|title=Family Guy Episode: \"McStroke\"|magazine=TV Guide|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> Recurring voice actors [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Ralph Garman]], writer [[Mark Hentemann]], writer [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], writer [[Alec Sulkin]], [[Lisa Wilhoit]] and writer [[John Viener]] made minor appearances in the episode.<ref name=ya/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode featured various references to the popular culture.

The only considerable difference is that eQTL studies can involve a million or more expression microtraits. Standard gene mapping software packages can be used, although it is often faster to use custom code such as QTL Reaper or the web-based eQTL mapping system [[GeneNetwork]]. GeneNetwork hosts many large eQTL mapping data sets and provide access to fast algorithms to map single loci and epistatic interactions. As is true in all QTL mapping studies, the final steps in  defining DNA variants that cause variation in traits are usually difficult and require a second round of experimentation.  This is especially the case for trans eQTLs that do not benefit from the strong prior probability that relevant variants are in the immediate vicinity of the parent gene.

The only considerable difference is that eQTL studies can involve a million or more expression microtraits. Standard gene mapping software packages can be used, although it is often faster to use custom code such as QTL Reaper or the web-based eQTL mapping system [[GeneNetwork]]. GeneNetwork hosts many large eQTL mapping data sets and provide access to fast algorithms to map single loci and epistatic interactions. As is true in all QTL mapping studies, the final steps in  defining DNA variants that cause variation in traits are usually difficult and require a second round of experimentation.  This is especially the case for trans eQTLs that do not benefit from the strong prior probability that relevant variants are in the immediate vicinity of the parent gene.

Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive [[Battle of Alesia]] in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] over the whole of [[Gaul]] (mainly present-day [[France]] and [[Belgium]]).

Still, Gaul was of significant military importance to the Romans, as they had been attacked several times by native tribes both indigenous to Gaul and farther to the north. Conquering Gaul allowed Rome to secure the natural border of the river [[Rhine]].

As he had been Governor of [[Hispania Ulterior]] in 61 BC and had campaigned successfully with them against the [[Lusitanians]], Caesar knew personally most (perhaps even all) of these legions.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Caesar also had the legal authority to levy additional legions and [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary units]] as he saw fit. The assignment of the provinces that comprise what we today know as [[Northern Italy]] was also helpful to his ambitions: the [[Po Valley]] and the adjoining regions had large numbers of Roman citizens, who could be enticed to sign up for legionary service.<ref name=\"chrissanthos-2019\" />\n\nHis ambition was to conquer and plunder some territories to get himself out of debt, and it is possible that Gaul was not his initial target. It is more likely that he was planning a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Dacia]],<ref>That the Balkans were Caesar's original target is argued by several scholars, including: Penguin Classics ''The Conquest of Gaul'': \"Introduction\", chapter 3 \"The course of the war\"{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}, [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], ''In the Name of Rome'', chapter 8 \"Caesar in Gaul\". It is suggested by the provinces Caesar initially wanted for himself (Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum) and supported by the initial placement of three of his four legions in [[Aquileia]].</ref> located in the [[Balkans]].\n\nThe countries of Gaul were civilized and wealthy. Most had contact with Roman merchants and some, particularly those that were governed by republics such as the [[Aedui]] and [[Helvetii]], had enjoyed stable political alliances with Rome in the past.\n\nThe Romans respected and feared the Gallic tribes. Only fifty years before, in 109 BC, Italy had been invaded from the north and saved only after several bloody and costly battles by [[Gaius Marius]]. Around 62 BC, when a Roman client state, the [[Arverni]], conspired with the [[Sequani]] and the [[Suebi]] nations east of the [[Rhine]] to attack the Aedui, a strong Roman ally, Rome turned a blind eye. The Sequani and Arverni sought [[Ariovistus]]\u2019 aid and defeated the [[Aedui]] in 63 BC at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]]. The Sequani rewarded Ariovistus with land following his victory.<ref name=\"Grant, Julius Caesar, 87\">Grant, Julius Caesar, 87</ref><ref name=\"G\u00e9rard Walter 1952\">G\u00e9rard Walter, Caesar: A Biography, trans.

By the end of the campaign, the non-client [[Suebi]] under the leadership of the belligerent [[Ariovistus]], stood triumphant over both the Aedui and their co-conspirators. Fearing another mass migration akin to the devastating [[Cimbrian War]], Rome, now keenly invested in the defense of Gaul, was irrevocably drawn into war.\n\n==Course==\n[[File:Gaul, 1st century BC.gif|thumb|200px|A map of [[Gaul]] in the 1st century BC, showing the relative positions of the [[Helvetii]] and the [[Sequani]]]]\n\n===Beginning of the war\u2014campaign against the Helvetii===\nThe [[Helvetii]] was a confederation of about five related Gallic tribes that lived on the Swiss plateau, hemmed in by the mountains as well as the Rhine and Rhone rivers. They began to come under increased pressure from German tribes to the north and east.<ref name=rickard>[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_gallic.html#f Rickard, J., \"Gallic War, 58-51 B.C.\", HistoryOfWar.org, 26 March 2009]</ref>\n\nBy 58 BC, the [[Helvetii]] were well on their way in the planning and provisioning for a mass migration under the leadership of [[Orgetorix]]. Caesar mentions as an additional reason their not being able to in turn raid for plunder themselves due to their location. (De Bello Gallico, I, 2) They planned to travel across Gaul to the west coast, a route that would have taken them through lands of the Aedui, a Roman ally, and the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul.<ref name=rickard/>\n\nThe Helvetii sent emissaries to neighboring tribes to negotiate peaceful transit. Orgetorix made an alliance with the Sequani chieftain [[Casticus]] and arranged the marriage of his daughter to an Aedui chieftain, [[Dumnorix]]. The three secretly planned to become kings of their respective tribes, and masters of the whole of Gaul (De Bello Gallico, I, 3). Orgetorix's personal ambitions were discovered and he was to be put on trial, with the penalty being death by fire if convicted. Orgetorix escaped with the help of his many debtors, but he died during his flight. However, the death of Orgetorix was \"not without suspicion that he had decided upon death for himself\" (committed suicide), as Caesar puts it (De Bello Gallico, I, 4).\n\nCaesar dated their departure to the 28 March, and mentions that they burned all their towns and villages so as to discourage thoughts among undecided client tribes and enemies of occupying their vacated realm. (De Bello Gallico, I, 5 and 6).\n\nCaesar was across the Alps in Italy when he received the news. With only a single legion in [[Transalpine Gaul]], the endangered province, he immediately hurried to Geneva and ordered a levy of several auxiliary units and the destruction of the Rhone bridge. The Helvetii sent an embassy to negotiate a peaceful passage, promising to do no harm. Caesar stalled the negotiations for fifteen days, and used the time to fortify his position with a rampart nineteen miles long and a parallel [[Ditch|trench]] (De Bello Gallico, I, 7 and 8).\n\n[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the Gallic Wars]]\nWhen the embassy returned, Caesar refused their request and warned them that any forceful attempt to cross the river would be opposed. Several attempts were quickly beaten off. The Helvetii turned back and entered negotiations with the Sequani, and with Dumnorix of the Aeduans, for an alternate route.(De Bello Gallico, I, 8 and 9).\n\nLeaving his single legion under the command of his second-in-command [[Titus Labienus]], Caesar hurried to Cisalpine Gaul. Upon arrival, he took command of the three legions which were in Aquileia and enrolled two new legions, the [[Legio XI Claudia|Legio XI]] and the [[Legio XII Fulminata|Legio XII]]. At the head of these five legions, he went the quickest way through the Alps, crossing territories of several hostile tribes and fighting several [[skirmishes]] en route (De Bello Gallico, I, 10).\n\nMeanwhile, the Helvetii had already crossed the territories of the Sequani, and were busy pillaging the lands of the Aedui, [[Ambarri]], and [[Allobroges]]. These tribes were unable to oppose them, and Roman allies asked for Caesar's help. Caesar obliged them and surprised the Helvetii as they were crossing the river Arar (modern [[Sa\u00f4ne River]]). Three quarters of the Helvetii had already crossed, but one quarter, the [[Tigurini]] (a Helvetian clan), was still on the east bank. Three legions, under Caesar's command, surprised and defeated the Tigurini in the [[Battle of the Arar]]. The remaining Tigurini fled to neighboring woods (De Bello Gallico, I, 11 and 12).\n\nAfter the battle, the Romans built a bridge over the Sa\u00f4ne to pursue the remaining Helvetii. The Helvetii sent an embassy led by [[Divico]], but the negotiations failed. For a fortnight, the Romans maintained their pursuit until they ran into supply troubles. Caesar, in the meantime, sent 4,000 Roman and allied Aedui cavalry to track the Helvetii, which suffered some casualties from only 500 Helvetii cavalry (\"''pauci de nostris cadunt''\"). Apparently Dumnorix was doing everything in his power to delay the supplies. Accordingly, the Romans stopped their pursuit and headed for the Aedui town of [[Bibracte]]. The tables were turned, and the Helvetii began to pursue the Romans, harassing their rear guard. Caesar chose a nearby hill to offer battle and the Roman legions stood to face their enemies (De Bello Gallico, I, 13 to 24).\n\nIn the ensuing [[Battle of Bibracte]], the Celts and Romans fought for the better part of the day in a hotly contested battle with the Romans eventually gaining victory. Caesar writes that \"the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful success.\" The defeated Helvetii offered their surrender, which Caesar accepted. However, 6,000 men of the Helvetian clan of the [[Verbigeni]] fled to avoid capture. Upon Caesar's orders, other Gallic tribes captured and returned these fugitives, who were executed. Those who had surrendered were ordered back to their homeland to rebuild it, and the necessary supplies were organized to feed them, as they were useful as a [[Buffer state|buffer]] between the Romans and the northern tribes. In the captured Helvetian camp, Caesar claims that a census written in Greek was found and studied: of a grand total of 368,000 Helvetii, of which 92,000 were able-bodied men, only 110,000 survivors were left to return home (De Bello Gallico, I, 25 to 29).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

When 24,000 Harudes joined his cause, Ariovistus demanded that the Sequani give him more land to accommodate the Harudes people.<ref name=\"Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 159\"/><ref name=\"C Fuller, Julius Caesar 1965\"/> This demand 'concerned' [[Rome]] because if the Sequani conceded, Ariovistus would be in a position to take all of the Sequani land and attack the rest of Gaul.<ref name=\"Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 159\"/>\n\nFollowing Caesar\u2019s victory over the Helvetii, the majority of the Gallic tribes congratulated Caesar and sought to meet with him in a general assembly.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 158</ref> [[Diviciacus (Aedui)|Diviciacus]], the head of the Aeduan government and spokesmen for the Gallic delegation, expressed concern over Ariovistus\u2019 conquests and the hostages he had taken.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 158 and 161</ref><ref name=\"Goldsworthy, Caesar, 271\">Goldsworthy, Caesar, 271</ref> Diviciacus demanded that Caesar defeat Ariovistus and remove the threat of a Germanic invasion otherwise they would have to seek refuge in a new land.<ref>Fuller, Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, and Tyrant, 106</ref> Not only did Caesar have a responsibility to protect the longstanding allegiance of the Aedui, but this proposition presented an opportunity to expand Rome\u2019s borders, strengthen the loyalty within Caesar\u2019s army and establish him as the commander of Rome\u2019s troops abroad.<ref name=\"Goldsworthy, Caesar, 271\"/><ref>Maria Wyke, Caesar: A Life in Western Culture (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), 42</ref>\n\nThe senate had declared Ariovistus a \"king and friend of the Roman people\" in 59 BC, so Caesar could not declare war on the Suebi tribe.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 247</ref> Caesar said that he could not ignore the pain the Aedui had suffered and delivered an ultimatum to Ariovistus demanding that no German cross the [[Rhine]], the return of Aedui hostages and the protection of the Aedui and other friends of Rome.<ref>Fuller, Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, and Tyrant, 107</ref> Although Ariovistus assured Caesar that the Aedui hostages would be safe as long as they continued their yearly tribute, he took the position that he and the Romans were both conquerors and that Rome had no jurisdiction over his actions.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 272</ref> With the attack of the Harudes on the Aedui and the report that a hundred clans of Suebi were trying to cross the Rhine into Gaul, Caesar had the justification he needed to wage war against Ariovistus in 58 BC.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 163\u2013165.; Goldsworthy, Caesar, 272</ref>\n\nCaesar, learning that Ariovistus intended to seize [[Vesontio]], the largest town of the Sequani, commenced marching his troops toward Vesontio. Some of Caesar\u2019s officers held their posts for political reasons only and had no war experience. Consequently, they suffered from poor morale which threatened Caesar\u2019s campaign. Caesar challenged the officers and their legions, saying that the only legion he could trust was the 10th. With their pride on the line, the other legions followed the 10th\u2019s lead, determined not to be outdone. Consequently, Caesar arrived in Vesontio before Ariovistus.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 274\u2013275</ref><ref>Fuller, Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, Tyrant, 108</ref>\n\nAriovistus sent emissaries to Caesar requesting a meeting. They met under a truce at a knoll on the plain. The truce was violated when Caesar learned that German horsemen were edging towards the knoll and throwing stones at his mounted escort.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 173\u2013176</ref> Two days later, Ariovistus requested another meeting. Hesitant to send senior officials, Caesar dispatched Valerius Procillus, his trusted friend, and Caius Mettius, a merchant who had successfully traded with Ariovistus. Insulted, Ariovistus threw the envoys in chains.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 177</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 277</ref> Ariovistus marched for two days and made camp two miles behind Caesar, thus cutting off Caesar\u2019s communication and supply lines with the allied tribes. Unable to entice Ariovistus into battle, Caesar ordered a second smaller camp to be built near Ariovistus\u2019 position.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 277\u2013278</ref> After the camp was completed, Caesar again challenged Ariovistus and was rewarded when Ariovistus attacked the smaller camp and was repulsed.\n\nThe next morning Caesar assembled his allied troops in front of the second camp and advanced his legions in ''triplex acies'' (three lines of troops) towards Ariovistus. Each of Caesar\u2019s five legates and his quaestor were given command of a legion. Caesar lined up on the right flank.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 279\u2013280</ref> Ariovistus countered by lining up his seven tribal formations. Caesar was victorious in the battle that ensued due in large part to the charge made by [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius Crassus]]. As the Germans began to drive back the Roman left flank, Crassus led his cavalry in a charge to restore balance and ordered up the cohorts of the third line. As a result, the whole German line broke and began to flee.<ref>Fuller, Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, and Tyrant, 109</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 280\u2013281</ref> Most of Ariovistus\u2019 one-hundred and twenty thousand men were killed. He and what remained of his troops escaped and crossed the Rhine, never to engage Rome in battle again. The Suebi camping near the Rhine returned home. Caesar was victorious.<ref>Grant, Julius Caesar, 89</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 281</ref>\n\n===Campaign against the Belgae===\nIn 57 BC Caesar once again intervened in an intra-Gallic conflict, marching against the [[Belgae]], who inhabited the area roughly bounded by modern-day [[Belgium]]. The Belgae had recently attacked a tribe allied with Rome and before marching out with his army to meet them, Caesar ordered the [[Remi]] and other neighbouring Gauls to investigate the Belgae's actions.<ref>Ezov, Amiram. ''The \"Missing Dimension\" of C. Julius Caesar''. 1996, p.66</ref> His army suffered a surprise attack in the [[battle of the Sabis]] while it was making camp near the river [[Sambre]].\n\nThe [[Nervii]] advanced so quickly that Caesar did not have the time to organise his forces and nearly suffered a humiliating defeat. Caesar admits to losing all of his standards and most his centurions dead or felled by wounds. He himself was forced to take up a shield and personally rally his forces which were then threatened with envelopment and massacre. The strong stand by the X legion and the prompt arrival of reinforcements enabled Caesar to regroup, redeploy and eventually repulse the Nervii once the [[Atrebates]] and Viromandui were put to flight.<ref name=rickard/>\n\nCaesar remarked that the warlike Nervii refused to yield their ground even after the Atrebates and Virumandui had been put into disarray. When finally surrounded by Roman reinforcements the Nerviians continued fighting as a pitiless hail of missiles rained down on them from the many archers and peltasts Caesar had brought from overseas. The peltasts, slingers and archers were brought for the specific purpose of confounding the Gallic proclivity for shield wall tactics, mass attack and individual close combat.\n\nThe Nervii were especially renowned for skills at warfare. They ruled and subsisted by warfare and by taxing their dependent and client tribes while adhering to a heroic hoplitic tradition. These Gallic conventions were something Caesar exploited as often as he could.\n\nTogether with Caesar's prudent and unabashed use of fixed projectile weapons like the \"scorpion\" and light ballista, the archers and peltasts took a heavy toll on the densely packed Nervii, who themselves shunned all projectile weapons but the lance. It is recorded in Caesar's war commentaries that as the battle raged, the Nervii caught Roman javelins in flight and hurled them back at legionnaires and that although all were eventually slain, not one of the Nervii was seen to flee. As the grim fighting wore on, the Nervii refused to yield and mounds of the fallen formed ramparts and Boduognatus' fighters fought from atop these hills of dead, clashing with the pressing Roman ranks again and again.\n\nThe skill with which the veteran Roman legions executed their well practiced pilum barrage and gladius and scutum counter-attacks together with the prudent use of missile weapons was instrumental in defeating the skillful and daring Nervii and associated Belgae.\n\nThe Belgae suffered heavy losses and eventually surrendered when faced with the destruction of their towns. The Nervii were severely mauled and forced to flee; thereby all former client tribes surrendered to Caesar or likewise fled. Their absence gave Caesar control of most of what is now Belgium.\n\n===Punitive expeditions===\n[[File:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|250px|A map of [[Gaul]] showing all the tribes and cities mentioned in the Gallic Wars]]\n{{See also|Caesar's invasions of Britain|Caesar's Rhine bridges}}\nThe following year, 56 BC, Caesar turned his attention to the tribes of the [[Atlantic]] seaboard, notably the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] tribe in [[Armorica]] (modern [[Brittany]]), who had assembled a confederacy of anti-Roman tribes. The Veneti were a seafaring people and had built a sailing fleet in the [[Gulf of Morbihan]], requiring the Romans to build galleys and undertake an unconventional land and sea campaign. Eventually Caesar was able to subdue these tribes after a protracted land and sea campaign.\n\nCaesar took his forces across the Rhine in 55 BC in a [[punitive expedition]] against the Germans, though the [[Suebi]], against whom the expedition was mounted, were never engaged in battle. That same year, he then crossed the [[English Channel]] with two legions on his ships to mount a similar expedition against the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]]. The British adventure nearly ended in defeat when bad weather wrecked much of their fleet and the unfamiliar sight of massed [[chariot]]s of the Britons caused confusion among their forces. Caesar did manage to secure a promise of hostages, though only two of them were actually sent. He withdrew, but returned in 54 BC with a much larger force that defeated the powerful [[Catuvellauni]], and forced them to pay tribute to Rome. The expeditions had little lasting effect, but were great propaganda victories for Caesar, keeping him in the public eye at home.\n\nThe campaigns of 55 BC and early 54 BC have caused controversy for many centuries. They were controversial even at the time among Caesar's contemporaries, and especially among his political opponents, who decried them as a costly exercise in personal aggrandizement. In modern times, commentators have been sharply divided between critics of Caesar's nakedly imperialist agenda and defenders of the benefits that the expansion of Roman power subsequently wrought in Gaul.\n\n===Consolidation and Gallic offensives===\n{{See also|Ambiorix's revolt}}\n[[File:RomanSilverDenariusWithHeadOfCaptiveGaul48BCE.JPG|thumb|Roman silver [[denarius]] with the head of captive Gaul 48 BC, following the campaigns of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]]]\nDiscontent among the subjugated Gauls prompted a major uprising in the winter of 54\u201353 BC, when the [[Eburones]] of north-eastern Gaul rose in arms under their leader [[Ambiorix]]. Fifteen Roman [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s were wiped out at Atuatuca Tungrorum (modern [[Tongeren]] in Belgium) and a garrison commanded by [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] narrowly survived after being relieved by Caesar in the nick of time. The rest of 53 BC was occupied with a punitive campaign against the Eburones and their allies, who were said to have been all but exterminated by the Romans.\n\n===Pacification of the last Gauls===\nAmbiorix's revolt was, however, merely the prelude to a much bigger campaign led by [[Vercingetorix]], chief of the [[Arverni]] tribe of south-central Gaul, who united many Gallic tribes and states under his leadership. Recognizing that the Romans had an upper hand on the battlefield due to their panoply and training, he declined to give battle against them and instead fought a \"[[scorched earth]]\" campaign to deprive them of supplies. Caesar hurriedly returned from Italy to take charge of the campaign, pursuing the Gauls and capturing the town of [[Avaricum]] (modern city of Bourges) but suffering a defeat at [[Gergovia]]. Vercingetorix, instead of staying mobile and in the open, chose to hold out at [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] (see [[Battle of Alesia]]). Caesar successfully besieged him and beat off a huge Gallic relief force, who dispersed with the exhaustion of their stores. This effectively marked the end of the Gallic Wars, although mopping-up actions took place throughout 51 BC. A number of lesser rebellions took place subsequently, but Roman control of Gaul was not seriously challenged again until the 2nd century AD.\n\n==The Gallic Wars in literature and culture==\n[[File:Hostilius Saserna AR Denarius 680938.jpg|right|thumb|Denarius from 48 BC, thought to depict an allegory of Gaul with a [[carnyx]] on the obverse and [[Temple of Artemis|Diana of Ephesus]] with a stag on the reverse]]\nThe primary historical source for the Gallic Wars is Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' in Latin, which is one of the best surviving examples of unadorned [[Latin]] prose. It has consequently been a subject of intense study for Latinists, and is one of the classic prose sources traditionally used as a standard teaching text in modern Latin education.\n\nThe Gallic Wars have become a popular setting in modern [[historical fiction]], especially that of [[France]] and [[Italy]]. Claude Cueni wrote a semi-historical novel, ''The Caesar's Druid'', about a fictional Celtic [[druid]], servant of Caesar and recorder of Caesar's campaigns. Morgan Llewelyn also wrote a book, ''Druids'', about a Celtic druid who assisted Vercingetorix in his campaign against Julius Caesar. Similarly, [[Norman Spinrad]]'s ''[[The Druid King]]'' follows the campaigns from [[Vercingetorix]]'s perspective.<ref name=sfdim>{{Cite web| title = Book Review: The Druid King by Norman Spinrad| url = http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug03/druidking.htm| first = John C.| last = Snider| year = 2003| accessdate = 10 April 2011| publisher = [[SciFiDimensions]]| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120119114742/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Aug03/druidking.htm| archivedate = 19 January 2012}}</ref> In addition, the [[comic]] ''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'' is set shortly after the Gallic Wars, where the titular character's village is the last holdout in Gaul against Caesar's legions.\n\nA popular series by [[Conn Iggulden]] called, ''[[Emperor (novel series)|The Emperor]]'', depicts the Gallic Wars in its third book, ''[[The Field of Swords]]''.\n\nThe TV series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' begins during the conquest of Gaul, and protagonists [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Lucius Vorenus]] and [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Titus Pullo]], are based on two historical centurions who fought during the Gallic Wars in Caesar's [[Legio XI Claudia]]{{citation needed|reason=Caesar doesn't mention in which legion they fought|date=June 2014}} and are mentioned in ''Commentarii de Bello Gallico''.\n\nThe historical novel ''[[Caesar (McCullough novel)|Caesar]],'' by [[Colleen McCullough]], gives a thorough, popular account of the Gallic Wars.\n\nThe concept album ''[[Helvetios]]'' by Swiss folk metal band, [[Eluveitie]], tells the story of the Gallic Wars through the eyes of the Helvetii.\n\nThe 2001 film, ''[[Druids (film)|Druids]]'', starring Christopher Lambert as Vercingetorix, depicts the Gallic Wars from the Gallic perspective.\n\nThe DLC campaign ''Caesar in Gaul'' for the strategy game ''[[Total War: Rome II]]'' is set during the Gallic Wars.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History}}\n* [[Roman Gaul]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Gallic War}}\n*''The conquest of Gaul'', {{ISBN|0-14-044433-5}}, by Gaius Julius Caesar, translated by S.

Rome's war against the Gallic tribes lasted from 58 BC to 50 BC and culminated in the decisive [[Battle of Alesia]] in 52 BC, in which a complete Roman victory resulted in the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] over the whole of [[Gaul]] (mainly present-day [[France]] and [[Belgium]]). While militarily just as strong as the Romans, the Gallic tribes' internal divisions helped ease victory for Caesar, and [[Vercingetorix]]'s attempt to unite the Gauls against Roman invasion came too late.<ref name=\"EB_The_Roman_Conquest\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/215768/France/41196/The-press |title=France: The Roman conquest |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=April 6, 2015 |quote=\"Because of chronic internal rivalries, Gallic resistance was easily broken, though Vercingetorix\u2019s Great Rebellion of 52 BC had notable successes.\"}}</ref><ref name=\"The_first_triumvirate_and_the_conquest_of_Gaul\">{{cite web |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/88114/Julius-Caesar/9735/The-first-triumvirate-and-the-conquest-of-Gaul |title=Julius Caesar: The first triumvirate and the conquest of Gaul |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |access-date=February 15, 2015 |quote=\"Indeed, the Gallic cavalry was probably superior to the Roman, horseman for horseman.

Still, Gaul was of significant military importance to the Romans, as they had been attacked several times by native tribes both indigenous to Gaul and farther to the north. Conquering Gaul allowed Rome to secure the natural border of the river [[Rhine]].

As he had been Governor of [[Hispania Ulterior]] in 61 BC and had campaigned successfully with them against the [[Lusitanians]], Caesar knew personally most (perhaps even all) of these legions.{{cn|date=March 2020}} Caesar also had the legal authority to levy additional legions and [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary units]] as he saw fit. The assignment of the provinces that comprise what we today know as [[Northern Italy]] was also helpful to his ambitions: the [[Po Valley]] and the adjoining regions had large numbers of Roman citizens, who could be enticed to sign up for legionary service.<ref name=\"chrissanthos-2019\" />\n\nHis ambition was to conquer and plunder some territories to get himself out of debt, and it is possible that Gaul was not his initial target. It is more likely that he was planning a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Dacia]],<ref>That the Balkans were Caesar's original target is argued by several scholars, including: Penguin Classics ''The Conquest of Gaul'': \"Introduction\", chapter 3 \"The course of the war\"{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}, [[Adrian Goldsworthy]], ''In the Name of Rome'', chapter 8 \"Caesar in Gaul\". It is suggested by the provinces Caesar initially wanted for himself (Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum) and supported by the initial placement of three of his four legions in [[Aquileia]].</ref> located in the [[Balkans]].\n\nThe countries of Gaul were civilized and wealthy. Most had contact with Roman merchants and some, particularly those that were governed by republics such as the [[Aedui]] and [[Helvetii]], had enjoyed stable political alliances with Rome in the past.\n\nThe Romans respected and feared the Gallic tribes. Only fifty years before, in 109 BC, Italy had been invaded from the north and saved only after several bloody and costly battles by [[Gaius Marius]]. Around 62 BC, when a Roman client state, the [[Arverni]], conspired with the [[Sequani]] and the [[Suebi]] nations east of the [[Rhine]] to attack the Aedui, a strong Roman ally, Rome turned a blind eye. The Sequani and Arverni sought [[Ariovistus]]\u2019 aid and defeated the [[Aedui]] in 63 BC at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]]. The Sequani rewarded Ariovistus with land following his victory.<ref name=\"Grant, Julius Caesar, 87\">Grant, Julius Caesar, 87</ref><ref name=\"G\u00e9rard Walter 1952\">G\u00e9rard Walter, Caesar: A Biography, trans.

By the end of the campaign, the non-client [[Suebi]] under the leadership of the belligerent [[Ariovistus]], stood triumphant over both the Aedui and their co-conspirators. Fearing another mass migration akin to the devastating [[Cimbrian War]], Rome, now keenly invested in the defense of Gaul, was irrevocably drawn into war.\n\n==Course==\n[[File:Gaul, 1st century BC.gif|thumb|200px|A map of [[Gaul]] in the 1st century BC, showing the relative positions of the [[Helvetii]] and the [[Sequani]]]]\n\n===Beginning of the war\u2014campaign against the Helvetii===\nThe [[Helvetii]] was a confederation of about five related Gallic tribes that lived on the Swiss plateau, hemmed in by the mountains as well as the Rhine and Rhone rivers. They began to come under increased pressure from German tribes to the north and east.<ref name=rickard>[http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_gallic.html#f Rickard, J., \"Gallic War, 58-51 B.C.\", HistoryOfWar.org, 26 March 2009]</ref>\n\nBy 58 BC, the [[Helvetii]] were well on their way in the planning and provisioning for a mass migration under the leadership of [[Orgetorix]]. Caesar mentions as an additional reason their not being able to in turn raid for plunder themselves due to their location. (De Bello Gallico, I, 2) They planned to travel across Gaul to the west coast, a route that would have taken them through lands of the Aedui, a Roman ally, and the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul.<ref name=rickard/>\n\nThe Helvetii sent emissaries to neighboring tribes to negotiate peaceful transit. Orgetorix made an alliance with the Sequani chieftain [[Casticus]] and arranged the marriage of his daughter to an Aedui chieftain, [[Dumnorix]]. The three secretly planned to become kings of their respective tribes, and masters of the whole of Gaul (De Bello Gallico, I, 3). Orgetorix's personal ambitions were discovered and he was to be put on trial, with the penalty being death by fire if convicted. Orgetorix escaped with the help of his many debtors, but he died during his flight. However, the death of Orgetorix was \"not without suspicion that he had decided upon death for himself\" (committed suicide), as Caesar puts it (De Bello Gallico, I, 4).\n\nCaesar dated their departure to the 28 March, and mentions that they burned all their towns and villages so as to discourage thoughts among undecided client tribes and enemies of occupying their vacated realm. (De Bello Gallico, I, 5 and 6).\n\nCaesar was across the Alps in Italy when he received the news. With only a single legion in [[Transalpine Gaul]], the endangered province, he immediately hurried to Geneva and ordered a levy of several auxiliary units and the destruction of the Rhone bridge. The Helvetii sent an embassy to negotiate a peaceful passage, promising to do no harm. Caesar stalled the negotiations for fifteen days, and used the time to fortify his position with a rampart nineteen miles long and a parallel [[Ditch|trench]] (De Bello Gallico, I, 7 and 8).\n\n[[File:Caesar campaigns gaul-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the Gallic Wars]]\nWhen the embassy returned, Caesar refused their request and warned them that any forceful attempt to cross the river would be opposed. Several attempts were quickly beaten off. The Helvetii turned back and entered negotiations with the Sequani, and with Dumnorix of the Aeduans, for an alternate route.(De Bello Gallico, I, 8 and 9).\n\nLeaving his single legion under the command of his second-in-command [[Titus Labienus]], Caesar hurried to Cisalpine Gaul. Upon arrival, he took command of the three legions which were in Aquileia and enrolled two new legions, the [[Legio XI Claudia|Legio XI]] and the [[Legio XII Fulminata|Legio XII]]. At the head of these five legions, he went the quickest way through the Alps, crossing territories of several hostile tribes and fighting several [[skirmishes]] en route (De Bello Gallico, I, 10).\n\nMeanwhile, the Helvetii had already crossed the territories of the Sequani, and were busy pillaging the lands of the Aedui, [[Ambarri]], and [[Allobroges]]. These tribes were unable to oppose them, and Roman allies asked for Caesar's help. Caesar obliged them and surprised the Helvetii as they were crossing the river Arar (modern [[Sa\u00f4ne River]]). Three quarters of the Helvetii had already crossed, but one quarter, the [[Tigurine]] (a Helvetian clan), was still on the east bank. Three legions, under Caesar's command, surprised and defeated the Tigurine in the [[Battle of the Arar]]. The remaining Tigurini fled to neighboring woods (De Bello Gallico, I, 11 and 12).\n\nAfter the battle, the Romans built a bridge over the Sa\u00f4ne to pursue the remaining Helvetii. The Helvetii sent an embassy led by [[Divico]], but the negotiations failed. For a fortnight, the Romans maintained their pursuit until they ran into supply troubles. Caesar, in the meantime, sent 4,000 Roman and allied Aedui cavalry to track the Helvetii, which suffered some casualties from only 500 Helvetii cavalry (\"''pauci de nostris cadunt''\"). Apparently Dumnorix was doing everything in his power to delay the supplies. Accordingly, the Romans stopped their pursuit and headed for the Aedui town of [[Bibracte]]. The tables were turned, and the Helvetii began to pursue the Romans, harassing their rear guard. Caesar chose a nearby hill to offer battle and the Roman legions stood to face their enemies (De Bello Gallico, I, 13 to 24).\n\nIn the ensuing [[Battle of Bibracte]], the Celts and Romans fought for the better part of the day in a hotly contested battle with the Romans eventually gaining victory. Caesar writes that \"the contest long and vigorously carried on with doubtful success.\" The defeated Helvetii offered their surrender, which Caesar accepted. However, 6,000 men of the Helvetian clan of the [[Verbigeni]] fled to avoid capture. Upon Caesar's orders, other Gallic tribes captured and returned these fugitives, who were executed. Those who had surrendered were ordered back to their homeland to rebuild it, and the necessary supplies were organized to feed them, as they were useful as a [[Buffer state|buffer]] between the Romans and the northern tribes. In the captured Helvetian camp, Caesar claims that a census written in Greek was found and studied: of a grand total of 368,000 Helvetii, of which 92,000 were able-bodied men, only 110,000 survivors were left to return home (De Bello Gallico, I, 25 to 29).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Some of Caesar\u2019s officers held their posts for political reasons only and had no war experience. Consequently, they suffered from poor morale which threatened Caesar\u2019s campaign. Caesar challenged the officers and their legions, saying that the only legion he could trust was the 10th. With their pride on the line, the other legions followed the 10th\u2019s lead, determined not to be outdone. Consequently, Caesar arrived in Vesontio before Ariovistus.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 274\u2013275</ref><ref>Fuller, Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, Tyrant, 108</ref>\n\nAriovistus sent emissaries to Caesar requesting a meeting. They met under a truce at a knoll on the plain. The truce was violated when Caesar learned that German horsemen were edging towards the knoll and throwing stones at his mounted escort.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 173\u2013176</ref> Two days later, Ariovistus requested another meeting. Hesitant to send senior officials, Caesar dispatched Valerius Procillus, his trusted friend, and Caius Mettius, a merchant who had successfully traded with Ariovistus. Insulted, Ariovistus threw the envoys in chains.<ref>Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 177</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 277</ref> Ariovistus marched for two days and made camp two miles behind Caesar, thus cutting off Caesar\u2019s communication and supply lines with the allied tribes. Unable to entice Ariovistus into battle, Caesar ordered a second smaller camp to be built near Ariovistus\u2019 position.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 277\u2013278</ref> After the camp was completed, Caesar again challenged Ariovistus and was rewarded when Ariovistus attacked the smaller camp and was repulsed.\n\nThe next morning Caesar assembled his allied troops in front of the second camp and advanced his legions in ''triplex acies'' (three lines of troops) towards Ariovistus. Each of Caesar\u2019s five legates and his quaestor were given command of a legion. Caesar lined up on the right flank.<ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 279\u2013280</ref> Ariovistus countered by lining up his seven tribal formations. Caesar was victorious in the battle that ensued due in large part to the charge made by [[Publius Licinius Crassus (son of triumvir)|Publius Crassus]]. As the Germans began to drive back the Roman left flank, Crassus led his cavalry in a charge to restore balance and ordered up the cohorts of the third line. As a result, the whole German line broke and began to flee.<ref>Fuller, Julius Caesar: Man, Soldier, and Tyrant, 109</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 280\u2013281</ref> Most of Ariovistus\u2019 one-hundred and twenty thousand men were killed. He and what remained of his troops escaped and crossed the Rhine, never to engage Rome in battle again. The Suebi camping near the Rhine returned home. Caesar was victorious.<ref>Grant, Julius Caesar, 89</ref><ref>Goldsworthy, Caesar, 281</ref>\n\n===Campaign against the Belgae===\nIn 57 BC Caesar once again intervened in an intra-Gallic conflict, marching against the [[Belgae]], who inhabited the area roughly bounded by modern-day [[Belgium]]. The Belgae had recently attacked a tribe allied with Rome and before marching out with his army to meet them, Caesar ordered the [[Remi]] and other neighbouring Gauls to investigate the Belgae's actions.<ref>Ezov, Amiram. ''The \"Missing Dimension\" of C. Julius Caesar''. 1996, p.66</ref> His army suffered a surprise attack in the [[battle of the Sabis]] while it was making camp near the river [[Sambre]].\n\nThe [[Nervii]] advanced so quickly that Caesar did not have the time to organise his forces and nearly suffered a humiliating defeat. Caesar admits to losing all of his standards and most his centurions dead or felled by wounds. He himself was forced to take up a shield and personally rally his forces which were then threatened with envelopment and massacre. The strong stand by the X legion and the prompt arrival of reinforcements enabled Caesar to regroup, redeploy and eventually repulse the Nervii once the [[Atrebates]] and Viromandui were put to flight.<ref name=rickard/>\n\nCaesar remarked that the warlike Nervii refused to yield their ground even after the Atrebates and Virumandui had been put into disarray. When finally surrounded by Roman reinforcements the Nerviians continued fighting as a pitiless hail of missiles rained down on them from the many archers and peltasts Caesar had brought from overseas. The peltasts, slingers and archers were brought for the specific purpose of confounding the Gallic proclivity for shield wall tactics, mass attack and individual close combat.\n\nThe Nervii were especially renowned for skills at warfare. They ruled and subsisted by warfare and by taxing their dependent and client tribes while adhering to a heroic hoplitic tradition. These Gallic conventions were something Caesar exploited as often as he could.\n\nTogether with Caesar's prudent and unabashed use of fixed projectile weapons like the \"scorpion\" and light ballista, the archers and peltasts took a heavy toll on the densely packed Nervii, who themselves shunned all projectile weapons but the lance. It is recorded in Caesar's war commentaries that as the battle raged, the Nervii caught Roman javelins in flight and hurled them back at legionnaires and that although all were eventually slain, not one of the Nervii was seen to flee. As the grim fighting wore on, the Nervii refused to yield and mounds of the fallen formed ramparts and Boduognatus' fighters fought from atop these hills of dead, clashing with the pressing Roman ranks again and again.\n\nThe skill with which the veteran Roman legions executed their well practiced pilum barrage and gladius and scutum counter-attacks together with the prudent use of missile weapons was instrumental in defeating the skillful and daring Nervii and associated Belgae.\n\nThe Belgae suffered heavy losses and eventually surrendered when faced with the destruction of their towns. The Nervii were severely mauled and forced to flee; thereby all former client tribes surrendered to Caesar or likewise fled. Their absence gave Caesar control of most of what is now Belgium.\n\n===Punitive expeditions===\n[[File:Map Gallia Tribes Towns.png|thumb|250px|A map of [[Gaul]] showing all the tribes and cities mentioned in the Gallic Wars]]\n{{See also|Caesar's invasions of Britain|Caesar's Rhine bridges}}\nThe following year, 56 BC, Caesar turned his attention to the tribes of the [[Atlantic]] seaboard, notably the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] tribe in [[Armorica]] (modern [[Brittany]]), who had assembled a confederacy of anti-Roman tribes. The Veneti were a seafaring people and had built a sailing fleet in the [[Gulf of Morbihan]], requiring the Romans to build galleys and undertake an unconventional land and sea campaign. Eventually Caesar was able to subdue these tribes after a protracted land and sea campaign.\n\nCaesar took his forces across the Rhine in 55 BC in a [[punitive expedition]] against the Germans, though the [[Suebi]], against whom the expedition was mounted, were never engaged in battle. That same year, he then crossed the [[English Channel]] with two legions on his ships to mount a similar expedition against the [[Britons (historic)|Britons]]. The British adventure nearly ended in defeat when bad weather wrecked much of their fleet and the unfamiliar sight of massed [[chariot]]s of the Britons caused confusion among their forces. Caesar did manage to secure a promise of hostages, though only two of them were actually sent. He withdrew, but returned in 54 BC with a much larger force that defeated the powerful [[Catuvellauni]], and forced them to pay tribute to Rome. The expeditions had little lasting effect, but were great propaganda victories for Caesar, keeping him in the public eye at home.\n\nThe campaigns of 55 BC and early 54 BC have caused controversy for many centuries. They were controversial even at the time among Caesar's contemporaries, and especially among his political opponents, who decried them as a costly exercise in personal aggrandizement. In modern times, commentators have been sharply divided between critics of Caesar's nakedly imperialist agenda and defenders of the benefits that the expansion of Roman power subsequently wrought in Gaul.\n\n===Consolidation and Gallic offensives===\n{{See also|Ambiorix's revolt}}\n[[File:RomanSilverDenariusWithHeadOfCaptiveGaul48BCE.JPG|thumb|Roman silver [[denarius]] with the head of captive Gaul 48 BC, following the campaigns of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]]]\nDiscontent among the subjugated Gauls prompted a major uprising in the winter of 54\u201353 BC, when the [[Eburones]] of north-eastern Gaul rose in arms under their leader [[Ambiorix]]. Fifteen Roman [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]]s were wiped out at Atuatuca Tungrorum (modern [[Tongeren]] in Belgium) and a garrison commanded by [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] narrowly survived after being relieved by Caesar in the nick of time. The rest of 53 BC was occupied with a punitive campaign against the Eburones and their allies, who were said to have been all but exterminated by the Romans.\n\n===Pacification of the last Gauls===\nAmbiorix's revolt was, however, merely the prelude to a much bigger campaign led by [[Vercingetorix]], chief of the [[Arverni]] tribe of south-central Gaul, who united many Gallic tribes and states under his leadership. Recognizing that the Romans had an upper hand on the battlefield due to their panoply and training, he declined to give battle against them and instead fought a \"[[scorched earth]]\" campaign to deprive them of supplies. Caesar hurriedly returned from Italy to take charge of the campaign, pursuing the Gauls and capturing the town of [[Avaricum]] (modern city of Bourges) but suffering a defeat at [[Gergovia]]. Vercingetorix, instead of staying mobile and in the open, chose to hold out at [[Alesia (city)|Alesia]] (see [[Battle of Alesia]]). Caesar successfully besieged him and beat off a huge Gallic relief force, who dispersed with the exhaustion of their stores. This effectively marked the end of the Gallic Wars, although mopping-up actions took place throughout 51 BC. A number of lesser rebellions took place subsequently, but Roman control of Gaul was not seriously challenged again until the 2nd century AD.\n\n==The Gallic Wars in literature and culture==\n[[File:Hostilius Saserna AR Denarius 680938.jpg|right|thumb|Denarius from 48 BC, thought to depict an allegory of Gaul with a [[carnyx]] on the obverse and [[Temple of Artemis|Diana of Ephesus]] with a stag on the reverse]]\nThe primary historical source for the Gallic Wars is Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' in Latin, which is one of the best surviving examples of unadorned [[Latin]] prose. It has consequently been a subject of intense study for Latinists, and is one of the classic prose sources traditionally used as a standard teaching text in modern Latin education.\n\nThe Gallic Wars have become a popular setting in modern [[historical fiction]], especially that of [[France]] and [[Italy]]. Claude Cueni wrote a semi-historical novel, ''The Caesar's Druid'', about a fictional Celtic [[druid]], servant of Caesar and recorder of Caesar's campaigns. Morgan Llewelyn also wrote a book, ''Druids'', about a Celtic druid who assisted Vercingetorix in his campaign against Julius Caesar.

His  inspirational leadership, grasp of strategy, and unconventional tactics brought about a number of decisive British naval victories, particularly during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He was wounded in combat, losing sight in one eye in [[Corsica]] at the age of 36, and most of one arm in the unsuccessful attempt to conquer [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] when he was 40. He was fatally shot during his victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805.\n\nNelson was born into a moderately prosperous [[Norfolk]] family and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle, [[Maurice Suckling]], a high-ranking naval officer. Nelson rose rapidly through the ranks and served with leading naval commanders of the period before obtaining his own command at the age of 20 in 1778.  He developed a reputation for personal valour and firm grasp of tactics, but suffered periods of illness and unemployment after the end of the [[American War of Independence]].  The outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] allowed Nelson to return to service, where he was particularly active in the [[Mediterranean]].  He fought in several minor engagements off [[Toulon]] and was important in the capture of [[Corsica]] and subsequent diplomatic duties with the Italian states.  In 1797, he distinguished himself while in command of {{HMS|Captain|1787|6}} at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]].\n\nShortly after that battle, Nelson took part in the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], where the attack was defeated and he was badly wounded, losing his right arm, and was forced to return to England to recuperate.  The following year he won a decisive victory over the French at the [[Battle of the Nile]] and remained in the Mediterranean to support the [[Kingdom of Naples]] against a French invasion.  In 1801 he was dispatched to the Baltic and won another victory, this time over the Danes at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]]. He commanded the blockade of the French and Spanish fleets at Toulon and, after their escape, chased them to the [[West Indies]] and back but failed to bring them to battle. After a brief return to England he took over the [[C\u00e1diz]] blockade in 1805. On 21 October 1805, the Franco-Spanish fleet came out of port, and Nelson's fleet engaged them at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The battle became one of Britain's greatest naval victories, but Nelson, aboard {{HMS|Victory}}, was fatally wounded by a French sharpshooter. His body was brought back to England where he was accorded a state funeral.\n\nNelson's death at Trafalgar secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic figures. The significance of the victory and his death during the battle led to his signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\", being regularly quoted, paraphrased and referenced up to the modern day. Numerous monuments, including [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], London, and the [[Nelson Monument, Edinburgh|Nelson Monument]] in [[Edinburgh]], have been created in his memory, and his legacy remains highly influential.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Birthplace of Admiral Lord Nelson, Burnham Thorpe - geograph.org.uk - 377940.jpg|thumb|left|The site of the rectory in [[Burnham Thorpe]] where Nelson was born in 1758]]\nHoratio Nelson was born on 29 September 1758 in a rectory in [[Burnham Thorpe]], [[Norfolk]], England, the sixth of eleven children of the Reverend [[Edmund Nelson (priest)|Edmund Nelson]] and his wife [[Catherine Suckling]].<ref name=\"Sugden 36\">Sugden, 2004, p. 36</ref> He was named after his godfather Horatio Walpole (1723\u20131809) then [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford|2nd Baron Walpole, of Wolterton]].<ref name=\"Memoirs1\">Pettigrew 1849, p. 1</ref> His mother, who died on 26 December 1767, when he was nine years old, was a great-niece of [[Robert Walpole|Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford]], the ''[[de facto]]'' first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]].<ref name=11brit352>''Britannica'' 11th edition, p. 352</ref> She lived in the village of [[Barsham, Suffolk]], and married the Reverend Edmund Nelson at [[Beccles]] church, [[Suffolk]], in 1749.

His naval career began on 1 January 1771, when he reported to the [[third-rate]] {{HMS|Raisonnable|1768|6}} as an [[Ordinary seaman (rating)|ordinary seaman]] and [[coxswain]] under his maternal uncle, Captain [[Maurice Suckling]], who commanded the vessel.  Shortly after reporting aboard, Nelson was appointed a [[midshipman]] and began officer training.

Nelson then learned of a planned expedition under the command of [[Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave|Constantine Phipps]], intended to survey a passage in the Arctic by which it was hoped that India could be reached: the fabled [[North-East Passage]]. At his nephew's request, Suckling arranged for Nelson to join the expedition as [[coxswain]]<ref name=\"Memoirs4\">Pettigrew 1849, p. 4</ref> to Commander [[Skeffington Lutwidge|Lutwidge]] aboard the converted [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Carcass|1759|6}}. The expedition reached within ten degrees of the [[North Pole]], but, unable to find a way through the dense ice floes, was forced to turn back. By 1800 Lutwidge began to circulate a story that while the ship had been trapped in the ice, Nelson had seen and pursued a polar bear, before being ordered to return to the ship. Lutwidge's later version, in 1809, reported that Nelson and a companion had given chase to the bear, but on being questioned why, replied that \"I wished, Sir, to get the skin for my father.\"<ref>Sugden 2004, p. 75.</ref>\n\nNelson briefly returned to ''Triumph'' after the expedition's return to Britain in September 1773.

On 19 February, two of [[Hyder Ali]]'s ketches attacked ''Seahorse'', which drove them off after a brief exchange of fire. This was Nelson's first experience of battle.<ref>Sugden 2004, pp. 95\u201397</ref> The rest of the year he spent escorting convoys, during which he continued to develop his navigation and ship handling skills.

In 1792 the [[French Revolution|French revolutionary]] government annexed the [[Austrian Netherlands]] (modern Belgium), which were traditionally preserved as a buffer state. The Admiralty recalled Nelson to service and gave him command of the 64-gun {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|6}} in January 1793. On 1 February France declared war.<ref name=\"Sugden 412\">Sugden 2004, p. 412</ref>\n\n===Mediterranean service===\nIn May 1793, Nelson sailed as part of a division under the command of Vice Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]], joined later in the month by the rest of Lord Hood's fleet.<ref name=\"Sugden 422\">Sugden 2004, p. 422</ref> The force initially sailed to Gibraltar and, with the intention of establishing naval superiority in the Mediterranean, made their way to Toulon, anchoring off the port in July.<ref name=\"Sugden 427\">Sugden 2004, p. 427</ref> Toulon was largely under the control of moderate republicans and [[House of Bourbon|royalists]], but was threatened by the forces of the [[National Convention]], which were marching on the city. Short of supplies and doubting their ability to defend themselves, the city authorities requested that Hood take it under his protection. Hood readily acquiesced and sent Nelson to carry dispatches to [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] requesting reinforcements.<ref name=\"Sugden 429\">Sugden 2004, p. 429</ref> After delivering the dispatches to Sardinia, ''Agamemnon'' arrived at Naples in early September.

Nelson closed with them, and discovered they were a French squadron. He promptly gave chase, firing on the 40-gun ''Melpomene''.<ref name=\"Sugden 446-7\">Sugden 2004, pp. 446\u201347</ref> During the [[Action of 22 October 1793]] he inflicted considerable damage but the remaining French ships turned to join the battle and, realising he was outnumbered, Nelson withdrew and continued to Cagliari, arriving on 24 October.<ref name=\"Sugden 446-7\" /> After making repairs, Nelson and ''Agamemnon'' sailed again on 26 October, bound for [[Tunis]] with a squadron under Commodore [[Robert Linzee]]. On his arrival, Nelson was given command of a small squadron consisting of ''Agamemnon'', three frigates and a sloop, and ordered to blockade the French garrison on Corsica.<ref name=\"Sugden 452-3\">Sugden 2004, pp. 452\u201353</ref> The fall of Toulon at the end of December 1793 severely damaged British fortunes in the Mediterranean. Hood had failed to make adequate provision for a withdrawal and 18 French ships-of-the-line fell into republican hands.<ref name=\"Sugden 455\">Sugden 2004, p. 455</ref> Nelson's mission to Corsica took on added significance, as it could provide the British a naval base close to the French coast.<ref name=\"Sugden 455\"/> Hood therefore reinforced Nelson with extra ships during January 1794.<ref name=\"Sugden 461\">Sugden 2004, p. 461</ref>\n\nA British assault force landed on the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to intensify the blockade off [[Bastia]]. For the rest of the month he carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General [[David Dundas (British Army officer)|David Dundas]] entered the outskirts of Bastia.<ref name=\"Sugden 471\">Sugden 2004, p. 471</ref> However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk an assault. Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour and opened fire, whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment.<ref name=\"Sugden 487\">Sugden 2004, p. 487</ref> After 45 days, the town surrendered.<ref name=\"Sugden 493\">Sugden 2004, p. 493</ref> Nelson prepared for an assault on [[Siege of Calvi|Calvi]], working in company with Lieutenant-General [[Charles Stuart (1753\u20131801)|Charles Stuart]].<ref name=\"Oman127\">Oman 1987, p. 127</ref>\n\nBritish forces landed at Calvi on 19 June, and immediately began moving guns ashore to occupy the heights surrounding the town. While Nelson directed a continuous bombardment of the enemy positions, Stuart's men began to advance. On 12 July Nelson was at one of the forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action.<ref name=\"Sugden 509-10\">Sugden 2004, pp. 509\u201310</ref> By 18 July most of the enemy positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August.<ref name=\"Sugden 513-4\">Sugden 2004, pp. 513\u201314</ref> However, Nelson's right eye had been irreparably damaged and he eventually lost all sight in it.<ref name=\"Sugden 515\">Sugden 2004, p. 515</ref>\n\n===Genoa and the fight of the ''\u00c7a Ira''===\n{{Main|Naval Battle of Genoa (1795)}}\n[[File:Capnoli.jpg|thumb|The fight of the ''\u00c7a Ira'']]\nAfter the occupation of Corsica, Hood ordered Nelson to open diplomatic relations with the city-state of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], a strategically important potential ally.<ref name=\"Sugden 522\">Sugden 2004, p. 522</ref> Soon afterwards, Hood returned to England and was succeeded by Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]] as commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean. Nelson put into [[Livorno|Leghorn]], and while ''Agamemnon'' underwent repairs, met with other naval officers at the port and entertained a brief affair with a local woman, Adelaide Correglia.<ref name=\"Sugden 533\">Sugden 2004, p. 533</ref> Hotham arrived with the rest of the fleet in December; Nelson and ''Agamemnon'' sailed on a number of cruises with them in late 1794 and early 1795.<ref name=\"Sugden 537\">Sugden 2004, p. 537</ref>\n\nOn 8 March, news reached Hotham that the French fleet was at sea and heading for Corsica. He immediately set out to intercept them, and Nelson eagerly anticipated his first fleet action. The French were reluctant to engage and the two fleets shadowed each other throughout 12 March. The following day two of the French ships collided, allowing Nelson to engage the much larger 84-gun [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|''\u00c7a Ira'']] for two and a half hours until the arrival of two French ships forced Nelson to veer away, having inflicted heavy casualties and considerable damage.<ref name=\"Sugden 546\">Sugden 2004, p. 546</ref> The fleets continued to shadow each other before making contact again, on 14 March, in the [[Naval Battle of Genoa (1795)|Battle of Genoa]]. Nelson joined the other British ships in attacking the battered ''\u00c7a Ira'', now under tow from [[French ship Censeur (1782)|''Censeur'']]. Heavily damaged, the two French ships were forced to surrender and Nelson took possession of ''Censeur''. Defeated at sea, the French abandoned their plan to invade Corsica and returned to port.<ref name=\"Sugden 550\">Sugden 2004, p. 550</ref>\n\n===Skirmishes and the retreat from Italy===\nNelson and the fleet remained in the Mediterranean throughout the summer of 1795. On 4 July ''Agamemnon'' sailed from St Fiorenzo with a small force of frigates and sloops, bound for Genoa. On 6 July Nelson ran into the French fleet and found himself pursued by several much larger ships-of-the-line. He retreated to St Fiorenzo, arriving just ahead of the pursuing French, who broke off as Nelson's signal guns alerted the British fleet in the harbour.<ref name=\"Sugden 556\">Sugden 2004, p. 556</ref> Hotham pursued the French to the [[\u00celes d'Hy\u00e8res|Hy\u00e8res Islands]], but failed to bring them to a decisive action. A [[Naval Battle of Hy\u00e8res Islands|number of small engagements were fought]] but to Nelson's dismay, he saw little action.<ref name=\"Sugden 556\"/>\n\nNelson returned to operate out of Genoa, intercepting and inspecting merchantmen and cutting-out suspicious vessels in both enemy and neutral harbours.<ref name=\"Sugden 574\">Sugden 2004, p. 574</ref> Nelson formulated ambitious plans for amphibious landings and naval assaults to frustrate the progress of the French [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]] that was now advancing on Genoa, but could excite little interest in Hotham.<ref name=\"Sugden 579\">Sugden 2004, p. 579</ref> In November Hotham was replaced by [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker]] but the situation in Italy was rapidly deteriorating: the French were raiding around Genoa and strong [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobin]] sentiment was rife within the city itself.<ref name=\"Sugden 584\">Sugden 2004, p. 584</ref> A large French assault at the end of November broke the allied lines, forcing a general retreat towards Genoa. Nelson's forces were able to cover the withdrawing army and prevent them from being surrounded, but he had too few ships and men to materially alter the strategic situation, and the British were forced to withdraw from the Italian ports. Nelson returned to Corsica on 30 November, angry and depressed at the British failure and questioning his future in the navy.<ref name=\"Sugden 588\">Sugden 2004, p. 588</ref>\n\n===Jervis and the evacuation of the Mediterranean===\nIn January 1796 the position of commander-in-chief of the fleet in the Mediterranean passed to Sir [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]], who appointed Nelson to exercise independent command over the ships blockading the French coast as a [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|commodore]].<ref name=\"Sugden 594\">Sugden 2004, p. 594</ref> Nelson spent the first half of the year conducting operations to frustrate French advances and bolster Britain's Italian allies. Despite some minor successes in intercepting small French warships (e.g., in the [[action of 31 May 1796]], when Nelson's squadron captured a convoy of seven small vessels), Nelson began to feel the British presence on the Italian peninsula was rapidly becoming useless.<ref name=\"Sugden 603\">Sugden 2004, p. 603</ref> In June the ''Agamemnon'' was sent back to Britain for repairs, and Nelson was appointed to the 74-gun {{HMS|Captain|1787|6}}.<ref name=\"Sugden 603\"/> In the same month, the French thrust towards Leghorn and were certain to capture the city. Nelson hurried there to oversee the evacuation of British nationals and transported them to Corsica, after which Jervis ordered him to blockade the newly captured French port.<ref name=\"Sugden 641\">Sugden 2004, p. 641</ref> In July he oversaw the occupation of [[Elba]], but by September the Genoese had broken their neutrality to declare in favour of the French.<ref name=\"Sugden 647\">Sugden 2004, p. 647</ref> By October, the Genoese position and the continued French advances led the British to decide that the Mediterranean fleet could no longer be supplied; they ordered it to be evacuated to Gibraltar. Nelson helped oversee the withdrawal from Corsica, and by December 1796 was aboard the frigate [[French frigate Minerve (1794)|HMS ''Minerve'']], covering the evacuation of the garrison at Elba. He then sailed for Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Sugden 683\">Sugden 2004, p. 683</ref>\n\nDuring the passage, Nelson [[Action of 19 December 1796|captured the Spanish frigate]] ''Santa Sabina'' and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]] in charge of the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board ''Minerve''. ''Santa Sabina'' was part of a larger Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable to outrun them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape.<ref name=\"Sugden 21-2\">Sugden 2004, pp. 21\u201322</ref> Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas.<ref name=\"Sugden 685\">Sugden 2004, p. 685</ref> He sailed for Gibraltar in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], stopped just long enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with ''Santa Sabina'', before pressing on through the straits to join Sir John Jervis off [[Cadiz]].<ref name=\"Oman 1987 174\">Oman 1987, p. 174</ref>\n\n==Admiralty==\n\n===Battle of Cape St Vincent===\n{{Main|Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)}}\n[[File:Surrender of the San Nicolas at St Vincent.jpg|thumb|right|Nelson receives the surrender of the ''San Nicholas'', an 1806 portrait by [[Richard Westall]]]]\nNelson joined Jervis's fleet off [[Cape St Vincent]], and reported the Spanish movements.<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 126\">Coleman 2001, p. 126</ref> Jervis decided to give battle and the two fleets met on 14 February. Nelson found himself towards the rear of the British line and realised that it would be a long time before he could bring ''Captain'' into action.<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 126\"/> Instead of continuing to follow the line, Nelson disobeyed orders and [[jibe|wore ship]], breaking from the line and heading to engage the Spanish van, which consisted of the 112-gun ''San Josef'', the 80-gun ''San Nicolas'' and the 130-gun [[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'']]. ''Captain'' engaged all three, assisted by {{HMS|Culloden|1783|6}} which had come to Nelson's aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides which left both ''Captain'' and ''Culloden'' badly damaged, Nelson found himself alongside ''San Nicolas''. He led a boarding party across, crying \"Westminster Abbey or glorious victory!\" and forced her to surrender.<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 128\">Coleman 2001, p. 128</ref> ''San Josef'' attempted to come to the ''San Nicolas'''s aid, but became entangled with her compatriot and was left immobile.

Four ships had surrendered to the British and two of them were Nelson's.<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 127\">Coleman 2001, p. 127</ref>\n\nNelson was victorious, but had disobeyed direct orders.

As she was not yet ready for sea, Nelson was instead given command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|6}}, to which he appointed [[Sir Edward Berry, 1st Baronet|Edward Berry]] as his [[flag captain]].<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 168\">Bradford 2005, p. 168</ref> French activities in the Mediterranean theatre were raising concern among the Admiralty: Napoleon was gathering forces in Southern France but the destination of his army was unknown. Nelson and the ''Vanguard'' were to be dispatched to Cadiz to reinforce the fleet. On 28 March 1798, Nelson hoisted his flag and sailed to join Earl St Vincent. St Vincent sent him on to Toulon with a small force to reconnoitre French activities.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 172\">Bradford 2005, p. 172</ref>\n\n===Hunting the French===\n{{Main|Mediterranean campaign of 1798}}\nNelson passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and took up position off Toulon by 17 May, but his squadron was dispersed and blown southwards by a strong gale that struck the area on 20 May.<ref name=\"Lavery 2003 65-6\">Lavery 2003, pp. 65\u201366</ref> While the British were battling the storm, Napoleon had sailed with his invasion fleet under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers]]. Nelson, having been reinforced with a number of ships from St Vincent, went in pursuit.<ref name=\"Lavery 2003 101\">Lavery 2003, p. 101</ref> He began searching the Italian coast for Napoleon's fleet, but was hampered by a lack of frigates that could operate as fast scouts.

After a conference with his captains, he decided Egypt was Napoleon's most likely destination and headed for Alexandria. On his arrival on 28 June, though, he found no sign of the French; dismayed, he withdrew and began searching to the east of the port.

The French line was anchored close to a line of shoals, in the belief that this would secure their [[port (nautical)|port]] side from attack; Brueys had assumed the British would follow convention and attack his centre from the [[starboard]] side. However, [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Thomas Foley]] aboard {{HMS|Goliath|1781|6}} discovered a gap between the shoals and the French ships, and took ''Goliath'' into the channel.

Nelson on ''Vanguard'' personally engaged [[HMS Spartiate (1798)|''Spartiate'']], also coming under fire from [[French ship Aquilon (1789)|''Aquilon'']]. At about eight o'clock, he was with Berry on the quarter-deck when a piece of French shot struck him in his forehead. He fell to the deck, a flap of torn skin obscuring his good eye. Blinded and half stunned, he felt sure he would die and cried out \"I am killed. Remember me to my wife.\" He was taken below to be seen by the surgeon.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 205\">Bradford 2005, p. 205</ref> After examining Nelson, the surgeon pronounced the wound non-threatening and applied a temporary bandage.<ref name=\"Hibbert 142\">Hibbert 1994, p. 142</ref>\n\nThe French van, pounded by British fire from both sides, had begun to surrender, and the victorious British ships continued to move down the line, bringing Brueys's 118-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] under constant heavy fire. ''Orient'' caught fire under this bombardment, and later exploded. Nelson briefly came on deck to direct the battle, but returned to the surgeon after watching the destruction of ''Orient''.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bradford 2005, p. 209</ref>\n\nThe Battle of the Nile was a major blow to Napoleon's ambitions in the east.

Napoleon then left his army and sailed back to France, evading detection by British ships. Given its strategic importance, some historians regard Nelson's achievement at the Nile as the most significant of his career, even greater than that at Trafalgar seven years later.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 209.

The [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar of Russia]] sent him a gift, and [[Selim III]], the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], awarded Nelson the [[Order of the Crescent|Order of the Turkish Crescent]] for his role in restoring Ottoman rule in Egypt. Lord Hood, after a conversation with the [[William Pitt the Younger|Prime Minister]], told Fanny that Nelson would likely be given a [[Viscount]]cy, similar to Jervis's earldom after Cape St Vincent and Duncan's viscountcy after Camperdown.<ref name=\"Hibbert 159\">Hibbert 1994, p. 159</ref> Earl Spencer however demurred, arguing that as Nelson had only been detached in command of a squadron, rather than being the commander in chief of the fleet, such an award would create an unwelcome precedent.

The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans.

He entertained a number of his friends and relations there over the coming month, and began plans for a grand engagement with the enemy fleet, one that would surprise his foes by forcing a pell-mell battle on them.<ref name=\"Hibbert 350\">Hibbert 1994, p. 350</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Henry Blackwood]] arrived at Merton early on 2 September, bringing news that the French and Spanish fleets had combined and were currently at anchor in C\u00e1diz. Nelson hurried to London where he met cabinet ministers and was given command of the fleet blockading C\u00e1diz. It was while attending one of these meetings on 12 September, with Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Nelson and Major General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], the future Duke of Wellington, met briefly in a waiting room. Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans. Wellington later recalled, \"He (Nelson) entered at once into conversation with me, if I can call it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all about himself and, in reality, a style so vain and so silly as to surprise and almost disgust me.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 351\">Hibbert 1994, p. 351</ref> However, after a few minutes Nelson left the room and having been told who his companion was, returned and entered into an earnest and intelligent discussion with the young Wellesley which lasted for a quarter of an hour, on the war, the state of the colonies and the geopolitical situation, that left a marked impression upon Wellesley. This was the only meeting between the two men.<ref>Knight 2005, p. 497</ref>\n\nNelson returned briefly to Merton to set his affairs in order and bid farewell to Emma, before travelling back to London and then on to Portsmouth, arriving there early in the morning of 14 September. He breakfasted at the George Inn with his friends [[George Rose (Treasurer of the Navy)|George Rose]], the [[Vice-President of the Board of Trade]], and [[George Canning]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]]. During the breakfast word spread of Nelson's presence at the inn and a large crowd of well wishers gathered. They accompanied Nelson to his barge and cheered him off, which Nelson acknowledged by raising his hat. Nelson was recorded as having turned to his colleague and stating: \"I had their huzzas before: I have their hearts now.\"<ref name=\"Sir Nicholas Harris 35\">Nicolas, The Despatches and Letters of Lord Nelson, Vol, VII p. 35 idem p. 36</ref><ref name=\"Tom Pocock 316\">Tom Pocock, Horatio Nelson p. 316</ref><ref name=\"Hibbert 356\">Hibbert 1994, p. 356</ref> [[Robert Southey]] reported on the onlookers for Nelson's walk to the dock: \"Many were in tears and many knelt down before him and blessed him as he passed.\"<ref name=\"Southey 296\">Southey 1922, The Life of Nelson, (1922 edition) p. 296</ref>\n\n''Victory'' joined the British fleet off C\u00e1diz on 27 September, Nelson taking over from Rear Admiral Collingwood.<ref name=\"Hibbert 362\">Hibbert 1994, p. 362</ref> He spent the following weeks preparing and refining his tactics for the anticipated battle and dining with his captains to ensure they understood his intentions.<ref name=\"Hibbert 360\">Hibbert 1994, p. 360</ref> Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional [[line of battle]]. Drawing on his own experience from the Nile and Copenhagen, and the examples of Duncan at Camperdown and [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney]] at the [[Battle of the Saintes|Saintes]], Nelson decided to split his fleet into squadrons rather than forming it into a similar line parallel to the enemy.<ref name=\"Adkin411\">Adkin 2007, p. 411</ref> These squadrons would then cut the enemy's line in a number of places, allowing a pell-mell battle to develop in which the British ships could overwhelm and destroy parts of their opponents' formation, before the unengaged enemy ships could come to their aid.<ref name=\"Adkin411\"/>\n\n==Battle of Trafalgar==\n{{Main|Battle of Trafalgar}}\n\n===Preparation===\nThe combined French and Spanish fleet under Villeneuve's command numbered 33 ships of the line. Napoleon Bonaparte had intended for Villeneuve to sail into the English Channel and cover the planned invasion of Britain, but the entry of Austria and Russia into the war forced Napoleon to call off the planned invasion and transfer troops to Germany. Villeneuve had been reluctant to risk an engagement with the British, and this reluctance led Napoleon to order Vice Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Rosily-Mesros|Fran\u00e7ois Rosily]] to go to C\u00e1diz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon.<ref name=\"Hibbert 362\"/> Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived.<ref name=\"Hibbert 362\"/> On 20 October 1805, the fleet was sighted making its way out of harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that they appeared to be heading to the west.<ref name=\"Hibbert 363\">Hibbert 1994, p. 363</ref>\n[[File:Turner, The Battle of Trafalgar (1822).jpg|thumb|[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|''The Battle of Trafalgar'']] by [[J. M. W.

He then went below and made his will, before returning to the quarterdeck to carry out an inspection.<ref name=\"Hibbert 365\">Hibbert 1994, p. 365</ref> Despite having 27 ships to Villeneuve's 33, Nelson was confident of success, declaring that he would not be satisfied with taking fewer than 20 prizes.<ref name=\"Hibbert 365\"/> He returned briefly to his cabin to write a final prayer, after which he joined ''Victory'''s signal lieutenant, [[John Pasco]]. <blockquote>Mr Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet \"England confides that every man will do his duty\". You must be quick, for I have one more signal to make, which is for close action.<ref name=\"Hibbert 366\">Hibbert 1994, p. 366</ref></blockquote> Pasco suggested changing ''confides'' to ''expects'' which, being in the Signal Book, could be signalled by the use of a single code (using three flags), whereas ''confides'' would have to be spelt out letter by letter. Nelson agreed, and [[England expects that every man will do his duty|the signal was hoisted]].<ref name=\"Hibbert 366\"/>\n\nAs the fleets converged, ''Victory'''s captain, Thomas Hardy, suggested that Nelson remove the decorations on his coat, so that he would not be so easily identified by enemy sharpshooters. Nelson replied that it was too late \"to be shifting a coat\", adding that they were \"military orders and he did not fear to show them to the enemy\".<ref name=\"Hibbert 368\">Hibbert 1994, p. 368</ref> Captain [[Henry Blackwood]], of the frigate {{HMS|Euryalus|1803|6}}, suggested Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe the battle. Nelson refused, and also turned down Hardy's suggestion to let [[Eliab Harvey]]'s {{HMS|Temeraire|1798|6}} come ahead of ''Victory'' and lead the line into battle.<ref name=\"Hibbert 368\"/>\n\n===Battle is joined===\n''Victory'' came under fire, initially passing wide, but then with greater accuracy as the distances decreased. A cannonball struck and killed Nelson's secretary, John Scott, nearly cutting him in two. Hardy's clerk took over, but he too was almost immediately killed. ''Victory''{{'}}s wheel was shot away, and another cannonball cut down eight marines. Hardy, standing next to Nelson on the quarterdeck, had his shoe buckle dented by a splinter. Nelson observed, \"This is too warm work to last long.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\">Hibbert 1994, p. 370</ref> ''Victory'' had by now reached the enemy line, and Hardy asked Nelson which ship to engage first. Nelson told him to take his pick, and Hardy moved ''Victory'' across the stern of the 80-gun French flagship ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1804)|Bucentaure]]''.<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\"/> ''Victory'' then came under fire from the 74-gun ''[[French ship Redoutable (1791)|Redoutable]]'', lying off ''Bucentaure''{{'}}s stern, and the 130-gun ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|Sant\u00edsima Trinidad]]''. As sharpshooters from the enemy ships fired onto ''Victory''{{'}}s deck from their rigging, Nelson and Hardy continued to walk about, directing and giving orders.<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\"/>\n\n===Wounding and death===\n[[File:Fall of Nelson.jpg|thumb|Nelson is shot on the [[quarterdeck]], painted by [[Denis Dighton]], c. 1825]]\nShortly after 1:00, Hardy realised that Nelson was not by his side. He turned to see Nelson kneeling on the deck, supporting himself with his hand, before falling onto his side. Hardy rushed to him, at which point Nelson smiled <blockquote>Hardy, I do believe they have done it at last .... my backbone is shot through.<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe had been hit by a marksman from ''Redoutable'', firing at a range of 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh [[thoracic vertebrae]], and lodged two inches (5&nbsp;cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller.<ref name=\"Hibbert 371\">Hibbert 1994, p. 371</ref> He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon [[William Beatty (surgeon)|William Beatty]], telling him <blockquote>You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through.<ref name=\"Hibbert 372\">Hibbert 1994, p. 372</ref></blockquote> Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.<ref name=\"Hibbert 372\"/>\n\nHardy came belowdecks to see Nelson just after half-past two, and informed him that a number of enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\">Hibbert 1994, p. 376</ref> With Nelson at this point were the chaplain [[Alexander John Scott|Alexander Scott]], the purser [[Walter Burke (Purser)|Walter Burke]], Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to \"take care of poor Lady Hamilton\", Nelson said \"Kiss me, Hardy\".<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/> Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood for a minute or two before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, \"Who is that?\", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied \"God bless you, Hardy.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/> By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, \"fan, fan&nbsp;... rub, rub&nbsp;... drink, drink.\" Beatty heard Nelson murmur, \"Thank God I have done my duty\", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/> He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as \"God and my country\".<ref name=\"Hayward 63\">Hayward 2003, p. 63</ref> Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/>\n[[File:Daniel Maclise - The Death of Nelson - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|center|800px|''The Death of Nelson'' by [[Daniel Maclise]] (Houses of Parliament, London)]]\n\n==Return to England==\nNelson's body was placed in a cask of [[brandy]] mixed with [[camphor]] and [[myrrh]], which was then lashed to the ''Victory''{{'}}s mainmast and placed under guard.<ref name=\"Hibbert 378\">Hibbert 1994, p. 378</ref> ''Victory'' was towed to [[Gibraltar]] after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with [[spirits of wine]].<ref name=\"Hibbert 378\"/> Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}}, and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, <blockquote>They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. \"Show him in directly\", I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, \"We have gained a great Victory.\" \u2013 \"Never mind your Victory\", I said. \"My letters \u2013 give me my letters\" \u2013 Captain Whitby was unable to speak \u2013 tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him.

He based his command on love rather than authority, inspiring both his superiors and his subordinates with his considerable courage, commitment and charisma, dubbed \"[[The Nelson Touch|the Nelson touch]]\".<ref name=\"Lambert107-8\"/><ref name=\"LambertXVII\">Lambert 2004, xvii</ref> Nelson combined this talent with an adept grasp of strategy and politics, making him a highly successful naval commander. The memorandum he wrote before Trafalgar expresses his attitude well: \"No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106127.html|title=Nelson's Trafalgar Memorandum|website=www.bl.uk}}</ref>\n\nNelson's personality was complex, often characterised by a desire to be noticed, both by his superiors, and the public. He was easily flattered by praise, and dismayed when he felt he was not given sufficient credit for his actions.<ref name=\"Lambert44\">Lambert 2004, p. 44</ref> This led him to take risks, and to enthusiastically publicise his resultant successes,<ref name=\"Lambert64\">Lambert 2004, p. 64</ref> which was not always considered acceptable at the time.<ref>Warner, Oliver.

His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, to the extent that Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family.<ref name=\"Oman571-2\">Oman 1987, pp. 571\u201372</ref> Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by [[Fabrizio Ruffo|Cardinal Ruffo]], and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as [[Robert Southey]], to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician [[Charles James Fox]] was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons <blockquote>I wish that the atrocities of which we hear so much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French&nbsp;\u2013 Naples for instance has been what is called \"delivered\", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital&nbsp;...

His  inspirational leadership, grasp of strategy, and unconventional tactics brought about a number of decisive British naval victories, particularly during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He was wounded in combat, losing sight in one eye in [[Corsica]] at the age of 36, and most of one arm in the unsuccessful attempt to conquer [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] when he was 40. He was fatally shot during his victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805.\n\nNelson was born into a moderately prosperous [[Norfolk]] family and joined the navy through the influence of his uncle, [[Maurice Suckling]], a high-ranking naval officer. Nelson rose rapidly through the ranks and served with leading naval commanders of the period before obtaining his own command at the age of 20 in 1778.  He developed a reputation for personal valour and firm grasp of tactics, but suffered periods of illness and unemployment after the end of the [[American War of Independence]].  The outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] allowed Nelson to return to service, where he was particularly active in the [[Mediterranean]].  He fought in several minor engagements off [[Toulon]] and was important in the capture of [[Corsica]] and subsequent diplomatic duties with the Italian states.  In 1797, he distinguished himself while in command of {{HMS|Captain|1787|6}} at the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St Vincent]].\n\nShortly after that battle, Nelson took part in the [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife]], where the attack was defeated and he was badly wounded, losing his right arm, and was forced to return to England to recuperate.  The following year he won a decisive victory over the French at the [[Battle of the Nile]] and remained in the Mediterranean to support the [[Kingdom of Naples]] against a French invasion.  In 1801 he was dispatched to the Baltic and won another victory, this time over the Danes at the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|Battle of Copenhagen]]. He commanded the blockade of the French and Spanish fleets at Toulon and, after their escape, chased them to the [[West Indies]] and back but failed to bring them to battle. After a brief return to England he took over the [[C\u00e1diz]] blockade in 1805. On 21 October 1805, the Franco-Spanish fleet came out of port, and Nelson's fleet engaged them at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The battle became one of Britain's greatest naval victories, but Nelson, aboard {{HMS|Victory}}, was fatally wounded by a French sharpshooter. His body was brought back to England where he was accorded a state funeral. .\n\nNelson's death at Trafalgar secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic figures. The significance of the victory and his death during the battle led to his signal, \"[[England expects that every man will do his duty]]\", being regularly quoted, paraphrased and referenced up to the modern day. Numerous monuments, including [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], London, and the [[Nelson Monument, Edinburgh|Nelson Monument]] in [[Edinburgh]], have been created in his memory, and his legacy remains highly influential.\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Birthplace of Admiral Lord Nelson, Burnham Thorpe - geograph.org.uk - 377940.jpg|thumb|left|The site of the rectory in [[Burnham Thorpe]] where Nelson was born in 1758]]\nHoratio Nelson was born on 29 September 1758 in a rectory in [[Burnham Thorpe]], [[Norfolk]], England, the sixth of eleven children of the Reverend [[Edmund Nelson (priest)|Edmund Nelson]] and his wife [[Catherine Suckling]].<ref name=\"Sugden 36\">Sugden, 2004, p. 36</ref> He was named after his godfather Horatio Walpole (1723\u20131809) then [[Horatio Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford|2nd Baron Walpole, of Wolterton]].<ref name=\"Memoirs1\">Pettigrew 1849, p. 1</ref> His mother, who died on 26 December 1767, when he was nine years old, was a great-niece of [[Robert Walpole|Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford]], the ''[[de facto]]'' first [[Prime Minister of Great Britain]].<ref name=11brit352>''Britannica'' 11th edition, p. 352</ref> She lived in the village of [[Barsham, Suffolk]], and married the Reverend Edmund Nelson at [[Beccles]] church, [[Suffolk]], in 1749.

His naval career began on 1 January 1771, when he reported to the [[third-rate]] {{HMS|Raisonnable|1768|6}} as an [[Ordinary seaman (rating)|ordinary seaman]] and [[coxswain]] under his maternal uncle, Captain [[Maurice Suckling]], who commanded the vessel.  Shortly after reporting aboard, Nelson was appointed a [[midshipman]] and began officer training. Early in his service, Nelson discovered that he suffered from [[Motion sickness|seasickness]], a chronic complaint that dogged him for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Sugden 56\">Sugden, 2004, p. 56</ref>\n\n==Early naval career==\nHMS ''Raisonnable'' had been commissioned during a period of tension with Spain, but when this passed, Suckling was transferred to the [[Nore]] [[guardship]] {{HMS|Triumph|1764|6}} and Nelson was dispatched to serve aboard the West Indiamen ''Mary Ann'' of the merchant shipping firm of [[Hibbert, Purrier and Horton]], in order to gain experience at sea;<ref>Hibbert 1994, p. 13</ref> he sailed from Medway, Kent, on 25 July 1771 sailing to Jamaica and Tobago, returning to Plymouth on 7 July 1772.<ref name=NArch>{{cite web|title=Joining the Royal Navy|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nelson/gallery2/|website=Nelson, Trafalgar and those who served|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=28 July 2015}}</ref> He twice crossed the Atlantic, before returning to serve under his uncle as the commander of Suckling's longboat, which carried men and dispatches to and from the shore. Nelson then learned of a planned expedition under the command of [[Constantine Phipps, 2nd Baron Mulgrave|Constantine Phipps]], intended to survey a passage in the Arctic by which it was hoped that India could be reached: the fabled [[North-East Passage]]. At his nephew's request, Suckling arranged for Nelson to join the expedition as [[coxswain]]<ref name=\"Memoirs4\">Pettigrew 1849, p. 4</ref> to Commander [[Skeffington Lutwidge|Lutwidge]] aboard the converted [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Carcass|1759|6}}. The expedition reached within ten degrees of the [[North Pole]], but, unable to find a way through the dense ice floes, was forced to turn back. By 1800 Lutwidge began to circulate a story that while the ship had been trapped in the ice, Nelson had seen and pursued a polar bear, before being ordered to return to the ship.

Despite some minor successes in intercepting small French warships (e.g., in the [[action of 31 May 1796]], when Nelson's squadron captured a convoy of seven small vessels), Nelson began to feel the British presence on the Italian peninsula was rapidly becoming useless.<ref name=\"Sugden 603\">Sugden 2004, p. 603</ref> In June the ''Agamemnon'' was sent back to Britain for repairs, and Nelson was appointed to the 74-gun {{HMS|Captain|1787|6}}.<ref name=\"Sugden 603\"/> In the same month, the French thrust towards Leghorn and were certain to capture the city. Nelson hurried there to oversee the evacuation of British nationals and transported them to Corsica, after which Jervis ordered him to blockade the newly captured French port.<ref name=\"Sugden 641\">Sugden 2004, p. 641</ref> In July he oversaw the occupation of [[Elba]], but by September the Genoese had broken their neutrality to declare in favour of the French.<ref name=\"Sugden 647\">Sugden 2004, p. 647</ref> By October, the Genoese position and the continued French advances led the British to decide that the Mediterranean fleet could no longer be supplied; they ordered it to be evacuated to Gibraltar. Nelson helped oversee the withdrawal from Corsica, and by December 1796 was aboard the frigate [[French frigate Minerve (1794)|HMS ''Minerve'']], covering the evacuation of the garrison at Elba. He then sailed for Gibraltar.<ref name=\"Sugden 683\">Sugden 2004, p. 683</ref>\n\nDuring the passage, Nelson [[Action of 19 December 1796|captured the Spanish frigate]] ''Santa Sabina'' and placed Lieutenants Jonathan Culverhouse and [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]] in charge of the captured vessel, taking the Spanish captain on board ''Minerve''. ''Santa Sabina'' was part of a larger Spanish force, and the following morning two Spanish ships-of-the-line and a frigate were sighted closing fast. Unable to outrun them, Nelson initially determined to fight but Culverhouse and Hardy raised the British colours and sailed northeast, drawing the Spanish ships after them until being captured, giving Nelson the opportunity to escape.<ref name=\"Sugden 21-2\">Sugden 2004, pp. 21\u201322</ref> Nelson went on to rendezvous with the British fleet at Elba, where he spent Christmas.<ref name=\"Sugden 685\">Sugden 2004, p. 685</ref> He sailed for Gibraltar in late January, and after learning that the Spanish fleet had sailed from [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], stopped just long enough to collect Hardy, Culverhouse, and the rest of the prize crew captured with ''Santa Sabina'', before pressing on through the straits to join Sir John Jervis off [[Cadiz]].<ref name=\"Oman 1987 174\">Oman 1987, p. 174</ref>\n\n==Admiralty==\n\n===Battle of Cape St Vincent===\n{{Main|Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)}}\n[[File:Surrender of the San Nicolas at St Vincent.jpg|thumb|right|Nelson receives the surrender of the ''San Nicholas'', an 1806 portrait by [[Richard Westall]]]]\nNelson joined Jervis's fleet off [[Cape St Vincent]], and reported the Spanish movements.<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 126\">Coleman 2001, p. 126</ref> Jervis decided to give battle and the two fleets met on 14 February.

''Captain'' engaged all three, assisted by {{HMS|Culloden|1783|6}} which had come to Nelson's aid. After an hour of exchanging broadsides which left both ''Captain'' and ''Culloden'' badly damaged, Nelson found himself alongside ''San Nicolas''.

Four ships had surrendered to the British and two of them were Nelson's.<ref name=\"Coleman 2001 127\">Coleman 2001, p. 127</ref>\n\nNelson was victorious, but had disobeyed direct orders.

The initial attempt was called off after adverse currents hampered the assault and the element of surprise was lost.<ref name=\"Hibbert 1994 121\">Hibbert 1994, p. 121</ref> Nelson immediately ordered another assault but this was beaten back. He prepared for a third attempt, to take place during the night. Although he personally led one of the battalions, the operation ended in failure: the Spanish were better prepared than had been expected and had secured strong defensive positions.<ref name=\"Hibbert 1994 122\">Hibbert 1994, p. 122</ref> Several of the boats failed to land at the correct positions in the confusion, while those that did were swept by gunfire and grapeshot. Nelson's boat reached its intended landing point but as he stepped ashore he was hit in the right arm by a musketball, which fractured his [[humerus]] bone in multiple places.<ref name=\"Hibbert 1994 122\"/> He was rowed back to ''Theseus'' to be attended to by the surgeon, Thomas Eshelby.<ref>\"[http://www.aboutnelson.co.uk/health.htm].\"</ref> On arriving at his ship he refused to be helped aboard, declaring \"Let me alone!

Unable to return to the fleet because their boats had been sunk, Troubridge was forced to enter into negotiations with the Spanish commander, and the British were allowed to withdraw.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 160\">Bradford 2005, p. 160</ref> The expedition had failed to achieve any of its objectives and had left a quarter of the landing force dead or wounded.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 160\"/><ref name=Santa_Cruz>Reports of the battle from Earl St Vincent and Nelson. {{London Gazette|issue=14041|date=2 September 1797|pages=835\u201336}}</ref> The squadron remained off Tenerife for a further three days and by 16 August had rejoined Jervis's fleet off Cadiz. Despondently Nelson wrote to Jervis: \"A left-handed Admiral will never again be considered as useful, therefore the sooner I get to a very humble cottage the better, and make room for a better man to serve the state\".<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 162\">Bradford 2005, p. 162</ref> He returned to England aboard HMS ''Seahorse'', arriving at [[Spithead]] on 1 September.

Whilst in London news reached him that [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan of Camperdown|Admiral Duncan]] had defeated the [[Batavian Republic|Dutch]] fleet at the [[Battle of Camperdown]].<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 166\">Bradford 2005, p. 166</ref> Nelson exclaimed that he would have given his other arm to have been present.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 166\"/> He spent the last months of 1797 recuperating in London, during which he was awarded the Freedom of the City of London and a pension of \u00a31,000 a year. He used the money to buy Round Wood Farm near [[Ipswich]], and intended to retire there with Fanny.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 167\">Bradford 2005, p. 167</ref> Despite his plans, Nelson was never to live there.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 167\"/>\n\nAlthough surgeons had been unable to remove the central [[Ligature (medicine)|ligature]] in his amputated arm, which had caused considerable inflammation and poisoning, in early December it came out of its own accord and Nelson rapidly began to recover. Eager to return to sea, he began agitating for a command and was promised the 80-gun {{HMS|Foudroyant|1798|6}}. As she was not yet ready for sea, Nelson was instead given command of the 74-gun {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|6}}, to which he appointed [[Sir Edward Berry, 1st Baronet|Edward Berry]] as his [[flag captain]].<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 168\">Bradford 2005, p. 168</ref> French activities in the Mediterranean theatre were raising concern among the Admiralty: Napoleon was gathering forces in Southern France but the destination of his army was unknown. Nelson and the ''Vanguard'' were to be dispatched to Cadiz to reinforce the fleet. On 28 March 1798, Nelson hoisted his flag and sailed to join Earl St Vincent. St Vincent sent him on to Toulon with a small force to reconnoitre French activities.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 172\">Bradford 2005, p. 172</ref>\n\n===Hunting the French===\n{{Main|Mediterranean campaign of 1798}}\nNelson passed through the Straits of Gibraltar and took up position off Toulon by 17 May, but his squadron was dispersed and blown southwards by a strong gale that struck the area on 20 May.<ref name=\"Lavery 2003 65-6\">Lavery 2003, pp. 65\u201366</ref> While the British were battling the storm, Napoleon had sailed with his invasion fleet under the command of [[Vice Admiral]] [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers]]. Nelson, having been reinforced with a number of ships from St Vincent, went in pursuit.<ref name=\"Lavery 2003 101\">Lavery 2003, p. 101</ref> He began searching the Italian coast for Napoleon's fleet, but was hampered by a lack of frigates that could operate as fast scouts. Napoleon had already arrived at [[Malta]] and, after a show of force, secured the island's surrender.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 176-7\">Bradford 2005, pp. 176\u201377</ref> Nelson followed him there, but the French had already left. After a conference with his captains, he decided Egypt was Napoleon's most likely destination and headed for Alexandria. On his arrival on 28 June, though, he found no sign of the French; dismayed, he withdrew and began searching to the east of the port. While he was absent, Napoleon's fleet arrived on 1 July and landed their forces unopposed.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 188-9\">Bradford 2005, pp. 188\u201389</ref>\n\nBrueys then anchored his fleet in [[Abu Qir Bay|Aboukir Bay]], ready to support Napoleon if required.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 192\">Bradford 2005, p. 192</ref> Nelson meanwhile had crossed the Mediterranean again in a fruitless attempt to locate the French and had returned to Naples to re-provision.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 193-4\">Bradford 2005, pp. 193\u201394</ref> He sailed again, intending to search the seas off [[Cyprus]], but decided to pass Alexandria again for a final check.

The French line was anchored close to a line of shoals, in the belief that this would secure their [[port (nautical)|port]] side from attack; Brueys had assumed the British would follow convention and attack his centre from the [[starboard]] side. However, [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Thomas Foley]] aboard {{HMS|Goliath|1781|6}} discovered a gap between the shoals and the French ships, and took ''Goliath'' into the channel.

Nelson on ''Vanguard'' personally engaged [[HMS Spartiate (1798)|''Spartiate'']], also coming under fire from [[French ship Aquilon (1789)|''Aquilon'']]. At about eight o'clock, he was with Berry on the quarter-deck when a piece of French shot struck him in his forehead. He fell to the deck, a flap of torn skin obscuring his good eye. Blinded and half stunned, he felt sure he would die and cried out \"I am killed. Remember me to my wife.\" He was taken below to be seen by the surgeon.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 205\">Bradford 2005, p. 205</ref> After examining Nelson, the surgeon pronounced the wound non-threatening and applied a temporary bandage.<ref name=\"Hibbert 142\">Hibbert 1994, p. 142</ref>\n\nThe French van, pounded by British fire from both sides, had begun to surrender, and the victorious British ships continued to move down the line, bringing Brueys's 118-gun flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] under constant heavy fire. ''Orient'' caught fire under this bombardment, and later exploded. Nelson briefly came on deck to direct the battle, but returned to the surgeon after watching the destruction of ''Orient''.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bradford 2005, p. 209</ref>\n\nThe Battle of the Nile was a major blow to Napoleon's ambitions in the east. The fleet had been destroyed: ''Orient'', another ship and two frigates had been burnt, seven 74-gun ships and two 80-gun ships had been captured, and only two ships-of-the-line and two frigates escaped,<ref name=Nile>Reports of the battle from Nelson. {{London Gazette |issue=15065|date=2 October 1798|pages=915\u201317}}</ref> while the forces Napoleon had brought to Egypt were stranded.<ref name=\"Bradford 2005 209\"/> Napoleon attacked north along the Mediterranean coast, but Turkish defenders supported by Captain Sir [[Sidney Smith (admiral)|Sidney Smith]] defeated his army at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]]. Napoleon then left his army and sailed back to France, evading detection by British ships. Given its strategic importance, some historians regard Nelson's achievement at the Nile as the most significant of his career, even greater than that at Trafalgar seven years later.<ref>Bradford 2005, p. 209. Bradford describes it as \"the most complete victory ever recorded in naval history\".</ref>\n\n===Rewards===\n[[File:George Romney - Emma Hart in a Straw Hat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Emma Hamilton]], Nelson's mistress and mother of his daughter [[Horatia Nelson|Horatia]], in a 1782\u201384 portrait by [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], depicting Emma at the height of her beauty (around age 17).]]\nNelson wrote dispatches to the Admiralty and oversaw temporary repairs to the ''Vanguard'', before sailing to Naples where he was met with enthusiastic celebrations.<ref name=\"Hibbert 147\">Hibbert 1994, p. 147</ref> The King of Naples, in company with the Hamiltons, greeted him in person when he arrived at the port and William Hamilton invited Nelson to stay at their house.<ref name=\"Hibbert 153\">Hibbert 1994, p. 153</ref> Celebrations were held in honour of Nelson's birthday that September, and he attended a banquet at the Hamiltons', where other officers had begun to notice his attention to Emma. Jervis himself had begun to grow concerned about reports of Nelson's behaviour, but in early October word of Nelson's victory had reached London. The First Lord of the Admiralty, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Earl Spencer]], fainted on hearing the news.<ref name=\"Hibbert 156\">Hibbert 1994, p. 156</ref> Scenes of celebration erupted across the country, balls and victory feasts were held and church bells were rung.

The [[Paul I of Russia|Tsar of Russia]] sent him a gift, and [[Selim III]], the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], awarded Nelson the [[Order of the Crescent|Order of the Turkish Crescent]] for his role in restoring Ottoman rule in Egypt. Lord Hood, after a conversation with the [[William Pitt the Younger|Prime Minister]], told Fanny that Nelson would likely be given a [[Viscount]]cy, similar to Jervis's earldom after Cape St Vincent and Duncan's viscountcy after Camperdown.<ref name=\"Hibbert 159\">Hibbert 1994, p. 159</ref> Earl Spencer however demurred, arguing that as Nelson had only been detached in command of a squadron, rather than being the commander in chief of the fleet, such an award would create an unwelcome precedent.

Despite enjoying his lifestyle in Naples, Nelson began to think of returning to England,<ref name=\"Hibbert 162\"/> but King Ferdinand of Naples, after a long period of pressure from his wife [[Maria Carolina of Austria]] and Sir William Hamilton, finally agreed to declare war on France. The Neapolitan army, led by the Austrian [[Karl Mack von Leiberich|General Mack]] and supported by Nelson's fleet, retook Rome from the French in late November, but the French regrouped outside the city and, after being reinforced, routed the Neapolitans. In disarray, the Neapolitan army fled back to Naples, with the pursuing French close behind.<ref name=\"Hibbert 165\">Hibbert 1994, p. 165</ref> Nelson hastily organised the evacuation of the Royal Family, several nobles and the British nationals, including the Hamiltons.

It was on this voyage that Horatio and Emma's illegitimate daughter [[Horatia Nelson|Horatia]] was probably conceived.<ref name=\"Hibbert 207\">Hibbert 1994, p. 207</ref> After the cruise, Nelson conveyed the Queen of Naples and her suite to Leghorn.

During this period Fanny Nelson and Emma Hamilton met for the first time; Nelson was reported as being cold and distant to his wife and his attention to Emma became the subject of gossip.<ref name=\"Hibbert 230\">Hibbert 1994, p. 230</ref> With the marriage breaking down, Nelson began to hate even being in the same room as Fanny.

The battle began badly for the British, with {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|6}}, {{HMS|Bellona|1760|6}} and {{HMS|Russell|1764|6}} running aground, and the rest of the fleet encountering heavier fire from the Danish shore batteries than had been anticipated. Parker sent the signal for Nelson to withdraw, reasoning:<blockquote>I will make the signal for recall for Nelson's sake.

Keep your eyes fixed on him.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 261\">Hibbert 1994, p. 261</ref> He then turned to his flag captain, [[Thomas Foley (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Foley]], and said \"You know, Foley, I have only one eye.

On 30 October Nelson spoke in support of the [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Addington]] government in the House of Lords, and afterwards made regular visits to attend sessions.<ref name=\"Hibbert 298\">Hibbert 1994, p. 298</ref> The three embarked on a tour of England and Wales, visiting [[Birmingham]], [[Warwick]], [[Gloucester]], [[Swansea]], [[Monmouth]] and numerous other towns and villages. Nelson often found himself received as a hero and was the centre of celebrations and events held in his honour.<ref name=\"Hibbert 281\" /> In 1802, Nelson bought [[Merton Place]], a country estate in [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], [[Surrey]] (now south-west London) where he lived briefly with the Hamiltons until William's death in April 1803.<ref name=\"Coleman 298\">Coleman 2001, p. 298</ref> The following month, war broke out again and Nelson prepared to return to sea.<ref name=\"Hibbert 323\">Hibbert 1994, p. 323</ref>\n\n==Return to sea==\n{{Main|Trafalgar Campaign}}\nNelson was appointed commander-in-chief of the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] and given the first-rate {{HMS|Victory}} as his flagship. He joined her at Portsmouth, where he received orders to sail to Malta and take command of a squadron there before joining the blockade of Toulon.<ref name=\"Hibbert 326\">Hibbert 1994, p. 326</ref> Nelson arrived off Toulon in July 1803 and spent the next year and a half enforcing the blockade.

Villeneuve had briefly cruised around the islands before heading back to Europe, in contravention of Napoleon's orders.<ref name=\"Hibbert 337\">Hibbert 1994, p. 337</ref> The returning French fleet was intercepted by a British fleet under Sir [[Robert Calder]] and engaged in the [[Battle of Cape Finisterre (1805)|Battle of Cape Finisterre]], but managed to reach [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]] with only minor losses.<ref name=\"Hibbert 338\">Hibbert 1994, p. 338</ref> Nelson returned to Gibraltar at the end of July, and travelled from there to England, dismayed at his failure to bring the French to battle and expecting to be censured.<ref name=\"Hibbert 339\">Hibbert 1994, p. 339</ref> To his surprise he was given a rapturous reception from crowds who had gathered to view his arrival, while senior British officials congratulated him for sustaining the close pursuit and credited him with saving the West Indies from a French invasion.<ref name=\"Hibbert 339\"/> Nelson stayed briefly in London, where he was cheered wherever he went, before visiting Merton to see Emma, arriving in late August. He entertained a number of his friends and relations there over the coming month, and began plans for a grand engagement with the enemy fleet, one that would surprise his foes by forcing a pell-mell battle on them.<ref name=\"Hibbert 350\">Hibbert 1994, p. 350</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Henry Blackwood]] arrived at Merton early on 2 September, bringing news that the French and Spanish fleets had combined and were currently at anchor in C\u00e1diz. Nelson hurried to London where he met cabinet ministers and was given command of the fleet blockading C\u00e1diz. It was while attending one of these meetings on 12 September, with Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, that Nelson and Major General [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur Wellesley]], the future Duke of Wellington, met briefly in a waiting room. Wellington was waiting to be debriefed on his Indian operations, and Nelson on his chase and future plans. Wellington later recalled, \"He (Nelson) entered at once into conversation with me, if I can call it conversation, for it was almost all on his side and all about himself and, in reality, a style so vain and so silly as to surprise and almost disgust me.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 351\">Hibbert 1994, p. 351</ref> However, after a few minutes Nelson left the room and having been told who his companion was, returned and entered into an earnest and intelligent discussion with the young Wellesley which lasted for a quarter of an hour, on the war, the state of the colonies and the geopolitical situation, that left a marked impression upon Wellesley. This was the only meeting between the two men.<ref>Knight 2005, p. 497</ref>\n\nNelson returned briefly to Merton to set his affairs in order and bid farewell to Emma, before travelling back to London and then on to Portsmouth, arriving there early in the morning of 14 September. He breakfasted at the George Inn with his friends [[George Rose (Treasurer of the Navy)|George Rose]], the [[Vice-President of the Board of Trade]], and [[George Canning]], the [[Treasurer of the Navy]]. During the breakfast word spread of Nelson's presence at the inn and a large crowd of well wishers gathered. They accompanied Nelson to his barge and cheered him off, which Nelson acknowledged by raising his hat. Nelson was recorded as having turned to his colleague and stating: \"I had their huzzas before: I have their hearts now.\"<ref name=\"Sir Nicholas Harris 35\">Nicolas, The Despatches and Letters of Lord Nelson, Vol, VII p. 35 idem p. 36</ref><ref name=\"Tom Pocock 316\">Tom Pocock, Horatio Nelson p. 316</ref><ref name=\"Hibbert 356\">Hibbert 1994, p. 356</ref> [[Robert Southey]] reported on the onlookers for Nelson's walk to the dock: \"Many were in tears and many knelt down before him and blessed him as he passed.\"<ref name=\"Southey 296\">Southey 1922, The Life of Nelson, (1922 edition) p. 296</ref>\n\n''Victory'' joined the British fleet off C\u00e1diz on 27 September, Nelson taking over from Rear Admiral Collingwood.<ref name=\"Hibbert 362\">Hibbert 1994, p. 362</ref> He spent the following weeks preparing and refining his tactics for the anticipated battle and dining with his captains to ensure they understood his intentions.<ref name=\"Hibbert 360\">Hibbert 1994, p. 360</ref> Nelson had devised a plan of attack that anticipated the allied fleet would form up in a traditional [[line of battle]]. Drawing on his own experience from the Nile and Copenhagen, and the examples of Duncan at Camperdown and [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Rodney]] at the [[Battle of the Saintes|Saintes]], Nelson decided to split his fleet into squadrons rather than forming it into a similar line parallel to the enemy.<ref name=\"Adkin411\">Adkin 2007, p. 411</ref> These squadrons would then cut the enemy's line in a number of places, allowing a pell-mell battle to develop in which the British ships could overwhelm and destroy parts of their opponents' formation, before the unengaged enemy ships could come to their aid.<ref name=\"Adkin411\"/>\n\n==Battle of Trafalgar==\n{{Main|Battle of Trafalgar}}\n\n===Preparation===\nThe combined French and Spanish fleet under Villeneuve's command numbered 33 ships of the line. Napoleon Bonaparte had intended for Villeneuve to sail into the English Channel and cover the planned invasion of Britain, but the entry of Austria and Russia into the war forced Napoleon to call off the planned invasion and transfer troops to Germany. Villeneuve had been reluctant to risk an engagement with the British, and this reluctance led Napoleon to order Vice Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois \u00c9tienne de Rosily-Mesros|Fran\u00e7ois Rosily]] to go to C\u00e1diz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon.<ref name=\"Hibbert 362\"/> Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived.<ref name=\"Hibbert 362\"/> On 20 October 1805, the fleet was sighted making its way out of harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that they appeared to be heading to the west.<ref name=\"Hibbert 363\">Hibbert 1994, p. 363</ref>\n[[File:Turner, The Battle of Trafalgar (1822).jpg|thumb|[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|''The Battle of Trafalgar'']] by [[J.

He then went below and made his will, before returning to the quarterdeck to carry out an inspection.<ref name=\"Hibbert 365\">Hibbert 1994, p. 365</ref> Despite having 27 ships to Villeneuve's 33, Nelson was confident of success, declaring that he would not be satisfied with taking fewer than 20 prizes.<ref name=\"Hibbert 365\"/> He returned briefly to his cabin to write a final prayer, after which he joined ''Victory'''s signal lieutenant, [[John Pasco]]. <blockquote>Mr Pasco, I wish to say to the fleet \"England confides that every man will do his duty\". You must be quick, for I have one more signal to make, which is for close action.<ref name=\"Hibbert 366\">Hibbert 1994, p. 366</ref></blockquote> Pasco suggested changing ''confides'' to ''expects'' which, being in the Signal Book, could be signalled by the use of a single code (using three flags), whereas ''confides'' would have to be spelt out letter by letter. Nelson agreed, and [[England expects that every man will do his duty|the signal was hoisted]].<ref name=\"Hibbert 366\"/>\n\nAs the fleets converged, ''Victory'''s captain, Thomas Hardy, suggested that Nelson remove the decorations on his coat, so that he would not be so easily identified by enemy sharpshooters. Nelson replied that it was too late \"to be shifting a coat\", adding that they were \"military orders and he did not fear to show them to the enemy\".<ref name=\"Hibbert 368\">Hibbert 1994, p. 368</ref> Captain [[Henry Blackwood]], of the frigate {{HMS|Euryalus|1803|6}}, suggested Nelson come aboard his ship to better observe the battle. Nelson refused, and also turned down Hardy's suggestion to let [[Eliab Harvey]]'s {{HMS|Temeraire|1798|6}} come ahead of ''Victory'' and lead the line into battle.<ref name=\"Hibbert 368\"/>\n\n===Battle is joined===\n''Victory'' came under fire, initially passing wide, but then with greater accuracy as the distances decreased. A cannonball struck and killed Nelson's secretary, John Scott, nearly cutting him in two. Hardy's clerk took over, but he too was almost immediately killed. ''Victory''{{'}}s wheel was shot away, and another cannonball cut down eight marines. Hardy, standing next to Nelson on the quarterdeck, had his shoe buckle dented by a splinter. Nelson observed, \"This is too warm work to last long.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\">Hibbert 1994, p. 370</ref> ''Victory'' had by now reached the enemy line, and Hardy asked Nelson which ship to engage first. Nelson told him to take his pick, and Hardy moved ''Victory'' across the stern of the 80-gun French flagship ''[[French ship Bucentaure (1804)|Bucentaure]]''.<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\"/> ''Victory'' then came under fire from the 74-gun ''[[French ship Redoutable (1791)|Redoutable]]'', lying off ''Bucentaure''{{'}}s stern, and the 130-gun ''[[Spanish ship Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad (1769)|Sant\u00edsima Trinidad]]''.

Hardy rushed to him, at which point Nelson smiled <blockquote>Hardy, I do believe they have done it at last .... my backbone is shot through.<ref name=\"Hibbert 370\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe had been hit by a marksman from ''Redoutable'', firing at a range of 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh [[thoracic vertebrae]], and lodged two inches (5&nbsp;cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller.<ref name=\"Hibbert 371\">Hibbert 1994, p. 371</ref> He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon [[William Beatty (surgeon)|William Beatty]], telling him <blockquote>You can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through.<ref name=\"Hibbert 372\">Hibbert 1994, p. 372</ref></blockquote> Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.<ref name=\"Hibbert 372\"/>\n\nHardy came belowdecks to see Nelson just after half-past two, and informed him that a number of enemy ships had surrendered. Nelson told him that he was sure to die, and begged him to pass his possessions to Emma.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\">Hibbert 1994, p. 376</ref> With Nelson at this point were the chaplain [[Alexander John Scott|Alexander Scott]], the purser [[Walter Burke (Purser)|Walter Burke]], Nelson's steward, Chevalier, and Beatty. Nelson, fearing that a gale was blowing up, instructed Hardy to be sure to anchor. After reminding him to \"take care of poor Lady Hamilton\", Nelson said \"Kiss me, Hardy\".<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/> Beatty recorded that Hardy knelt and kissed Nelson on the cheek. He then stood for a minute or two before kissing him on the forehead. Nelson asked, \"Who is that?\", and on hearing that it was Hardy, he replied \"God bless you, Hardy.\"<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/> By now very weak, Nelson continued to murmur instructions to Burke and Scott, \"fan, fan&nbsp;... rub, rub&nbsp;... drink, drink.\" Beatty heard Nelson murmur, \"Thank God I have done my duty\", and when he returned, Nelson's voice had faded and his pulse was very weak.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/> He looked up as Beatty took his pulse, then closed his eyes. Scott, who remained by Nelson as he died, recorded his last words as \"God and my country\".<ref name=\"Hayward 63\">Hayward 2003, p. 63</ref> Nelson died at half-past four, three hours after he had been shot.<ref name=\"Hibbert 376\"/>\n[[File:Daniel Maclise - The Death of Nelson - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|center|800px|''The Death of Nelson'' by [[Daniel Maclise]] (Houses of Parliament, London)]]\n\n==Return to England==\nNelson's body was placed in a cask of [[brandy]] mixed with [[camphor]] and [[myrrh]], which was then lashed to the ''Victory''{{'}}s mainmast and placed under guard.<ref name=\"Hibbert 378\">Hibbert 1994, p. 378</ref> ''Victory'' was towed to [[Gibraltar]] after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with [[spirits of wine]].<ref name=\"Hibbert 378\"/> Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard {{HMS|Pickle|1800|6}}, and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton.

He based his command on love rather than authority, inspiring both his superiors and his subordinates with his considerable courage, commitment and charisma, dubbed \"[[The Nelson Touch|the Nelson touch]]\".<ref name=\"Lambert107-8\"/><ref name=\"LambertXVII\">Lambert 2004, xvii</ref> Nelson combined this talent with an adept grasp of strategy and politics, making him a highly successful naval commander. The memorandum he wrote before Trafalgar expresses his attitude well: \"No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item106127.html|title=Nelson's Trafalgar Memorandum|website=www.bl.uk}}</ref>\n\nNelson's personality was complex, often characterised by a desire to be noticed, both by his superiors, and the public. He was easily flattered by praise, and dismayed when he felt he was not given sufficient credit for his actions.<ref name=\"Lambert44\">Lambert 2004, p. 44</ref> This led him to take risks, and to enthusiastically publicise his resultant successes,<ref name=\"Lambert64\">Lambert 2004, p. 64</ref> which was not always considered acceptable at the time.<ref>Warner, Oliver.

[https://archive.org/details/commandatseagrea00warn Internet Archive website] Retrieved 19 July 2019.</ref> Nelson was also highly confident in his abilities, determined and able to make important decisions.<ref name=\"Lambert52-3\">Lambert 2004, pp. 52\u201353</ref> His active career meant that he was considerably experienced in combat, and was a shrewd judge of his opponents, able to identify and exploit his enemies' weaknesses.<ref name=\"Lambert107-8\">Lambert 2004, pp. 107\u201308</ref> He was often prone to insecurities, however, as well as violent mood swings,<ref name=\"Lambert4\">Lambert 2004, p. 4</ref> and was extremely vain: he loved to receive decorations, tributes, and praise.<ref name=\"Lambert151\">Lambert 2004, p. 151</ref> Despite his personality, he remained a highly professional leader and was driven all his life by a strong sense of duty.<ref name=\"Lambert4\"/> Nelson's fame reached new heights after his death, and he came to be regarded as one of Britain's greatest military heroes, ranked alongside the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].<ref>Lee 2005, pp. 3\u20134</ref> In the [[BBC]]'s ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' programme in 2002, Nelson was voted the ninth greatest Briton of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2509465.stm|title= Churchill voted greatest Briton|publisher= bbc.co.uk|date= 24 November 2002}}</ref>\n\nAspects of Nelson's life and career were controversial, both during his lifetime and after his death. His affair with Emma Hamilton was widely remarked upon and disapproved of, to the extent that Emma was denied permission to attend Nelson's funeral and was subsequently ignored by the government, which awarded money and titles to Nelson's legitimate family.<ref name=\"Oman571-2\">Oman 1987, pp. 571\u201372</ref> Nelson's actions during the reoccupation of Naples have also been the subject of debate: his approval of the wave of reprisals against the Jacobins who had surrendered under the terms agreed by [[Fabrizio Ruffo|Cardinal Ruffo]], and his personal intervention in securing the execution of Caracciolo, are considered by some biographers, such as [[Robert Southey]], to have been a shameful breach of honour. Prominent contemporary politician [[Charles James Fox]] was among those who attacked Nelson for his actions at Naples, declaring in the House of Commons <blockquote>I wish that the atrocities of which we hear so much and which I abhor as much as any man, were indeed unexampled. I fear that they do not belong exclusively to the French&nbsp;\u2013 Naples for instance has been what is called \"delivered\", and yet, if I am rightly informed, it has been stained and polluted by murders so ferocious, and by cruelties of every kind so abhorrent, that the heart shudders at the recital&nbsp;... [The besieged rebels] demanded that a British officer should be brought forward, and to him they capitulated. They made terms with him under the sanction of the British name. Before they sailed their property was confiscated, numbers were thrown into dungeons, and some of them, I understand, notwithstanding the British guarantee, were actually executed.<ref name=\"Coleman228\">Coleman 2001, p. 228</ref></blockquote> Other pro-republican writers produced books and pamphlets decrying the events in Naples as atrocities.<ref name=\"Lambert365-6\">Lambert 2004, pp. 365\u201366</ref> Later assessments, including one by [[Andrew Lambert]], have stressed that the armistice had not been authorised by the King of Naples, and that the retribution meted out by the Neapolitans was not unusual for the time. Lambert also suggests that Nelson in fact acted to put an end to the bloodshed, using his ships and men to restore order in the city.<ref name=\"Lambert365-6\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{Main|Legacy of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Monuments and memorials to Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson}}\n{{see also|List of places named after Horatio Nelson|HMS Lord Nelson|HMS Nelson}}\n[[File:Nelson's Column, Trafalgar Sq, London - Sep 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], London]]\n\nNelson's influence continued long after his death, and saw periodic revivals of interest, especially during times of crisis in Britain.

Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish forces during the siege of M\u00e1laga by the Catholic monarchs against the Emirate of Granada {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}, and civilian variants were put into operation in the 1830s  Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered ambulances.\n\n== Early patient transport ==\n[[File:FDNY ambulance, 1949.jpg|thumb|An FDNY ambulance in 1949]]\nThere is evidence of forced transport of those with [[psychiatric]] problems or [[leprosy]] in ancient times.

The Spanish army of the time was well treated and attracted volunteers from across the continent; and among their benefits were the first [[military hospital]]s (''ambulancias''), although injured soldiers were not picked up for treatment until after the cessation of the battle, resulting in many dying on the field.\n\nA major change in usage of ambulances in battle came about with the ''ambulances volantes'' designed by [[Dominique Jean Larrey]] (1766&ndash;1842), who later became [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]\u2019s chief physician.<ref name=fly1>{{cite journal|journal= World Journal of Surgery|title= \"To afford the wounded speedy assistance\": Dominique Jean Larrey and Napoleon|publisher= Springer-Verlag |issn= 0364-2313|year= 2006|volume= 30|issue= 8|pages= 1392\u20139|pmid= 16850154|doi= 10.1007/s00268-005-0436-8|first1= Panagiotis N. |last1= Skandalakis |first2= Panagiotis |last2= Lainas |first3= Odyseas |last3= Zoras |first4= John E. |last4= Skandalakis |first5= Petros |last5= Mirilas}}</ref><ref name=fly2>{{cite journal|url= http://napoleonic-literature.com/Flying_Ambulance.htm |title= The Revolutionary Flying Ambulance of Napoleon's Surgeon |last= Ortiz |first= Captain Jose M |date =October\u2013December 1998 |pages= 17\u201325 |volume= 8 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514091424/http://www.napoleonic-literature.com/Flying_Ambulance.htm |archivedate= 2008-05-14 }}</ref> Larrey was present at the battle of [[Speyer|Spires]],<ref>\nThe French [[Army of the Rhine (1791-1801)|Army of the Rhine]] under the command of [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine]] captured Speyer on 30 September 1792.\n</ref>\nbetween the [[France|French]] and [[Prussia]]ns, and was distressed that wounded soldiers were not picked up by the numerous ambulances (which regulations required to be stationed two and half miles back from the scene of battle) until after hostilities had ceased, so he set about developing a new ambulance system.<ref name=Ambulance/><ref name=fly1/> Having decided against using the Norman system of horse [[Litter (rescue basket)|litters]], he settled on two- or four-wheeled [[horse]]-drawn wagons to transport fallen soldiers from the (active) battlefield ''after'' they had received early treatment in the field. Larrey adapted the axle assembly from the French army's horse-drawn artillery (\"flying artillery\" \u2013 ''{{ill|artillerie volante|fr|Artillerie \u00e0 cheval}}'') that made their gun carriages especially maneuverable on uneven terrain, and so christened his ambulances \"flying ambulances\" (''ambulances volantes'').  The flying ambulances were first used by the Army of the Rhine in 1793. Larrey subsequently developed similar services for Napoleon's armies, and adapted his ambulances to the conditions; including developing a litter which could be carried by a camel for the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|1798-1801 French campaign in Egypt]].<ref name=fly2/>\n\n== Development of civilian services ==\n\nIn civilian ambulances, a major advance was made with the introduction of a transport carriage for [[cholera]] patients in London in 1832. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper said, \"The curative process commences the instant the patient is put in to the carriage; time is saved which can be given to the care of the patient; the patient may be driven to the hospital so speedily that the hospitals may be less numerous and located at greater distances from each other\".<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\n== Advances during the American Civil War ==\n[[File:Civil War Zouave ambulance.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn ambulance from the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865)]]\n\nMore advances in medical care for the military were made during the [[United States]]\u2019 [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Union military physicians Joseph Barnes and Jonathan Letterman built upon Larrey\u2019s work and designed a prehospital care system for soldiers, which used new techniques and methods of transport. They ensured that ''every'' regiment possessed at least one ambulance cart, with a two-wheeled design that accommodated two or three patients. These ambulances unfortunately proved to be too lightweight for the task, and were phased out to be replaced by the \"Rucker\" ambulance, named for Major General Rucker,<ref name=Ambulance/> which was a four-wheeled design, and was a common sight on battlefield of that war. Other vehicles were pressed into service during the civil war, including a number of [[steamboat]]s, which served as mobile hospitals for the troops. It was in this period that the practice of transporting wounded soldiers to treatment facilities by [[railroad]] was introduced.<ref name=\"Kuehl\">Kuehl, Alexander E. (Ed.). ''Prehospital Systems and Medical Oversight'', 3rd edition. ''National Association of EMS Physicians''. 2002. @ ch. 1.</ref>\n\n== Hospital-based services begin ==\n[[File:Bellevue Hospital Ambulance, New York Times, 1895.JPG|thumb|A horse-drawn ambulance outside [[Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York City]], 1895]]\n\nThe first known hospital-based ambulance service was based out of Commercial Hospital, [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], (now the University of Cincinnati Medical Center) by 1865.<ref name=Ambulance/> This was soon followed by other services, notably the [[New York City|New York]] service provided out of [[Bellevue Hospital]]. [[Edward Dalton]], a former surgeon in the [[Union Army]], was charged with creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, [[morphine]], and [[brandy]], reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: within a few months this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' [[Horse harness|harness]] arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30&nbsp;seconds of being called.<ref name=ambhist>The Ambulance: A History. Ryan Corbett Bell. McFarland & Co., 2009 ({{ISBN|978-0786438112}})</ref> The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392.<ref name=Ambulance/> For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes.<ref name=ambhist/>  This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.<ref name=ambhist/>\n\nIn 1867, the city of [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]], in the [[United Kingdom]], received six horse-drawn ambulances for the purpose of conveying [[smallpox]] and fever patients from their homes to a hospital. These ambulances were designed to resemble private carriages, but were equipped with rollers in their floors and large rear doors to allow for a patient, lying on a specially designed bed, to be easily loaded. Space was provided for an attendant to ride with the patient, and the entire patient compartment was designed to be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Anyone willing to pay the cost of horse hire could summon the ambulance by telegram or in person.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higginbotham|first=Peter|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances/MAB-Ambulances.shtml|title=The MAB Land Ambulance Service|date=October 2005|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Workhouses Information|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914024956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances%2FMAB-Ambulances.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-14}}</ref>\n\n== Dedicated services begin ==\nIn 1880, the President of the [[Liverpool Medical Institution]], [[Reginald Harrison]], suggested a horse-drawn ambulance for the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ambulance in Civil Life: Being An Address Delivered at the Liverpool Medical Society, 6 October 1881|last=Harrison|first=Reginald|publisher=John Bale|year=1902|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YtlthqHmHsC&pg=PA355|title=The Ambulance: A History|last=Bell|first=Ryan Corbett|date=2009-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786438112|location=|pages=11\u201317|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In 1884, this ambulance service was created based at the Liverpool Northern Hospital: it was the first in Britain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1908-03-07|title=REGINALD HARRISON, F.R.C.S.Eng|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/2462/601|journal=British Medical Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2462|pages=601\u2013603|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2462.601|pmc=2436126|issn=0007-1447|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1887 the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]] was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in London.<ref name=sja1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|title=St John Ambulance in the Industrial Revolution|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2007-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626032454/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|archive-date=2007-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure.

In 1910 the Brigade began its first public duty at the Royal Dublin Society. During the 1916 rising and (after becoming the independent [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland]]) the 'Emergency' (World War II) the brigade acted as an ambulance service and remained so until the set up of Regional Ambulance Services.\n\nIn 1938 the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] was set up in Galway. In the years since this voluntary service has gone from strength to strength and is now Ireland's largest voluntary ambulance service and one of Ireland's largest charities.\n\nIn [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], military medic Seymour Warrian called a public meeting in Brisbane and established an ambulance service after witnessing an event at the Brisbane showgrounds during Show Week in 1892.<ref name=qab>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/about/|title=History of Queensland Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Queensland Ambulance Service}}</ref> A fallen rider, suffering a broken leg was walked off the field by well-meaning but misguided bystanders, worsening his injury. As a result of the meeting, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on the 12 September.<ref name=qab/> The first [[ambulance station]] in Queensland operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company and officers on night duty slept on rolls of newspaper on the floor. They had a stretcher, but no vehicle and transported patients on foot, although in time, they gained horse-drawn stretchers and eventually vehicles. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. In 1991 the independent QATB centres amalgamated to form the Queensland Ambulance Service which is now the fourth largest ambulance service in the world.<ref name=qab/>\n\n== Mass transit use for emergency medical provision ==\n\nIn the late 19th century cities, including [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] and [[St Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] started using trolley cars on their [[tram]] network which were designed to act as ambulances, transporting the sick and injured. The trolley cars in Bahia included a fumigating compartment and a two-bed nurses work area. The design of the tram network in St Louis was such that the ambulance streetcar, introduced in 1894 was able to reach all 16 infirmaries in the city.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nIn Germany, in 1902, a civilian ambulance train was introduced (building on the use of trains during military conflict) for use during railway accidents. It housed a mobile operating room and eight stretchers. Railroad employed surgeons lived near the railway station where the ambulance train was stationed, and were summoned to urgently attend in the event of an emergency. This train had priority over the tracks, with all other trains obliged to give way.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\n== Introduction of motor units ==\n[[File:DFVAC 1948 Cadillac Miller Meteor front passenger quarter.jpg|thumb|A 1948 Cadillac [[Miller-Meteor|Meteor]] ambulance]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[automobile]] was being developed, and started to be introduced alongside horse-drawn models; early 20th-century ambulances were powered by [[steam]], [[gasoline]], and [[electricity]], reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motor-powered ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the [[Michael Reese Hospital]], [[Chicago]], taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated in February 1899 by 500 prominent local businessmen.<ref name=Ambulance/> This was followed in 1900, by New York City, which extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with {{convert|2|hp}} motors on the rear axle.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first gasoline-powered ambulance was the Palliser Ambulance, introduced in 1905, and named for Capt. [[John Palliser]] of the Canadian Militia. This three-wheeled vehicle (one at the front, two at the rear) was designed for use on the battlefield, under enemy fire. It was a heavy tractor unit, cased in bulletproof steel sheets. These steel shields opened outwards to provide a small area of cover from fire (nine feet wide by {{convert|7|ft|m}} high) for the ambulance staff when the vehicle was stationary.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe British Army followed quickly behind the Canadians in introducing a limited number of automobile ambulances. In 1905, the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] commissioned a number of [[Straker-Squire]] motor ambulance vans. They were based on a double-decker bus manufactured by the same company, although on a shorter wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steamtraction.com/archive/5090/|title=The Straker-Squire 1905 Ambulance|accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=Steam Traction}}</ref> A number of them were based in Oxfordshire, serving several major encampments in the area.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first mass-production automobile-based ambulance (rather than one-off models) was produced in the United States in 1909 by the [[James Cunningham, Son & Company]] of [[Rochester, New York]], a manufacturer of carriages and hearses. This ambulance, named the ''Model 774 Automobile Ambulance'', featured a proprietary {{convert|32|hp}}, 4-cylinder [[internal combustion]] engine. The chassis rode on pneumatic tires, while the body featured electric lights, a suspended cot with two attendant seats, and a side-mounted gong.<ref>McCall, Walter MP. 2002. \"The American Ambulance\", ''Iconografix''</ref>\n\n== World War I ==\n\nDuring World War One, the Red Cross brought in the first widespread battlefield motor ambulances to replace horse-drawn vehicles, a change which was such a success, the horse-drawn variants were quickly phased out. In civilian emergency care, dedicated ambulance services were frequently managed or dispatched by individual [[hospital]]s, though in some areas, [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] services enabled [[police]] departments to handle dispatch duties.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" />\n\nThe equipment carried by the ambulance was changing fast at this time. Traction splints were introduced during [[World War I]], and were found to have a positive effect on the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] of patients with leg fractures. [[Two-way radio]]s became available shortly after World War I, providing more efficient radio [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] of ambulances. Shortly before [[World War II]], then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a [[physician]], and was dispatched by radio. It was frequently found that ambulances were [[hearse]]s \u2013 the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient \u2013 and were thus frequently run by [[funeral home]]s. These vehicles which could serve for either purpose were known as [[combination car]]s.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |title=Miller-Meteor History |accessdate=2007-06-02 |publisher=Miller Meteor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314002150/http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |archivedate=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Air ambulances ==\n\n[[File:Flying doctor Alice Springs 1954.jpg|thumb|Australian Flying Doctor Service vehicles in 1954]]\n\nDuring World War One, aviation moved from experimentation to a powerful military force, and following the war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into ambulance planes. Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the [[Australia]]n [[Outback]]; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality under the guidance of the Very Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] in 1928 when the [[Australian Inland Mission]] service established the Aerial <!--Note: proper name is \"Aerial\", because it was founded in Australia--> Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]].<ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|title=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612073357/http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|archive-date=2007-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:Phaenomen granit 30.JPG|thumb|A German ambulance of the World War II era]]\n\nIn much of the world, ambulance quality fell sharply during the Second World War, as physicians, needed by the armed services, were pulled off ambulances. In the [[United Kingdom]], during the [[Battle of Britain]], the need for ambulances was so great that vans were commandeered and pressed into service, often carrying several victims at once. Following the war, physicians would continue to ride ambulances in some countries, but not in others. Other vehicles, including civilian and [[police car]]s were pressed into service to transport patients due to a lack of a dedicated resource.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>King, Dean. ''Patrick O'Brian: a Life''. ''Owl Books''. 2001 @ p. 81</ref>\nMilitary ambulances such as the [[Austin K2/Y]] were used both in the combat areas and on the [[Home Front]].

They also saw combat in Africa and through parts of Europe and the Pacific.\n\n== The KOrean War ==\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the newly created [[United States Air Force]] produced a number of air-ambulance units for use in forward operating medical units, using helicopters for rapid evacuation of patients. The [[H-13 Sioux]] helicopter, made famous by the film and television versions of ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', transported 18,000 wounded soldiers during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_medical_evac_helio_korea.php|publisher=olive-drab.com|title=Medical Evacuation in the Korean War}}</ref> The work of the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons was a success and was repeated by U.S. forces in Vietnam. The use of helicopters for emergency medical evacuations extended to civilian practice by groups such as the [[Shock Trauma Air Rescue Society]].\n\n== Move to on-scene care ==\n[[File:StratfordPd64.jpg|thumb|A 1964 police cruiser, which is also fitted to transport patients]]\n\nAfter the [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash]] in 1952, ambulances in Britain were restructured to be a \"mobile hospital\", rather than just transporting patients, thus leading to modern ambulances. [[CPR]] was developed and accepted as the standard of care for out-of-hospital [[cardiac arrest]]; [[defibrillation]], based in part on an increased understanding of heart arrhythmias, was introduced, as were new [[pharmaceutical]]s to be used in cardiac arrest situations; in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]], a mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies;<ref name=Ambulance/> and well-developed studies demonstrated the need for overhauling ambulance services.

The Spanish army of the time was well treated and attracted volunteers from across the continent; and among their benefits were the first [[military hospital]]s (''ambulancias''), although injured soldiers were not picked up for treatment until after the cessation of the battle, resulting in many dying on the field.\n\nA major change in usage of ambulances in battle came about with the ''ambulances volantes'' designed by [[Dominique Jean Larrey]] (1766&ndash;1842), who later became [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]\u2019s chief physician.<ref name=fly1>{{cite journal|journal= World Journal of Surgery|title= \"To afford the wounded speedy assistance\": Dominique Jean Larrey and Napoleon|publisher= Springer-Verlag |issn= 0364-2313|year= 2006|volume= 30|issue= 8|pages= 1392\u20139|pmid= 16850154|doi= 10.1007/s00268-005-0436-8|first1= Panagiotis N. |last1= Skandalakis |first2= Panagiotis |last2= Lainas |first3= Odyseas |last3= Zoras |first4= John E. |last4= Skandalakis |first5= Petros |last5= Mirilas}}</ref><ref name=fly2>{{cite journal|url= http://napoleonic-literature.com/Flying_Ambulance.htm |title= The Revolutionary Flying Ambulance of Napoleon's Surgeon |last= Ortiz |first= Captain Jose M |date =October\u2013December 1998 |pages= 17\u201325 |volume= 8 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080514091424/http://www.napoleonic-literature.com/Flying_Ambulance.htm |archivedate= 2008-05-14 }}</ref> Larrey was present at the battle of [[Speyer|Spires]],<ref>\nThe French [[Army of the Rhine (1791-1801)|Army of the Rhine]] under the command of [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine|Custine]] captured Speyer on 30 September 1792.\n</ref>\nbetween the [[France|French]] and [[Prussia]]ns, and was distressed that wounded soldiers were not picked up by the numerous ambulances (which regulations required to be stationed two and half miles back from the scene of battle) until after hostilities had ceased, so he set about developing a new ambulance system.<ref name=Ambulance/><ref name=fly1/> Having decided against using the Norman system of horse [[Litter (rescue basket)|litters]], he settled on two- or four-wheeled [[horse]]-drawn wagons to transport fallen soldiers from the (active) battlefield ''after'' they had received early treatment in the field. Larrey adapted the axle assembly from the French army's horse-drawn artillery (\"flying artillery\" \u2013 ''{{ill|artillerie volante|fr|Artillerie \u00e0 cheval}}'') that made their gun carriages especially maneuverable on uneven terrain, and so christened his ambulances \"flying ambulances\" (''ambulances volantes'').  The flying ambulances were first used by the Army of the Rhine in 1793. Larrey subsequently developed similar services for Napoleon's armies, and adapted his ambulances to the conditions; including developing a litter which could be carried by a camel for the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|1798-1801 French campaign in Egypt]].<ref name=fly2/>\n\n== Development of civilian services ==\n\nIn civilian ambulances, a major advance was made with the introduction of a transport carriage for [[cholera]] patients in London in 1832. ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper said, \"The curative process commences the instant the patient is put in to the carriage; time is saved which can be given to the care of the patient; the patient may be driven to the hospital so speedily that the hospitals may be less numerous and located at greater distances from each other\".<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\n== Advances during the American Civil War ==\n[[File:Civil War Zouave ambulance.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn ambulance from the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865)]]\n\nMore advances in medical care for the military were made during the [[United States]]\u2019 [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Union military physicians Joseph Barnes and Jonathan Letterman built upon Larrey\u2019s work and designed a prehospital care system for soldiers, which used new techniques and methods of transport. They ensured that ''every'' regiment possessed at least one ambulance cart, with a two-wheeled design that accommodated two or three patients. These ambulances unfortunately proved to be too lightweight for the task, and were phased out to be replaced by the \"Rucker\" ambulance, named for Major General Rucker,<ref name=Ambulance/> which was a four-wheeled design, and was a common sight on battlefield of that war. Other vehicles were pressed into service during the civil war, including a number of [[steamboat]]s, which served as mobile hospitals for the troops. It was in this period that the practice of transporting wounded soldiers to treatment facilities by [[railroad]] was introduced.<ref name=\"Kuehl\">Kuehl, Alexander E. (Ed.).

[[Edward Dalton]], a former surgeon in the [[Union Army]], was charged with creating a hospital in lower New York; he started an ambulance service to bring the patients to the hospital faster and in more comfort, a service which started in 1869. These ambulances carried medical equipment, such as splints, a stomach pump, [[morphine]], and [[brandy]], reflecting contemporary medicine. Dalton believed that speed was of the essence, and at first the horses were kept in harness while awaiting a call: within a few months this practice had been replaced with a 'drop,' or 'snap,' [[Horse harness|harness]] arrangement, whereby the tack was lowered by pulley from the ceiling straight onto the horse: under either scheme, ambulances were ready to go within 30&nbsp;seconds of being called.<ref name=ambhist>The Ambulance: A History. Ryan Corbett Bell. McFarland & Co., 2009 ({{ISBN|978-0786438112}})</ref> The service was very popular and grew rapidly, with the year 1870 seeing the ambulances attend 1401 emergency calls, but twenty-one years later, this had more than tripled to 4392.<ref name=Ambulance/> For the first week of their operation, the ambulances were crewed by the hospital's house-staff, after which the hospital hired Drs. Duncan Lee and Robert Taylor as full-time ambulance surgeons; going forward, the plan was to crew the ambulances with fresh graduates of Bellevue's surgical training program, who would serve for six-month terms and be replaced by new hires from successive graduating classes.<ref name=ambhist/>  This scheme foundered immediately, however, when graduates balked at the schedule and the salary offered: $50 a month, twelve-hour shifts, and one day off every four weeks. Instead, by the end of 1869, the system of staffing the ambulance with residents in training (who could simply be assigned, rather than having to be recruited) was firmly established. As late as 1935, these interns were earning the same $50 a month their grandfathers had received.<ref name=ambhist/>\n\nIn 1867, the city of [[London]]'s [[Metropolitan Asylums Board]], in the [[United Kingdom]], received six horse-drawn ambulances for the purpose of conveying [[smallpox]] and fever patients from their homes to a hospital. These ambulances were designed to resemble private carriages, but were equipped with rollers in their floors and large rear doors to allow for a patient, lying on a specially designed bed, to be easily loaded. Space was provided for an attendant to ride with the patient, and the entire patient compartment was designed to be easily cleaned and decontaminated. Anyone willing to pay the cost of horse hire could summon the ambulance by telegram or in person.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higginbotham|first=Peter|url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances/MAB-Ambulances.shtml|title=The MAB Land Ambulance Service|date=October 2005|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Workhouses Information|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914024956/http://www.workhouses.org.uk/index.html?MAB-Ambulances%2FMAB-Ambulances.shtml|archivedate=2007-09-14}}</ref>\n\n== Dedicated services begin ==\nIn 1880, the President of the [[Liverpool Medical Institution]], [[Reginald Harrison]], suggested a horse-drawn ambulance for the city.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ambulance in Civil Life: Being An Address Delivered at the Liverpool Medical Society, 6 October 1881|last=Harrison|first=Reginald|publisher=John Bale|year=1902|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-YtlthqHmHsC&pg=PA355|title=The Ambulance: A History|last=Bell|first=Ryan Corbett|date=2009-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786438112|location=|pages=11\u201317|language=en|quote=|via=}}</ref> In 1884, this ambulance service was created based at the Liverpool Northern Hospital: it was the first in Britain.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1908-03-07|title=REGINALD HARRISON, F.R.C.S.Eng|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/1/2462/601|journal=British Medical Journal|language=en|volume=1|issue=2462|pages=601\u2013603|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.2462.601|pmc=2436126|issn=0007-1447|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1887 the [[St John Ambulance Brigade]] was established to provide first aid and ambulance services at public events in London.<ref name=sja1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|title=St John Ambulance in the Industrial Revolution|publisher=St John Ambulance UK|accessdate=2007-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626032454/http://www.sja.org.uk/sja/about-us/our-history/industrial-revolution.aspx|archive-date=2007-06-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was modelled on a military-style command and discipline structure.

In 1910 the Brigade began its first public duty at the Royal Dublin Society. During the 1916 rising and (after becoming the independent [[St. John Ambulance Brigade of Ireland]]) the 'Emergency' (World War II) the brigade acted as an ambulance service and remained so until the set up of Regional Ambulance Services.\n\nIn 1938 the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] was set up in Galway. In the years since this voluntary service has gone from strength to strength and is now Ireland's largest voluntary ambulance service and one of Ireland's largest charities.\n\nIn [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], military medic Seymour Warrian called a public meeting in Brisbane and established an ambulance service after witnessing an event at the Brisbane showgrounds during Show Week in 1892.<ref name=qab>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/about/|title=History of Queensland Ambulance Service|accessdate=2007-06-16|publisher=Queensland Ambulance Service}}</ref> A fallen rider, suffering a broken leg was walked off the field by well-meaning but misguided bystanders, worsening his injury. As a result of the meeting, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on the 12 September.<ref name=qab/> The first [[ambulance station]] in Queensland operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company and officers on night duty slept on rolls of newspaper on the floor. They had a stretcher, but no vehicle and transported patients on foot, although in time, they gained horse-drawn stretchers and eventually vehicles. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. In 1991 the independent QATB centres amalgamated to form the Queensland Ambulance Service which is now the fourth largest ambulance service in the world.<ref name=qab/>\n\n== Mass transit use for emergency medical provision ==\n\nIn the late 19th century cities, including [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] and [[St Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] started using trolley cars on their [[tram]] network which were designed to act as ambulances, transporting the sick and injured. The trolley cars in Bahia included a fumigating compartment and a two-bed nurses work area. The design of the tram network in St Louis was such that the ambulance streetcar, introduced in 1894 was able to reach all 16 infirmaries in the city.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nIn Germany, in 1902, a civilian ambulance train was introduced (building on the use of trains during military conflict) for use during railway accidents. It housed a mobile operating room and eight stretchers. Railroad employed surgeons lived near the railway station where the ambulance train was stationed, and were summoned to urgently attend in the event of an emergency. This train had priority over the tracks, with all other trains obliged to give way.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\n== Introduction of motor units ==\n[[File:DFVAC 1948 Cadillac Miller Meteor front passenger quarter.jpg|thumb|A 1948 Cadillac [[Miller-Meteor|Meteor]] ambulance]]\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[automobile]] was being developed, and started to be introduced alongside horse-drawn models; early 20th-century ambulances were powered by [[steam]], [[gasoline]], and [[electricity]], reflecting the competing automotive technologies then in existence. However, the first motor-powered ambulance was brought into service in the last year of the 19th century, with the [[Michael Reese Hospital]], [[Chicago]], taking delivery of the first automobile ambulance, donated in February 1899 by 500 prominent local businessmen.<ref name=Ambulance/> This was followed in 1900, by New York City, which extolled its virtues of greater speed, more safety for the patient, faster stopping and a smoother ride. These first two automobile ambulances were electrically powered with {{convert|2|hp}} motors on the rear axle.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first gasoline-powered ambulance was the Palliser Ambulance, introduced in 1905, and named for Capt. [[John Palliser]] of the Canadian Militia. This three-wheeled vehicle (one at the front, two at the rear) was designed for use on the battlefield, under enemy fire. It was a heavy tractor unit, cased in bulletproof steel sheets. These steel shields opened outwards to provide a small area of cover from fire (nine feet wide by {{convert|7|ft|m}} high) for the ambulance staff when the vehicle was stationary.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe British Army followed quickly behind the Canadians in introducing a limited number of automobile ambulances. In 1905, the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] commissioned a number of [[Straker-Squire]] motor ambulance vans. They were based on a double-decker bus manufactured by the same company, although on a shorter wheelbase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steamtraction.com/archive/5090/|title=The Straker-Squire 1905 Ambulance|accessdate=2007-06-05|publisher=Steam Traction}}</ref> A number of them were based in Oxfordshire, serving several major encampments in the area.<ref name=Ambulance/>\n\nThe first mass-production automobile-based ambulance (rather than one-off models) was produced in the United States in 1909 by the [[James Cunningham, Son & Company]] of [[Rochester, New York]], a manufacturer of carriages and hearses. This ambulance, named the ''Model 774 Automobile Ambulance'', featured a proprietary {{convert|32|hp}}, 4-cylinder [[internal combustion]] engine. The chassis rode on pneumatic tires, while the body featured electric lights, a suspended cot with two attendant seats, and a side-mounted gong.<ref>McCall, Walter MP. 2002. \"The American Ambulance\", ''Iconografix''</ref>\n\n== World War I ==\n\nDuring World War One, the Red Cross brought in the first widespread battlefield motor ambulances to replace horse-drawn vehicles, a change which was such a success, the horse-drawn variants were quickly phased out. In civilian emergency care, dedicated ambulance services were frequently managed or dispatched by individual [[hospital]]s, though in some areas, [[telegraph]] and [[telephone]] services enabled [[police]] departments to handle dispatch duties.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" />\n\nThe equipment carried by the ambulance was changing fast at this time. Traction splints were introduced during [[World War I]], and were found to have a positive effect on the [[morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]] of patients with leg fractures. [[Two-way radio]]s became available shortly after World War I, providing more efficient radio [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] of ambulances. Shortly before [[World War II]], then, a modern ambulance carried advanced medical equipment, was staffed by a [[physician]], and was dispatched by radio. It was frequently found that ambulances were [[hearse]]s \u2013 the only available vehicle that could carry a recumbent patient \u2013 and were thus frequently run by [[funeral home]]s. These vehicles which could serve for either purpose were known as [[combination car]]s.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |title=Miller-Meteor History |accessdate=2007-06-02 |publisher=Miller Meteor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314002150/http://www.miller-meteor.com/history.asp |archivedate=2007-03-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Air ambulances ==\n\n[[File:Flying doctor Alice Springs 1954.jpg|thumb|Australian Flying Doctor Service vehicles in 1954]]\n\nDuring World War One, aviation moved from experimentation to a powerful military force, and following the war, with a surplus of aircraft in circulation, new uses were found for the aircraft. This included the conversion of planes throughout the world into ambulance planes. Although in 1917, Lieutenant Clifford Peel, a medical student, outlined a system of [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and ground facilities designed to provide medical services to the [[Australia]]n [[Outback]]; the first custom-built air ambulances did not come into existence until the late 1920s. These ideas became reality under the guidance of the Very Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] in 1928 when the [[Australian Inland Mission]] service established the Aerial <!--Note: proper name is \"Aerial\", because it was founded in Australia--> Medical Service, a one-year experimental program. Physicians in this program had several responsibilities, one of which was to fly out to a patient, treat the patient, and fly the patient to a hospital if the physician could not deliver adequate care on scene. Eventually, this experiment became the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia]].<ref name=Flying>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|title=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|accessdate=2007-06-02|publisher=Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612073357/http://www.flyingdoctor.net/|archive-date=2007-06-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n[[File:Phaenomen granit 30.JPG|thumb|A German ambulance of the World War II era]]\n\nIn much of the world, ambulance quality fell sharply during the Second World War, as physicians, needed by the armed services, were pulled off ambulances. In the [[United Kingdom]], during the [[Battle of Britain]], the need for ambulances was so great that vans were commandeered and pressed into service, often carrying several victims at once. Following the war, physicians would continue to ride ambulances in some countries, but not in others. Other vehicles, including civilian and [[police car]]s were pressed into service to transport patients due to a lack of a dedicated resource.<ref name=\"Kuehl\" /><ref>King, Dean. ''Patrick O'Brian: a Life''. ''Owl Books''. 2001 @ p. 81</ref>\nMilitary ambulances such as the [[Austin K2/Y]] were used both in the combat areas and on the [[Home Front]].

They also saw combat in Africa and through parts of Europe and the Pacific.\n\n== The Korean War ==\n\nDuring the [[Korean War]], the newly created [[United States Air Force]] produced a number of air-ambulance units for use in forward operating medical units, using helicopters for rapid evacuation of patients. The [[H-13 Sioux]] helicopter, made famous by the film and television versions of ''[[M*A*S*H]]'', transported 18,000 wounded soldiers during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olive-drab.com/od_medical_evac_helio_korea.php|publisher=olive-drab.com|title=Medical Evacuation in the Korean War}}</ref> The work of the Medical Air Evacuation Squadrons was a success and was repeated by U.S. forces in Vietnam.

[[CPR]] was developed and accepted as the standard of care for out-of-hospital [[cardiac arrest]]; [[defibrillation]], based in part on an increased understanding of heart arrhythmias, was introduced, as were new [[pharmaceutical]]s to be used in cardiac arrest situations; in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]], a mobile coronary care ambulance successfully resuscitated patients using these technologies;<ref name=Ambulance/> and well-developed studies demonstrated the need for overhauling ambulance services.

Advances in the technology and understanding of emergency vehicle equipment also continued to influence ambulance design, just as it did for police and fire-suppression vehicles.\n\n== Modern vehicles ==\n[[File:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|[[Magen David Adom|Israeli EMS]]'s contemporary civilian armored mobile intensive care unit. Used for response to difficult situations, it incorporates a customized rear compartment on a super-duty [[Ford E-Series#E-Series|Ford E-450]] chassis]]\n\nModern ambulances are now often custom-built, and as well as the specialist medical equipment now built into the ambulances, industry-wide improvements in vehicle design have had an impact, including improvements in audible and visual warning equipment to help protect crews in vulnerable situations (such as at a road traffic collision), and general improvements such as [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], which are particularly valuable for ambulances, due to the speeds reached and the weight carried. There have also been improvements to help safeguard the health and welfare of ambulance crews, such as the addition of patient [[tail lift]]s, ramps and winches,<ref name=tail>{{cite web|url=http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701055836/http://www.rossandbonnyman.co.uk/specialist-lifts.html#aa|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-07-01|title=Ambulance Lifts|publisher=Ross and Bonnyman|accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref> to cut down on the amount of manual handling a crew must perform.\n\nAmbulance design is still evolving, largely due to the growing skills and role of [[paramedic]]s and other ambulance crew, which require specialist equipment. Other factors driving improvement include the need to help protect ambulance crews from common accidents, such as traffic collisions and rarer, but potentially catastrophic incidents such as terrorist activities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dodge WC54]]\n* [[Combat medic]]\n* [[Ambulance]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180921124235/http://www.paramedic-community.com/ahsv/ Ambulance Historical Society Victoria website]\n\n{{Emergency medical services}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Ambulance}}\n[[Category:Ambulances]]\n", "name_user": "206.45.201.208", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eThe KOrean War)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_ambulance"}
