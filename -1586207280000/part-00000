The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] through the [[Finger Lakes]] region to its southern border at the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] border. \n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently [[Salvatore Ronald Matano]]. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]], currently Cardinal [[Timothy Dolan]]. The [[cathedral]] [[parish]] for the diocese is [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Rochester)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral - Rochester, New York.jpg|thumb|left|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Rochester (1868-1937)]]\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when [[Pope Pius IX]] entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to [[Bernard J. McQuaid]], the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and women religious (sisters) has fallen.<ref>[http://www.dor.org/dorhomepage/history.htm Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester - Diocesan History]</ref>\n*In 1909, there were 121,000 Catholics in 93 parishes, 36 missions and 53 parish schools with 18,000 pupils. There were 164 priests and more than 500 sisters.\n*In 1938, there were 223,657 Catholics in 129 parishes, 36 missions and 72 parish schools serving 23,796 pupils. There were 289 active diocesan priests.\n*In 1966, there were 361,790 Catholics in 155 parishes, 36 mission churches and 99 elementary parish schools serving 45,540 pupils. There were 371 active diocesan priests and 1,549 sisters.\n*In 1978, there were 358,850 Catholics in 161 parishes, 29 mission churches and 75 schools serving 19,526 pupils. There were 311 active diocesan priests and 1,095 women religious.\n*In 1992, there were 361,384 Catholics in 162 parishes and 58 elementary schools serving 11,992 pupils. There were 208 active diocesan priests and 842 sisters.\n\nOn September 22nd 2017 the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration celebrating one hundred and fifty years and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\n==Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy==\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims.<ref>https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/06/09/andreatta-diocese-rochester-has-paid-1-6-m-20-sex-abuse-victims/686390002/</ref> Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old. On June 10, 2019, a man claiming that he had been molested between 1969 and 1971 by local priest Rev. Francis Vogt filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Rochester and several other local Catholic organizations affiliated the Diocese, claiming that they shielded Vogt from potential prosecution.<ref name=grownnot>https://13wham.com/news/local/victim-sues-diocese-of-rochester-over-claims-of-sexual-abuse-by-priest</ref> On September 12, 2019, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in the wake of lawsuits against priests and other ministers who served in the Diocese.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/12/rochester-ny-catholic-diocese-bankruptcy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-child-victims-act-cva-chapter-11/2297878001/|title=Diocese bankruptcy: Matano says it was 'a very difficult and painful decision'|last=Orr|first=Steve|date=September 12, 2019|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> <ref name=protectionnotgood /> The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester is the first Catholic diocese in the state of New York to file for bankruptcy and also the 20th Catholic diocese in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=protectionnotgood>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/12/catholic-sex-abuse-rochester-diocese-files-bankruptcy-protection/2308133001/</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Rochester===\n# [[Bernard J.

The region that the Diocese comprises extends from its northern border on the south shore of [[Lake Ontario]] through the [[Finger Lakes]] region to its southern border at the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] border. \n\nThe Diocese of Rochester comprises 12 counties in New York, with approximately 350,000 Catholics and over 125 faith communities (parishes and chapels), 22 diocesan elementary schools and 7 independent parochial high schools. The bishop of the diocese is currently [[Salvatore Ronald Matano]]. The metropolitan for the diocese is the Archbishop of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York]], currently Cardinal [[Timothy Dolan]]. The [[cathedral]] [[parish]] for the diocese is [[Sacred Heart Cathedral (Rochester)|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St. Patrick's Cathedral - Rochester, New York.jpg|thumb|left|St. Patrick's Cathedral in Rochester (1868-1937)]]\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester began on March 3, 1868, when [[Pope Pius IX]] entrusted eight counties (Monroe, Livingston, Wayne, Ontario, Seneca, Cayuga, Yates, and Tompkins) within the Diocese of Buffalo to [[Bernard J. McQuaid]], the first bishop of Rochester. The new diocese had about 54,500 Catholics in 35 parish churches and 29 mission churches.\n\nIn 1896, the counties of Schuyler, Tioga, Chemung, and Steuben were added to the Diocese of Rochester from the Diocese of Buffalo, forming the current boundaries.\n\nThe diocese grew as Catholic immigrants came to western New York, peaking in the 1960s. Since then, the Catholic population has stabilized while the numbers of ordained presbyters (priests) and women religious (sisters) has fallen.<ref>[http://www.dor.org/dorhomepage/history.htm Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester - Diocesan History]</ref>\n*In 1909, there were 121,000 Catholics in 93 parishes, 36 missions and 53 parish schools with 18,000 pupils. There were 164 priests and more than 500 sisters.\n*In 1938, there were 223,657 Catholics in 129 parishes, 36 missions and 72 parish schools serving 23,796 pupils. There were 289 active diocesan priests.\n*In 1966, there were 361,790 Catholics in 155 parishes, 36 mission churches and 99 elementary parish schools serving 45,540 pupils. There were 371 active diocesan priests and 1,549 sisters.\n*In 1978, there were 358,850 Catholics in 161 parishes, 29 mission churches and 75 schools serving 19,526 pupils. There were 311 active diocesan priests and 1,095 women religious.\n*In 1992, there were 361,384 Catholics in 162 parishes and 58 elementary schools serving 11,992 pupils. There were 208 active diocesan priests and 842 sisters.\n\nOn September 22nd 2017 the Diocese of Rochester inaugurated its sesquicentennial anniversary marked by a solemn mass at Sacred Heart Cathedral. This event marks a year long celebration celebrating one hundred and fifty years and the year of the Eucharist which was proclaimed by Bishop Salvatore Matano on the Feast of Corpus Christi.\n\n==Reports of sex abuse and bankruptcy==\n\nIn June 2018, it was revealed that the Diocese had secretly paid $1.6 million since 1950 in compensation to 20 sex abuse victims.<ref>https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2018/06/09/andreatta-diocese-rochester-has-paid-1-6-m-20-sex-abuse-victims/686390002/</ref> Most of the payments occurred after the eruption of the 2002 clergy sex abuse scandal, although some are decades old. On June 10, 2019, a man claiming that he had been molested between 1969 and 1971 by local priest Rev. Francis Vogt filed a lawsuit against the Diocese of Rochester and several other local Catholic organizations affiliated the Diocese, claiming that they shielded Vogt from potential prosecution.<ref name=grownnot>https://13wham.com/news/local/victim-sues-diocese-of-rochester-over-claims-of-sexual-abuse-by-priest</ref> On September 12, 2019, the Diocese filed for [[Chapter 11 Bankruptcy]] in the wake of lawsuits against priests and other ministers who served in the Diocese.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/2019/09/12/rochester-ny-catholic-diocese-bankruptcy-sex-abuse-lawsuits-child-victims-act-cva-chapter-11/2297878001/|title=Diocese bankruptcy: Matano says it was 'a very difficult and painful decision'|last=Orr|first=Steve|date=September 12, 2019|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> <ref name=protectionnotgood /> The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester is the first Catholic diocese in the state of New York to file for bankruptcy and also the 20th Catholic diocese in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=protectionnotgood>https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/09/12/catholic-sex-abuse-rochester-diocese-files-bankruptcy-protection/2308133001/</ref>\n\n==Bishops==\nThe following are lists of bishops and their years of service:\n\n===Bishops of Rochester===\n# [[Bernard J.

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much lower number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; this is high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name=\"February 2015\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]], 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1914\u2013present{{efn|Daily maximum and

King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever.

It runs approximately east\u2013west through the northern section of downtown Kitchener. It was originally laid out and constructed in 1856 by the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR), and after the GTR's acquisition of the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]], the mainline through Kitchener became known informally as the \"North Main Line\" in contrast with the \"South Main Line\" through [[Brantford, Ontario|Brantford]], both connecting [[London, Ontario|London]] and [[Toronto]]. Coming from the east, the [[Waterloo Spur]] diverges from the mainline and heads north through [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] and ultimately to [[Elmira, Ontario|Elmira]]. The spur was formerly owned by CN, but is now owned by the [[Region of Waterloo]] and leased to the [[Goderich-Exeter Railway]] (GEXR), a shortline freight railway.\n\n[[Kitchener station]] lies a short distance west along the track from the junction with the Waterloo Spur. The current station building dates from 1897 and is a heritage structure which is owned by [[Via Rail]], Canada's national passenger railway. Both Via Rail [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|''Corridor'']] service and [[GO Transit]] [[Kitchener line]] service are available at the station, the latter of which has its western terminus at the station. Via Rail service consists of two trains per day in each direction along the Toronto\u2013London\u2013Sarnia route; one westbound train terminates at [[Sarnia station|Sarnia]] while another terminates at [[London station (Ontario)|London]], while both eastbound trains terminate at [[Toronto Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viarail.ca/sites/all/files/media/pdfs/schedules/summer2020/24-25_Toronto-London-Sarnia.pdf |title=Toronto-London-Sarnia |access-date=8 March 2020 |publisher=[[Via Rail]]}}</ref> GO train service was originally extended to Kitchener in 2011 from its previous western terminus at [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]].<ref name=2011kitchenerline>{{cite news |url=https://www.therecord.com/sports-story/2567786-go-trains-to-run-from-kitchener-to-toronto-in-2011/ |title=GO trains to run from Kitchener to Toronto in 2011 |date=13 November 2010 |newspaper=[[Waterloo Region Record]] |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> GO service began with two trains per direction per weekday,<ref name=2011kitchenerline /> but since its inception train frequency has gradually increased and as of early 2020 it stands at 8 eastbound and 7 westbound trains per weekday, with no weekend service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gotransit.com/static_files/gotransit/assets/pdf/TripPlanning/FullSchedules/FS11012020/Table31.pdf |publisher=[[GO Transit]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |title=Kitchener GO Train and Bus Schedule}}</ref> In 2017, [[Metrolinx]] (the parent agency of GO Transit) constructed a purpose-built train layover facility on Shirley Avenue to supplement its existing adapted layover facility, which was at capacity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrolinxengage.com/sites/default/files/waterloo_region_council_august_30_final.pdf |publisher=[[Metrolinx]] |website=Metrolinx Engage |title=Creating Connections in Waterloo Region |date=30 August 2017 |access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nWhile Kitchener benefits from increasingly frequent commuter-oriented GO service east to Toronto, intercity Via Rail service to the city has been largely unchanged for years, limiting its connectivity to [[Southwestern Ontario]] to the west.

Located approximately {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Toronto]], Kitchener is the regional seat. Kitchener was called '''[[Berlin to Kitchener name change|Berlin]]''' until 1916; it was designated the Town of Berlin from 1854 until 1912 and the City of Berlin from 1912 until 1916.\n\nThe City of Kitchener covers an area of 136.86 square kilometres and had a population of 233,222 at the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]]. The Kitchener [[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|metropolitan area]], which includes the smaller, neighbouring cities of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] to the north and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to the south, has 523,894 people, making it the tenth largest [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA) in Canada and the fourth largest CMA in Ontario.\n\nKitchener and Waterloo are considered \"twin cities\" which are often referred to jointly as \"Kitchener\u2013Waterloo\" (K\u2013W), although they have separate [[Municipal government in Canada|municipal governments]]. Including Cambridge, the three cities are known as \"[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|the Tri-Cities]]\". All are part of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo, which was created in 1973, when it replaced Waterloo County, which had been created in 1853.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geography===\nKitchener is located in [[Southwestern Ontario]], in the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]]. This geological and climatic region has wet-climate soils and deciduous forests. Situated in the Grand River Valley, the area is generally above {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in elevation.\n\nKitchener is the largest city within the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] watershed, and the largest city on the Haldimand Tract. Just to the west of the city is [[Baden Hill]], in [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot Township]]. This glacial [[kame]] remnant formation is the highest elevation for many miles. The other dominant glacial feature is the [[Waterloo Moraine]], which snakes its way through the region and holds a significant quantity of [[artesian wells]], from which the city derives most of its drinking water. The settlement's first name, Sandhills, is an accurate description of the higher points of the moraine.\n\n===Climate===\nKitchener has a [[humid continental climate]] of the warm summer subtype (''Dfb'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]); there are large seasonal differences, usually warm and humid summers and cold to occasionally very cold winters. Winter-like conditions generally last from the mid-December until mid-March, while summer temperatures generally occur between mid-May to close to the end of September.\n\nMarch 2012 went down in the history books for Kitchener \u2013 between 16 and 22 March, temperatures ranged from {{convert|21.4|C|F|1}} to {{convert|27.0|C|F|1}}\u20147 record highs in a row. 19 March high of {{convert|24|C|F|1}} is one of the highest winter temperatures ever recorded, while 22 March high of {{convert|27|C|F|1}} is the highest for March in this area.\n\nTemperatures during the year can exceed {{convert|30|C|F|1}} in the summer and drop below {{convert|-20|C|F|1}} in the winter several times a year, but prolonged periods of extreme temperatures are rare.  The frost-free period for Kitchener averages about 147 frost-free days a year,<ref name=climate /> a much lower number than cities on the Great Lakes due its inland location and higher elevation. Snowfall averages {{convert|160|cm|in|0}}  per year; this is high, but not nearly as high as areas more directly affected by [[lake effect snow]].\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Kitchener was {{convert|38.3|C|0}} on August 6 & 7, 1918, and again on July 27, 1941.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1941\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-34.1|C|1}} on February 16, 2015.<ref name=\"February 2015\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]], 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1914\u2013present{{efn|Daily maximum and

hectare area given to the [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] by the British as a gift for their allegiance during the [[American Revolution]]. Between 1796 and 1798, the Six Nations sold 38,000 hectares of this land to [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] Colonel [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]].  The portion of land that Beasley purchased was remote but of great interest to German [[Mennonite]] farming families from [[Pennsylvania]]. They wanted to live in an area that would allow them to practice their beliefs without persecution. Eventually, the Mennonites purchased all of Beasley's unsold land creating 160 farm tracts.\n\nMany of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania, known as the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] or Pennsilfaanisch-Deitsche (German, not \"modern\" Dutch), after November 1803 bought land in a 60,000-acre section of Block Two from the German Company which was established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands.

In 1816 the Government of Upper Canada designated the settlement the Township of Waterloo.\n\nMuch of the land, made up of [[moraine]]s and swampland interspersed with rivers and streams, was converted to farmland and roads.  [[Rock Pigeon|Wild pigeons]], which once swarmed by the tens of thousands, were driven from the area.  Apple trees were introduced to the region by John Eby in the 1830s, and several [[gristmill|grist-]] and [[saw mill|sawmills]] (most notably Joseph Schneider's 1816 sawmill, John and [[Abraham Erb]]'s grist- and sawmills and Eby's cider mill) were erected throughout the area.  Schneider built Berlin's first road, from his home to the corner of King Street and Queen Street (then known as Walper corner).  The settlers raised $1,000 to extend the road from Walper corner to Huether corner, where the Huether Brewery was built and the [[Huether Hotel]] now stands in the city of Waterloo; a petition to the government for $100 to assist in completing the project was denied.\n\nLater named the founder of Berlin, [[Benjamin Eby]] (made Mennonite preacher in 1809, and bishop in 1812) arrived from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, in 1806 and purchased a large tract of land consisting of much of what would become the village of Berlin (named about 1830).

The German community became industrial and political leaders, and created a German-Canadian society unlike any other found in Canada at the time.

The Princess of Wales Chapter of the [[Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire]] raised the $6,000 needed for the monument.<ref>[http://www.kpl.org/ref/gsr/trivia.html Kitchener Public Library Trivia Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513105151/http://www.kpl.org/ref/gsr/trivia.html |date=13 May 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:victoria-park-kitchener-lake.jpg|thumb|right|Victoria Park]]\n\nAnother significant beauty spot in the city is Rockway Gardens. Adjacent to the Rockway golf course, the gardens occupy a long narrow strip of land alongside King Street as it rushes down to meet the Conestoga Parkway and become Highway 8. Here there are many fountains, ponds, waterfalls and rock grottoes. It is a popular site for wedding photos in the summer.\n\nKitchener has an extensive and safe community trail system. The trails, which are controlled and run by the city, are hundreds of kilometres in length. Due to Kitchener's close proximity to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]], several community trails and paths border the river's shores. This convenient access to the Grand River has drawn nature-seeking tourists to the city. However, Kitchener's trails and especially natural areas remain underfunded by city council and as a result, many are not adequately maintained.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |title=Staff report regarding state of Kitchener's park system |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316205637/http://www.kitchener.ca/Files/Item/item9645_csd-06-105_-_park___trails.pdf |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, a bike park at the newly constructed McLennan Park, in the city's south end, was hailed as one of the best city-run bike parks in [[Southern Ontario]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.therecord.com/News/Local/article/565847 |title=TheRecord \u2013 21 Rosedene Avenue |publisher=News.therecord.com |date=19 July 2011 |accessdate=10 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> by [[Freestyle BMX|BMX]] and [[mountain biking]] enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |title=Take the Lane: Kitchener's new bike park |publisher=Therecord.blogs.com |date=21 July 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708021409/http://therecord.blogs.com/take_the_lane/2007/07/kitcheners-new-.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The bike park offers a [[Four-cross|four-cross (4X)]] section, a [[Freestyle BMX|pump track]] section, a [[Dirt jumping|jump park]], and a [[Flatland BMX|free-ride]] course.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |title=City of Kitchener |publisher=Kitchener.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184531/http://www.kitchener.ca/pdf/parks_mclennan_bike.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> McLennan Park also features an accessible play area, a splash pad, basketball courts, beach volleyball courts, a leash-free dog area, and a toboggan hill.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |title=City of Kitchener \u2013 McLennan Park |publisher=City of Kitchener |accessdate=10 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729151656/http://www.kitchener.ca/en/livinginkitchener/MclennanPark.asp |archivedate=29 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Chicopee Ski Club]] is also within the city limits.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Highways and expressways===\n[[File:Highway 401 Grand River.jpg|thumb|left|[[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] in Kitchener looking east towards the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]]]]\n[[File:Conestoga.jpg|thumb|right|[[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]] as seen from Franklin Street bridge]]\nKitchener was very proactive and visionary about its transportation network in the 1960s, with the province undertaking at that time construction of the [[Conestoga Parkway]] from the western boundary (just past Homer Watson Boulevard) across the south side of the city and looping north along the Grand River to Northfield Drive in Waterloo.\nSubsequent upgrades took the Conestoga west beyond Trussler Road and north towards [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St Jacobs]], with eight lanes through its middle stretch.\n\nThe Conestoga Parkway bears the provincial highway designations of Highways [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|7]] and [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|8]]. King Street becomes Hwy 8 where it meets the Conestoga in the south and leads down to the 401, but Old King Street survives as the street-route through Freeport to the Preston area of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]]. Up until construction of the Conestoga, Highland Road through [[Baden, Ontario|Baden]] had been the primary highway to [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]]. Victoria Street was then and remains the primary highway to [[Guelph]] but this is slated to be bypassed with an entirely new highway beginning at the Wellington Street exit and running roughly north of and parallel to the old route.\n\nThere are two interchanges with [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]] on Kitchener's southern border. In addition to the primary link where Hwy 8 merges into the Hwy 401, there is another interchange on the west side with Homer Watson Boulevard.\n\nIn order to reduce the congestion on Highway 8, a new interchange has been proposed on Highway 401 at Trussler Road, which would serve the rapidly growing west side of Kitchener. Although this proposal is supported by the Region of Waterloo, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has no plans to proceed with an interchange at Trussler Road.\n\n{{Geographic location\n|title = '''Destinations from Kitchener'''\n|Northwest = [[Wellesley, Ontario|Wellesley]]\n|North     = [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Northeast = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Elora, Ontario|Elora]], [[Fergus, Ontario|Fergus]]\n|West      = [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Stratford, Ontario|Stratford]] <br /><small>''via [[Conestoga Parkway]]''</small>\n|Centre    = Kitchener\n|East      = [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Guelph]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 7 (Ontario)|Highway 7]]''</small>\n|Southwest = [[Woodstock, Ontario|Woodstock]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]''</small>\n|South     = [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]], [[Paris, Ontario|Paris]]\n|Southeast = [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] <br /><small>''via [[Highway 8 (Ontario)|Highway 8]]''</small>\n}}\n\n===City streets===\nUnlike most southern Ontario cities whose streets follow a strict British grid survey pattern, Kitchener's streets are laid out in a complex radial pattern on the Continental models most familiar to the German settlers.\n\nThere is good historical reason for this. Kitchener was one of the few places in Ontario where the settlers arrived in advance of government surveyors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} The Mennonites who had banded together as the German Company to purchase the township from Richard Beasley simply divided their vast parcel of land by the number of shareholder households and then drew random lots to confer title on individual farms.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} There was no grid survey done\u2014no lines, no concessions, no right-of-way corridors for roads. When it came time to punch roads through the wilderness, the farmers modelled the road network on what was familiar to them, which was the pattern of villages in Switzerland and southern Germany.\n\nThis is a Continental Radial pattern and the result was major streets extended through diagonals cutting across the grid of smaller streets and converging at multiple-point intersections which, as the communities became more prosperous and if the automobile had not displaced the horse, might someday have become [[roundabouts]] decorated with circular gardens, fountains or statuary in the style of European cities. Five-point intersections created by converging diagonals are legion in the older areas.\n\nIn 2004, [[roundabouts]] were introduced to the Region of Waterloo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingaround/roundabouts.asp |title=Roundabouts \u2013 Region of Waterloo |publisher=Regionofwaterloo.ca |accessdate=10 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619124821/http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/gettingAround/roundabouts.asp |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Besides improving traffic flow, they will help the region lower pollution from emissions created by idling vehicles. In 2006, the first two were installed along Ira Needles Boulevard in Kitchener. Some people{{Who|date=February 2017}} argue roundabouts are ideal for intersections in this region because of the aforementioned historical growth along Continental radial patterns versus the British grid systems, but all installs have been at T and cross intersections making the point irrelevant.\n\nA controversial plan would extend River Road through an area known as Hidden Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |title=Strengthening Community |publisher=Waterlooians.ca |accessdate=3 March 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706212813/http://www.waterlooians.ca/index.php?view=41 |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> but the pressure of traffic and the absence of any other full east-west arterials between Fairway Road and the Highway 401 is forcing this development ahead.\n\nMost streets that cross the municipal boundary between Kitchener and [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] retain the same street name in both cities. However, several streets which are divided into east and west sections in Kitchener shift to a north-south division in Waterloo. This primarily affects [[Weber Street|Weber]] and [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King]] Streets and Westmount Road. Since these roads do not actually change their primary directional alignment significantly, (Weber Street and King Street, supposedly \"Parallel\" streets, cross 3 times), the shift in labelling can create confusion, since each of the aforementioned thoroughfares bears the labels north, south, west, and east on certain segments. However, it also reduces the potential confusion that would result from having separate west and east segments of the same street existing simultaneously in both cities.\n\nThe problem with giving streets in Waterloo Region compass-based labels, and attempting to divide each of the cities into quadrants comes from the radial layout of the roads, and the historical patterns of development. Waterloo's quadrants, created by the intersection of King and Erb Streets, roughly correspond to compass directions, but Kitchener's quadrants, delineated by King and Queen Streets, do not resemble compass directions whatsoever. A notable case is that of Lancaster Street, which runs almost exactly north-south, but is designated as east-west, since it crosses Queen Street, which divides the \"east\" and \"west\" halves of the city, yet follows a northeast-southwest orientation itself.\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|GRT iXpress bus (since adapted into the ION bus service)]]\nSince 2000, public transport throughout the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] has been provided by [[Grand River Transit]], which was created by a merger of the former Cambridge Transit and Kitchener Transit.

In some cases the neighbourhood associations cover several neighbourhoods and/or planning communities and the name of one neighbourhood is sometimes used to refer to the entire area.  \n\nThe Stanley Park Neighbourhood Association, for example, covers much of the eastern and southeastern area of the city including the planning communities of Stanley Park, Heritage Park, Idlewood, and Grand River North and South. Further complicating things is that the first area of development named Stanley Park, which is where Stanley Park school is located and where Stanley Park Conservation Area is located, has been included within the city's planning district of Heritage Park, leaving only later-developed areas of Stanley Park plus an adjacent residential neighbourhood to the south, originally referred to as Sunnyside, in the Stanley Park planning neighbourhood.

Born in [[Cambridge]] and raised in [[Start Hill, Essex|Start Hill]], [[Essex]], she began posting songs on [[Myspace]] in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse [[raves]] and parties. In 2010 she signed a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]], releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Charli XCX rose to fame with the [[Icona Pop]] collaboration \"[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]\", which became an international hit, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe. Her debut studio album, ''[[True Romance (Charli XCX album)|True Romance]]'' (2013), was released that year to critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the chorus and hook to \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\" by rapper [[Iggy Azalea]], which finished the year as one of the [[best-selling singles worldwide]] and was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s. The same year, she received her first solo hit with \"[[Boom Clap]]\", which became her third (first solo) Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her second studio album, the [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced ''[[Sucker (album)|Sucker]]'', was released at the end of the year, and produced the successful singles \"[[Break the Rules (Charli XCX song)|Break the Rules]]\" and \"[[Doing It (Charli XCX song)|Doing It]]\".\n\nIn 2015, Charli XCX began working with producers and artists in [[A. G. Cook]]'s British collective [[PC Music]], as well as producer [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]], developing a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the ''[[Vroom Vroom (EP)|Vroom Vroom]]'' EP in 2016 and the mixtapes ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]'' in 2017, as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified \"[[After the Afterparty]]\", \"[[Boys (Charli XCX song)|Boys]]\", and \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\". In 2019, Charli XCX released her third studio album, ''[[Charli (album)|Charli]].''\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists, including [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Beg for It (song)|Beg for It]]\" (2014), [[Selena Gomez]]'s \"[[Same Old Love]]\" (2015), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"[[Tonight (Blondie song)|Tonight]]\" (2017), and [[Shawn Mendes]]' collaboration with [[Camila Cabello]], \"[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]\" (2019).\n\n==Early life==\nCharlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in [[Cambridge]], England.

Born in [[Cambridge]] and raised in [[Start Hill, Essex|Start Hill]], [[Essex]], she began posting songs on [[Myspace]] in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse [[raves]] and parties. In 2010 she signed a recording contract with [[Asylum Records]], releasing a series of singles and mixtapes throughout 2011 and 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Charli XCX rose to fame with the [[Icona Pop]] collaboration \"[[I Love It (Icona Pop song)|I Love It]]\", which became an international hit, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe. Her debut studio album, ''[[True Romance (Charli XCX album)|True Romance]]'' (2013), was released that year to critical acclaim but failed to meet commercial expectations. In 2014, she contributed the chorus and hook to \"[[Fancy (Iggy Azalea song)|Fancy]]\" by rapper [[Iggy Azalea]], which finished the year as one of the [[best-selling singles worldwide]] and was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s. The same year, she received her first solo hit with \"[[Boom Clap]]\", which became her third (first solo) Top 10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her second studio album, the [[punk rock|punk]]-influenced ''[[Sucker (album)|Sucker]]'', was released at the end of the year, and produced the successful singles \"[[Break the Rules (Charli XCX song)|Break the Rules]]\" and \"[[Doing It (Charli XCX song)|Doing It]]\".\n\nIn 2015, Charli XCX began working with producers and artists in [[A. G. Cook]]'s British collective [[PC Music]], as well as producer [[Sophie (musician)|Sophie]], developing a more experimental sound and image. While working on her third album, she released the ''[[Vroom Vroom (EP)|Vroom Vroom]]'' EP in 2016 and the mixtapes ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'' and ''[[Pop 2 (mixtape)|Pop 2]]'' in 2017, as well as a series of singles including the BPI-certified \"[[After the Afterparty]]\", \"[[Boys (Charli XCX song)|Boys]]\", and \"[[1999 (Charli XCX and Troye Sivan song)|1999]]\". In 2019, Charli XCX released her third studio album, ''[[Charli (album)|Charli]].''\n\nIn addition to her solo work, Charli XCX has co-written songs for other artists, including [[Iggy Azalea]]'s \"[[Beg for It (song)|Beg for It]]\" (2014), [[Selena Gomez]]'s \"[[Same Old Love]]\" (2015), [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s \"[[Tonight (Blondie song)|Tonight]]\" (2017), and [[Shawn Mendes]]' collaboration with [[Camila Cabello]], \"[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]\" (2019).\n\n==Early life==\nCharlotte Emma Aitchison was born on 2 August 1992, in [[Cambridge]], England.

Due in part to its nearly flat (actually slightly downhill) route, it has become a favorite in the running community for those working to establish personal best times. All finishers receive a medal.\n\n==History==\nThe race was first run in 1980 with 1454 men and 122 women finishing.  In that year and in 1981, participants ran straight through the courtyard of City Hall; since then, runners are diverted around the building.  \n\nUntil 1989, the race ended with a lap around the field at [[JFK Stadium]] in South Philadelphia.  After the stadium was condemned and demolished, the finish moved to [[FDR Park]] (on the other side of Broad Street), and then to the Navy Yard, about a quarter mile beyond the front gates.\n\nParticipation rose steadily through the 1990s and exploded by the mid-2000s. Since 2013, registration of single runners (though not teams) has been handled by lottery, with about 40,000 entrants, and roughly 35,000 runners finishing the race, the majority of them women.<ref>http://www.broadstreetrun.com/News/Documents/Race%20Information%20Guide%20Final%204-27-14.pdf</ref>\n\n==Course records==\n* Open Male: Patrick Cheruiyot, 45:14, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadstreetrun.com/media.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229183955/http://www.broadstreetrun.com/media.htm |archivedate=2008-12-29 }}</ref>\n* Open Female: [[Catherine Ndereba]], 53:07, 1999\n* Master Male: Andrey Kuznetsov, 50:13, 2002\n* Master Female: Sandra Mewett, 57:56, 1992\n* Open Wheelchair Male: Tony Nogueira, 32:05, 2007\n* Open Wheelchair Female: Jessica Galli, 35:59, 2001\n* Master Wheelchair Male: Tony Nogueira, 33:52, 2008\n* Master Wheelchair Female: Jacqui Kapinowski, 49:19, 2008\n\n==Past winners==\n'''Key:'''\n{{legend2|#A9F5A9|'''Course record'''|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!class=unsortable|Edition\n!Year\n!class=unsortable|Men's winner\n!Time ([[hour|h]]:[[minute|m]]:[[second|s]])\n!class=unsortable|Women's winner\n!Time ([[hour|h]]:[[minute|m]]:[[second|s]])\n|-\n|1st\n|1980\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Mike Bradley (athlete)|Mike Bradley]]|USA}}\n|52:45\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jan Yerkes]]|USA}}\n|1:03:45\n|-\n|2nd\n|1981\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|50:34\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Sheila Dalo]]|USA}}\n|1:03:25\n|-\n|3rd\n|1982\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|49:01\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Pat Shiffert]]|USA}}\n|57:48\n|-\n|4th\n|1983\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|49:46\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Roberta Anthes]]|USA}}\n|1:00:33\n|-\n|5th\n|1984\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Kevin McGarry]]|USA}}\n|48:23\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Lena Holman]]|USA}}\n|59:58\n|-\n|6th\n|1985\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|50:53\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Renie Shields]]|USA}}\n|59:02\n|-\n|7th\n|1986\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jim Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|49:05\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Renie Shields]]|USA}}\n|57:27\n|-\n|8th\n|1987\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jim Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|49:22\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Renie Shields]]|USA}}\n|57:51\n|-\n|9th\n|1988\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Bob Schwelm]]|USA}}\n|48:31\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Shelly Steely]]|USA}}\n|54:11\n|-\n|10th\n|1989\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Briane Ferrari]]|USA}}\n|49:10\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jane DiMarco]]|USA}}\n|57:56\n|-\n|11th\n|1990\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jim Norris]]|USA}}\n|47:53\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jan Yerkes]]|USA}}\n|1:03:45\n|-\n|12th\n|1991\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Brent Barnhill]]|USA}}\n|47:55\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jillian Beschloss]]|USA}}\n|56:22\n|-\n|13th\n|1992\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Simon Peter]]|TAN}}\n|47:43\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Carol Haux]]|USA}}\n|57:37\n|-\n|14th\n|1993\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Khalid Kairouani]]|MAR}}\n|47:13\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Elaine Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|53:15\n|-\n|15th\n|1994\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Eric Lorenz]]|USA}}\n|49:21\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Lori Roch]]|USA}}\n|57:14\n|-\n|16th\n|1995\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Joseph Kamau]]|KEN}}\n|47:26\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Gordon Bakoulis]]|USA}}\n|55:18\n|-\n|17th\n|1996\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Joel Onwonga]]|KEN}}\n|47:27<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pray |first1=Rusty |title=Kenya's Onwoniga lonely at the top in Broad Street Run |publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=May 6, 1996 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=D3}}</ref>\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Lisa Vail]]|USA}}\n|55:38\n|-\n|18th\n|1997\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[John Mwai]]|KEN}}\n|47:42\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Elaine Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|54:45\n|-\n|19th\n|1998\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[John Mwai]]|KEN}}\n|48:44\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Teresa Wanjiku]]|KEN}}\n|57:13\n|-\n|20th<ref>Fleischman, Bill (1999-05-03).

Due in part to its nearly flat (actually slightly downhill) route, it has become a favorite in the running community for those working to establish personal best times. All finishers receive a medal.\n\n==History==\nThe race was first run in 1980 with 1454 men and 122 women finishing.  In that year and in 1981, participants ran straight through the courtyard of City Hall; since then, runners are diverted around the building.  \n\nUntil 1989, the race ended with a lap around the field at [[JFK Stadium]] in South Philadelphia.  After the stadium was condemned and demolished, the finish moved to [[FDR Park]] (on the other side of Broad Street), and then to the Navy Yard, about a quarter mile beyond the front gates.\n\nParticipation rose steadily through the 1990s and exploded by the mid-2000s. Since 2013, registration of single runners (though not teams) has been handled by lottery, with about 40,000 entrants, and roughly 35,000 runners finishing the race, the majority of them women.<ref>http://www.broadstreetrun.com/News/Documents/Race%20Information%20Guide%20Final%204-27-14.pdf</ref>\n\n==Course records==\n* Open Male: Patrick Cheruiyot, 45:14, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadstreetrun.com/media.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229183955/http://www.broadstreetrun.com/media.htm |archivedate=2008-12-29 }}</ref>\n* Open Female: [[Catherine Ndereba]], 53:07, 1999\n* Master Male: Andrey Kuznetsov, 50:13, 2002\n* Master Female: Sandra Mewett, 57:56, 1992\n* Open Wheelchair Male: Tony Nogueira, 32:05, 2007\n* Open Wheelchair Female: Jessica Galli, 35:59, 2001\n* Master Wheelchair Male: Tony Nogueira, 33:52, 2008\n* Master Wheelchair Female: Jacqui Kapinowski, 49:19, 2008\n\n==Past winners==\n'''Key:'''\n{{legend2|#A9F5A9|'''Course record'''|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!class=unsortable|Edition\n!Year\n!class=unsortable|Men's winner\n!Time ([[hour|h]]:[[minute|m]]:[[second|s]])\n!class=unsortable|Women's winner\n!Time ([[hour|h]]:[[minute|m]]:[[second|s]])\n|-\n|1st\n|1980\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Mike Bradley]]|USA}}\n|52:45\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jan Yerkes]]|USA}}\n|1:03:45\n|-\n|2nd\n|1981\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|50:34\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Sheila Dalo]]|USA}}\n|1:03:25\n|-\n|3rd\n|1982\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|49:01\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Pat Shiffert]]|USA}}\n|57:48\n|-\n|4th\n|1983\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|49:46\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Roberta Anthes]]|USA}}\n|1:00:33\n|-\n|5th\n|1984\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Kevin McGarry]]|USA}}\n|48:23\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Lena Holman]]|USA}}\n|59:58\n|-\n|6th\n|1985\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jack Kruse]]|USA}}\n|50:53\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Renie Shields]]|USA}}\n|59:02\n|-\n|7th\n|1986\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jim Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|49:05\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Renie Shields]]|USA}}\n|57:27\n|-\n|8th\n|1987\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jim Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|49:22\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Renie Shields]]|USA}}\n|57:51\n|-\n|9th\n|1988\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Bob Schwelm]]|USA}}\n|48:31\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Shelly Steely]]|USA}}\n|54:11\n|-\n|10th\n|1989\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Briane Ferrari]]|USA}}\n|49:10\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jane DiMarco]]|USA}}\n|57:56\n|-\n|11th\n|1990\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jim Norris]]|USA}}\n|47:53\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jan Yerkes]]|USA}}\n|1:03:45\n|-\n|12th\n|1991\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Brent Barnhill]]|USA}}\n|47:55\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Jillian Beschloss]]|USA}}\n|56:22\n|-\n|13th\n|1992\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Simon Peter]]|TAN}}\n|47:43\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Carol Haux]]|USA}}\n|57:37\n|-\n|14th\n|1993\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Khalid Kairouani]]|MAR}}\n|47:13\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Elaine Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|53:15\n|-\n|15th\n|1994\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Eric Lorenz]]|USA}}\n|49:21\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Lori Roch]]|USA}}\n|57:14\n|-\n|16th\n|1995\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Joseph Kamau]]|KEN}}\n|47:26\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Gordon Bakoulis]]|USA}}\n|55:18\n|-\n|17th\n|1996\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Joel Onwonga]]|KEN}}\n|47:27<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pray |first1=Rusty |title=Kenya's Onwoniga lonely at the top in Broad Street Run |publisher=Philadelphia Inquirer |date=May 6, 1996 |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |page=D3}}</ref>\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Lisa Vail]]|USA}}\n|55:38\n|-\n|18th\n|1997\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[John Mwai]]|KEN}}\n|47:42\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Elaine Van Blunk]]|USA}}\n|54:45\n|-\n|19th\n|1998\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[John Mwai]]|KEN}}\n|48:44\n|align=left|{{flagathlete|[[Teresa Wanjiku]]|KEN}}\n|57:13\n|-\n|20th<ref>Fleischman, Bill (1999-05-03).

Hossack's father, also an inventor, developed methods to pump [[water in Africa]]. Hossack's grandfather built and patented dry cell batteries as far back as 1910.\n  \nHossack learned to ride motorcycles at a young age on the uncluttered roads of Rhodesia. His first bikes were a [[BSA Bantam]], a Greeves scrambler and a [[Ducati Mach 1|Ducati 250 Mach 1]], which he raced. This racing bug took Hossack to the [[Isle of Man TT]] in 1969. The following year Hossack worked as mechanic for fellow Rhodesian and Manx winner Gordon Keith on a tour of the Continental racing circus. Hossack's talents were spotted by young [[Barry Sheene]] who offered him a job, but Hossack took a job with [[McLaren|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing]] in 1972. Hossack spent the next three years learning his craft and honing his skills as chassis builder, mechanic, and pit crew member. Hossack worked 3 years on the Indy team, and in 1974 McLaren won the [[Indy 500]], and the [[Formula One|F1]] championship. He was later involved with other motor racing projects including 3 stints at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], twice as race planner and manager.\n\n==Inventions==\nHossack's first invention was his 2 stroke engine, inspired by the [[Wankel engine]] which was the holy grail of the automobile industry at the time. The first Hossack prototype engine was built in 1973 and was run in the McLaren work shop. The second engine, a more serious build is still a runner today.<ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Crowe |url=http://thekneeslider.com/the-hossack-engine-a-square-piston-two-stroke/ |title=The Hossack Engine \u2013 a Square Piston Two Stroke |website=Thekneeslider.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe Hossack suspension system came into being in the years after Hossack left McLaren. It started with some sketches then moved to a wire coat hanger experiment. The next step was to turn it into metal which became Hossack 1, a championship winning racer.\n\nIn 2001, Hossack moved to the USA designing scanners used in the medical industry. Hossack's name is on several patents in the medical devices industry. These IVUS scanners (Intra Vascular Ultrasound) are used to see inside the vessels around the heart.\n\nIn 2010, Hossack turned his thinking to mountain bikes. Teased by his work mates in the Medical company he worked in he took up the challenge. The motive here was to create an attachment to a standard bicycle frame rather than a Hossack type suspension system.\n\n==Hossack suspension system==\nThe Hossack front suspension system consists of 2 wish-bones, an upright and steering linkage.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Foale|first1=Tony |title=Motorcycle Chassis Design|date=1984 |publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd |isbn=085045560X |pages=91\u201393}}</ref> Similar components are found on the front of all racing cars, the only significant difference being in the up-right which has its geometry rearranged. The wish-bones look and work exactly like their racing car equivalent. The up-right performs the same task as its racing car equivalent but has its axle rotated through 90 degrees and over hung. The steering link does the same job as its name sake in car suspension. There is a handle bar pivot but this carries none of the suspension loading and only has to handle the weight of the rider's upper half. The spring/damper element can be run in several different positions to achieve different conditions as is also common in the racing car world.\n\n==Racers==\n{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}\nAfter leaving McLaren, Hossack started on motorcycle design, applying his accumulated knowledge to the design of his first machine, developing a unique front suspension system which he formulated using a wire coat hanger and a piece of wood. Wheels and parts were sourced from a scrap yard to build a rudimentary test-bed, and finally an XL500 Honda engine was donated by a friend. Although built only to test the theory, this very bike proved successful enough to graduate to the race track. Updated with Astralite wheels, it later went on to win the British Single Cylinder Championship in 1986,<ref>''Motorcycle Sport'', March 1987, pp.123-124. ''Single cylinder road racing''. Accessed 22 July 2018</ref> 1987 and 1988 ridden by Vernon Glashier, who still owns the bike.\n\nBy late 1982{{contradict-inline|date=July 2018|reason=Chronology of the prose does not make sense, implying the first build was later than the third}} the third Hossack bike was ready to race and was designed to fit the 350cc Yamaha TZ and RD engines. During 1983 several well-known journalists had ridden Hossack 3, including Alan Cathcart, Ray Knight and Mat Oxley. Hossack went on to build more versions of his design for other engines which include Ducati, Suzuki and Laverda.\n\n==BMW K100==\nFinding club racing changing towards production models Hossack next turned his hand to street models - first the PDQ Kawasaki<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cathcart |first1=Alan |title=Dream Bikes, First Edition |publisher=Macdonald Orbis |isbn=0356155668 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/dreambikes0000cath/page/202 202\u2013707] |url=https://archive.org/details/dreambikes0000cath/page/202 }}</ref> and later a BMW K100. Hossack set himself the task with the K100 to use as many standard parts as practical and make it handle and stop better. In the process the final product was {{cvt|12|lb}} lighter than the standard unit, and possessed all the advantages that BMW later claimed for the K series bikes. This Hossack-BMW conversion was popular in Germany where the design received a TUV type-approval for sale. One of Hossack's conversions was taken to BMW's headquarters in Munich where it was shown to their management and run on their test track. Unfortunately for Hossack, BMW were in the final stages of releasing their Telelever suspension system.{{vague|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Triumph conversion==\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2018}}\nHossack's last bike conversion was a [[Triumph Trident|Triumph Trident 900]] in 1994, commissioned by Formula 1 entrepreneur [[Keith Duckworth]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burr |first1=Norman |title=First principles : the official biography of Keith Duckworth OBE |isbn=978-1-845845-28-5 |pages=289, 297, 300}}</ref> This proved to be an ideal application, as the cylinder heads of the triple offered an ideal mounting point for the lower wishbone. The conversion worked well but never went further than that one prototype.\n\n==Post motorcycles==\nDuring the 1990s, after leaving the motorcycle design world behind, Hossack spent several years inventing machines for the packaging industry before taking a position in the medical device industry.

The great powers of the day decided that Serbia should construct the railway. Not economically developed to begin with, Serbia was additionally pauperized after the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u20131878)|Serbian-Ottoman wars]] from 1876 to 1878, so it lacked the necessary funds. Prince [[Milan Obrenovi\u0107 IV|Milan Obrenovi\u0107]] and the government announced a [[request for tender]] and the bidding was won by a French company. According to a popular - but unproven - version of events, Prince Milan accepted a bribe of 1 million francs in gold to give the job to the French.<ref name=\"Politika\">{{Citation | author = Dragan Peri\u0107 | title = Gvozdeni konji u Ciganskoj bari | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin, No. 1039 | pages = 28\u201329 | language = Serbian | date = 27 August 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe concession included the construction of the [[Belgrade\u2013Ni\u0161 railway]], the train bridge over the [[Sava]] river and a railway that would connect Belgrade to [[Zemun]], a border town of [[Austria-Hungary]] at the time. The location of the future station building was chosen in 1881.<ref name=tajne>{{cite news | author = Branka Vasiljevi\u0107 | title = Tajne Glavne \u017eelezni\u010dke stanice | trans-title = Secrets of the Main Railway Station | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 16 April 2019 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/427585/Tajne-Glavne-zeleznicke-stanice}}</ref> It was a marshy [[bog]] called ''Ciganska bara'' (\"Gypsy pond\").<ref name=Politika/> The bog was charted for the first time in an [[Austria]]n map from 1789. It was a marsh which covered a wide area stretching from the present-day ''Kara\u0111or\u0111eva'' street to the mouth of the [[Top\u010diderska Reka]] into the Sava, across the northern tip of [[Ada Ciganlija]]. The marshy area covered the today's location of the Belgrade Main railway station and parts of the ''Sarajevska'' and ''Hajduk-Veljkov venac'' streets. Ciganska bara drained two other bogs. One  was located on [[Slavija Square|Slavija]], which drained through the creek of ''Vra\u010darski potok''<ref>{{Citation | author = Dragana Joki\u0107 Stamenkovi\u0107| title = Beograd na dvesta sputanih voda| newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 28 May 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/178840/Beograd-na-dvesta-sputanih-voda }}</ref> which flew down the area of the today's [[Nemanjina Street]]. The other pond was [[Zeleni Venac]]. The eponymous [[Gypsies]] inhabiting the area used the mud from the bog to make roof tiles. They lived in small huts or caravans (called \"\u010derge\"), between the high grass and [[Juncaceae|rush]], with their horses and water buffalos grazing freely in the area. As most of the huts were actually [[stilt house]]s built on [[deep foundation|piles]] due to the marshy land, the area was gradually named [[Bara Venecija]] (\"[[Venice]] pond\").<ref name=ack>{{Citation | author = Dragoljub Ackovi\u0107| title = \u0160est vekova Roma u Beogradu \u2013 part XV, Veselje do kasno u no\u0107 | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAs such, the location was absolutely inappropriate for any construction work and the marsh had to be filled first. The remains of the demolished [[Republic Square (Belgrade)#Stambol Gate|Stambol Gate]] in 1866 also finished in the bog.<ref name=tajne/> By 1884 the bog was drained and buried under the rubble from all parts of the city but especially from [[Prokop (Belgrade)|Prokop]],<ref name=ack/> Prokop is located in the eastern section of the former neighborhood of [[Jatagan Mala]]. Previously, it was a geographical reference, as the area was located in the lower valley of the now-underground stream of [[Mokrolu\u0161ki Potok]]. Earth and gravel were dug and used to cover and drain the swamps on the right bank of the Sava, so that the neighborhoods of [[Savamala]] and [[Bara Venecija]] could be constructed, along with the building of central railway station. After the works were completed, the area around Mokrolu\u0161ki Potok was left as a steep, elongated cut in the ground, thus acquiring its name (Serbian ''prokop'', cut or dug through). Prince Milan personally suggested this area, which stretched above [[\u0110or\u0111e Vajfert]]'s brewery and the neighborhood of [[Mostar interchange#Neighborhood|Smutekovac]]. Among his many reasons he cited the quality of the earth and the fact that the proximity of the construction site would reduce the transportation costs. However, that land belonged to his wife, [[Natalie of Serbia|Princess Natalie]], so the prince even earned money from the station's construction. In a historical twist, Prokop is the location of Belgrade's designated present-day central railway station.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nWhen the location was chosen, it was also disconnected from Belgrade in terms of transportation. The former village of Savamala was closest, but the city could only be reached using a [[fiaker]], and this along a bypass route leading through Spomeni\u010dka Street (modern Nemanjina).<ref name=tajne/>\n\nThe construction of the railway and station initially met with fierce opposition. The law on railway construction barely passed in the National Assembly of Serbia, while for the railway itself it was said that it was both costly and unnecessary; a \"devil's snake\"; a \"destroyer of the people\", a threat to female fertility and a conduit of infiltration by foreign powers.<ref>{{cite news | author = Darko Pejovi\u0107 | script-title=sr: \u0418\u0437 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0443\u045b\u0435 \u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0443 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u0443 | trans-title = From ground floor house to five-floor villa | newspaper = Politika | page = 11 | language = Serbian | date = 28 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Belgrade Main railway station}}\n\n=== Opening ===\n\nThe [[foundation stone]]s were laid by prince Milan: for the railway on {{OldStyleDate|3 July|1881|21 June}}, for the station on {{OldStyleDate|15 April|1883|3 April}}. The building of the station lagged behind the construction of the railway and the bridge, so when the time came for the first train to pass through Belgrade, the object wasn't finished. As it was obvious that the station won't be finished on time, the temporary object was built to serve the purpose instead. Even though at one point in 1884 it was recorded that 5,575 workers were employed on the building's construction, it couldn't be finished in time.<ref name=obnova>{{cite news | author = Branka Vasiljevi\u0107 | script-title=sr: \u041e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u0431\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0435 \u0437\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0435 \u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0435 \u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435 | trans-title = Reconstruction of the former building of the Main railway station | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 6 August 2019 }}</ref> It had to be ceremonially open, even though it was still covered with scaffolds.<ref name=Politika/> The first train from this station departed towards [[Zemun]] with courtly honours, on {{OldStyleDate|1 September|1884|20 August}}, at 3 p.m.<ref>Srpske novine, 21 August 1884</ref> As Serbia was declared a kingdom in 1882, the first passengers were now King Milan, Queen Natalie and the Crown Prince [[Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107|Alexander]], on the way to [[Vienna]].

It was also well connected with the roads which lead outside of the city. It was directly connected with the road which is today the ''Savska'' Street in the direction of the [[Mostar interchange|Mostar]] neighborhood. There, it was splitting in two directions, one to the east (later neighborhoods of [[Jatagan Mala]] and [[Prokop (Belgrade)|Prokop]]) in the direction of [[Kragujevac]] in central Serbia, and the other to the south (neighborhoods of [[Senjak]], [[\u010cukarica]], [[\u017darkovo]]) and further to the west Serbia.

Soon after, direct connection was established with [[Dubrovnik]] and Zelenika ([[Herceg Novi]]).<ref name=zlatno/><ref name=uskrs/>\n\n=== World War II and reconstruction ===\n\nThe building was damaged during [[World War II]]. It was hit during the [[Operation Retribution (1941)|bombing of Belgrade]], part of the German attack on Yugoslavia on 6 March 1941. Immediately after entering Belgrade, Germans constructed an improvised stationary building  next to the damaged building, on the location where the [[Tito's Blue Train]] was exhibited in 1980. The station was further damaged during the heavy Easter Bombing, conducted by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944. The building was reconstructed after the war, being fully finished in 1953. Two side towers, one of the main architectural and visual marks of the station in the direction of the Kara\u0111or\u0111eva Street, weren't rebuilt but were completely demolished instead.<ref name=tajne/><ref name=uskrs/>\n\nThe post-war reconstruction was headed by the Russian contractors. The clock, placed above the main entrance immediately after the opening in 1885, was also damaged. New mechanism was placed inside and the clock was returned to its original place, but the clock's decorative lace of wrought iron wasn't restored. The door at the main entrance were replaced, but the decoration from the same material as the clock's also hasn't been restored. The glass roof was completely destroyed during the war, but the Russian opted for a built roof instead for restoring the original, glass one. Above the clock, in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] there was a coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia, held by sculptured, stone winged lions ([[gryphons]]. Above this composition, the Roman numerals MDCCCLXXXIV, marking the year of 1884, were written over the [[architrave]]. New Communist authorities took down the royal coat of arms immediately after taking over after World War II. The stone lions and the [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]], the decorative round shield around them, were removed later and disappeared after a while.

Citing numerous disadvantages of the new station, he asserted that the old, Main station is way better suited for the railway traffic and that is should be kept. Main station is interconnected by the public transportation lines with almost all parts of Belgrade, and only 6 tram lines go to 11 parts of the city. The location is much better and, as the Belgrade grew around it, practically the entire urban life unfolds around it. He disputed the claim of the city administration that the railway prevents the city to \"come out on the river banks\" as the removal only of the tracks which are not in use will do the trick. The station will be of major importance for the future [[Belgrade Metro]] and, since he said that Prokop, in functional terms, is not a station at all, with closing of the Main station, central Belgrade would not have any proper railway station.

Not economically developed to begin with, Serbia was additionally pauperized after the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u20131878)|Serbian-Ottoman wars]] from 1876 to 1878, so it lacked the funds. Prince [[Milan Obrenovi\u0107 IV|Milan Obrenovi\u0107]] and the government announced the [[request for tender]] and the bidding was won by a French company. Popular story goes that prince Milan took a bribe of 1 million francs in gold, in order to give the job to the French, but that was never proven.<ref name=\"Politika\">{{Citation | author = Dragan Peri\u0107 | title = Gvozdeni konji u Ciganskoj bari | newspaper = [[Politika]]-Magazin, No. 1039 | pages = 28\u201329 | language = Serbian | date = 27 August 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nThe concession included the construction of the [[Belgrade\u2013Ni\u0161 railway]], the train bridge over the [[Sava]] river and a railway which will connect Belgrade to [[Zemun]], at the time, the border town of [[Austria-Hungary]].

It was a marsh which covered a wide area from the modern ''Kara\u0111or\u0111eva'' street to the mouth of the [[Top\u010diderska Reka]] into the Sava, across the northern tip of [[Ada Ciganlija]]. The marshy area covered the today's location of the Belgrade Main railway station and parts of the ''Sarajevska'' and ''Hajduk-Veljkov venac'' streets. Ciganska bara drained two other bogs. One  was located on [[Slavija Square|Slavija]], which drained through the creek of ''Vra\u010darski potok''<ref>{{Citation | author = Dragana Joki\u0107 Stamenkovi\u0107| title = Beograd na dvesta sputanih voda| newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 28 May 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/178840/Beograd-na-dvesta-sputanih-voda }}</ref> which flew down the area of the today's [[Nemanjina Street]]. The other pond was [[Zeleni Venac]]. [[Gypsies]] who lived in the area, hence the name, used the mud from the bog to make roof tiles. They lived in small huts or caravans (called \"\u010derge\"), between the high grass and [[Juncaceae|rush]], with their horses and water buffaloes grazing freely in the area.

The remains of the demolished [[Republic Square (Belgrade)#Stambol Gate|Stambol Gate]] in 1866 also finished in the bog.<ref name=tajne/> By 1884 the bog was drained and buried under the rubble from all parts of the city but especially from [[Prokop (Belgrade)|Prokop]],<ref name=ack/> Prokop is located in the eastern section of the former neighborhood of [[Jatagan Mala]]. Previously, it was a geographical reference, as the area was located in the lower valley of the now underground stream of [[Mokrolu\u0161ki Potok]]. Earth and gravel were dug and used to cover and drain the swamps on the Sava's right bank, so that neighborhoods of [[Savamala]] and [[Bara Venecija]] could be constructed, along with the building of central railway station. After the works were completed, the area around Mokrolu\u0161ki Potok was left as a steep, elongated cut in the ground and so got its name (Serbian ''prokop'', cut or dug through). Prince Milan personally suggested this area, which stretched above the [[\u0110or\u0111e Vajfert]]'s brewery and the neighborhood of [[Mostar interchange#Neighborhood|Smutekovac]]. He cited many reasons like the quality of the earth or closeness to the construction site which would reduce the transportation costs. However, that land belonged to his wife, [[Natalie of Serbia|Princess Natalie]], so the prince even earned money from the station's construction. In a historical twist, the Prokop is today location of the future central railway station in Belgrade.<ref name=Politika/>\n\nWhen the location was chosen, it was also disconnected from Belgrade in terms of transportation.

It was also well connected with the roads which lead outside of the city. It was directly connected with the road which is today the ''Savska'' Street in the direction of the [[Mostar interchange|Mostar]] neighborhood. There, it was splitting in two directions, one to the east (later neighborhoods of [[Jatagan Mala]] and [[Prokop (Belgrade)|Prokop]]) in the direction of [[Kragujevac]] in central Serbia, and the other to the south (neighborhoods of [[Senjak]], [[\u010cukarica]], [[\u017darkovo]]) and further to the west Serbia.

It was hit during the [[Operation Retribution (1941)|bombing of Belgrade]], part of the German attack on Yugoslavia on 6 March 1941. Immediately after entering Belgrade, Germans constructed an improvised stationary building  next to the damaged building, on the location where the [[Tito's Blue Train]] was exhibited in 1980. The station was further damaged during the heavy Easter Bombing, conducted by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944. The building was reconstructed after the war, being fully finished in 1953. Two side towers, one of the main architectural and visual marks of the station in the direction of the Kara\u0111or\u0111eva Street, weren't rebuilt but were completely demolished instead.<ref name=tajne/><ref name=uskrs/>\n\nThe post-war reconstruction was headed by the Russian contractors. The clock, placed above the main entrance immediately after the opening in 1885, was also damaged. New mechanism was placed inside and the clock was returned to its original place, but the clock's decorative lace of wrought iron wasn't restored. The door at the main entrance were replaced, but the decoration from the same material as the clock's also hasn't been restored. The glass roof was completely destroyed during the war, but the Russian opted for a built roof instead for restoring the original, glass one.

Citing numerous disadvantages of the new station, he asserted that the old, Main station is way better suited for the railway traffic and that is should be kept. Main station is interconnected by the public transportation lines with almost all parts of Belgrade, and only 6 tram lines go to 11 parts of the city. The location is much better and, as the Belgrade grew around it, practically the entire urban life unfolds around it. He disputed the claim of the city administration that the railway prevents the city to \"come out on the river banks\" as the removal only of the tracks which are not in use will do the trick. The station will be of major importance for the future [[Belgrade Metro]] and, since he said that Prokop, in functional terms, is not a station at all, with closing of the Main station, central Belgrade would not have any proper railway station. Vu\u010di\u0107 concluded that the interests of the investors are superior to those of the commuters. He also maintains that the isolation of the new station's location will directly bring to the further decrease in the number of railway passengers. Another member of the Academy, transportation engineer Du\u0161an Teodorovi\u0107 also criticized the project.<ref name=\"danas\">{{cite web | url = https://www.danas.rs/beograd/prokop-najkatastrofalnija-greska-saobracaja-u-beogradu/ | author = A.Popovi\u0107 | title = Prokop najkatastrofalnija gre\u0161ka saobra\u0107aja u Beogradu | trans-title = Prokop (is) the most disastrous error of the Belgrade transportation | date = 18 April 2018 | publisher = [[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]] | language = Serbian }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Dejan Aleksi\u0107, Daliborka Mu\u010dibabi\u0107 | title = Plan za metro u interesu putnika, a ne investitora | trans-title = Plan for the metro (should be) in the interest of the passengers, not of the investors | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 18 April 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/402152/Plan-za-metro-u-interesu-putnika-a-ne-investitora }}</ref>\n\nNenad Kecman, executive manager of the [[Serbian Railways]] stated that none of the objections or suggestions by the experts from the railway transportation branch were adopted by the city administration. New system will marginalize the railway transportation, he added, claiming that the professionals are against both closing of the station, as the entire city gravitates to it, and the planned demolition, or adaptation into the pedestrian bridge, of the [[Old Railway Bridge]]. Saying that such a luxurious complex, like the planned Belgrade Waterfront, can't function without some kind of a railway system, especially for connecting it to the airport, the experts insisted on keeping the old station in at least diminished capacity, but city refused that, claiming that the investors from the United Arab Emirates, which are partners in the Belgrade Waterfront project, rejected any idea of a railway.<ref name=danas/>\n\nArchitect Bojan Kova\u010devi\u0107, president of the Academy of Architecture of Serbia, labeled the hastiness in pushing the Belgrade Waterfront agenda - like the closing of the Main Railway Station even though the new railway facilities weren't finished - as the \"raping\" of Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://rs.n1info.com/a397085/Biznis/Izmestanje-Glavne-zeleznicke-6-meseci-pre-roka-zasto-se-zuri.html | author = Jelena D.

It is one of the first railway stations in Serbia, whose design included a specific architectural program and contents adapted to the European technical achievements. It is designed in the style of academism, as a representative edifice, with the dynamic floor plan. The central classicist projection of the main entrance with the triangular tympanum dominates over the architectural composition. With its specific solutions, the building stands as a proof of the technical and architectural development of Serbia in the last decades of the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1980, a [[Tito's Blue Train]] locomotive was put on open display next to the railway station entrance.\n\nThe building was declared a cultural monument in 1981 and the cultural monument of great importance in 1983.<ref name=obnova/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| bgcolor=\"#ECECEC\" | \n<gallery widths=\"150px\" perrow=\"5\" style=\"font-size: small; line-height: 130%;\">\nFile:Belgrade Main railway station 3.jpg|\nFile:Glavna \u017eelezni\u010dka stanica Beograd 1.jpg|\nFile:Belgrade Main railway station 2.jpg|\nFile:\u017dS 441 in Belgrade-Glavna railway station.jpg|\nFile:Belgrade Main railway station (by Pudelek).jpg|\nFile:\u017dS 661 247 at Belgrade Glavna railway station.jpg|\nFile:Belgrade railway station.JPG|\nFile:Belgrade railway station 2.JPG|\nFile:Belgrade Main Railway Station.jpg|\nFile:Belgrade Main Railwaystation at night.JPG|\n</gallery>\n|}\n</center>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Belgrade railway junction]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category-inline|Belgrade Main railway station}}\n\n{{Transport in Belgrade}}\n\n[[Category:Railway stations in Belgrade|Main]]\n[[Category:Railway stations opened in 1884]]\n[[Category:1884 establishments in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Railway stations closed in 2018]]\n", "name_user": "Marko1973", "label": "safe", "comment": "Stylistic edits.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade_Main_railway_station"}
