The Hawkeyes got off to a slow start, but after Wyoming punter Tim Zaleski missed the ball on the attempted punt, the Hawkeyes took a 14-3 lead at the half. Iowa built on the momentum with a 45-yard pass from first year starter Nate Stanley to wide receiver Nick Easley. Iowa wins the season opener 24-3. Iowa's defense impressed many, holding Josh Allen to only 174 yards and 17 incompletions, and a quarterback rating of 24.9. Iowa defense also picked off Allen twice.\n\nThis game marked the debut of the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football#Kinnick Wave|\"Kinnick Wave\"]], a new Iowa football tradition in which fans turn toward the

The Hawkeyes got off to a slow start, but after Wyoming punter Tim Zaleski missed the ball on the attempted punt, the Hawkeyes took a 14-3 lead at the half. Iowa built on the momentum with a 45-yard pass from first year starter Nate Stanley to wide receiver Nick Easley. Iowa wins the season opener 24-3. Iowa's defense impressed many, holding Josh Allen to only 174 yards and 17 incompletions, and a quarterback rating of 24.9. Iowa defense also picked off Allen twice.\n\nThis game marked the debut of the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football#Kinnick Wave|\"Kinnick Wave\"]], a new Iowa football tradition in which fans turn toward the

However, it was the pirate market that introduced ''3 Idiots'' to most Chinese audiences, becoming a [[cult hit]] in the country. It became China's 12th favourite film of all time, according to ratings on Chinese film review site [[Douban]], with only one domestic Chinese film (''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'') ranked higher. Aamir Khan gained a large growing Chinese fanbase as a result. By 2013, China grew to become the world's second largest film market (after the United States), paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, starting with ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"forbes-china\"/> ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014) was the first Indian film to collect {{INR|link=yes}}2&nbsp;billion overseas,<ref>{{Cite web | title = Business Standard-PK creates history in China; crosses Rs 100 cr at Chinese box office | last = Malvania | first = Urvi | work = Business-standard.com | date = 10 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://wap.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/pk-creates-history-in-china-cross-rs-100-cr-at-chinese-box-office-115060900536_1.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = Aamir Khan's 'PK' grosses record 100 million yuan in China | author = PTI | work = The Indian Express | date = 7 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aamir-khans-pk-grosses-record-100-million-yuan-in-china/ }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = 'PK' racing towards $20 mn mark in China | last = Dev | first = Anindita | work = Zee News | date = 19 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/pk-racing-towards-20-mn-mark-in-china_1616303.html }}</ref> and ''[[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]'' (2016) is the first Indian film to exceed [[1000 Crore Club|{{INR}}10&nbsp;billion]] and $100&nbsp;million overseas,<ref name=\"Bollywood Hungama\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/box-office-special-features/dangals-overseas-gross-stands-whopping-214-mil-usd-rs-1380-crores/|title=Dangal's overseas gross stands at a whopping 214 mil.

However, it was the pirate market that introduced ''3 Idiots'' to most Chinese audiences, becoming a [[cult hit]] in the country. It became China's 12th favourite film of all time, according to ratings on Chinese film review site [[Douban]], with only one domestic Chinese film (''[[Farewell My Concubine (film)|Farewell My Concubine]]'') ranked higher. Aamir Khan gained a large growing Chinese fanbase as a result. By 2013, China grew to become the world's second largest film market (after the United States), paving the way for Aamir Khan's Chinese box office success, starting with ''[[Dhoom 3]]'' (2013).<ref name=\"forbes-china\"/> ''[[PK (film)|PK]]'' (2014) was the first Indian film to collect {{INR|link=yes}}2&nbsp;billion overseas,<ref>{{Cite web | title = Business Standard-PK creates history in China; crosses Rs 100 cr at Chinese box office | last = Malvania | first = Urvi | work = Business-standard.com | date = 10 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://wap.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/pk-creates-history-in-china-cross-rs-100-cr-at-chinese-box-office-115060900536_1.html }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = Aamir Khan's 'PK' grosses record 100 million yuan in China | author = PTI | work = The Indian Express | date = 7 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/aamir-khans-pk-grosses-record-100-million-yuan-in-china/ }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | title = 'PK' racing towards $20 mn mark in China | last = Dev | first = Anindita | work = Zee News | date = 19 June 2015 | accessdate = 24 July 2016 | url = http://zeenews.india.com/entertainment/movies/pk-racing-towards-20-mn-mark-in-china_1616303.html }}</ref> and ''[[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]'' (2016) is the first Indian film to exceed [[1000 Crore Club|{{INR}}10&nbsp;billion]] and $100&nbsp;million overseas,<ref name=\"Bollywood Hungama\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/box-office-special-features/dangals-overseas-gross-stands-whopping-214-mil-usd-rs-1380-crores/|title=Dangal's overseas gross stands at a whopping 214 mil.

{"title_page": "Ad hominem", "text_new": "{{short description|Typically, a fallacious argumentative strategy that attacks the character of the person making the argument. Alternatively, a valid strategy basing arguments on the opponents' own commitments, without endorsing those commitments}}\n{{redirect|Personal attack|the policy on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:No personal attacks}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for \"to the person\"), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is a term is applied to several different types of arguments, most of which are [[Fallacy#Informal fallacy|fallacious]]. Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}}\n\nMany examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"''argument from commitment.''\" Italian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"''addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.''\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\nExcept within specialized philosophical usages, the modern usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? Not on Walton's watch.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nAn ''ad hominem'' fallacy occurs when one attacks the character of an interlocutor in an attempt to refute their argument. Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ''ad hominem'' fallacy. For example, if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an interlocutor's argument and adds a slight character attack at the end, this character attack is not necessarily fallacious.

Alternatively, a valid strategy basing arguments on the opponents' own commitments, without endorsing those commitments}}\n{{redirect|Personal attack|the policy on Wikipedia|Wikipedia:No personal attacks}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Ad hominem''''' ([[Latin]] for \"to the person\"), short for '''''argumentum ad hominem''''', is a term is applied to several different types of arguments, most of which are [[Fallacy#Informal fallacy|fallacious]]. Typically it refers to a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The most common form of this fallacy is \"A makes a claim ''a'', B asserts that A holds a property that is unwelcome, and hence B concludes that argument ''a'' is wrong\".\n\nThe valid types of ''ad hominem'' arguments are generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage and typically refer to the dialectical strategy of using the target's own beliefs and arguments against them while not assenting to the validity of those beliefs and arguments.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe various types of ''ad hominem'' arguments have been known in the West since at least the ancient Greeks. [[Aristotle]], in his work ''[[Sophistical Refutations]]'', detailed the fallaciousness of putting the questioner but not the argument under scrutiny.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=82}}\n\nMany examples of ancient non-fallacious ''ad hominem'' arguments are preserved in the works of the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]]. In these arguments, the concepts and assumptions of the opponents are used as part of a dialectical strategy against the opponents to demonstrate the unsoundness of their own arguments and assumptions. In this way, the arguments are to the person (''ad hominem''), but without attacking the properties of the individuals making the arguments.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2001|1p=207-209|2a1=Wong|2y=2017|2p=49}} This kind of argument is also known as \"''argument from commitment.''\" Italian polymath [[Galileo Galilei]] and British philosopher [[John Locke]] also examined the argument from commitment, a form of the ''ad hominem'' argument, meaning examining an argument on the basis of whether it stands true to the principles of the person carrying the argument. In the mid-19th century, the modern understanding of the term ''ad hominem'' started to take shape, with the broad definition given by English logician [[Richard Whately]]. According to Whately, ''ad hominem'' arguments were \"''addressed to the peculiar circumstances, character, avowed opinions, or past conduct of the individual.''\"{{sfn|Walton|2001|pp=208-210}}\n\nExcept within specialized philosophical usages, the modern usage of the term ''ad hominem'' signifies a straight attack at the character and ethos of a person, in an attempt to refute its argument.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=210}}\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe Latin phase ''argumentum ad hominem'' stands for \"argument against the person\".{{sfn|Tindale|2007|p=91}} \"Ad\" corresponds to \"against\" but it could also mean \"to\" or \"towards\".{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=71-72}}\n\nThe terms ''ad mulierem'' and ''ad feminam'' have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.{{sfnm|1a1=Olivesi|1y=2010|2a1=Sommers|2y=1991}}\n\n== Types of ad hominem arguments ==\n{{see also|List of fallacies}}\n\n[[File:Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement.svg|440px|thumb|''Ad hominem'' attack lies near the bottom end of [[Graham's Hierarchy of Disagreement]]]]\n\nFallacious ''ad hominem'' reasoning is categorized  among [[informal fallacy|informal fallacies]], more precisely as a [[genetic fallacy]], a subcategory of [[fallacies of irrelevance]].{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=2008|1p=190|2a1=Bowell|2a2=Kemp|2y=2010|2pp=201-213|3a1=Copi|3y=1986|3pp=112-113}}\n\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies can be separated in various different types, among others are ''tu quoque'', circumstantial, guilt by association, and abusive ''ad hominem''. All of them are similar to the general scheme of ''ad hominem'' argument, that is instead of dealing with the essence of someones argument or trying to refute it, the interlocutor is attacking the character of the proponent of the argument and concluding that it is a sufficient reason to drop the initial argument.{{sfn|van Eemeren|2001|p=142}}\n\n=== ''Tu quoque'' ===\n{{main|Tu quoque}}\n''Ad hominem tu quoque'' (literally: \"You also\") is a response to a personal attack (or ''ad hominem'' argument) that itself is a personal attack.{{sfnm|1a1=Wrisley|1y=2019|1p=88|2a1=Walton|2y=2015|2pp= 431-435|3a1=Lavery|3a2=Hughes|3y=2008|3p=132}}\n\n''Tu quoque'' appears as: \n*A makes a claim ''a''.\n*B attacks the character of A by saying he holds a ''property x'', which is bad.\n*A defends himself by attacking B, saying he also holds the same ''property x''.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=89}}\n\nHere is an example given by philosophy professor George Wrisley to illustrate the above: A businessman and politician is giving a lecture at a University about how good his company is and how nicely the system works. A student asks him \"Is it true that you and your company are selling weapons to third world rulers who use those arms against their own people?\" and the  businessman replies \"is it true that your university gets funding by the same company you are claiming it is selling guns to those countries? You are not a white dove either\". The ''ad hominem'' accusation of the student is relevant to the narrative the businessman tries to project thus not fallacious. On the other hand, the attack on the student (that is, the student being inconsistent) is irrelevant to the opening narrative. So the businessman's ''tu quoque'' response is fallacious.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=89-91}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Christopher Tindale]] approaches somewhat different the ''tu quoque'' fallacy. According to Tindale, a ''tu quoque'' fallacy appears when a response to an argument is made on the history of the arguer. This argument is also invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true, then source A may be a [[hypocrite]] or even changed their mind, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. A common example, given by Tindale, is when a doctor advises a patient to lose weight, but the patient argues that there is no need for him to go on a diet because the doctor is also overweight.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=94-96}}\n\n=== Circumstantial ===\n{{main|Bulverism}}\n''Circumstantial ad hominem'' points out that someone is in circumstances (for instance, their job, wealth, property, or relations) such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. As with other types of ''ad hominem'' attack, circumstantial attack could be fallacious or not. It could be fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the [[genetic fallacy]] (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source). But it also may be a sound argument, if the premises are correct and the bias is relevant to the argument.{{sfnm|1a1=Walton|1y=1998|1pp=18-21|2a1=Wrisley|2y=2019|2pp=77-78}}\n\nA simple example is: a father may tell his daughter not to start smoking because she will damage her health, and she may point out that he is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that smoking might cause various diseases. Her father's inconsistency is not a proper reason to reject his claim.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=211}}\n\nPhilosopher and pundit on informal fallacies [[Douglas N. Walton]] argues that a circumstantial ''ad hominem'' argument can be non-fallacious. This could be the case when someone (A) attacks the personality of another person (B) making an argument (a) while the personality of B is relevant to argument a, i.e. B talks as an authority figure. To illustrate this reasoning, Walton gives the example of a witness at a trial, if he had been caught lying and cheating in his own life, should the jury take his word for granted? Not on Walton's watch.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=213}}\n\n=== Guilt by association ===\n{{main|Association fallacy}}\nGuilt by association can sometimes also be a type of ''ad hominem'' fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.{{sfn|Walton|1998|pp=18-21}}\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n# Source S makes claim C. \n# Group G, which is currently viewed negatively by the recipient, also makes claim C.\n# Therefore, source S is viewed by the recipient of the claim as associated to their group G and inherits how negatively viewed it is.\n\nAcademic Leigh Kolb gives as an example that the 2008 US vice\u2010presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] attacked [[Barack Obama]] for having worked with [[Bill Ayers]], who had been a leader in the [[Weather Underground]] terrorist group in the 1960s. Despite Obama's denouncing every act of terrorism, he was still associated by his opponents with terrorism.{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\nGuilt by association is frequently found in social and political debates. It also appears after horrible events, linked to a specific group. An example, given also by Leigh Kolb, is the peak of attacks against Muslims in the USA after the [[September_11_attacks| September 11 attacks]].{{sfn|Kolb|2019|pp=351-352}}\n\n===Abusive ''ad hominem''===\nAbusive ''ad hominem'' argument (or direct ''ad hominem'') is associated with an attack to the character of the person carrying an argument. This kind of argument, besides usually being fallacious, is also counterproductive, as a proper dialogue is hard to achieve after such an attack.{{sfn|Tindale|2007|pp=92-93}}{{sfn|Hansen|2019|loc= 1. The core fallacies}}{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=123}}\n\nAn ''ad hominem'' fallacy occurs when one attacks the character of an interlocutor in an attempt to refute their argument. Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ''ad hominem'' fallacy. For example, if one supplies sufficient reasons to reject an interlocutor's argument and adds a slight character attack at the end, this character attack is not necessarily fallacious. Whether it is fallacious depends on whether or not the insult is used as a reason against the interlocutor's argument. An ''ad hominem'' occurs when an attack on the interlocutor's character functions as a response to an interlocutor's argument or claim.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|p=83}}\n\nKey issues on examining an argument whether being an ''ad hominem'' fallacy or not are whether the accusation against the person stands true or not, whether the accusation is relevant to the argument. Lastly, it should be examined whether the ''ad hominem'' argument shortens or diminishes the counterargument. An example is a dialogue at the court, where the attorney cross-examines an eyewitness, bringing to light the fact that the witness was convicted in the past for lying. If the attorney's conclusion is that the witness is lying, that would be wrong. But if his argument would be that the witness should not be trusted, that would not be a fallacy.{{sfn|Wrisley|2019|pp=86-87}}\n\n=== Argument from commitment ===\nThe term ''ad hominem'' is used to refer to a type of valid argument that employs, as a dialectical strategy, the exclusive utilization of the beliefs, convictions, and assumptions of those holding the position being argued against, i.e., arguments constructed on the basis of what other people hold to be true. This usage is generally only encountered in specialist philosophical usage or in pre-20th Century usages.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|2019|loc=note1}} This type of argument is also known as \"argument from commitment\" or the  ''ex concessis'' argument (Latin for \"from what has been conceded already\").{{sfn|Walton|2001}}\n\n== Usage in debates==\n''Ad hominem'' fallacies are considered to be uncivil and do not help creating a constructive atmosphere for dialogue to flourish.{{sfn|Weston|2018|p=82}} An ''ad hominem'' attack is an attack on the character of the target who tends to feel the necessity to defend himself from the accusation of being hypocrite\u2014not an easy task. It is so powerful of an argument it has been employed in many political debates. Since it is associated with negativity and dirty tricks, it has gained a bad fame, of being always fallacious.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=122}}\n\nAuthor Eithan Orkibi, having studied the Israeli politics prior to elections, described two other forms of ''ad hominem'' attacks that are common during election periods. They both depend on the collective memory shared by both proponents and the audience. The first is the ''precedential ad hominem'', according to which the previous history of someone means that they do not fit for the office. It goes like this: \"My opponent was (allegedly) wrong in the past, therefore he is wrong now\". The second one, is a behavioral ''ad hominem'': \"my opponent was not a descent in his arguments in the past, so he is not now either\".

At ten years old, she joined leading women's club [[Millwall Lionesses L.F.C.|Millwall Lionesses]]. In the 1996\u201397 season, Chapman made her senior team debut at the age of&nbsp;14. She became a regular starter in the team and also participated in the 1997 [[FA Women's Premier League Cup]] and [[FA Women's Cup]] final wins. In the 1998\u201399 campaign, Chapman won [[The Football Association|FA]] Young Player of the Year award. Already a full England international, she left Millwall in 2000 to sign a professional contract with [[Fulham L.F.C.|Fulham]]. She played on the teams that won back-to-back promotions, as well as the 2001\u201302 Premier League Cup and [[2002 FA Women's Cup Final|2002 FA Women's Cup]]. In June 2001 Chapman was again named FA Young Player of the Year. After two years with [[Charlton Athletic L.F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] from 2004, Chapman joined [[Arsenal W.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies]] and reached prominence with the team in her first season, winning a domestic [[Treble (association football)|treble]] as well as the [[UEFA Women's Cup]]. She had missed significant sections of the 2002\u201303 and 2007\u201308 seasons through pregnancy, and spent a single season with American [[Women's Professional Soccer]] team [[Chicago Red Stars]] in 2010, before returning to Arsenal Ladies. After another pregnancy truncated her 2013 season, Chapman moved across London to sign for [[Chelsea L.F.C.|Chelsea Ladies]] in January 2014.\n\nChapman is a former [[England women's national football team|England]] U\u201318 captain.

At ten years old, she joined leading women's club [[Millwall Lionesses L.F.C.|Millwall Lionesses]]. In the 1996\u201397 season, Chapman made her senior team debut at the age of&nbsp;14. She became a regular starter in the team and also participated in the 1997 [[FA Women's Premier League Cup]] and [[FA Women's Cup]] final wins. In the 1998\u201399 campaign, Chapman won [[The Football Association|FA]] Young Player of the Year award. Already a full England international, she left Millwall in 2000 to sign a professional contract with [[Fulham L.F.C.|Fulham]]. She played on the teams that won back-to-back promotions, as well as the 2001\u201302 Premier League Cup and [[2002 FA Women's Cup Final|2002 FA Women's Cup]]. In June&nbsp;2001 Chapman was again named FA Young Player of the Year. After two years with [[Charlton Athletic L.F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] from 2004, Chapman joined [[Arsenal W.F.C.|Arsenal Ladies]] and reached prominence with the team in her first season, winning a domestic [[Treble (association football)|treble]] as well as the [[UEFA Women's Cup]]. She had missed significant sections of the 2002\u201303 and 2007\u201308 seasons through pregnancy, and spent a single season with American [[Women's Professional Soccer]] team [[Chicago Red Stars]] in 2010, before returning to Arsenal Ladies. After another pregnancy truncated her 2013 season, Chapman moved across London to sign for [[Chelsea L.F.C.|Chelsea Ladies]] in January 2014.\n\nChapman is a former [[England women's national football team|England]] U\u201318 captain.

In March&nbsp;2002 she netted her first senior international goal in a 4\u20131 [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup qualification]] win in the [[Netherlands women's national football team|Netherlands]]. In her first spell with the national team, Chapman represented England at four major international tournaments; [[2001 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Euro 2001]], [[2005 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Euro 2005]], [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup|2007 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2009 UEFA Women's Championship|UEFA Euro 2009]].

The reason for this sudden enrollment drop in DCPS is that the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 separated DC Public Charter Schools (DCPCS) from District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nThe District of Columbia passed charter school legislation in 1996, which went into effect in September 1999.  The legislation gave the District the power to grant charters for 15 years.  Although this is longer than the traditional 3\u20135 year term observed in 31 other states, a required review takes place every 5 years. 4.4% of public school students enrolled in a charter school for the 1999 academic school year; the 28 schools had a total enrollment of approx. 3,000 students. After legislation was enacted in 2007, chartering authority was placed under the D.C. Public Charter School Board and disaffiliated from DCPS. The governance of DCPS was also restructured, and the district was placed under the [[Mayoral control of schools|control of the Mayor]]. In 2010 about 38% of Washington, D.C. public school students attended 60 [[charter schools]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Birnbaum | title=Taking baby steps towards charter schools | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042704768.html| work= | publisher=Washington Pose | location=Washington, DC | pages= 18 in Casual Living | date=29 April 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> There are 52 public charter schools in the District, with 93 campuses and 30,000 students. The total number of public charter schools has been reduced from 60 schools on 96 campuses in 2008\u201309 to 53 schools on 98 campuses as of the 2011\u201312 school year. However, the addition of grades to the charter schools are still increasing enrollment and decreasing from DCPS\u2019 numbers.\n\n==Students==\n\n===Health===\nIn 2009, 43% of all DCPS public school students were overweight or obese. This was one of the highest rates in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news | first=Tim | last=Craig | title=D.C.

This constituted a large drop from the freshman graduation rate of 68.4% in 2002 and 68.8% as recently as 2005. In just the 2008\u201309 school year alone, 1,075 black students dropped out of high school. This figure raises concern since there were 1,246 students that dropped out of DCPS schools that year.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=Public School Graduates and Dropouts From the Common Core of Data: School Year 2008\u201309 | url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011312.pdf | work= National Center for Education Statistics| publisher=Institute of Education Sciences, Department of Education| location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date=2008\u20132009| id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nHowever, these numbers are not meant to be misleading; the 62.8% freshman graduation rate of black students in 2008 was above the state average.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Theodore Roosevelt High School, 13th St. in upper NW, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Roosevelt Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[Petworth, Washington, D.C.|Petworth]].]]\nWithin DCPS, schools are classified as either a \"neighborhood school\" or a \"destination school.\" Neighborhood schools are elementary or secondary schools assigned to students based on his or her address. Destination schools are feeder-schools for elementary or secondary institutions from a school a student is already attending. Since the fall of 2009, students may choose a destination school, regardless of their neighborhood location. Locations of all of the schools and the neighborhood divides can be found on the DCPS website.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools--School Locator | url=http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/Learn+About+Schools/Find+Your+Assigned+Schools | work= | publisher=The Government of the District of Columbia | location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date= | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFor the school year ending in spring 2007, the DCPS was governed by the [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|D.C. Board of Education]], with eleven members, including two students who had the right to debate but not to vote. Five members were elected and four were appointed by the Mayor. The Board established DCPS policies and employed a superintendent to serve as chief executive officer of the school district, responsible for day-to-day operations. Four Board members represented specific geographical boundaries and the Board President was elected at large. One condition of the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was the creation of DCPS as a separate cabinet-level agency from the D.C. Board of Education. This moved DCPS within the executive branch of the District of Columbia government\u2014specifically, under Mayoral control. Currently, this means that DCPS is subordinate to District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] proposed putting the public schools under the direct control of the Mayor's Office upon taking office in January 2007. However, this reform to District of Columbia Public Schools was encouraged by his predecessor and constituents at large. It also placed all of the District of Columbia public charter schools under the care of a new board\u2014District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (PCSB). Although these schools were previously a part of DCPS, they are now considered to be a separate district controlled by the D.C. Public Charter School Board (PCSB).\n\nThe D.C. Council passed the Mayor's proposal into law but since the change amended the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act]], the change needed to gain Federal approval before taking effect.  D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced H.R. 2080, a bill to amend the D.C. Home Rule Charter Act to provide for the Mayor's proposal. H.R. 2080 was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under an expedited procedure on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators ([[Ben Cardin]] of [[Maryland]], [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]], and [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]]) initially placed \"holds\" on the bill to prevent its consideration in the [[United States Senate]], the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.  On June 12, Mayor Fenty appointed [[Michelle Rhee]] the new Chancellor, replacing Superintendent [[Clifford B. Janey]].\n\n===D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003===\n{{Main|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program}}\n\nIn January 2004, Congress passed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. The law established a federally-funded private [[school voucher]] program known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). The OSP distributes vouchers to low-income families to cover private school tuition. Because there are more eligible applicants than available vouchers, they are distributed by lottery. In 2010, a [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students, finding that it raised graduation rates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Patrick|title=Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education -- Institute of Education Sciences}}</ref> Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%. By comparison, the rate for students who did not receive vouchers was only 70%.

Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007===\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia enacted the DC Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act established a DC public school agency based on authority given to the council in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The Department of Education that was established under the Mayor triggered several changes. The largest was already discussed\u2014DCPCS gained sole authority over chartering and charted schools, DCPS became subordinate to the Mayor's office. Secondly, many smaller authoritative changes took place. The first is that the State Education Office (SEO) became the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The four subsections of the District were reaffirmed through location-based State Board of Education selectees. In addition, the smaller eight school election wards were reaffirmed. Finally, the Commission was established through this legislature. The \"Commission\" is the Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission, which includes the Mayor, Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Judge of the DC Superior Family Court, Superintendent of Education, Chancellor of DCPS, Chair of DCPCSB and fourteen others.\nAfter the 2007\u20132008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. A very strong negative impact was initially experienced by DCPS due to the loss. A [[GAO-conducted study]]<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools: Important Steps Taken to Continue Reform Efforts, But Enhanced Planning Could Improve Implementation and Sustainability| url=http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d09619high.pdf | work= Report to Congressional Requesters| publisher= United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) | location=Washington, DC | pages= | date=June 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nrecommended that the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes for strikes and look to performance reviews from central offices to strengthen accountability. These recommendations were followed and accountability has increased through academic and financial report generation.  Increased accountability made way for other small reforms. One example is the implementation of a requirement that students entering 9th grade are now required to sit down with a school counselor and construct a course-plan to reach graduation.\n\n==No Child Left Behind compliance==\n\nIn accordance with Section 1116, a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB), entitled \"Academic Assessment and Local Education Agency and School Improvement\", the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) of the District of Columbia oversees compliance with [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Adequate+Yearly+Progress+(AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress] (AYP). A large portion of meeting AYP is based on standardized-tests performance; the District used the [[summative assessment]] called the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (\"DC CAS\") through the 2013-2014 school year, after which it switched to tools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ([[PARCC]]) and the National Center and State Collaborative (NCSC).<ref>{{cite web|title=DC CAS|url=http://osse.dc.gov/service/dc-cas|website=Office of the State Superintendent of Education|publisher=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Students Are Assessed|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040753/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessment Glossary|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022539/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMany schools are failing to meet AYP, even though DCPS educators offer support and tools to students to be academically successful.{{citation needed|reason=this statement needs a source to back it up and has a slanted tone.|date=March 2015}} DCPS has created an evaluation tool to assess schools by more than their standardized test scores.

According to school choice researcher Erin Dillon, \"In its winning application for federal Race to the Top funds, DCPS, for example, touted its three models for autonomous schools: The aptly named 'Autonomous Schools,' which are granted autonomy as a reward for high performance; 'Partnership Schools,' which are run by outside organizations that are granted autonomy in the hope of dramatically improving performance; and the 'D.C. Collaborative for Change,' or DC3, a joint effort of some of the District\u2019s highest- and lowest-performing schools that have been granted autonomy as a tool for innovating with curriculum and professional development. (Meanwhile, highly autonomous charter schools, a growing presence in the District of Columbia, educate almost 40 percent of the city\u2019s public school students.)\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Erin|title=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|work=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|publisher=Education Sector|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628123000/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\n====Traditional high schools====\n[[File:Wilson-high-dc.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], Tenleytown]]\n[[File:Eastern Senior High School - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], Kingman Park]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" | School name || Students* ||class=\"unsortable\"| Low grade ||class=\"unsortable\"| High grade\n|-\n| [[Anacostia High School]] || 449 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Ballou High School]] || 930 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Calvin Coolidge High School]] || 346 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] || 584 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]] || 818 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[H.D.

The reason for this sudden enrollment drop in DCPS is that the Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 separated DC Public Charter Schools (DCPCS) from District of Columbia Public Schools.\n\nThe District of Columbia passed charter school legislation in 1996, which went into effect in September 1999.  The legislation gave the District the power to grant charters for 15 years.  Although this is longer than the traditional 3\u20135 year term observed in 31 other states, a required review takes place every 5 years. 4.4% of public school students enrolled in a charter school for the 1999 academic school year; the 28 schools had a total enrollment of approx. 3,000 students. After legislation was enacted in 2007, chartering authority was placed under the D.C. Public Charter School Board and disaffiliated from DCPS. The governance of DCPS was also restructured, and the district was placed under the [[Mayoral control of schools|control of the Mayor]]. In 2010 about 38% of Washington, D.C. public school students attended 60 [[charter schools]].<ref>{{Cite news | first=Michael | last=Birnbaum | title=Taking baby steps towards charter schools | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042704768.html| work= | publisher=Washington Pose | location=Washington, DC | pages= 18 in Casual Living | date=29 April 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref> There are 52 public charter schools in the District, with 93 campuses and 30,000 students. The total number of public charter schools has been reduced from 60 schools on 96 campuses in 2008\u201309 to 53 schools on 98 campuses as of the 2011\u201312 school year. However, the addition of grades to the charter schools are still increasing enrollment and decreasing from DCPS\u2019 numbers.\n\n==Students==\n\n===Health===\nIn 2009, 43% of all DCPS public school students were overweight or obese.

This constituted a large drop from the freshman graduation rate of 68.4% in 2002 and 68.8% as recently as 2005. In just the 2008\u201309 school year alone, 1,075 black students dropped out of high school. This figure raises concern since there were 1,246 students that dropped out of DCPS schools that year.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=Public School Graduates and Dropouts From the Common Core of Data: School Year 2008\u201309 | url=http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011312.pdf | work= National Center for Education Statistics| publisher=Institute of Education Sciences, Department of Education| location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date=2008\u20132009| id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nHowever, these numbers are not meant to be misleading; the 62.8% freshman graduation rate of black students in 2008 was above the state average.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Theodore Roosevelt High School, 13th St. in upper NW, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[Roosevelt Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]] in [[Petworth, Washington, D.C.|Petworth]].]]\nWithin DCPS, schools are classified as either a \"neighborhood school\" or a \"destination school.\" Neighborhood schools are elementary or secondary schools assigned to students based on his or her address. Destination schools are feeder-schools for elementary or secondary institutions from a school a student is already attending. Since the fall of 2009, students may choose a destination school, regardless of their neighborhood location. Locations of all of the schools and the neighborhood divides can be found on the DCPS website.<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools--School Locator | url=http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/Learn+About+Schools/Find+Your+Assigned+Schools | work= | publisher=The Government of the District of Columbia | location=Washington, DC | pages=  | date= | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nFor the school year ending in spring 2007, the DCPS was governed by the [[District of Columbia State Board of Education|D.C. Board of Education]], with eleven members, including two students who had the right to debate but not to vote. Five members were elected and four were appointed by the Mayor. The Board established DCPS policies and employed a superintendent to serve as chief executive officer of the school district, responsible for day-to-day operations. Four Board members represented specific geographical boundaries and the Board President was elected at large. One condition of the District of Columbia Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007 was the creation of DCPS as a separate cabinet-level agency from the D.C. Board of Education. This moved DCPS within the executive branch of the District of Columbia government\u2014specifically, under Mayoral control. Currently, this means that DCPS is subordinate to District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser. D.C. Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] proposed putting the public schools under the direct control of the Mayor's Office upon taking office in January 2007. However, this reform to District of Columbia Public Schools was encouraged by his predecessor and constituents at large. It also placed all of the District of Columbia public charter schools under the care of a new board\u2014District of Columbia Public Charter School Board (PCSB). Although these schools were previously a part of DCPS, they are now considered to be a separate district controlled by the D.C. Public Charter School Board (PCSB).\n\nThe D.C. Council passed the Mayor's proposal into law but since the change amended the [[District of Columbia Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act]], the change needed to gain Federal approval before taking effect.  D.C. Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced H.R. 2080, a bill to amend the D.C. Home Rule Charter Act to provide for the Mayor's proposal. H.R. 2080 was passed by the [[United States House of Representatives]] under an expedited procedure on May 8, 2007 by a voice vote. After three U.S. Senators ([[Ben Cardin]] of [[Maryland]], [[Mary Landrieu]] of [[Louisiana]], and [[Carl Levin]] of [[Michigan]]) initially placed \"holds\" on the bill to prevent its consideration in the [[United States Senate]], the Senate agreed to pass H.R. 2080 without amendment on May 22, 2007 by unanimous consent. On May 31, 2007, the bill was presented to the President and President Bush signed H.R. 2080 into law on June 1, 2007. After the standard Congressional review period expired on June 12, 2007, the Mayor's office had direct control of the Superintendent and the school budget.  On June 12, Mayor Fenty appointed [[Michelle Rhee]] the new Chancellor, replacing Superintendent [[Clifford B. Janey]].\n\n===D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003===\n{{Main|D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program}}\n\nIn January 2004, Congress passed the D.C. School Choice Incentive Act of 2003. The law established a federally-funded private [[school voucher]] program known as the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP). The OSP distributes vouchers to low-income families to cover private school tuition. Because there are more eligible applicants than available vouchers, they are distributed by lottery. In 2010, a [[randomized controlled trial]] conducted under the auspices of the Department of Education examined the impacts of the OSP students, finding that it raised graduation rates.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Patrick|title=Evaluation of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program: Final Report|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/pubs/20104018/pdf/20104018.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Education -- Institute of Education Sciences}}</ref> Students who were offered vouchers had a graduation rate of 82%, while those who actually used their vouchers had a graduation rate of 91%.

Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007===\n\nThe Council of the District of Columbia enacted the DC Public Education Reform Amendment Act of 2007. This act established a DC public school agency based on authority given to the council in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973. The Department of Education that was established under the Mayor triggered several changes. The largest was already discussed\u2014DCPCS gained sole authority over chartering and charted schools, DCPS became subordinate to the Mayor's office. Secondly, many smaller authoritative changes took place. The first is that the State Education Office (SEO) became the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). The four subsections of the District were reaffirmed through location-based State Board of Education selectees. In addition, the smaller eight school election wards were reaffirmed. Finally, the Commission was established through this legislature. The \"Commission\" is the Interagency Collaboration and Services Integration Commission, which includes the Mayor, Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, Chief Judge of the DC Superior Family Court, Superintendent of Education, Chancellor of DCPS, Chair of DCPCSB and fourteen others.\nAfter the 2007\u20132008 school year, about one-fifth of the teachers and one-third of the principals resigned, retired, or were terminated from DCPS. A very strong negative impact was initially experienced by DCPS due to the loss. A [[GAO-conducted study]]<ref>{{Cite news | first=| last=| title=District of Columbia Public Schools: Important Steps Taken to Continue Reform Efforts, But Enhanced Planning Could Improve Implementation and Sustainability| url=http://www.gao.gov/highlights/d09619high.pdf | work= Report to Congressional Requesters| publisher= United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) | location=Washington, DC | pages= | date=June 2009 | id= | accessdate=}}</ref>\nrecommended that the Mayor direct DCPS to establish planning processes for strikes and look to performance reviews from central offices to strengthen accountability. These recommendations were followed and accountability has increased through academic and financial report generation.  Increased accountability made way for other small reforms. One example is the implementation of a requirement that students entering 9th grade are now required to sit down with a school counselor and construct a course-plan to reach graduation.\n\n==No Child Left Behind compliance==\n\nIn accordance with Section 1116, a provision of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB), entitled \"Academic Assessment and Local Education Agency and School Improvement\", the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) of the District of Columbia oversees compliance with [http://www.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Adequate+Yearly+Progress+(AYP) Adequate Yearly Progress] (AYP). A large portion of meeting AYP is based on standardized-tests performance; the District used the [[summative assessment]] called the District of Columbia Comprehensive Assessment System (\"DC CAS\") through the 2013-2014 school year, after which it switched to tools from the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers ([[PARCC]]) and the National Center and State Collaborative (NCSC).<ref>{{cite web|title=DC CAS|url=http://osse.dc.gov/service/dc-cas|website=Office of the State Superintendent of Education|publisher=Washington, DC|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Students Are Assessed|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208040753/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed|archive-date=February 8, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Assessment Glossary|url=http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|website=District of Columbia Public Schools|accessdate=7 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218022539/http://dcps.dc.gov/DCPS/In+the+Classroom/How+Students+Are+Assessed/Assessment+Glossary|archive-date=February 18, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMany schools are failing to meet AYP, even though DCPS educators offer support and tools to students to be academically successful.{{citation needed|reason=this statement needs a source to back it up and has a slanted tone.|date=March 2015}} DCPS has created an evaluation tool to assess schools by more than their standardized test scores.

According to school choice researcher Erin Dillon, \"In its winning application for federal Race to the Top funds, DCPS, for example, touted its three models for autonomous schools: The aptly named 'Autonomous Schools,' which are granted autonomy as a reward for high performance; 'Partnership Schools,' which are run by outside organizations that are granted autonomy in the hope of dramatically improving performance; and the 'D.C. Collaborative for Change,' or DC3, a joint effort of some of the District\u2019s highest- and lowest-performing schools that have been granted autonomy as a tool for innovating with curriculum and professional development. (Meanwhile, highly autonomous charter schools, a growing presence in the District of Columbia, educate almost 40 percent of the city\u2019s public school students.)\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Dillon|first=Erin|title=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|work=The Road to Autonomy: Can Schools, Districts, and Central Offices Find Their Way?|publisher=Education Sector|accessdate=27 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628123000/http://www.educationsector.org/publications/road-autonomy-can-schools-districts-and-central-offices-find-their-way|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===High schools===\n====Traditional high schools====\n[[File:Wilson-high-dc.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson High School (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson High School]], Tenleytown]]\n[[File:Eastern Senior High School - Washington, DC.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]], Kingman Park]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"175\" | School name || Students* ||class=\"unsortable\"| Low grade ||class=\"unsortable\"| High grade\n|-\n| [[Anacostia High School]] || 449 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Ballou High School]] || 930 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Coolidge Senior High School (Washington, DC)|Calvin Coolidge High School]] || 346 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Dunbar High School (Washington, D.C.)|Dunbar High School]] || 584 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[Eastern High School (Washington, D.C.)|Eastern High School]] || 818 || 9th || 12th\n|-\n| [[H.D.
