When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, himself and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSome years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIn Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapsed as the castle began to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. \n\nAs Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]], a young benevolent [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] woman who develops feelings for the Beast and begins to see the humanity within him.\n** Daisy Duczmal portrays an infant Belle. \n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Beast (Beauty and the Beast)|Beast]], a cold-hearted, selfish, unkind prince who is transformed into a beast and forced to earn back his humanity by learning to truly love and be loved in return, as well as to give rather than take.

The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to \"communicate the subtleties of the human face\" and \"[capture the] thought that occurs to him\" which gets \"through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.\" The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name=\"Penske Business Media\"/>\n\nBefore the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the \"Days of the Sun\" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe.

In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. \"That score had more to reveal\", he says, \"You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales.

When he refuses, she reveals her identity. As punishment for the prince's lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, himself and his servants from the memories of their loved ones and everyone else in the town. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the spell will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, or he will remain a beast forever.\n\nSome years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an inventor named Maurice, dreams of adventure. She constantly brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier, as he is not the type of man Belle wishes to marry. On Maurice's way to a convention and lost in the forest, he seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. Belle tricks both her father and the Beast by asking for a simple hug goodbye from her father, she pushes him out and locks herself in the dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take her father's place and forces Maurice to leave immediately.\n\nBelle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, becoming injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a spark develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a [[Plague doctor costume|plague doctor mask]] and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].\n\nIn Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the town hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\n\nAfter sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Inside the asylum carriage, Belle tells her father that she knows what happened to her mother and showed him the rose rattle she took from her magical visit to their old, abandoned home. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\n\nDuring the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. However, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, which then collapsed as the castle began to crumble, leading Gaston to fall to his death. The Beast then dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. \n\nAs Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast and servants to their human forms and to the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Belle (Beauty and the Beast)|Belle]], a young benevolent [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] woman who develops feelings for the Beast and begins to see the humanity within him.\n** Daisy Duczmal portrays an infant Belle. \n* [[Dan Stevens]] as [[Beast (Beauty and the Beast)|Beast]], a cold-hearted, selfish, unkind prince who is transformed into a beast and forced to earn back his humanity by learning to truly love and be loved in return, as well as to give rather than take.

on stilts for much of the film\". The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to \"communicate the subtleties of the human face\" and \"[capture the] thought that occurs to him\" which gets \"through [to] the eyes, which are the last human element in the Beast.\" The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with [[computer animation|CGI animation]].<ref name=\"Penske Business Media\"/>\n\nBefore the release of the film, Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the \"Days of the Sun\" number, due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones, who looked similar to [[Hattie Morahan]], who portrayed Agathe. In the original version of the scene, it was Jones's character, the Prince's mother, who sings the first verse of the song, with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and [[Henry Garrett (actor)|Henry Garrett]] playing his father; but in the reshot version of the scene, the singing part is given to the Prince (now played by Adam Mitchell). The King was also recast to Tom Turner, although Harriet Jones was still the Queen, albeit with dark hair.

In [[Bill Condon]]'s opinion, that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live-action version of the movie. \"That score had more to reveal\", he says, \"You look at the songs and there's not a clunker in the group. In fact, [[Frank Rich]] described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991. The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairy-tales. Take that vision, put it into a new medium, make it a radical reinvention, something not just for the stage because it's not just being literal, now other elements come into play.

The content was variable: most focused on recording the ownership of estates and the descent of lordships of [[manor]]s, thus the genealogies of county families, heraldry and other antiquarian material; In the introduction to one typical early work of this style, ''The Antiquities of Warwickshire'' published in 1656, the author [[William Dugdale]] writes:<ref>https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/n7/mode/2up</ref></br>\n:''I offer unto you my noble countriemen, as the most proper persons to whom it can be presented wherein you will see very much of your worthy ancestors, to whose memory I have erected it as a monumentall pillar and to shew in what honour they lived in those flourishing ages past. In this kind, or not much different, have divers persons in forrein parts very learnedly written; some whereof I have noted in my preface: and I could wish that there were more that would adventure in the like manner for the rest of the counties of this nation, considering how acceptable those are, which others have already performed''.</br>\nThus his work was designed primarily to be read by his fellow county gentry of Warwickshire, whose public lives and marriages were largely confined within their own county of residence, which they administered as Justices of the Peace and Sheriffs, and represented in Parliament. The genealogical and heraldic tradition continues with the series of [[Victoria County History|Victoria County Histories]] commenced in the late 19th century. \n\nOther forms recorded [[archaeological site]]s. A closely related genre, which emerged in the second half of the 17th century, was the county \"Natural History\", which focused on the county's flora, fauna and natural phenomena, but which also often included chapters on antiquities. The best known examples were [[Robert Plot]]'s two volumes on Oxfordshire (1677) and Staffordshire (1686); and [[John Aubrey]]'s unpublished work on Wiltshire.\n\n==Development==\n===Continental models===\nDugdale quotes as his foreign models C\u00e9sar de Nostredame (1553-1629), historian of [[Provence]] in France, author of ''Rerum antiquarum et nobiliorum Provinciae'', written c.1560, published 1615; Ottavio Rossi, historian of [[Brescia]] in Italy, author of ''Memorie Bresciane, Opera Historica, E Simbolica'' (1626);  Guillaume Catel (1560-1626), historian of [[Languedoc]] in France, author of ''M\u00e9moires sur l'histoire du Languedoc'' (1633); [[Samuel Guichenon]] (1607-1664), historian of Bresse in France, author of  ''Histoire de la [[Bresse]] et du [[Bugey]]'' (1650) and [[Antonius Sanderus]] (1586-1664), historian of Flanders, author of ''Flandria Illustrata'' (1641).\n\n===English pioneers===\n[[William Lambarde]]'s ''Perambulation of [[Kent]]'' (completed 1570; published 1576) is generally acknowledged as the first example of the genre in England. It was followed by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew's]] ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602), and [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton's]] ''Description of Leicester Shire'' (1622), as well as a number of other projects (such as those of [[Sir William Pole]], [[Thomas Westcote]], and [[Tristram Risdon]] in Devon, and [[Sampson Erdeswicke]] in Staffordshire) which, although they sometimes circulated in manuscript, did not come to completion or publication. Following the appearance of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century [[John Bowyer Nichols]] followed the line of a history of [[Leicestershire]] compiled by his father [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nichols, John Bowyer}}</ref> The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: \"Antiquities of\", \"Worthies of\", \"Geological survey\", \"Description of\", later \"Directory of\", all could indicate the intention of producing a \"history\", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today. [[Chorography]], [[topography]] and [[toponymy]] might all be involved. Materials and collections for their counties were made by antiquaries, but publication might await sponsorship or enough subscriptions, as well as a capable author who would make a readable book, perhaps of multiple volumes, from notes.\n\n==Listing by county==\n\n===Bedfordshire===\nSee: [[History of Bedfordshire]]; [[:Category: History of Bedfordshire]];\n\n*''[[Magna Britannia]]'' (1806)\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/catalogue.aspx?gid=1&type=1 ''Victoria County History''] three volumes, 1904\u20131912\n\n===Berkshire===\n*[[Elias Ashmole]], ''Antiquities of Berkshire'' (1719)\n* J.

The content was variable: most focused on recording the ownership of estates and the descent of lordships of [[manor]]s, thus the genealogies of county families, heraldry and other antiquarian material; In the introduction to one typical early work of this style, ''The Antiquities of Warwickshire'' published in 1656, the author [[William Dugdale]] writes:<ref>https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesofwar00dugd/page/n7/mode/2up</ref></br>\n:''I offer unto you my noble countriemen, as the most proper persons to whom it can be presented wherein you will see very much of your worthy ancestors, to whose memory I have erected it as a monumentall pillar and to shew in what honour they lived in those flourishing ages past. In this kind, or not much different, have divers persons in forrein parts very learnedly written; some whereof I have noted in my preface: and I could wish that there were more that would adventure in the like manner for the rest of the counties of this nation, considering how acceptable those are, which others have already performed''.</br>\nThus his work was designed primarily to be read by his fellow county gentry of Warwickshire, whose public lives and marriages were largely confined within their own county of residence, which they administered as Justices of the Peace and Sheriffs, and represented in Parliament. The genealogical and heraldic tradition continues with the series of [[Victoria County History|Victoria County Histories]] commenced in the late 19th century. \n\nOther forms recorded [[archaeological site]]s. A closely related genre, which emerged in the second half of the 17th century, was the county \"Natural History\", which focused on the county's flora, fauna and natural phenomena, but which also often included chapters on antiquities. The best known examples were [[Robert Plot]]'s two volumes on Oxfordshire (1677) and Staffordshire (1686); and [[John Aubrey]]'s unpublished work on Wiltshire.\n\n==Development==\n===Continental models===\nDugdale quotes as his foreign models C\u00e9sar de Nostredame (1553-1629), historian of [[Provence]] in France, author of ''Rerum antiquarum et nobiliorum Provinciae'', written c.1560, published 1615; Ottavio Rossi, historan of [[Brescia]] in Italy, author of ''Memorie Bresciane, Opera Historica, E Simbolica'' (1626);  Guillaume Catel (1560-1626), historian of [[Languedoc]] in France, author of ''M\u00e9moires sur l'histoire du Languedoc'' (1633); [[Samuel Guichenon]] (1607-1664), historian of Bresse in France, author of  ''Histoire de la [[Bresse]] et du [[Bugey]]'' (1650) and [[Antonius Sanderus]] (1586-1664), historian of Flanders, author of ''Flandria Illustrata'' (1641). \n\n===English pioneers===\n[[William Lambarde]]'s ''Perambulation of [[Kent]]'' (completed 1570; published 1576) is generally acknowledged as the first example of the genre in England. It was followed by [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew's]] ''Survey of Cornwall'' (1602), and [[William Burton (antiquary, died 1645)|William Burton's]] ''Description of Leicester Shire'' (1622), as well as a number of other projects (such as those of [[Sir William Pole]], [[Thomas Westcote]], and [[Tristram Risdon]] in Devon, and [[Sampson Erdeswicke]] in Staffordshire) which, although they sometimes circulated in manuscript, did not come to completion or publication. Following the appearance of [[William Dugdale]]'s ''Antiquities of Warwickshire'' (1656), a pattern was set. In the nineteenth century [[John Bowyer Nichols]] followed the line of a history of [[Leicestershire]] compiled by his father [[John Nichols (printer)|John Nichols]], and saw numerous counties histories through the press at his printing firm.<ref>{{cite DNB|wstitle=Nichols, John Bowyer}}</ref> The scope of county histories varied, but the titles became quite standard: \"Antiquities of\", \"Worthies of\", \"Geological survey\", \"Description of\", later \"Directory of\", all could indicate the intention of producing a \"history\", a term that only in later times acquired the narrower meaning it carries today. [[Chorography]], [[topography]] and [[toponymy]] might all be involved. Materials and collections for their counties were made by antiquaries, but publication might await sponsorship or enough subscriptions, as well as a capable author who would make a readable book, perhaps of multiple volumes, from notes.\n\n==Listing by county==\n\n===Bedfordshire===\nSee: [[History of Bedfordshire]]; [[:Category: History of Bedfordshire]];\n\n*''[[Magna Britannia]]'' (1806)\n*[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/catalogue.aspx?gid=1&type=1 ''Victoria County History''] three volumes, 1904\u20131912\n\n===Berkshire===\n*[[Elias Ashmole]], ''Antiquities of Berkshire'' (1719)\n* J.

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes.

The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in intentional gender discrimination in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=238}}</ref> This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game.<ref name=\"Greenburg_1997\" /> In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the \"three-part test\".\n\n# Providing athletic participation opportunities that are substantially proportionate to the student enrollment. This prong of the test is satisfied when participation opportunities for men and women are \"substantially proportionate\" to their respective undergraduate enrollment.\n# Demonstrating a continual expansion of athletic opportunities for the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution has a history and continuing practice of program expansion that is responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex (typically female).\n# Accommodating the interest and ability of the underrepresented sex. This prong of the test is satisfied when an institution is meeting the interests and abilities of its female students even where there are disproportionately fewer females than males participating in sports.\n\n====== Room for improvement ======\nAlthough schools only have to be compliant with one of the three prongs, a 1999 study by Sigelman and Wahlbeck found that many schools are \"nowhere near compliance\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sigelman|first=Lee|last2=Wahlbeck|first2=Paul|date=1999|title=Gender Proportionality in Intercollegiate Athletics: The Mathematics of Title IX Compliance|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=80|issue=3|pages=518\u2013538|jstor=42863927}}</ref> Many schools attempt to achieve compliance through the first prong; however, in order to achieve that compliance schools cut men's programs, which is not the way the OCR wanted compliance achieved.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irons|first=Alicia|date=Spring 2006|title=The Economic Inefficiency of Title IX|url=http://business.uni.edu/economics/Themes/irons.pdf|journal=Major Themes in Economics|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref> Equity is not the only way to be compliant with Title IX; athletic departments need to show that they are making efforts to achieve parity in participation, treatment, and athletic financial assistance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacwaa.org/advocacy/title-ix/information|title=Title IX Information|access-date=April 17, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to research done by National Women's Law Center in 2011, 4500 public high schools across the nation have extremely high gender inequality and are violating the Title IX laws.<ref name=\"auto\">Wong, A.

There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous.

In 2016, Al Jazeera published an article bringing the discrimination that female Swedish athletes face to light by mentioning the double standard put on female athletes in terms of having to work double and still not receive the recognition or pay of the men's teams. Sweden is recognized as being a feminist country, however the wage gap is significant between male and female athletes. In 2013, Swedish striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned  $16.7 million a year playing for Paris Saint-German, whereas Lotta Schellin who played for Lyon in France only earned $239,720. The wage gap is also evident among coaches. The difference in pay is evident in how male athletes and female athletes are able to spend their time between games. Women often have to work between training and games to make a living and to pay for their training camps, whereas men have that time to recuperate and relax; men also don't pay to attend training camps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/swedish-female-athletes-face-discrimination-160315110758946.html|title=Swedish female athletes face discrimination &#124; Europe &#124; al Jazeera}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2019, the [[Sweden women's national ice hockey team|Swedish women's national ice hockey team]] boycotted the team's training camp and the Five Nations Tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/08/16/swedish-womens-hockey-players-boycott-over-pay-dispute/|title=Swedish women's hockey players boycott over pay dispute|last1=Dure|first1=Beau|date=2019-08-16|website=NBC Sports|accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref> In a movement they called #F\u00f6rFramtiden (in English, \"For the Future\"), all 43 players invited to camp cited lack of equal pay as well as various instances of poor treatment by [[Swedish Ice Hockey Association|Svenska Ishockeyf\u00f6rbundet]] (the Swedish Ice Hockey Association, or SIF) toward the national team, including, but not limited to:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theicegarden.com/2019/8/18/20805729/for-the-future-how-team-sweden-reached-their-limit-damkronorna-sdhl|title=For the future: How Team Sweden reached their limit|last1=Foster|first1=Meredith|date=2019-08-18|website=The Ice Garden|accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n* Team travel conditions - traveling by ferry instead of by plane to games; arriving to games one day before a tournament began, without accounting for time differences and jet lag\n* Team uniforms - players are provided men's clothing by SIF, not women's clothing\n* Nutrition - players are provided expired products\n* Lack of development - players allege that SIF has not adequately created a program to foster development of women's hockey at the youth level\n\nThe [[4 Nations Cup|Four Nations Cup]], originally scheduled for November 2019, was canceled by SIF due to the players' dispute with the federation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/09/13/four-nations-cup-cancelled-amid-team-swedens-equality-battle/|title=Women's Four Nations Cup cancelled amid Team Sweden's equality battle|last1=Ingemi|first1=Marisa|date=2019-09-13|website=The Boston Herald|accessdate=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the boycott, it was announced in October 2019 that the players had reached a new agreement with the federation,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.swehockey.se/Nyheter/nyheterfransvenskaishockeyforbundet/2019/Oktober2016/damkronornaklaraforspel/|title=The Crowns are Ready for Play|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2019|website=Svenska Ishockeyf\u00f6rbundet|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> and that the team will begin training in November 2019 and play in a tournament against [[Switzerland women's national ice hockey team|Switzerland]], [[Finland women's national ice hockey team|Finland]], and [[Germany women's national ice hockey team|Germany]] in December 2019.

Substantial research indicates that women's sports and female athletes gain only a small fraction of sports media coverage worldwide. Research that has examined why this is the case suggested this can be attributed to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the male-dominated sports newsroom, ingrained assumptions about readership, and the systematic, repetitive nature of sports news.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sherwood|first=Merryn|last2=Osborne|first2=Angela|last3=Nicholson|first3=Matthew|last4=Sherry|first4=Emma|date=December 2017|title=Newswork, News Values, and Audience Considerations: Factors That Facilitate Media Coverage of Women's Sports|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=647\u2013668|doi=10.1177/2167479516645535|issn=2167-4795}}</ref> In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.<ref>{{cite web |title=When it comes to women in sports, TV news tunes out |url=https://news.usc.edu/82382/when-it-comes-to-women-in-sports-tv-news-tunes-out/}}</ref> Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories.

It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.\n\nWhen researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.<ref>\"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports.\" LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web.

In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers.

In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories.

Despite this jump in viewership of women's soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women's professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men's league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women's Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women's sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men's sports (or approximately 11\u00bd hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women's sports. SportsCenter's numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men's sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women's sports (approximately 17 min).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|last2=Messner|first2=Michael A.|last3=Musto|first3=Michela|date=September 2015|title=\"It's Dude Time!\": A Quarter Century of Excluding Women's Sports in Televised News and Highlight Shows|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=261\u2013287|doi=10.1177/2167479515588761|issn=2167-4795}}</ref>\n\nA recent article from the Wall Street Journal states \u201cfrom 2016 to 2018, women's games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer's audited financial statements<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Rachel |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Games Outearned Men's Games |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600. |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\u201d (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women's sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women's soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women's soccer displayed most recently within the Women's FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The U.S. Women's National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women's sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue. \n\nAmy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. \"Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.\" She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. \"The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership.

Amateur competitions became the primary venue for women's sports. Throughout the mid-twentieth century, Communist countries dominated many [[Olympic sports]], including women's sports, due to state-sponsored athletic programs that were technically regarded as amateur.  The legacy of these programs endured, as former Communist countries continue to produce many of the top female athletes. Germany and Scandinavia also developed strong women's athletic programs in this period.\n<gallery caption=\"Women's sports in history\">\nFile:Bronze figure of a running girl, Greek, about 520-500 BC, Found at Prizren, Serbia, Winning at the ancient Games, British Museum (7667206370).jpg|A [[Spartan]] woman running.

There were also regional differences, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine \"girls rule\" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls' and women's sport have traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: both historically have low levels of interest and participation.  There were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics and not many female coaches.  The media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines with the male sports establishment actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports and thought of them as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the common notion that women's bodies were restricted and delicate and that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the \"new women\" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage. The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen.<ref>M.

Before Title IX, women coached 90% of women's teams; in 1978 that percentage dropped to 58, and in 2004 it dropped even more to 44 percent.<ref name=\"coakley255\">{{cite book|title=Sports in Society|last=Coakley|first=Jay|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2007|location=New York|page=255}}</ref> In 1972, women administered 90 percent of women's athletic programs, and in 2004 this fell to 19 percent.

This pay discrepancy exists despite the fact that the women's team has been much more successful in international competitions; the women's team has won four Olympic gold medals and three of the last five Women's World Cups, while the men's team has never won either of these competitions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/sports/soccer/uswnt-us-women-carli-lloyd-alex-morgan-hope-solo-complain.html?_r=0|title=Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination|author=Andrew Das|date=2016-03-31|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2016-04-02}}</ref>\n\n===World conferences===\n\nIn 1994, the International Working Group on Women and Sport organized the first World Conference on Women and Sport in Brighton, United Kingdom, where the Brighton Declaration was published.

Substantial research indicates that women's sports and female athletes gain only a small fraction of sports media coverage worldwide. Research that has examined why this is the case suggested this can be attributed to three particular factors that govern sports newswork: the male-dominated sports newsroom, ingrained assumptions about readership, and the systematic, repetitive nature of sports news.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sherwood|first=Merryn|last2=Osborne|first2=Angela|last3=Nicholson|first3=Matthew|last4=Sherry|first4=Emma|date=December 2017|title=Newswork, News Values, and Audience Considerations: Factors That Facilitate Media Coverage of Women's Sports|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=5|issue=6|pages=647\u2013668|doi=10.1177/2167479516645535|issn=2167-4795}}</ref> In 1989, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular sports commentary shows.<ref>{{cite web |title=When it comes to women in sports, TV news tunes out |url=https://news.usc.edu/82382/when-it-comes-to-women-in-sports-tv-news-tunes-out/}}</ref> Michael Messner and his team in 2010 analyzed three different two-week periods by recording the amount of time that the stories were on air and the content of the stories.

In the late 1900s Women's Sports started to gain popularity in the media because of their talent in the Olympics.<ref>{{cite journal |title=An Imperceptible Difference: Visual and Textual Constructions of Femininity in Sport Illustrated and Sports Illustrated for Women |url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&sid=b1aa5c2a-a43c-40c6-97e5-7d193c12cfdd%40sdc-v-sessmgr01}}</ref> In 1999, women's sports coverage reached an all-time high when it was recorded at 8.7%. It maintained its higher percentages until it reached an all-time low in 2009, decreasing to 1.6%. The researchers also measured the amount of time that women's sports were reported in the [[news ticker]], the strip that displays information at the bottom of most news broadcasts. When recorded in 2009, 5% of ticker coverage was based on women's sports, compared to the 95% that was based on men's sports. These percentages were recorded in order to compare the amount of media coverage for each gender.\n\nWhen researching the actual amount of time that women's sports stories were mentioned, they focused specifically on differences between the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]]. They recorded two different time periods: when they were in season and when they were off-season. The WNBA had 8 stories, totaling 5:31 minutes, during their season, which was less than the NBA, which had a total of 72 stories, totaling approximately 65:51 minutes. During the off-season, the WNBA did not receive any stories or time on the ticker, while the NBA received a total of 81, which were approximately 50:15 minutes. When compared, the WNBA had a total of 8 stories and 5:31 minutes while the NBA had 153 stories and 1:56:06 hours. The actual games had several differences in the way the games were presented. The findings were that WNBA games had lower sound quality, more editing mistakes, fewer views of the shot clock and fewer camera angles. There was less verbal commentary and visual statistics about the players throughout the games as well.<ref>\"Gender Stereotyping in Televised Sports.\" LA 48 Foundation. June 2010. Web. November 2014. http://www.la84.org/gender-stereotyping-in-televised-sports/</ref> The quality of the stories has also significantly changed. In past studies, women were sexualized, portrayed as violent, or portrayed as girlfriends, wives and mothers. Female athletes were often included in gag stories that involved sexual dialogue or emphasized their bodies. In Australia, the wives of the men's cricket team members were given more media coverage than the players on the women's cricket team, who also had won more games than the men's rugby team.<ref>Holmes, Tracy. \"After Homophobia Let's Tackle Prejudice Against Women's Sports.\" ABC.

In 1990, a study was conducted that recorded and compared the amount of media coverage of men and women's sports on popular newspapers. They analyzed four different sports magazines for three months and recorded the number of women's sports stories that were featured and the content of the stories. Women's sports made up 3.5%, compared to the 81% of men's coverage.

Despite this jump in viewership of women's soccer in the U.S., television broadcasting of the women's professional soccer league in the U.S. remained much lower than that of the men's league. Fox Sports Network (the company that owns the rights to broadcast the National Women's Soccer League) broadcast 3 regular season NWSL games and 34 Major League Soccer regular-season games during the 2016 seasons. The dearth of coverage of women's sports is evidenced by the low number of segments (i.e., stories) in our sample. Of the 934 local network affiliate news segments (over 12 hr of broadcasts), 880 were on men's sports (or approximately 11\u00bd hr), 22 segments (or nearly 18 min) were on gender-neutral sports (e.g., a horse race, coverage of the Los Angeles [LA] marathon, and a recreational sports event), and only 32 segments (about 23 min) featured women's sports. SportsCenter's numbers were similar. Of the 405 total SportsCenter segments in our sample (nearly 14 hr), 376 covered men's sports (slightly over 13 hr), 16 segments were on gender-neutral sports (just over 20 min), and only 13 segments featured women's sports (approximately 17 min).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cooky|first=Cheryl|last2=Messner|first2=Michael A.|last3=Musto|first3=Michela|date=September 2015|title=\"It's Dude Time!\": A Quarter Century of Excluding Women's Sports in Televised News and Highlight Shows|journal=Communication & Sport|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=261\u2013287|doi=10.1177/2167479515588761|issn=2167-4795}}</ref>\n\nA recent article from the Wall Street Journal states \u201cfrom 2016 to 2018, women's games generated about $50.8 million in revenue compared with $49.9 million for the men, according to U.S. soccer's audited financial statements<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bachman |first1=Rachel |title=U.S. Women's Soccer Games Outearned Men's Games |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-womens-soccer-games-out-earned-mens-games-11560765600. |website=Wall Street Journal |publisher=Dow Jones & Company |accessdate=17 June 2019}}</ref>\u201d (Bachman, 2019). These numbers contrasts the idea that women's sports are not entertaining enough for the viewer or typical fan by $1.9 million. This idea stems from the male dominated sports perspective, which constantly undermines the perception of quality, effort, and potential that women's soccer exhibits. However, we can see through the caliber of women's soccer displayed most recently within the Women's FIFA World Cup of 2019 that it was on par if not better than the level of play of their male counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} The U.S. Women's National Team scored 13 goals against Thailand in their opening match, the most goals scored in any World Cup match in history. Media outlets though may remain concerned that increased coverage of women's sport will lead to a reduction in audience draw and advertising revenue. \n\nAmy Godoy-Pressland conducted a study that investigated the relationship between sports reporting and gender in Great Britain. She studied Great Britain's newspapers from January 2008 to December 2009 and documented how media coverage of men's sports and women's sports was fairly equal during the Olympics and then altered after the Olympics were over. \"Sportswomen are disproportionately under-represented and the sheer quantity and quality of news items on sportsmen demonstrates how male athletes are represented as dominant and superior to females.\" She also documented how women's bodies were sexualized in photographs and written coverage, noting that the women featured were either nude, semi-nude, or wearing revealing clothing. \"The sexualization of sportswomen in Sunday reporting is commonplace and aimed at the mostly male readership. It promotes the idea of female aesthetics over achievements, while the coverage of women not directly involved in sport misrepresents the place of women in sport and inferiorizes real sportswomen's achievements.\"<ref>\"Women underrepresented, sexualized in weekend sports reporting\" ''Science Daily''.

Traditional media has also improved its coverage of women's sports through more exposure time and using better equipment to record the events. Recent research has shown that in the past twenty years, camera angles, slow motion replays, quality and graphics regarding the presentation of women sports has gradually improved.<ref name=\"Cooky, C. 2012\">Cooky, C., & Lavoi, N.

Built in Scotland, the submarine was the last of the class to enter service when commissioned into the RAN in 1978. ''Otama'' was a specialist, one of two \"Mystery Boats\", fitted with additional surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment.<ref name=AFRmag>Barker, ''The Mystery Boats''</ref> ''Otama'' was routinely deployed on classified operations to obtain intelligence on [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]] vessels and [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]] vessels, and conducted associated coastal surveillance, throughout Asia.<ref name=AFRmag/>\n\nThe submarine was part of the RAN's largest [[flag-showing cruise]] in the Indian Ocean during 1980. From 1983 to 1985, she underwent an extensive upgrade. On Monday 3 August 1987\n, two submariners died when ''Otama'' submerged while they were still working in the [[Sail (submarine)|fin]]. ''Otama'' remained in service until late 2000; a delay from her original planned decommissioning date to help attenuate the problems with the replacement {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|1}}s.\n\n''Otama'' was sold to the Western Port Oberon Association in 2001, which planned to preserve her as a [[museum vessel]] as part of the proposed [[Victorian Maritime Centre]]. Submissions to build the [[maritime museum]] at various locations on the [[Mornington Peninsula]] were repeatedly rebuffed. In late 2008, the submarine was listed for sale on [[eBay]], but despite several expressions of interest, ''Otama'' was not sold. In-principle approval to build the Victorian Maritime Centre on [[reclaimed land]] adjacent to the Western Port Marina at [[Hastings, Victoria|Hastings]] was granted in 2013, but as of 2016, planning permits have not been approved.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{main|Oberon-class submarine}}\nThe ''Oberon'' class was based heavily on the preceding [[British Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise'' class]] of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels' hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities.<ref name=compedium>Chant, ''A Compedium of Armaments and Military Hardware'', pp. 167\u20138</ref> Eight submarines were ordered for the RAN, in two batches of four.<ref name=Cooper188>Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 188</ref> The first batch was approved in 1963, and the second batch (including ''Otama'') was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]].<ref name=Cooper194>Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 194</ref><ref>Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 394-5</ref> This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|submarine branch]].<ref name=OxCom399>Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military history'', p. 399</ref>\n\nThe submarine was {{convert|295.2|ft|m|1}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|26.5|ft|m|1}}, and a [[Draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|m|1}} when surfaced.<ref name=Janes96/> At full load [[Displacement (nautical)|displacement]], she displaced 2,030&nbsp;tons when surfaced, and 2,410&nbsp;tons when submerged.<ref name=Janes96/> The two propeller shafts were each driven by an English Electric motor providing {{convert|3,500|bhp|lk=in|0}} and {{convert|4,500|shp|lk=in|0}}; the electricity for these was generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators.<ref name=Shaw15>Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 15</ref> The submarine could travel at up to {{convert|12|kn|lk=in|0}} on the surface, and up to {{convert|17|kn|0}} when submerged, had a maximum range of {{convert|9000|nmi|lk=in|0}} at {{convert|12|kn|0}}, and a [[test depth]] of {{convert|200|m|ft|0}} below sea level.<ref name=Janes96/><ref name=Shaw15/> When [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]], the boat had a [[Ship's company|company]] of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]], the number of sailors had increased to 60.<ref name=Janes96/><ref name=Shaw15/> In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.<ref name=Shaw15/>\n\nThe main armament of the ''Oberon''s consisted of six {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=compedium/> The [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark VIII|British Mark 8 torpedo]] was initially carried by the submarine; this was later replaced by the [[Wire-guided torpedo|wire-guided]] [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark 23 Grog|Mark 23]].<ref name=Shaw21>Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 21</ref> After a multi-year refit ending in 1985, ''Otama'' was upgraded to carry United States Navy [[Mark 48 torpedo]]es and [[Boeing Harpoon|UGM-84 Sub Harpoon]] [[anti-ship missile]]s; the last Australian ''Oberon'' to undergo the Submarine Weapon Update Program.<ref name=OxCom399/><ref name=Sharpe22/><ref name=Owen32>Owen, in Mitchell, ''Australian Maritime Issues 2010'', p. 32</ref> As of 1996, the standard payload of an Australian ''Oberon'' was a mix of 20 Mark 48 Mod 4 torpedoes and Sub Harpoon missiles.<ref name=Janes96/> Some or all of the torpedo payload could be replaced by [[Stonefish (mine)|Mark 5 Stonefish]] [[Naval mine|sea mines]], which were deployed through the torpedo tubes.<ref name=Janes96>Sharpe (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships, 1996\u20131997'', p. 23</ref><ref name=Shaw21/> On entering service, two stern-mounted, short-length {{convert|21|in|cm|adj=on|0}} torpedo tubes for Mark 20 anti-submarine torpedoes.<ref name=Shaw19/> However, the development of steerable wire-guided torpedoes made the less-capable aft-firing torpedoes redundant; they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.<ref name=Shaw19>Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 19</ref>\n\n''Otama'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] at [[Greenock, Scotland]] on 25 May 1973, launched on 3 December 1975, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the RAN on 27 April 1978.<ref name=Sharpe22>Sharped (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships 1992\u201393'', p. 22</ref> The submarine was due to enter service in 1976, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in ''Otama'' and [[Sister ship|sister boat]] {{HMAS|Orion||2}}; stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine's construction by two years.<ref name=Owen31>Owen, in Mitchell, ''Australian Maritime Issues 2010'', p. 31</ref> The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with [[Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System|Micropuffs]] rangefinding [[sonar]] during construction that the earlier built boats were due to receive as an upgrade.<ref name=Owen32.3>Owen, in Mitchell, ''Australian Maritime Issues 2010'', p. 32-3</ref>\n\n''Otama'' was the sixth and final ''Oberon''-class submarine to enter service with the RAN.<ref>Stevens, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', opp. p. 32</ref> The boat's name comes from a North Queensland [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning \"dolphin\"; this was a break in RAN tradition, which had used the names of explorers and pioneers for previous submarines.<ref>Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 394</ref><ref name=DeptDefPR/> ''Otama'' was assigned the [[pennant number]] 62.<ref>Gillett, ''Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946'', p. 77</ref> The high standard of internal fittings compared to the rest of the class led to the \"[[Gucci]] Boat\" nickname.<ref name=SealBlake83>Seal & Blake, ''Century of Silent Service'', p. 83</ref>\n\n''Otama'' received a special electronic surveillance fit after ''Orion'' had been fitted with this during construction.<ref name=\"Owen32.3\"/><ref name=AFRmag/>\n\n==Operational history==\nAfter a delivery voyage via ports in Denmark, [[Florida]], and Mexico, ''Otama'' arrived at {{HMAS|Platypus|naval base|6}} in [[Sydney]] on 15 December 1979.<ref>''H.M.A.S. OTAMA COMES HOME Manufacturing strengthens'', in ''The Canberra Times''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], ''Otama'' and ''Orion'' regularly deployed on surveillance and spying operations using their specialist intelligence-gathering equipment, earning them the nickname \"Mystery Boats\".<ref name=AFRmag/><ref name=RSLnsw>''Cat and Mouse'', Reveille \u2013 The Voice of New South Wales Serving and Ex-Service Men and Women</ref><ref name=WkAust>Barker, ''Cold War exploits of Australia's secret submarines''</ref><ref name=Owens103.5>Owens, in ''Centenary of Australian Submarines'', pp. 103-5</ref> These activities starting in 1978 were part of the broader Western nations' intelligence-gathering apparatus, and included surveillance off the coasts of Vietnam, China, India and Indonesia. Obtaining intelligence on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Chinese made vessels in operations in the Indian Ocean and South China Sea.<ref name=AFRmag/><ref name=RSLnsw/><ref name=WkAust/> Observation off the Soviet base at [[Vladivostok]].<ref name=Owens103.5/> These activities continued until 1992 after an incident with ''Orion'', and most of ''Otama''{{'}}s activities and deployments during this period remain classified.<ref name=Owens103.5/><ref name=AFRmag/><ref name=RSLnsw/><ref name=WkAust/>\n\nIn April 1980, ''Otama'' and the [[destroyer]] {{HMAS|Hobart|D 39|2}} were sent to [[Fiji]] as part of Australia's response to [[1979\u201380 South Pacific cyclone season#Tropical Cyclone Wally|Tropical Cyclone Wally]].<ref>''CYCLONE DAMAGE Fiji's PM appeals to nation for help'', in ''The Canberra Times''</ref> On 8 September 1980, ''Otama'' joined five other RAN vessels to form the Australia Squadron.<ref name=Lind297>Lind, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 297</ref> The Squadron, which included HMA Ships {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|2}}, {{HMAS|Perth|D 38|2}}, {{HMAS|Derwent|DE 49|2}}, {{HMAS|Stalwart|D 215|2}}, and {{HMAS|Supply||2}} spent two months in the Indian Ocean as part of a flag-showing cruise; the largest RAN deployment since World War II.<ref name=SealBlake83/><ref name=Lind297/>\n\nIn July 1983, ''Otama'' was docked for modernisation.<ref name=Gillett76>Gillett, ''Australian and New Zealand Warships since 1946'', p. 76</ref> The Submarine Weapon Update Program refit lasted until 1985.<ref name=Gillett76/>\n\n[[File:Oberon class submarines commemorative plaque, Rockingham Naval Memorial Park, September 2019 01.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative plaque at [[Rockingham Naval Memorial Park]] for the three sailors killed on board of Australian ''Oberon''s]]\nOn 3 August 1987, two sailors were killed aboard ''Otama''. At 09:00, the submarine left HMAS ''Platypus'' to test a new towed [[hydrophone]] array.<ref name=Waller6>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', p. 6</ref> Extreme weather forced the cancellation of the test, and two sailors were sent into the [[Sail (submarine)|fin]] at around 10:20 to retrieve and stow the array.<ref name=Waller6/> At 10:35, the submarine was prepared for diving, and she submerged four minutes later, with the two men still in the fin.<ref name=Waller6/> The submariners, on noticing their vessel diving underneath them, climbed up the fin to the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and opened the [[voicepipe]] in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the control room before being washed overboard.<ref name=Waller7/> Their absence was not noticed until around 11:00, despite post-dive checks and a rotation of duty stations in the interim, and was not confirmed for at least another half-hour.<ref name=Waller6/> A search for the submariners was conducted, and one of the bodies was spotted, but could not be recovered.<ref name=Waller7>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', p. 7</ref> Estimated survival time in the prevailing conditions was only five minutes, and the submariners were not required to wear [[lifejacket|lifebelts]].<ref name=Waller7/> A naval board of inquiry recommended that action be taken against two officers, although the Navy Office did not take action, as there were multiple factors leading into the incident, and [[Courts martial|court martialing]] the two officers could find one or both held solely responsible for the deaths.<ref name=Waller3.4>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> In addition to the rejection of the board's findings, several officers involved in the incident (including the two singled out by the inquiry), were promoted.<ref name=Waller10>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', p. 10</ref> A [[coronial inquiry]] followed (one of the first heard by the new office of the [[State Coroner of New South Wales]]), to which there was some opposition by the RAN, including advising personnel not to cooperate with the task force gathering evidence for the inquiry, and attempting to fend off a request by the coroner for a trip on the submarine replicating the events of the day.<ref name=Waller3.4/> Following two separate weeks of hearings in October and November 1988, the state coroner concluded that the incident was the sum of multiple moderate-to-minor breaches of operating procedure and careless negligence (including that notices indicating personnel were outside the submarine were not posted, and key personnel were not informed) aboard a submarine operating in non-standard conditions (such as the testing of new equipment, along with observers and trainees aboard, and a high rotation of personnel between stations in a short period of time).<ref>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 5-10</ref> The coroner singled out ''Otama''{{'}}s commanding officer for allowing so many rules and procedures to be ignored under his command, but did not find sufficient cause to recommend charges against any individual.<ref>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 8-9</ref> Several changes were made to casing operational procedures at sea, including making lifebelts compulsory and requiring the senior petty officer on duty to sign out and sign back in personnel working outside.<ref>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 7, 10</ref> The fatalities aboard ''Otama'' were two of the only three deaths aboard Australian ''Oberon''s.<ref>Owen, in ''Centenary of Australian Submarines'', p. 105</ref>\n\nFrom 1996, ''Otama'' was given approval to conduct coastal surveillance operations using its specialist intelligence-gathering equipment on Indonesia in particular to obtain information on East Timor.<ref name=WkAust/>\n\nAt the end of March 1999, ''Otama'' was reassigned to {{HMAS|Stirling||6}} in Western Australia, where the {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|2}}s were operating.<ref name=Owens103.4>Owens, in ''Centenary of Australian Submarines'', pp. 103-4</ref><ref name=DTbehind>''Subs leave harbour behind'', The Daily Telegraph, p. 4</ref> Within days of leaving Sydney, sister boat {{HMAS|Onslow||2}} was [[paid off]], leaving ''Otama'' the only one of her class in service, and the submarine base at HMAS ''Platypus'' was cleared for closure.<ref name=Owens103.4/><ref name=DTbehind/>\n\n==Decommissioning and fate==\n''Otama'' paid off on 15 December 2000: problems with the introduction of the ''Collins''-class submarines kept ''Otama'' and sister boat HMAS ''Onslow'' in service for several years beyond their planned decommissioning date.<ref>Jones, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 276\u20137</ref><ref name=\"YW298.9\"/> In the year leading up to her paying off, the pending decommissioning combined with the findings of the [[McIntosh-Prescott Report]] to cause the \"Fast Track\" program, A$1&nbsp;billion of modifications to make {{HMAS|Dechaineux|SSG 76|2}} and {{HMAS|Sheean|SSG 77|2}} fit for service by the end of the year.<ref name=YW298.9>Yule & Woolner, ''The Collins Class Submarine Story'', pp. 288\u20139</ref> ''Otama'' was the last Australian ''Oberon'' to leave service.<ref>Owen, in ''Centenary of Australian Submarines'', p. 93</ref>\n\nThe submarine was sold in 2001 to the Western Port Oberon Association, a community group intending to preserve her as a [[museum vessel]] and building the [[Victorian Maritime Centre]] in [[Hastings, Victoria]].<ref name=StewartASIO>Stewart, ''ASIO eyes mystery group after attempt to buy

''Otama'' arrived in [[Western Port Bay]] in 2002, where she was moored while waiting for the approval and development of the museum.<ref name=\"CogdonEbay\"/>\n\nBy late 2008, plans for three separate locations for the [[Victorian Maritime Centre]] \u2013 Hastings, [[Crib Point, Victoria|Crib Point]], and [[Stony Point, Victoria|Stony Point]] \u2013 had all been rejected by the [[Department of Sustainability and Environment]].<ref name=StewartASIO/><ref name=CogdonEbay/><ref name=Steward19122008/> As the Western Port Oberon Association could no longer afford to maintain the submarine while waiting for a favourable decision, ''Otama'' was listed on [[eBay]] for sale in November 2008.<ref name=CogdonEbay/><ref name=SealBlake84>Seal & Blake, ''Century of Silent Service'', p. 84</ref><ref name=CliftonEvans>Clifton-Evans, ''Is eBay the answer?''</ref><ref>College & Warlow, ''Ships of the Royal Navy'', p. 291</ref> Although no bids were placed by the time the online auction closed in late December, the association received several expressions of interest: including from the St Kilda Marina, [[City of Frankston|Frankston City Council]], and one purporting to be a tourism operator but believed by the Western Port Oberon Association to be wanting to restore the [[Narco-submarine|submarine for drug smuggling]] (which was referred to the [[Australian Federal

Built in Scotland, the submarine was the last of the class to enter service when commissioned into the RAN in 1978. ''Otama'' was a specialist, one of two \"Mystery Boats\", fitted with additional surveillance and intelligence-gathering equipment.<ref name=AFRmag>Barker, ''The Mystery Boats''</ref> ''Otama'' was routinely deployed on classified operations to obtain intelligence on [[Soviet Pacific Fleet]] vessels and [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Chinese Navy]] vessels, and conducted associated coastal surveillance, throughout Asia.<ref name=AFRmag/>\n\nThe submarine was part of the RAN's largest [[flag-showing cruise]] in the Indian Ocean during 1980. From 1983 to 1985, she underwent an extensive upgrade. On Monday 3 August 1987\n, two submariners died when ''Otama'' submerged while they were still working in the [[Sail (submarine)|fin]]. ''Otama'' remained in service until late 2000; a delay from her original planned decommissioning date to help attenuate the problems with the replacement {{sclass-|Collins|submarine|1}}s.\n\n''Otama'' was sold to the Western Port Oberon Association in 2001, which planned to preserve her as a [[museum vessel]] as part of the proposed [[Victorian Maritime Centre]]. Submissions to build the [[maritime museum]] at various locations on the [[Mornington Peninsula]] were repeatedly rebuffed. In late 2008, the submarine was listed for sale on [[eBay]], but despite several expressions of interest, ''Otama'' was not sold. In-principle approval to build the Victorian Maritime Centre on [[reclaimed land]] adjacent to the Western Port Marina at [[Hastings, Victoria|Hastings]] was granted in 2013, but as of 2016, planning permits have not been approved.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{main|Oberon-class submarine}}\nThe ''Oberon'' class was based heavily on the preceding [[British Porpoise-class submarine|''Porpoise'' class]] of submarines, with changes made to improve the vessels' hull integrity, sensor systems, and stealth capabilities.<ref name=compedium>Chant, ''A Compedium of Armaments and Military Hardware'', pp. 167\u20138</ref> Eight submarines were ordered for the RAN, in two batches of four.<ref name=Cooper188>Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 188</ref> The first batch was approved in 1963, and the second batch (including ''Otama'') was approved during the late 1960s, although two of these were cancelled before construction started in 1969, with the funding redirected to the [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]].<ref name=Cooper194>Cooper, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 194</ref><ref>Bastock, ''Australia's Ships of War'', p. 394-5</ref> This was the fourth time the RAN had attempted to establish a [[Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service|submarine branch]].<ref name=OxCom399>Dennis et al., ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military history'', p. 399</ref>\n\nThe submarine was {{convert|295.2|ft|m|1}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|26.5|ft|m|1}}, and a [[Draught (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|m|1}} when surfaced.<ref name=Janes96/> At full load [[Displacement (nautical)|displacement]], she displaced 2,030&nbsp;tons when surfaced, and 2,410&nbsp;tons when submerged.<ref name=Janes96/> The two propeller shafts were each driven by an English Electric motor providing {{convert|3,500|bhp|lk=in|0}} and {{convert|4,500|shp|lk=in|0}}; the electricity for these was generated by two Admiralty Standard Range supercharged V16 diesel generators.<ref name=Shaw15>Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 15</ref> The submarine could travel at up to {{convert|12|kn|lk=in|0}} on the surface, and up to {{convert|17|kn|0}} when submerged, had a maximum range of {{convert|9000|nmi|lk=in|0}} at {{convert|12|kn|0}}, and a [[test depth]] of {{convert|200|m|ft|0}} below sea level.<ref name=Janes96/><ref name=Shaw15/> When [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]], the boat had a [[Ship's company|company]] of 8 officers and 56 sailors, but by the time she [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]], the number of sailors had increased to 60.<ref name=Janes96/><ref name=Shaw15/> In addition, up to 16 trainees could be carried.<ref name=Shaw15/>\n\nThe main armament of the ''Oberon''s consisted of six {{convert|21|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s.<ref name=compedium/> The [[British 21 inch torpedo#21 inch Mark VIII|British Mark 8 torpedo]] was initially carried by the submarine;

they were closed off, and later removed during a refit.<ref name=Shaw19>Shaw, ''HMAS Onslow'', p. 19</ref>\n\n''Otama'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] by [[Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]] at [[Greenock, Scotland]] on 25 May 1973, launched on 3 December 1975, and [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the RAN on 27 April 1978.<ref name=Sharpe22>Sharped (ed.), ''Jane's Fighting Ships 1992\u201393'', p. 22</ref> The submarine was due to enter service in 1976, but faulty high-power electrical cabling had been installed in ''Otama'' and [[Sister ship|sister boat]] {{HMAS|Orion||2}}; stripping out and replacing the cabling delayed each submarine's construction by two years.<ref name=Owen31>Owen, in Mitchell, ''Australian Maritime Issues 2010'', p. 31</ref> The delay meant that the two boats could be fitted with [[Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility System|Micropuffs]] rangefinding [[sonar]] during construction that the earlier built boats were due to receive as an upgrade.<ref name=Owen32.3>Owen, in Mitchell, ''Australian Maritime Issues 2010'', p. 32-3</ref>\n\n''Otama'' was the sixth and final ''Oberon''-class submarine to enter service with the RAN.<ref>Stevens, in Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', opp. p. 32</ref> The boat's name comes from a North Queensland [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] word meaning \"dolphin\";

At 09:00, the submarine left HMAS ''Platypus'' to test a new towed [[hydrophone]] array.<ref name=Waller6>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', p. 6</ref> Extreme weather forced the cancellation of the test, and two sailors were sent into the [[Sail (submarine)|fin]] at around 10:20 to retrieve and stow the array.<ref name=Waller6/> At 10:35, the submarine was prepared for diving, and she submerged four minutes later, with the two men still in the fin.<ref name=Waller6/> The submariners, on noticing their vessel diving underneath them, climbed up the fin to the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] and opened the [[voicepipe]] in an unsuccessful attempt to contact the control room before being washed overboard.<ref name=Waller7/> Their absence was not noticed until around 11:00, despite post-dive checks and a rotation of duty stations in the interim, and was not confirmed for at least another half-hour.<ref name=Waller6/> A search for the submariners was conducted, and one of the bodies was spotted, but could not be recovered.<ref name=Waller7>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', p. 7</ref> Estimated survival time in the prevailing conditions was only five minutes, and the submariners were not required to wear [[lifejacket|lifebelts]].<ref name=Waller7/> A naval board of inquiry recommended that action be taken against two officers, although the Navy Office did not take action, as there were multiple factors leading into the incident, and [[Courts martial|court martialing]] the two officers could find one or both held solely responsible for the deaths.<ref name=Waller3.4>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> In addition to the rejection of the board's findings, several officers involved in the incident (including the two singled out by the inquiry), were promoted.<ref name=Waller10>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', p. 10</ref> A [[coronial inquiry]] followed (one of the first heard by the new office of the [[State Coroner of New South Wales]]), to which there was some opposition by the RAN, including advising personnel not to cooperate with the task force gathering evidence for the inquiry, and attempting to fend off a request by the coroner for a trip on the submarine replicating the events of the day.<ref name=Waller3.4/> Following two separate weeks of hearings in October and November 1988, the state coroner concluded that the incident was the sum of multiple moderate-to-minor breaches of operating procedure and careless negligence (including that notices indicating personnel were outside the submarine were not posted, and key personnel were not informed) aboard a submarine operating in non-standard conditions (such as the testing of new equipment, along with observers and trainees aboard, and a high rotation of personnel between stations in a short period of time).<ref>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 5-10</ref> The coroner singled out ''Otama''{{'}}s commanding officer for allowing so many rules and procedures to be ignored under his command, but did not find sufficient cause to recommend charges against any individual.<ref>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 8-9</ref> Several changes were made to casing operational procedures at sea, including making lifebelts compulsory and requiring the senior petty officer on duty to sign out and sign back in personnel working outside.<ref>Waller, ''Suddenly Dead'', pp. 7, 10</ref> The

sub''</ref><ref name=CogdonEbay>Cogdon, ''Submarine for sale on internet auction website eBay''</ref> The association beat 32 other tenders for the disposal of ''Otama'', and received a $500,000 \"Centenary of Federation\" grant from the federal government to fund the purchase and relocation.<ref name=DeptDefPR>Nelson, ''Australian Submarine History Lands at Hastings with $500 000 Centenary

''Otama'' arrived in [[Western Port Bay]] in 2002, where she was moored while waiting for the approval and development of the museum.<ref name=\"CogdonEbay\"/>\n\nBy late 2008, plans for three separate locations for the [[Victorian Maritime Centre]] \u2013 Hastings, [[Crib Point, Victoria|Crib Point]], and [[Stony Point, Victoria|Stony Point]] \u2013 had all been rejected by the [[Department of Sustainability and Environment]].<ref name=StewartASIO/><ref name=CogdonEbay/><ref name=Steward19122008/> As the Western Port Oberon Association could no longer afford to maintain the

auction closed in late December, the association received several expressions of interest: including from the St Kilda Marina, [[City of Frankston|Frankston City Council]], and one purporting to be a tourism operator but believed by the Western Port Oberon Association to be wanting to restore the [[Narco-submarine|submarine for drug smuggling]] (which was referred to the [[Australian Federal

''Otama''{{'}}s interior was used to represent a Russian submarine for the short film ''[[Deeper Than Yesterday]]''.<ref name=Bodey/> The 20-minute film won awards at the [[2010 Australian Film

Victorian environmental minister [[Ryan Smith (Australian politician)|Ryan Smith]] in March 2013.<ref name=Hast>Hast, ''Sub ashore in 18 months''</ref> The association submitted plans in June for a {{convert|2.5|ha|adj=on}} site on the seawall of the Western Port Marina at Hastings, to be built on reclaimed land.<ref name=Hast/> The proposed site is on the outer edge of the existing seawall, with ''Otama'' enclosed in a semi-recessed concrete pit designed to support the main internal deck at ground level, located between the seawall and the planned site of the maritime centre.<ref
