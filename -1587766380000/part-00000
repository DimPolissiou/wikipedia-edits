The record is in books \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d and in the book of [[city map]]s on page 129. This map section showing the area called the Excelsior can be found in ''Bancroft's Official Guide Map of City and County of San Francisco''.<ref>Bancroft, A.L. (1881).

The Southern San Francisco area referred to everything south and central along with the eastern bent of Mission Street and District. The neighborhood extends to its end at the county line. Over the years, as the southern end of San Francisco was developed, the city created Major neighborhoods & Districts within the area, and these were given names that appeared on city maps. These are: Bernal Heights, Ingleside, The Excelsior District, Visitacion Valley & The Bay View District. As the city grew, The Excelsior District was developed further, and it was split into even smaller sub-neighborhoods useful for Real Estate. Some of these given names are: the Excelsior neighborhood ''itself'', Mission Terrace, Crocker Amazon, Cayuga and the Outer Mission neighborhood. Despite this division into smaller sub-neighborhoods, most of these areas are still referred to as being the Excelsior District today.\n\nMany of the area's streets, those named for the capitals of countries, and its avenues, those that are named for the countries themselves, were done so by Emanuel Lewis and his daughter Jeannette. Emanuel built 200 houses which sold as a result of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]. On the west side of the district, which is also known as the Mission Terrace, many of the streets were named after American Indian tribes (Mohawk Ave became Seneca Ave for example), and Onondaga, Navajo, Modoc, Ottawa, Oneida, Seminole, and Cayuga are named among the rest. It is evident that many names have been retained, and from the various neighborhoods' inceptions, while some have changed to accommodate changes in political climate. As an example, Excelsior Avenue itself was originally named \"China\".  Likely due to anti-Asian feelings that led to the [[Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882]], India, Japan and China Streets were changed to Peru, Avalon, and Excelsior Streets.<ref name=\"San Francisco Public Library - Excelsior Branch\">{{cite web | url = http://excelsiorbranchsfpl.blogspot.com/2010/07/in-neighborhood-greg-pabst-and.html | title = In the Neighborhood - Greg Pabst and the Excelsior Stroll | |work=San Francisco Public Library - Excelsior Branch |accessdate =January 1, 2014  }}</ref>.

This annual event typically occurs in August.\n\nEstablished in 2002, the Excelsior Festival\u00a0was created by the Excelsior Action Group to bring attention to one of San Francisco's most vibrant neighborhoods. Because the City's public maps omitted (and still do, in some cases) any part of the city below Cesar Chavez, the Festival was created to put the Excelsior District on the map. It worked and made a difference. In 2011 the Excelsior Action Group brought SF Sunday Streets to the district to host activities along Mission Street from Silver to Geneva Avenue during the Excelsior Festival. After 15 years the Festival so outgrew its footprint that since 2017, the festival became the Excelsior Sunday Streets taking place each year in the Spring and Fall. \n\nThe Excelsior District Annual Car Show, which takes place in Excelsior Playground each year and typically in October brings together hundreds of locals residents to celebrate the Chicano Cholo culture & Irish, Italian roots of the Excelsior District. Displays of low riders and Muscle cars line the street of Madrid, food, vendors, live local rap artist performances all take place within Excelsior Playground.  \n\nThe Excelsior District Car Show originated when Jim Espinoza, while working with the neighborhood youth, created an organization called The Excelsior Youth Club. Today Jim Espinoza, along with some of the members of The Excelsior Youth Club, is memorialized on the wall behind the basketball court in the colorful Excelsior Playground mural.  In more recent years, Diane Wunderlich, former Secretary of The Excelsior Youth Club, brought the car show back.  Both Jim and Diane have always been heavily involved in the preservation of the neighborhood culture.   \n\nIn 2008, the SF Giants, led by Shortstop and Hall of Famer \"Little O\" [[Omar Vizquel]], funded renovating the Excelsior Playground baseball field and a new mural called \"Coming Together Through Sports\". The mural was designed and painted with Precita Eyes Muralists Association artist Cory Calandra Devereaux, Omar Vizquel and Excelsior community members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.precitaeyes.org/murals-2012-2005.html|title=Murals: 2012-2005|website=Precita Eyes Muralists|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>   \n\nPhotographer Travis Jensen is currently working on a photo book called \"Forever Upward\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2015/12/travis-jensens-photos-showcase-san-franciscos-last-ungentrified-neighborhood|title=Travis Jensen's Photos Showcase San Francisco's Last Ungentrified Neighborhood|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>  \n\nIn January 2020 SF Heritage Foundation, initiated a new program, \"Heritage in the Neighborhoods\" focusing on the Heritage in the Excelsior District. SF Heritage is partnering with Excelsior Action Group and the SF Victorian Alliance to jointly identify historic buildings, public artwork, or legacy businesses to raise their profile and significance to avoid losing these gems.   https://www.sfheritage.org/excelsior/\n\nCentral to the neighborhood for quite some time was the landmark Granada Theater, at the intersection of Mission and Ocean. In 1922 it opened with the name \"Excelsior\" but, was replaced with the name \"Granada\" in 1931 after the downtown Granada Theater changed its name to the Paramount, freeing up the name. Both the name and a vertical \"Granada\" sign were deployed in the Excelsior. However, the theater closed in 1982.\n\nAmong the various schools in the district is the San Francisco Community Alternative School, a public grade school with a unique 'project-based' curriculum,<ref>[http://www.my-sfcs.org/ San Francisco Community School -

The mural was designed and painted with Precita Eyes Muralists Association artist Cory Calandra Devereaux, Omar Vizquel and Excelsior community members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.precitaeyes.org/murals-2012-2005.html|title=Murals: 2012-2005|website=Precita Eyes Muralists|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>   \n\nPhotographer Travis Jensen is currently working on a photo book called \"Forever Upward\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2015/12/travis-jensens-photos-showcase-san-franciscos-last-ungentrified-neighborhood|title=Travis Jensen's Photos Showcase San Francisco's Last Ungentrified Neighborhood|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref>  \n\nIn January 2020 SF Heritage Foundation, initiated a new program, \"Heritage in the Neighborhoods\" focusing on the Heritage in the Excelsior District. SF Heritage is partnering with Excelsior Action Group and the SF Victorian Alliance to jointly identify historic buildings, public artwork, or legacy businesses to raise their profile and significance to avoid losing these gems.   https://www.sfheritage.org/excelsior/\n\nCentral to the neighborhood for quite some time was the landmark Granada Theater, at the intersection of Mission and Ocean. In 1922 it opened with the name \"Excelsior\" but, was replaced with the name \"Granada\" in 1931 after the downtown Granada Theater changed its name to the Paramount, freeing up the name. Both the name and a vertical \"Granada\" sign were deployed in the Excelsior. However, the theater closed in 1982.\n\nAmong the various schools in the district is the San Francisco Community Alternative School, a public grade school with a unique 'project-based' curriculum,<ref>[http://www.my-sfcs.org/ San Francisco Community School - Welcome<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the [[School of the Epiphany]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.jerryday.org\n* [http://www.excelsiorsf.org Excelsior District Improvement Association]\n* [http://www.eagsf.org Excelsior Action Group]\n* http://www.excelsiorfestival.org\n* [http://excelsiorsf.org/ Excelsior District Improvement Association (EDIA) website]\n* [http://travisjensenphoto.com/excelsior Travis Jensen Photo website]\n{{Neighborhoods_of_San_Francisco}}\n\n[[Category:Neighborhoods in San Francisco]]\n", "name_user": "BriefEdits", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNoteworthy residents:Added citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excelsior_District,_San_Francisco"}

Current human disease epidemics are explored as a function of population size. That human population growth is itself a phenomenon with clearly identifiable ecological/biological causes has been overlooked. Here, human population growth is discussed as being subject to the same dynamic processes as the population growth of other species. Contrary to the widely held belief that food production must be increased to feed the growing population, experimental and correlational data indicate that human population growth varies as a function of food availability. By increasing food production for humans, at the expense of other species, the biologically determined effect has been, and continues to be, an increase in the human population. Understanding the relationship between food increases and population increases is proposed as a necessary first step in addressing this global problem.

Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.\n[[File:Lacanja_burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn]]\nThere are two types of indicators of environmental impact: \"means-based\", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and \"effect-based\", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of [[Nitrogen fertilizers|nitrogen applied]] to the [[soil]].<!-- this first example makes no sense to me.

As a hydrological result it is found that:\n* the downstream river [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] is reduced\n* the [[evaporation]] in the scheme is increased\n* the [[groundwater recharge]] in the scheme is increased\n* the level of the [[watertable|water table]] rises\n* the [[drainage]] flow is increased.\nThese may be called direct effects.\n\nEffects on soil and [[water quality]] are indirect and complex, and subsequent impacts on natural, [[ecology|ecological]] and [[socio-economy|socio-economic]] conditions are intricate.  In some, but not all instances, [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinization]] can result.  However, irrigation can also be used, together with soil drainage, to overcome soil salinization by leaching excess salts from the vicinity of the root zone.<ref>http://www.fao.org/tempref/agl/agll/docs/salinity_brochure_eng.pdf</ref><ref>van Hoorn, J.

Such massive alteration of the global [[carbon cycle]] has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices.

According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock.

First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise \u201cimprove\u201d upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences.<ref>Commoner, B. (1971). The closing cycle \u2013 Nature, man, and technology, [[Alfred A. Knopf]].</ref> Second, the conservation of mass principle and the [[first law of thermodynamics]] (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or [[entropy]] outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create \u201corder\u201d in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing \u201cdisorder\u201d in the environment. According to a number of studies, increased entropy is likely to be correlated to negative environmental impacts.<ref>Faber, M., Niemes, N. and Stephan, G. (2012).

In some cases, additional forest logging is done in the vicinity of mines to increase the available room for the storage of the created debris and soil.<ref>[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2009/01/gold/larmer-text/6 Logging of forests and debris dumping].

Plants that are polluted with heavy metals usually depict reduced growth, yield and performance. Pollution by heavy metals decreases the soil organic matter composition resulting in a decline in soil nutrients which then leads to a decline in the growth of plants or even death.<ref>Chibuike, G.

In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization of various renewable energy sources]].\n\nIn the real world, [[Power consumption|consumption]] of fossil fuel resources leads to [[global warming]] and climate change. However, little change is being made in many parts of the world. If the [[peak oil]] theory proves true, more explorations of viable alternative energy sources, could be more friendly to the environment.\n\nRapidly advancing technologies can achieve a transition of energy generation, water and waste management, and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of [[systems ecology]] and [[industrial ecology]].<ref>Kay, J.

A joint life cycle analysis by the US Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Energy found that substituting 100% biodiesel for petroleum diesel in buses reduced life cycle consumption of petroleum by 95%.  Biodiesel reduced net emissions of carbon dioxide by 78.45%, compared with petroleum diesel.  In urban buses, biodiesel reduced particulate emissions 32 percent, carbon monoxide emissions 35 percent, and emissions of sulfur oxides 8%, relative to life cycle emissions associated with use of petroleum diesel.  Life cycle emissions of hydrocarbons were 35% higher and emission of various nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 13.5% higher with biodiesel.<ref>USDA-USDoE.  (1998).

After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.\n\n===Electricity generation===\n{{main|Environmental impact of electricity generation}}\nThe environmental impact of [[electricity generation]] is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power. This power is normally generated at [[power plant]]s that convert some other kind of energy into [[electricity]]. Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.\n\n===Nuclear power===\n{{main|Environmental impact of nuclear power}}\n[[File:Gr\u00fcne protests against nuclear energy.jpg|right|thumb|Anti-nuclear protest near [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste disposal centre]] at [[Gorleben]] in northern Germany]]\nThe environmental impact of [[nuclear power]] results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]] processes including mining, processing, transporting and storing fuel and [[radioactive]] fuel waste. Released [[radioisotopes]] pose a health danger to human populations, animals and plants as radioactive particles enter organisms through various transmission routes.\n\nRadiation is a [[carcinogen]] and causes numerous effects on living organisms and systems. The environmental impacts of nuclear power plant disasters such as the [[Chernobyl disaster]], the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] and the [[Three Mile Island accident]], among others, persist indefinitely, though several other factors contributed to these events including improper management of fail safe systems and natural disasters putting uncommon stress on the generators. The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive [[Plutonium-244]] has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.<ref>Smith, G.

[[Surface mining]] of [[oil shale reserves|oil shale deposits]] causes the usual environmental impacts of [[open-pit mining]]. In addition, the [[combustion]] and [[Shale oil extraction|thermal processing]] generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]]. Experimental in-situ conversion processes and [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.<ref name=\"BartisBoston\">\n{{cite conference\n |url=http://www.aspo-usa.com/fall2006/presentations/pdf/Bartis_J_Boston_2006.pdf \n |title=Unconventional Liquid Fuels Overview \n |author=Bartis, Jim \n |publisher=Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas \n |conference=World Oil Conference \n |location=Boston \n |date=2006-10-26 \n |accessdate=2007-06-28 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161801/http://www.aspo-usa.com/fall2006/presentations/pdf/Bartis_J_Boston_2006.pdf \n |archivedate=2011-07-21 \n}}</ref>\n\n===Petroleum===\n{{main|Environmental impact of petroleum}}\nThe environmental impact of [[petroleum]] is often negative because it is [[toxic]] to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.\n\n===Reservoirs===\n{{main|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}\n[[Image:Wachusett-dam.jpg|thumb|right|The Wachusett Dam in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]]]\nThe environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.\n\n[[Dam]]s and the [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric]] power, increasing the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental\u2014to both the environment and surrounding human populations\u2014 has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.\n\n===Wind power===\n[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbines in an agricultural setting]]\n{{main|Environmental impact of wind power}}\n\nCompared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. [[Wind power]]ed electricity generation consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.<ref name=mar>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |journal=Dissent |volume=13 |date=Summer 2004 |pages=43\u201348 |author=Diesendorf, Mark |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThere are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines, as there are around other artificial structures.

In recent years, measures have been taken to reduce these effects.\n\n===Nanotechnology===\n{{main|Environmental impact of nanotechnology}}\n[[Nanotechnology]]'s environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of [[nanomaterials]] will affect organisms and ecosystems.\n\n===Paint===\n{{main|Environmental impact of paint}}\nThe environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional [[painting]] materials and processes can have harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including those from the use of [[lead]] and other additives. Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred.

Although pulp and paper manufacturing requires large amounts of energy, a portion of it comes from burning wood waste.]]\nThe environmental impact of paper is significant, which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the [[printing press]] and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood, paper has become a cheap commodity. This has led to a high level of consumption and waste. With the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by [[environmental organization]]s and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards [[sustainability]] in the [[pulp and paper industry]].\n\n===Plastics===\n{{further|Plastic#Environmental effects}}\n[[File:Pacific-garbage-patch-map 2010 noaamdp.jpg|thumb|[[Great Pacific garbage patch]] ]] \nSome scientists suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/world/sutter-vanishing-help/|title=How to stop the sixth mass extinction |first=John D. |last=Sutter |date=December 12, 2016|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pesticides===\n{{main|Environmental impact of pesticides}}\nThe environmental impact of [[pesticide]]s is often greater than what is intended by those who use them.

Current human disease epidemics are explored as a function of population size. That human population growth is itself a phenomenon with clearly identifiable ecological/biological causes has been overlooked. Here, human population growth is discussed as being subject to the same dynamic processes as the population growth of other species. Contrary to the widely held belief that food production must be increased to feed the growing population, experimental and correlational data indicate that human population growth varies as a function of food availability. By increasing food production for humans, at the expense of other species, the biologically determined effect has been, and continues to be, an increase in the human population. Understanding the relationship between food increases and population increases is proposed as a necessary first step in addressing this global problem.

Ultimately, the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers. The connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect, as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature.\n[[File:Lacanja_burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn]]\nThere are two types of indicators of environmental impact: \"means-based\", which is based on the farmer's production methods, and \"effect-based\", which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment. An example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is affected by the amount of [[Nitrogen fertilizers|nitrogen applied]] to the [[soil]].<!-- this first example makes no sense to me. If you agree, I suggest to leave and indication here; or, if you can, rewrite it.--> An indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based.<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\">{{cite journal|last1=van der Warf|first1=Hayo|last2=Petit|first2=Jean|title=Evaluation of the environmental impact of agriculture at the farm level: a comparison and analysis of 12 indicator-based methods|journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment|date=December 2002|volume=93|issue=1\u20133|pages=131\u2013145|doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(01)00354-1}}</ref>\n\nThe environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil, to water, the air, animal and soil diversity, plants, and the food itself.

For example, \u201cgreen water\u201d use is evapotranspirational use of soil water that has been provided directly by precipitation; and \u201cgreen water\u201d has been estimated to account for 94% of global beef cattle production's \u201c[[water footprint]]\u201d,<ref>Mekonnen, M.

Such massive alteration of the global [[carbon cycle]] has only been possible because of the availability and deployment of advanced technologies, ranging in application from fossil fuel exploration, extraction, distribution, refining, and combustion in power plants and automobile engines and advanced farming practices. Livestock contributes to climate change both through the production of greenhouse gases and through destruction of [[carbon sink]]s such as rain-forests. According to the 2006 United Nations/FAO report, 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions found in the atmosphere are due to livestock. The raising of livestock and the land needed to feed them has resulted in the destruction of millions of acres of rainforest and as global demand for meat rises, so too will the demand for land. Ninety-one percent of all rainforest land deforested since 1970 is now used for livestock.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food Choice and Sustainability|last=Oppenlander|first=Richard|publisher=Langdon Street Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-62652-435-4|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=31|via=}}</ref> Potential negative environmental impacts caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations are rising global air temperatures, altered hydrogeological cycles resulting in more frequent and severe droughts, storms, and floods, as well as sea level rise and ecosystem disruption.<ref name=IPCC>{{Cite web |url=http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226155600/http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Acid Deposition  ===\n{{Main|Acid Deposition}}\nThe fossils that are burned by humans for energy usually come back to them in the form of acid rain. Acid rain is a form of precipitation which has high sulfuric and nitric acids which can occur in the form of a fog or snow. Acid rain has numerous ecological impacts on streams, lakes, wetlands and other aquatic environments. It damages forests, robs the soil of its essential nutrients, releases aluminium to the soil, which makes it very hard for trees to absorb water.<ref>National Geographic. Acid Rain, explained. <nowiki>https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/acid-rain/</nowiki></ref>\n\nResearchers have discovered that kelp, eelgrass and other vegetation can effectively absorb carbon dioxide and hence reducing ocean acidity. Scientists, therefore, say that growing these plants could help in mitigating the damaging effects of acidification on marine life.<ref>Jones N., (2016).

Environmental impacts caused by the application of technology are often perceived as unavoidable for several reasons. First, given that the purpose of many technologies is to exploit, control, or otherwise \u201cimprove\u201d upon nature for the perceived benefit of humanity while at the same time the myriad of processes in nature have been optimized and are continually adjusted by evolution, any disturbance of these natural processes by technology is likely to result in negative environmental consequences.<ref>Commoner, B. (1971). The closing cycle \u2013 Nature, man, and technology, [[Alfred A. Knopf]].</ref> Second, the conservation of mass principle and the [[first law of thermodynamics]] (i.e., conservation of energy) dictate that whenever material resources or energy are moved around or manipulated by technology, environmental consequences are inescapable. Third, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], order can be increased within a system (such as the human economy) only by increasing disorder or [[entropy]] outside the system (i.e., the environment). Thus, technologies can create \u201corder\u201d in the human economy (i.e., order as manifested in buildings, factories, transportation networks, communication systems, etc.) only at the expense of increasing \u201cdisorder\u201d in the environment.

The radioactive decay rate of particles varies greatly, dependent upon the nuclear properties of a particular isotope. Radioactive [[Plutonium-244]] has a half-life of 80.8 million years, which indicates the time duration required for half of a given sample to decay, though very little plutonium-244 is produced in the nuclear fuel cycle and lower half-life materials have lower activity thus giving off less dangerous radiation.<ref>Smith, G.

[[Surface mining]] of [[oil shale reserves|oil shale deposits]] causes the usual environmental impacts of [[open-pit mining]]. In addition, the [[combustion]] and [[Shale oil extraction|thermal processing]] generate waste material, which must be disposed of, and harmful atmospheric emissions, including [[carbon dioxide]], a major [[greenhouse gas]]. Experimental in-situ conversion processes and [[carbon capture and storage]] technologies may reduce some of these concerns in future, but may raise others, such as the pollution of groundwater.<ref name=\"BartisBoston\">\n{{cite conference\n |url=http://www.aspo-usa.com/fall2006/presentations/pdf/Bartis_J_Boston_2006.pdf \n |title=Unconventional Liquid Fuels Overview \n |author=Bartis, Jim \n |publisher=Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas \n |conference=World Oil Conference \n |location=Boston \n |date=2006-10-26 \n |accessdate=2007-06-28 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161801/http://www.aspo-usa.com/fall2006/presentations/pdf/Bartis_J_Boston_2006.pdf \n |archivedate=2011-07-21 \n}}</ref>\n\n===Petroleum===\n{{main|Environmental impact of petroleum}}\nThe environmental impact of [[petroleum]] is often negative because it is [[toxic]] to almost all forms of life. Petroleum, a common word for oil or natural gas, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.\n\n===Reservoirs===\n{{main|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}\n[[Image:Wachusett-dam.jpg|thumb|right|The Wachusett Dam in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]]]]\nThe environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases.\n\n[[Dam]]s and the [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric]] power, increasing the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities and flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Although the impact varies greatly between different dams and reservoirs, common criticisms include preventing sea-run fish from reaching their historical mating grounds, less access to water downstream, and a smaller catch for fishing communities in the area. Advances in technology have provided solutions to many negative impacts of dams but these advances are often not viewed as worth investing in if not required by law or under the threat of fines. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental\u2014to both the environment and surrounding human populations\u2014 has been debated since the 1960s and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.\n\n===Wind power===\n[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|Wind turbines in an agricultural setting]]\n{{main|Environmental impact of wind power}}\n\nCompared to the environmental impact of traditional energy sources, the environmental impact of wind power is relatively minor. [[Wind power]]ed electricity generation consumes no fuel, and emits no [[air pollution]], unlike fossil fuel power sources. The energy consumed to manufacture and transport the materials used to build a wind power plant is equal to the new energy produced by the plant within a few months. While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible, with only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure made unavailable for use.<ref name=mar>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |title=Why Australia needs wind power |journal=Dissent |volume=13 |date=Summer 2004 |pages=43\u201348 |author=Diesendorf, Mark |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706112239/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |archivedate=July 6, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThere are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines, as there are around other artificial structures.

In recent years, measures have been taken to reduce these effects.\n\n===Nanotechnology===\n{{main|Environmental impact of nanotechnology}}\n[[Nanotechnology]]'s environmental impact can be split into two aspects: the potential for nanotechnological innovations to help improve the environment, and the possibly novel type of pollution that nanotechnological materials might cause if released into the environment. As nanotechnology is an emerging field, there is great debate regarding to what extent industrial and commercial use of [[nanomaterials]] will affect organisms and ecosystems.\n\n===Paint===\n{{main|Environmental impact of paint}}\nThe environmental impact of paint is diverse. Traditional [[painting]] materials and processes can have harmful effects on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], including those from the use of [[lead]] and other additives. Measures can be taken to reduce environmental impact, including accurately estimating paint quantities so that wastage is minimized, use of paints, coatings, painting accessories and techniques that are environmentally preferred. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] guidelines and [[Green Star (Australia)|Green Star]] ratings are some of the standards that can be applied.\n\n===Paper===\n{{main|Environmental impact of paper}}\n[[File:PulpAndPaperMill.jpg|thumb|right|A pulp and paper mill in [[New Brunswick]], Canada. Although pulp and paper manufacturing requires large amounts of energy, a portion of it comes from burning wood waste.]]\nThe environmental impact of paper is significant, which has led to changes in industry and behaviour at both business and personal levels. With the use of modern technology such as the [[printing press]] and the highly mechanised harvesting of wood, paper has become a cheap commodity. This has led to a high level of consumption and waste. With the rise in environmental awareness due to the lobbying by [[environmental organization]]s and with increased government regulation there is now a trend towards [[sustainability]] in the [[pulp and paper industry]].\n\n===Plastics===\n{{further|Plastic#Environmental effects}}\n[[File:Pacific-garbage-patch-map 2010 noaamdp.jpg|thumb|[[Great Pacific garbage patch]] ]] \nSome scientists suggest that by 2050 there could be more plastic than fish in the oceans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/world/sutter-vanishing-help/|title=How to stop the sixth mass extinction |first=John D. |last=Sutter |date=December 12, 2016|website=Cnn.com|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pesticides===\n{{main|Environmental impact of pesticides}}\nThe environmental impact of [[pesticide]]s is often greater than what is intended by those who use them.

After [[History of Sweden (1611\u201348)|the German allies of Sweden]] were forced to seek terms with the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the French first minister, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], declared war on [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] because French territory was surrounded by [[Habsburg]] territories. The conflict was a continuation of the aims of the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]] (1628\u201331) in which France invaded northern Italy trying to take possession of territory claimed by the [[Spanish Habsburg]]s. Though some minor territorial gains were made by France, the Franco-Spanish War ended inconclusively in 1659 with the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]].<ref>Parrott, David: ''Richelieu's Army: War, Government and Society in France, 1624\u20131642''.

Spain financed [[Huguenot rebellions]] from 1622 to 1630, and the 1648 to 1653 civil war known as the [[Fronde]]; France supported revolts against Spanish rule in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]], [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]] and [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)|Naples]]. \n\nThe war consisted of two distinct phases; before 1635, France supported Habsburg opponents in the Dutch Revolt and Thirty Years War, but avoided direct involvement. After agreeing alliances with the [[Swedish_Empire|Swedes]] and [[Dutch_Republic|Dutch]] in 1635, it became a participant in both wars, which ended with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The hostilities of the war ended with the marriage of [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. Spain remained a great global power, with a vast colonial empire, but the war is often seen as the beginning of the Spanish decline as the pre-eminent superpower.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|pp=77-78}}\n\n==Strategic Overview==\n17th century Europe was dominated by the struggle between the [[House_of_Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings of [[Kingdom_of_France|France]], and their [[House_of_Habsburg|Habsburg]] rivals in [[Habsburg_Spain|Spain]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Until the mid 20th century, the [[Thirty Years War]] was primarily seen as a German religious conflict; in 1938, historian [[Veronica_Wedgwood|CV Wedgwood]] argued it formed part of a wider, ongoing European struggle, with the Habsburg-Bourbon conflict at its centre. A perspective now generally accepted by historians, its implication is that strategies pursued during the Franco-Spanish War can only be understood in a European context.{{sfn|Sutherland|1992|pages=588-590}}   \n\nIn 1630, Habsburg possessions bordered France in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]], [[Alsace]], [[Roussillon]] and [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]] (see Map). France supported anti-Spanish wars by the [[Eighty_Years'_War|Dutch]], and clients in [[Lombardy|Northern Italy]], as well as revolts in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]], [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]]. French-backed Austrian opponents included the [[Franco-Ottoman_alliance|Ottomans]], the [[Venetian Republic]], [[George_I_R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|Transylvanian rebels]], and [[Swedish_Empire|Sweden]].{{sfn|Jensen|1985|pp=451-470}} \n[[File:France 1552-1798.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|France 1552-1798]]\nSpain and Austria financed Huguenot rebellions in South-Western France, and the 1648 to 1653 civil war known as the [[Fronde]]. They also backed conspiracies led by the feudal lords who resented their loss of power under [[Cardinal_Richelieu|Richelieu]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]]; the most significant included the 1632 [[Henri_II_de_Montmorency|Montmorency plot]], the [[Louis,_Count_of_Soissons|1641 Princes des Paix rising]], and [[Henri_Coiffier_de_Ruz\u00e9,_Marquis_of_Cinq-Mars|Cinq-Mars]] in 1642.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pages=663-664}} \n\nWider co-operation between the Habsburgs was limited, since their objectives did not always align; Spain was a global maritime power, Austria primarily a European land power. The Empire had over 1,800 members, most extremely small; although a Habsburg had been [[Holy Roman Emperor]] since 1440, in theory it was an elected position. After [[Peace_of_Augsburg|1555]], the Empire increasingly became a federation of independent states; encouraged by France, Habsburg acceptance of this reality is one of the less acknowledged outcomes of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]].{{sfn|Wilson|1976|p=259}}\n\nFrance faced the same issue of diverging objectives with its allies. The war coincided with the period of economic supremacy known as the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and by 1640, many Dutch statesmen viewed French ambitions in the Spanish Netherlands as a threat.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=669}} Unlike France, Swedish war aims were restricted to Germany, and in 1641, they considered a separate peace with Ferdinand.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=627}}         \n\nMuch of the fighting took place around the [[Spanish Road]], an overland supply route connecting Spanish possessions in [[Piedmont|Northern Italy]] to [[Flanders]]. Rarely used for moving soldiers post-1601, it remained vital for trade, and went through areas like [[Alsace]] essential to French security. In Northern Italy, [[Duchy_of_Savoy|Savoy]] and the Spanish-held [[Duchy of Milan]] were strategically important, since they provided access to the vulnerable southern borders of France, and Habsburg [[Erblande|territories in Austria]]. Richelieu aimed to end Spanish dominance in these areas, an objective largely achieved by the time he died in 1642.{{sfn|Wilson|1976|p=259}}    \n\nUntil the advent of railways in the 19th century, water was the primary means of bulk transportation, and campaigns focused on control of rivers and ports. Armies relied on [[Military_logistics|foraging]], while feeding the draught animals essential for transport and cavalry restricted campaigning in the winter. By the 1630s, the countryside had been devastated by years of constant warfare, which limited the size of armies, and the ability to conduct operations. Sickness killed far more soldiers than battle; France invaded [[Flanders]] with 27,000 men in May, which was reduced by desertion and disease to under 17,000 in early July.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2014|pp=169-170}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain - Vel\u00e1zquez 1644.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV of Spain]], ruler from 1621 to 1665]]\nThe [[Thirty Years War]] began in 1618 when the [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-dominated [[Bohemian_Revolt|Bohemian Estates]] offered the [[Kingdom_of_Bohemia|Crown of Bohemia]] to [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|Frederick of the Palatinate]], rather than the conservative [[Catholic_Church|Catholic]], [[Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#Bohemian_revolt|Emperor Ferdinand II]]. Most of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] remained neutral, viewing it as an inheritance dispute, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. However, when Frederick refused to admit defeat, Imperial forces invaded the [[Palatinate_campaign|Palatinate]] and forced him into exile; removal of a hereditary prince changed the nature and extent of the war.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=314-316}}  \n\nAccompanied by a renewed [[Counter-Reformation]], this threatened Protestant states within the Empire. It also drew in external powers who held Imperial territories; [[County_of_Nassau#County_of_Nassau-Dillenburg|Nassau-Dillenburg]] was a hereditary possession of the [[Prince_of_Orange|Dutch Prince of Orange]], while [[Christian_IV_of_Denmark|Christian IV of Denmark]] was also [[Duke_of_Holstein-Gottorp|Duke of Holstein]]. With France facing Spanish-financed [[Huguenot rebellions]] from 1622 to 1630, and [[War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession|proxy wars in Italy]] from 1628 to 1631, this provided opportunities to weaken the Habsburgs, but avoid direct conflict.{{sfn|Hayden|1973|pp=1-23}}\n\nFrance supported the Dutch war with Spain, as well as funding [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish]], then [[Swedish_Empire|Swedish]] intervention in the Empire. In 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] invaded [[Pomerania]]; partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, he also sought control of the [[Baltic_maritime_trade_(c._1400\u20131800)|Baltic trade]], which provided much of Sweden's income.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1938|pp=385-386}} Economic issues meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but led to conflict with [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and Denmark-Norway. Defeat at [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|N\u00f6rdlingen]] in September 1634 forced the Swedes to retreat, while most of their German allies made peace with Ferdinand in the 1635 [[Treaty of Prague (1635)|Treaty of Prague]].{{sfn|Knox|2017|pp=182-183}} \n[[File:Luis XIII, rey de Francia (Philippe de Champaigne).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis XIII]], French ruler from 1610 to 1643]]\nThe other major European conflict of the period was the 1568 to 1648 [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the [[Dutch Republic]], suspended in 1609 by the [[Twelve Years' Truce]].{{sfn|Lynch|1969|p=42}} The Spanish strongly objected to its commercial provisions and when [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] became king in 1621, he resumed the war. The cost proved extremely high, increased after 1628 by a proxy war with France over the [[War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession|Mantuan succession]]. While the [[Spanish Empire]] reached its maximum extent under Philip's rule, its complexity and size made it increasingly difficult to govern, or enact essential reforms.{{sfn|Mackay|1999|pp=4-5}}\n\nIn 1628, the Dutch captured the [[Battle_in_the_Bay_of_Matanzas|Spanish treasure fleet]], which they used to finance the 1629 [[Siege_of_'s-Hertogenbosch|capture of 's-Hertogenbosch]]. The powerful [[Amsterdam]] mercantile lobby saw this as an opportunity to end the war; negotiations ended without result in 1633, but strengthened the peace party.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=521-523}} The Peace of Prague led to rumours of a proposed Austro-Spanish offensive in the Netherlands, leading [[Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis XIII]] and Richelieu to decide on direct intervention. In early 1635, they signed an agreement with [[Bernard of Saxe-Weimar]] to provide 16,000 troops for a campaign in Alsace and the Rhineland, an anti-Spain alliance with the [[Dutch Republic]], and the Treaty of Compi\u00e8gne with Sweden.{{sfn|Poot|2013|pp=120-122}}\n\n==Phase I; 1635 to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia==\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = 1635-1659; key locations Northern France and the Spanish Netherlands (current Belgium borders shown)|relief=yes|border = black| width = 260| float = right\n|label =  Les Avins|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 34|lon_deg = 5|lon_min = 17\n|label3 = Dunkirk |pos3= right|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 02|lon3_deg = 2|lon3_min = 23\n|label5 = Brussels|pos5=left|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min =51 |lon5_deg = 4 |lon5_min = 21\n|label6 = Leuven|pos6=top|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =53 |lon6_deg = 4 |lon6_min = 42\n|label7=  Valenciennes|pos7= right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 21|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 34\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9= Corbie|pos9 = top|lat9_deg = 50|lat9_min = 00|lon9_deg = 2 | lon9_min = 30\n|label10= Lens|pos10 = top|lat10_deg = 50|lat10_min = 33|lon10_deg = 3 | lon10_min = 54\n|label11= Arras|pos11=right|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min = 18|lon11_deg = 2|lon11_min = 47\n}}\nIn May, a French army of 27,000 advanced into the Spanish Netherlands, defeating a smaller Spanish force at [[Battle of Les Avins|Les Avins]], before linking up with the Dutch. Outnumbered, the [[Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria|Cardinal-Infante]] withdrew into [[Leuven]]; by the time the [[Siege_of_Leuven|siege began]] on 24 June, desertions reduced the French to under 17,000, and they withdrew in early July. After the loss of [[Siege_of_Schenkenschans|Schenkenschans]] on 28 July, the Dutch also withdrew from the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2014|pp=169-170}} \n\nThis failure meant the [[States_General_of_the_Netherlands|States-General]] opposed further large scale land operations, and instead prioritised attacks on Spanish trade.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=934}} In 1636, a Spanish offensive reached [[Corbie]] in Northern France; although it caused panic in [[Paris]], lack of supplies forced them to retreat, and it was not repeated.

In 1641, the [[Catalan Courts]] recognised Louis XIII as [[Count of Barcelona]], and ruler of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].{{sfn|Van Gelderen|2002|p=284}} However, Catalans found French administration differed little from that of Castile, and the war became a three sided contest between the rural peasantry, the Spanish, and the French and Catalan elite.{{sfn|Mitchell|2005|pp=431-448}}\n\nOn 14 May 1643, Louis XIII died; his five year old son, [[Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis XIV]], became king, his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], taking control of the Regency Council that ruled in his name. Five days later, [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9, then known as the duc d'Enghien]], defeated the Spanish [[Army of Flanders]] at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]]; less decisive than often thought, the loss of this highly experienced unit ended Spanish dominance of the European battlefield.{{sfn|Black|2002|p=147}} Cond\u00e9, a member of the royal family, and effective ruler of large parts of eastern France, used it as leverage in his struggle for political control with Anne, and [[Cardinal Mazarin]].{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=666-668}}\n\nDespite limited success in Northern France and the Spanish Netherlands, including victory at [[Battle of Lens|Lens]] in August 1648, France was unable to knock Spain out of the war. In Germany, Imperial victories at [[Battle_of_Tuttlingen|Tuttlingen]] and [[Battle_of_Herbsthausen|Mergentheim]] were offset by French success at [[Battle_of_N\u00f6rdlingen_(1645)|N\u00f6rdlingen]] and [[Battle_of_Zusmarshausen|Zusmarshausen]]. In Italy, Franco-Savoyard offensives against the Spanish-ruled [[Duchy of Milan]] achieved little, partly due to the disruption caused by the 1639 to 1642 [[Piedmontese Civil War]]. Victory at [[Battle_of_Orbetello|Orbetello]] in June 1646, and the recapture of [[Neapolitan_Republic_(1647)|Naples]] in 1647 left Spain firmly in control of this region.{{sfn|Paoletti|2007|pp=27-28}}\n\nThe 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended the Thirty Years War and recognised Dutch independence, ending the drain on Spanish resources. Under the October 1648 Treaty of M\u00fcnster, France gained strategic locations in Alsace and Lorraine, as well as [[Pinerolo]], which controlled access to Alpine passes in Northern Italy.{{sfn|Paoletti |2007|pp=27-28}} However, the peace excluded Italy, [[Burgundian_Circle|Imperial territories in the Low Countries]], and French-occupied [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]], while Emperor Ferdinand agreed to remain neutral.

From 1654 to 1656, French victories at [[Battle of Arras (1654)|Arras]], [[Landrecies]] and [[Saint-Ghislain]] were offset by Spanish success at [[Pavia|Pavia, in Lombardy]], and [[Battle of Valenciennes (1656)|Valenciennes]]. Under pressure from [[Pope Alexander VII]], Mazarin offered peace terms, but refused to accept Spain's insistence Cond\u00e9 must be restored to his French titles and lands.{{sfn|Inglis Jones|1994|pp=296-300}} Philip viewed this as a personal obligation, and with the war apparently going his way, rejected talks.{{sfn|Black|1991|p=16}}    \n\nPrior to the 1660s, France lacked a powerful navy of its own, and instead relied on the Dutch, who ceased to provide this after 1648. Since 1654, Spain had been involved in a [[Anglo-Spanish_War_(1654\u20131660)|naval conflict]] with the [[Commonwealth_of_England|English Commonwealth]], and in 1657, Mazarin negotiated an [[Treaty_of_Paris_(1657)|Anglo-French alliance]]. France was required to end its backing for the exiled [[Charles_II_of_England|Charles II]], some of whose supporters joined the Spanish as a result.{{sfn|Quainton |1935|p=268}} \n\n1658 featured an Anglo-French offensive in North Flanders, whose main objective was [[Dunkirk]], a centre for Spanish [[privateer]] attacks on English shipping.{{efn|Its location meant ships based in Dunkirk could enter the [[North Sea]] on a single flood tide, allowing them to raid as far north as the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]]; its closure was a British objective for centuries.{{sfn|Bromley |1987|p=233}}}} After the [[Siege_of_Dunkirk_(1658)|loss of Dunkirk]] in June, Spain requested a truce, which Mazarin initially refused. However, Cromwell's death led to political chaos in England, while French allies Savoy and [[Duchy_of_Modena_and_Reggio|Modena]] ended the war in Northern Italy by agreeing a truce with the Spanish commander, [[Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena|Caracena]].{{sfn|Hanlon|2016|p=134}}\n\n==Treaty of the Pyrenees and marriage contract==\n[[File:Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]]; exiled in 1651, his restoration was a major obstacle to peace]]\nOn 8 May 1659, France and Spain began negotiating terms; the death of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in September 1658 weakened England, which was allowed to observe, but excluded from the talks.

Thirty Years' War}}\n\nThe '''Franco-Spanish War''' of 1635 to 1659 was one of a series of wars between [[Kingdom_of_France|France]], and their [[House_of_Habsburg|Habsburg]] rivals in [[Habsburg_Spain|Spain]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It is considered a connected conflict of the 1568 to 1648 [[Eighty_Years'_War|Dutch Revolt]], and 1618 to 1648 [[Thirty Years War]]. \n\nMain areas of conflict included [[Northern Italy]], the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Catalonia]], and the [[Rhineland]], with both sides backing domestic conspiracies in the other. Spain financed [[Huguenot rebellions]] from 1622 to 1630, and the 1648 to 1653 civil war known as the [[Fronde]]; France supported revolts against Spanish rule in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]], [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]] and [[Neapolitan Republic (1647)|Naples]]. \n\nThe war consisted of two distinct phases; before 1635, France supported Habsburg opponents in the Dutch Revolt and Thirty Years War, but avoided direct involvement. After agreeing alliances with the [[Swedish_Empire|Swedes]] and [[Dutch_Republic|Dutch]] in 1635, it became a participant in both wars, which ended with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. \n\nAfter 1648, fighting continued between Spain and France, with neither gaining an advantage. The 1657 [[Treaty_of_Paris_(1657)|Anglo-French alliance]] led to an offensive in [[Flanders]], and victory at the June 1658 [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of the Dunes]]. This did little to change the overall position, but the Spanish economy was severely impacted by English naval attacks, while France had largely achieved its strategic objectives. Both sides saw little benefit in prolonging the war, and agreed peace in November 1659. \n\nFrench territorial gains were minor in extent, but of considerable strategic significance, as was the marriage of [[Louis XIV of France]] and [[Maria Theresa of Spain]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. Spain remained a great power, with a vast colonial empire, but the war is often seen as marking the end of its position as '''the''' pre-eminent global superpower.{{sfn|Parrott|2001|pp=77-78}} \n\n==Strategic Overview==\n17th century Europe was dominated by the struggle between the [[House_of_Bourbon|Bourbon]] kings of [[Kingdom_of_France|France]], and their [[House_of_Habsburg|Habsburg]] rivals in [[Habsburg_Spain|Spain]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Until the mid 20th century, the [[Thirty Years War]] was primarily seen as a German religious conflict; in 1938, historian [[Veronica_Wedgwood|CV Wedgwood]] argued it formed part of a wider, ongoing European struggle, with the Habsburg-Bourbon conflict at its centre. A perspective now generally accepted by historians, its implication is that strategies pursued during the Franco-Spanish War can only be understood in a European context.{{sfn|Sutherland|1992|pages=588-590}}   \n\nIn 1630, Habsburg possessions bordered France in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]], [[Alsace]], [[Roussillon]] and [[Duchy_of_Lorraine|Lorraine]] (see Map). France supported anti-Spanish wars by the [[Eighty_Years'_War|Dutch]], and clients in [[Lombardy|Northern Italy]], as well as revolts in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]], [[Reapers' War|Catalonia]] and [[Kingdom_of_Naples|Naples]]. French-backed Austrian opponents included the [[Franco-Ottoman_alliance|Ottomans]], the [[Venetian Republic]], [[George_I_R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|Transylvanian rebels]], and [[Swedish_Empire|Sweden]].{{sfn|Jensen|1985|pp=451-470}} \n[[File:France 1552-1798.png|thumb|left|upright=1.25|France 1552-1798]]\nSpain and Austria financed Huguenot rebellions in South-Western France, and the 1648 to 1653 civil war known as the [[Fronde]]. They also backed conspiracies led by the feudal lords who resented their loss of power under [[Cardinal_Richelieu|Richelieu]] and [[Cardinal Mazarin]]; the most significant included the 1632 [[Henri_II_de_Montmorency|Montmorency plot]], the [[Louis,_Count_of_Soissons|1641 Princes des Paix rising]], and [[Henri_Coiffier_de_Ruz\u00e9,_Marquis_of_Cinq-Mars|Cinq-Mars]] in 1642.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pages=663-664}} \n\nWider co-operation between the Habsburgs was limited, since their objectives did not always align; Spain was a global maritime power, Austria primarily a European land power. The Empire had over 1,800 members, most extremely small; although a Habsburg had been [[Holy Roman Emperor]] since 1440, in theory it was an elected position. After [[Peace_of_Augsburg|1555]], the Empire increasingly became a federation of independent states; encouraged by France, Habsburg acceptance of this reality is one of the less acknowledged outcomes of the 1648 [[Treaty of Westphalia]].{{sfn|Wilson|1976|p=259}}\n\nFrance faced the same issue of diverging objectives with its allies. The war coincided with the period of economic supremacy known as the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and by 1640, many Dutch statesmen viewed French ambitions in the Spanish Netherlands as a threat.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=669}} Unlike France, Swedish war aims were restricted to Germany, and in 1641, they considered a separate peace with Ferdinand.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|p=627}}         \n\nMuch of the fighting took place around the [[Spanish Road]], an overland supply route connecting Spanish possessions in [[Piedmont|Northern Italy]] to [[Flanders]]. Rarely used for moving soldiers post-1601, it remained vital for trade, and went through areas like [[Alsace]] essential to French security. In Northern Italy, [[Duchy_of_Savoy|Savoy]] and the Spanish-held [[Duchy of Milan]] were strategically important, since they provided access to the vulnerable southern borders of France, and Habsburg [[Erblande|territories in Austria]]. Richelieu aimed to end Spanish dominance in these areas, an objective largely achieved by the time he died in 1642.{{sfn|Wilson|1976|p=259}}    \n\nUntil the advent of railways in the 19th century, water was the primary means of bulk transportation, and campaigns focused on control of rivers and ports. Armies relied on [[Military_logistics|foraging]], while feeding the draught animals essential for transport and cavalry restricted campaigning in the winter. By the 1630s, the countryside had been devastated by years of constant warfare, which limited the size of armies, and the ability to conduct operations. Sickness killed far more soldiers than battle; France invaded [[Flanders]] with 27,000 men in May, which was reduced by desertion and disease to under 17,000 in early July.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2014|pp=169-170}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Philip IV of Spain - Vel\u00e1zquez 1644.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV of Spain]], ruler from 1621 to 1665]]\nThe [[Thirty Years War]] began in 1618 when the [[Protestantism|Protestant]]-dominated [[Bohemian_Revolt|Bohemian Estates]] offered the [[Kingdom_of_Bohemia|Crown of Bohemia]] to [[Frederick_V_of_the_Palatinate|Frederick of the Palatinate]], rather than the conservative [[Catholic_Church|Catholic]], [[Ferdinand_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor#Bohemian_revolt|Emperor Ferdinand II]]. Most of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] remained neutral, viewing it as an inheritance dispute, and the revolt was quickly suppressed. However, when Frederick refused to admit defeat, Imperial forces invaded the [[Palatinate_campaign|Palatinate]] and forced him into exile; removal of a hereditary prince changed the nature and extent of the war.{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=314-316}}  \n\nAccompanied by a renewed [[Counter-Reformation]], this threatened Protestant states within the Empire. It also drew in external powers who held Imperial territories; [[County_of_Nassau#County_of_Nassau-Dillenburg|Nassau-Dillenburg]] was a hereditary possession of the [[Prince_of_Orange|Dutch Prince of Orange]], while [[Christian_IV_of_Denmark|Christian IV of Denmark]] was also [[Duke_of_Holstein-Gottorp|Duke of Holstein]]. With France facing Spanish-financed [[Huguenot rebellions]] from 1622 to 1630, and [[War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession|proxy wars in Italy]] from 1628 to 1631, this provided opportunities to weaken the Habsburgs, but avoid direct conflict.{{sfn|Hayden|1973|pp=1-23}}\n\nFrance supported the Dutch war with Spain, as well as funding [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish]], then [[Swedish_Empire|Swedish]] intervention in the Empire. In 1630, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] invaded [[Pomerania]]; partly to support his Protestant co-religionists, he also sought control of the [[Baltic_maritime_trade_(c._1400\u20131800)|Baltic trade]], which provided much of Sweden's income.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1938|pp=385-386}} Economic issues meant Swedish intervention continued after Gustavus was killed in 1632, but led to conflict with [[Electorate_of_Saxony|Saxony]], [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] and Denmark-Norway. Defeat at [[Battle of N\u00f6rdlingen (1634)|N\u00f6rdlingen]] in September 1634 forced the Swedes to retreat, while most of their German allies made peace with Ferdinand in the 1635 [[Treaty of Prague (1635)|Treaty of Prague]].{{sfn|Knox|2017|pp=182-183}} \n[[File:Luis XIII, rey de Francia (Philippe de Champaigne).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis XIII]], French ruler from 1610 to 1643]]\nThe other major European conflict of the period was the 1568 to 1648 [[Eighty Years' War]] between Spain and the [[Dutch Republic]], suspended in 1609 by the [[Twelve Years' Truce]].{{sfn|Lynch|1969|p=42}} The Spanish strongly objected to its commercial provisions and when [[Philip_IV_of_Spain|Philip IV]] became king in 1621, he resumed the war. The cost proved extremely high, increased after 1628 by a proxy war with France over the [[War_of_the_Mantuan_Succession|Mantuan succession]]. While the [[Spanish Empire]] reached its maximum extent under Philip's rule, its complexity and size made it increasingly difficult to govern, or enact essential reforms.{{sfn|Mackay|1999|pp=4-5}}\n\nIn 1628, the Dutch captured the [[Battle_in_the_Bay_of_Matanzas|Spanish treasure fleet]], which they used to finance the 1629 [[Siege_of_'s-Hertogenbosch|capture of 's-Hertogenbosch]]. The powerful [[Amsterdam]] mercantile lobby saw this as an opportunity to end the war; negotiations ended without result in 1633, but strengthened the peace party.{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=521-523}} The Peace of Prague led to rumours of a proposed Austro-Spanish offensive in the Netherlands, leading [[Louis_XIII_of_France|Louis XIII]] and Richelieu to decide on direct intervention. In early 1635, they signed an agreement with [[Bernard of Saxe-Weimar]] to provide 16,000 troops for a campaign in Alsace and the Rhineland, an anti-Spain alliance with the [[Dutch Republic]], and the Treaty of Compi\u00e8gne with Sweden.{{sfn|Poot|2013|pp=120-122}}\n\n==Phase I; 1635 to the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia==\n{{Location map many|Belgium|caption = 1635-1659; key locations Northern France and the Spanish Netherlands (current Belgium borders shown)|relief=yes|border = black| width = 260| float = right\n|label =  Les Avins|pos=left|lat_deg= 50|lat_min= 34|lon_deg = 5|lon_min = 17\n|label3 = Dunkirk |pos3= right|lat3_deg=51|lat3_min = 02|lon3_deg = 2|lon3_min = 23\n|label5 = Brussels|pos5=left|lat5_deg=50|lat5_min =51 |lon5_deg = 4 |lon5_min = 21\n|label6 = Leuven|pos6=top|lat6_deg=50|lat6_min =53 |lon6_deg = 4 |lon6_min = 42\n|label7=  Valenciennes|pos7= right|lat7_deg = 50|lat7_min = 21|lon7_deg = 3|lon7_min = 34\n|label8 = Maastricht|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 50 | lat8_min = 51 | lon8_deg = 5 | lon8_min = 41\n|label9= Corbie|pos9 = top|lat9_deg = 50|lat9_min = 00|lon9_deg = 2 | lon9_min = 30\n|label10= Lens|pos10 = top|lat10_deg = 50|lat10_min = 33|lon10_deg = 3 | lon10_min = 54\n|label11= Arras|pos11=right|lat11_deg=50|lat11_min = 18|lon11_deg = 2|lon11_min = 47\n}}\nIn May, a French army of 27,000 advanced into the Spanish Netherlands, defeating a smaller Spanish force at [[Battle of Les Avins|Les Avins]], before linking up with the Dutch. Outnumbered, the [[Cardinal-Infante_Ferdinand_of_Austria|Cardinal-Infante]] withdrew into [[Leuven]]; by the time the [[Siege_of_Leuven|siege began]] on 24 June, desertions reduced the French to under 17,000, and they withdrew in early July. After the loss of [[Siege_of_Schenkenschans|Schenkenschans]] on 28 July, the Dutch also withdrew from the Spanish Netherlands.{{sfn|Van Nimwegen|2014|pp=169-170}} \n\nThis failure meant the [[States_General_of_the_Netherlands|States-General]] opposed further large scale land operations, and instead prioritised attacks on Spanish trade.{{sfn|Israel|1995|p=934}} In 1636, a Spanish offensive reached [[Corbie]] in Northern France; although it caused panic in [[Paris]], lack of supplies forced them to retreat, and it was not repeated. Spain's focus was to recover territories in the [[Low Countries]], and repulse [[Battle_of_Tornavento|Franco-Savoyard attacks in Lombardy]].{{sfn|Israel|1995|pp=272-273}}       \n\nAs agreed at Compi\u00e8gne in 1635, the French replaced Swedish garrisons in Alsace; prior to his death in 1639, Bernard of Saxe-Weimar won a series of victories in the Rhineland, the most important being the [[Battle_of_Breisach|capture of Breisach]] in December 1638.{{sfn|Bely|2014|pp=94-95}} This severed the Spanish Road, forcing Spain to reinforce their armies by sea, where the Dutch had maritime supremacy; in 1639, they destroyed a large supply convoy at [[Battle_of_the_Downs|the Downs]]. They also attacked [[Portuguese_Empire|Portuguese possessions]] in Africa and the Americas, then part of the Spanish Empire; [[Madrid]]'s inability to prevent this caused increasing unrest in Portugal.{{sfn|Costa|2005|p=4}}\n{{Location map many|Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|caption = 1635-1648; key locations Rhineland campaign|relief=yes|border = black| width = 200| float = left\n|label =  Breisach|pos=right|lat_deg= 48|lat_min= 02|lon_deg = 7|lon_min = 35\n|label5 = Rheinfelden|pos5=right|lat5_deg=47|lat5_min =33 |lon5_deg = 7 |lon5_min = 48\n|label6 = Mergentheim |pos6=bottom  |lat6_deg=49|lat6_min =30|lon6_deg = 09|lon6_min = 46\n|label7=  Mannheim|pos7= left|lat7_deg = 49|lat7_min = 29|lon7_deg = 8|lon7_min = 28\n|label8 = Tuttlingen|pos8 = right|lat8_deg = 47 | lat8_min = 59 | lon8_deg = 8 | lon8_min = 49\n|label9= Zusmarshausen|pos9 = left|lat9_deg = 48|lat9_min = 23|lon9_deg = 10 | lon9_min = 35\n|label10= N\u00f6rdlingen |pos10 = left|lat10_deg = 48|lat10_min = 51|lon10_deg = 10| lon10_min = 29\n}}\nThroughout the 1630s, attempts by the [[Crown of Castile]] to increase taxes and centralise control led to protests; in 1640, these became revolts in [[Portuguese_Restoration_War|Portugal]] and [[Reapers'_War|Catalonia]]. In 1641, the [[Catalan Courts]] recognised Louis XIII as [[Count of Barcelona]], and ruler of the [[Principality of Catalonia]].{{sfn|Van Gelderen|2002|p=284}} However, Catalans found French administration differed little from that of Castile, and the war became a three sided contest between the rural peasantry, the Spanish, and the French and Catalan elite.{{sfn|Mitchell|2005|pp=431-448}}\n\nOn 14 May 1643, Louis XIII died; his five year old son, [[Louis_XIV_of_France|Louis XIV]], became king, his mother, [[Anne of Austria]], taking control of the Regency Council that ruled in his name. Five days later, [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9, then known as the duc d'Enghien]], defeated the Spanish [[Army of Flanders]] at [[Battle of Rocroi|Rocroi]]; less decisive than often thought, the loss of this highly experienced unit ended Spanish dominance of the European battlefield.{{sfn|Black|2002|p=147}} Cond\u00e9, a member of the royal family, and effective ruler of large parts of eastern France, used it as leverage in his struggle for political control with Anne, and [[Cardinal Mazarin]].{{sfn|Wilson|2009|pp=666-668}}\n\nDespite limited success in Northern France and the Spanish Netherlands, including victory at [[Battle of Lens|Lens]] in August 1648, France was unable to knock Spain out of the war. In Germany, Imperial victories at [[Battle_of_Tuttlingen|Tuttlingen]] and [[Battle_of_Herbsthausen|Mergentheim]] were offset by French success at [[Battle_of_N\u00f6rdlingen_(1645)|N\u00f6rdlingen]] and [[Battle_of_Zusmarshausen|Zusmarshausen]]. In Italy, Franco-Savoyard offensives against the Spanish-ruled [[Duchy of Milan]] achieved little, partly due to the disruption caused by the 1639 to 1642 [[Piedmontese Civil War]]. Victory at [[Battle_of_Orbetello|Orbetello]] in June 1646, and the recapture of [[Neapolitan_Republic_(1647)|Naples]] in 1647 left Spain firmly in control of this region.{{sfn|Paoletti|2007|pp=27-28}}\n\nThe 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]] ended the Thirty Years War and recognised Dutch independence, ending the drain on Spanish resources.

From 1654 to 1656, French victories at [[Battle of Arras (1654)|Arras]], [[Landrecies]] and [[Saint-Ghislain]] were offset by Spanish success at [[Pavia|Pavia, in Lombardy]], and [[Battle of Valenciennes (1656)|Valenciennes]]. Under pressure from [[Pope Alexander VII]], Mazarin offered peace terms, but refused to accept Spain's insistence Cond\u00e9 must be restored to his French titles and lands.{{sfn|Inglis Jones|1994|pp=296-300}} Philip viewed this as a personal obligation, and with the war apparently going his way, rejected talks.{{sfn|Black|1991|p=16}}    \n\nPrior to the 1660s, France lacked a powerful navy of its own, and instead relied on the Dutch, who ceased to provide this after 1648. Since 1654, Spain had been involved in a [[Anglo-Spanish_War_(1654\u20131660)|naval conflict]] with the [[Commonwealth_of_England|English Commonwealth]], and in 1657, Mazarin negotiated an [[Treaty_of_Paris_(1657)|Anglo-French alliance]]. France was required to end its backing for the exiled [[Charles_II_of_England|Charles II]], some of whose supporters joined the Spanish as a result.{{sfn|Quainton |1935|p=268}} \n\n1658 featured an Anglo-French offensive in North Flanders, whose main objective was [[Dunkirk]], a centre for Spanish [[privateer]] attacks on English shipping.{{efn|Its location meant ships based in Dunkirk could enter the [[North Sea]] on a single flood tide, allowing them to raid as far north as the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]]; its closure was a British objective for centuries.{{sfn|Bromley |1987|p=233}}}} After the [[Siege_of_Dunkirk_(1658)|loss of Dunkirk]] in June, Spain requested a truce, which Mazarin initially refused. However, Cromwell's death led to political chaos in England, while French allies Savoy and [[Duchy_of_Modena_and_Reggio|Modena]] ended the war in Northern Italy by agreeing a truce with the Spanish commander, [[Luis de Benavides Carrillo, Marquis of Caracena|Caracena]].{{sfn|Hanlon|2016|p=134}}\n\n==Treaty of the Pyrenees and marriage contract==\n[[File:Louis, Grand Cond\u00e9.PNG|thumb|left|upright|[[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9|Cond\u00e9]]; exiled in 1651, his restoration was a major obstacle to peace]]\nOn 8 May 1659, France and Spain began negotiating terms; the death of [[Oliver Cromwell]] in September 1658 weakened England, which was allowed to observe, but excluded from the talks. Although the [[Anglo-Spanish_War_(1654\u20131660)|Anglo-Spanish War]] was suspended after the 1660 [[The_Restoration|restoration of Charles II]], it did not formally end until the 1667 [[Treaty_of_Madrid_(1667)|Treaty of Madrid]].{{sfn|Davenport| Paullin|1917|p=50}}\n\nUnder the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], signed on November 5, 1659, France gained [[Artois]] and [[French_Hainaut|Hainaut]] along its border with the Spanish Netherlands, as well as [[Northern_Catalonia|Roussillon, or Northern Catalonia]]. These were more significant than often assumed; in combination with the 1648 Treaty of M\u00fcnster, France strengthened its borders in the east and south-west, while in 1662, Charles II [[Sale_of_Dunkirk|sold Dunkirk to France]].

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an high-schooler [[elf]] lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died of a severe illness shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, during which Barley reveals to Ian that he was unable to emotionally bring himself to say goodbye to his father when he was dying in the hospital years before. They surface to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian, fed up with Barley\u2019s recklessness, lashes out at him for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to finally give his proper goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\".

Ian and the goat girl come across a booth hosted by three evil mermaids. The mermaids sing their mesmerizing song to lure the two into staying in one of three houses put for rent. Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak. When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance, the mermaids place them in one of the houses. The house they are in starts to sink into the ground.\n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley. The scene itself was removed because the filmmakers felt it was too grim.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ew.com/movies/onward-deleted-scene-sirens-jenny-tom-holland | title=Exclusive: 'Onward' deleted scene summons sirens and a lost character | access-date=April 2, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328104405/https://ew.com/movies/onward-deleted-scene-sirens-jenny-tom-holland/ | archive-date=March 28, 2020 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/onward-deleted-scene-features-a-capitalist-twist-on-the-1842526629 | title=Onward Deleted Scene Features a Capitalist Twist on the Siren Song | access-date=April 3, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200331032039/https://io9.gizmodo.com/onward-deleted-scene-features-a-capitalist-twist-on-the-1842526629 | archive-date=March 31, 2020 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Theatrical===\n''Onward'' premiered at the [[70th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 21, 2020<ref name=premiere>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2020/01/berlin-film-festival-lineup-competition-announced-revealed-live-1202845048/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|last=Wiseman|first=Andreas|date=January 29, 2020|title=Berlin Competition Lineup: Kelly Reichardt, Sally Potter, Abel Ferrara, Christian Petzold; Disney's 'Onward' & Hillary Clinton Also Heading To Fest|accessdate=February 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200130153631/https://deadline.com/2020/01/berlin-film-festival-lineup-competition-announced-revealed-live-1202845048/|archive-date=January 30, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and was released in the United States on March 6.<ref name=\"VarietyDec2018\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/film/news/chris-pratt-tom-holland-julia-louis-dreyfus-octavia-spencer-onward-1203088174/ |title=Chris Pratt, Tom Holland, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer to Voice Pixar's 'Onward' |last1=McNary |first1=Dave |date=December 12, 2018 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]  |accessdate=December 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181212222451/https://variety.com/2018/film/news/chris-pratt-tom-holland-julia-louis-dreyfus-octavia-spencer-onward-1203088174/|archive-date=December 12, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> A new short film titled ''[[Playdate with Destiny]]'', centered around [[Maggie Simpson]] of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', appears before the feature film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.slashfilm.com/simpsons-short-film/|title=New 'The Simpsons' Short Film To Play In Theaters In Front of Pixar's 'Onward'|date=February 28, 2020|access-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228181730/https://www.slashfilm.com/simpsons-short-film/|archive-date=February 28, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B9GRqCFnI6M/|title=Maggie Simpson is speechless...

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> The gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]], which had forced most movie theaters to shut down within several weeks after Onward's release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/ |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an high-schooler [[elf]] lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died of a severe illness shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements.

Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, during which Barley reveals to Ian that he was unable to emotionally bring himself to say goodbye to his father when he was dying in the hospital years before. They surface to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian, fed up with Barley\u2019s recklessness, lashes out at him for leading them on a [[wild goose chase]] and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to finally give his proper goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, Ian and Barley have a better relationship with Colt, and the brothers continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |work=Pixar Post |access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

The house they are in starts to sink into the ground.\n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley.

In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> The gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]], which had forced most movie theaters to shut down within several weeks after Onward's release.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/ |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

He worked as a senior civil servant at the [[Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (France)|Inspectorate General of Finances]] and later became an [[investment banker]] at [[Rothschild & Co]].\n\nMacron was appointed a deputy secretary general by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] shortly after [[2012 French presidential election|his election]] in May 2012, making Macron one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was later appointed to the [[French cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy and Industry]] in August 2014 by [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Manuel Valls]]. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned from the Cabinet in August 2016, launching a campaign for the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]]. Although Macron had been a member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016, [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!|En Marche]].\n\nThough initially behind in opinion polls, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating [[Marine Le Pen]]. He quickly appointed [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] as prime minister, and in the [[2017 French legislative election|legislative elections]] a month later, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM), secured a majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]].

mi\u0283\u025bl f\u0281ede\u0281ik mak\u0281\u0254\u0303|lang}}; born 21 December 1977) is a French politician who has been [[President of France]] and ''ex officio'' [[Co-Prince of Andorra]] since 14 May 2017.\n\nBorn in [[Amiens]], Macron studied [[philosophy]] at [[Paris Nanterre University]], later completing a master's degree in public affairs at [[Sciences Po]] and graduating from the [[\u00c9cole nationale d'administration]] in 2004. He worked as a senior civil servant at the [[Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des finances (France)|Inspectorate General of Finances]] and later became an [[investment banker]] at [[Rothschild & Co]].\n\nMacron was appointed a deputy secretary general by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] shortly after [[2012 French presidential election|his election]] in May 2012, making Macron one of Hollande's senior advisers. He was later appointed to the [[French cabinet|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of the Economy, Finances and Industry (France)|Minister of the Economy and Industry]] in August 2014 by [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Manuel Valls]]. In this role, Macron championed a number of business-friendly reforms. He resigned from the Cabinet in August 2016, launching a campaign for the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]]. Although Macron had been a member of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] from 2006 to 2009, he ran in the election under the banner of a centrist political movement he founded in April 2016, [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!|En Marche]].\n\nThough initially behind in opinion polls, Macron topped the ballot in the first round of voting, and was elected President of France on 7 May 2017 with 66.1% of the vote in the second round, defeating [[Marine Le Pen]]. He quickly appointed [[\u00c9douard Philippe]] as prime minister, and in the [[2017 French legislative election|legislative elections]] a month later, Macron's party, renamed \"La R\u00e9publique En Marche!\" (LREM), secured a majority in the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. At the age of 39, Macron became the youngest president in [[History of France|French history]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Amiens]], Emmanuel Jean-Michel Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Macron is the son of Fran\u00e7oise Macron (n\u00e9e Nogu\u00e8s), a [[physician]], and [[Jean-Michel Macron]], professor of [[neurology]] at the [[University of Picardy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/politique/dans-un-livre-anne-fulda-raconte-macron-cote-intime-3297407 |accessdate=25 April 2017 |date=21 April 2017 |title=Dans un livre, Anne Fulda raconte Macron c\u00f4t\u00e9 intime|publisher=JDD \u00e0 la Une |language=fr }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Badeau|first=Kevin|title=Le livre qui raconte l'intimit\u00e9 d'Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/editos-analyses/0211955006642-le-livre-qui-raconte-lintimite-demmanuel-macron-2078386.php|newspaper=Les Echos|date=7 April 2017|accessdate=20 May 2017}}</ref> The couple divorced in 2010.

In 1582, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] declared the [[Gregorian calendar]] widely used today, correcting the error by a deletion of 10 days. The Gregorian calendar reform also (in effect) restored 1 January as New Year's Day. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|until 1752]].

This is normally on 14 April or 15 April, depending on the leap year. Elsewhere in northern/central India, the [[Vikram Samvat]] calendar is followed. According to that, the new year day is the first day of the Chaitra Month, also known as Chaitra Shukla Pratipada or [[Gudi Padwa]].

Unlike most other calendar systems in India, the New Year's Day on the [[Malayalam Calendar]] is not based on any astronomical event. It is just the first day of the first of the 12 months on the [[Malayalam Calendar]].

The astrological time difference between the New Year and the passing year (''nonagathe'') is celebrated with several Buddhist rituals and customs that are to be concentrated on, which are exclusive of all types of 'work'. After Buddhist rituals and traditions are attended to, Sinhala and Tamil New Year-based social gatherings and festive parties with the aid of firecrackers, and fireworks would be organised.

Romans had long dated their years by [[list of Roman consuls|these consulships]], rather than sequentially, and making the kalends of January start the new year aligned this dating.

These days were also [[astronomy|astronomically]] and [[astrology|astrologically]] significant since, at the time of the [[Julian reform]], 25 March had been understood as the [[spring equinox (Northern Hemisphere)|spring equinox]] and 25 December as the [[winter solstice]].

By the sixteenth century, the drift from the observed [[equinox]] had become unacceptable. In 1582, [[Pope Gregory XIII]] declared the [[Gregorian calendar]] widely used today, correcting the error by a deletion of 10 days. The Gregorian calendar reform also (in effect) restored 1 January as New Year's Day. Although most Catholic countries adopted the Gregorian calendar almost immediately, it was only gradually adopted among Protestant countries. The British, for example, did not adopt the reformed calendar [[Calendar (New Style) Act 1750|until 1752]]. Until then, the [[British Empire]] {{snd}} and its American colonies {{snd}} still celebrated the new year on 25 March.\n\nMost nations of Western Europe officially adopted 1 January as New Year's Day somewhat before they adopted the Gregorian Calendar.
