It is the successor to the 2012 video game ''[[Far Cry 3]]'', and the fourth main installment in the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in [[role-playing game]]s, such as a branching storyline, and side quests. The game also features a map editor both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.\n\nAnnounced in May 2014, development on ''Far Cry 4'' began immediately after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to ''Far Cry 3'' that continues ''3''<nowiki/>'s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of ''Far Cry 4'' were inspired by the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' and ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]''. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by [[Ubisoft Toronto]]. The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and  [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2014.\n\n''Far Cry 4'' was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A successor, ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', was released in March 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Far Cry 4'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the [[fictional country]] of Kyrat. Ajay may utilize various short and long range firearms, including [[Pistol|pistols]], [[Revolver|revolvers]], [[Shotgun|shotguns]], [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], [[Submachine gun|submachine guns,]] [[Bow and arrow|bows]], a [[flamethrower]], [[Rocket launcher|rocket launchers]], [[Grenade launcher|grenade launchers]], and [[Sniper rifle|sniper]] rifles. More powerful versions of these weapons become available after considerable progression through the game. Throwable weapons include [[Grenade|fragmentation grenades]], [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov cocktails]], and [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]].  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 The Gun Show|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 23, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322120526/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or up-close.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|title=Far Cry 4 Review: Surviving War and Wildlife|first=Steven|last=Wong|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910085311/http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike previous installments in the series, ''Far Cry 4'' gives players the ability to kick objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|title=Far Cry 4 gameplay footage shows co-op, grapple hook, kicking|first=Robert|last=Purchase|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910041405/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> \n[[File:Far Cry 4 gameplay screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|right|In ''Far Cry 4'', players have the ability to ride on elephants.]]\nPlayers can use a variety of methods to approach missions.

Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies.

After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul \"De Pleur\" Harmon ([[Travis Willingham]]), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar ([[Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic]]), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.\n\nHowever the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita ([[Janina Gavankar]]), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.\n\nAs the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley ([[Alain Goulem]]), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.\n\nAjay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother.{{efn|The ''Escape from Durgesh Prison'' downloadable content takes place at this point in the story.}} The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.\n\n===Endings===\nAjay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Mohan sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together: Lakshmana, Ajay's [[half-sister]]. Mohan killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands. The player can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with. If Amita is placed in charge, she turns Kyrat into an [[authoritarian]] drug state, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields, and [[Conscription|conscripting]] [[Child soldiers|children]] into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army; Ajay also learns that she has had her sister, Bhadra, taken away, \"never to come again\". If Sabal is placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a patriarchal fundamentalist theocracy where all of Amita's supporters are executed, women are denied fundamental political rights, and Bhadra is anointed as a religious symbol for the country to rally around. The player has the choice to kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.\n\nAn [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table in Pagan's mansion; when Pagan returns, he thanks Ajay for being a \"gentleman\" and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history. After Ajay plants his mother's ashes at the shrine, Pagan invites Ajay to join him to \"finally shoot some goddamn guns\".<ref>Good, Owen. (November 15, 2014).

After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called \"The Relic\". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.\n\n===''Valley of the Yetis''===\n''Valley of the Yetis'' is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after ''Escape from Durgesh Prison''.\n\nIn his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a [[cult]] worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into \"Awakened\", or [[yeti]]s, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.\n-->\n\n==Development==\nThe game's development was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], which took over the development of the ''Far Cry'' franchise after the release of ''[[Far Cry: Instincts]]'' in 2005. Additional development was handled by four other in-house Ubisoft studios, [[Ubisoft Toronto]], [[Red Storm Entertainment]], [[Ubisoft Shanghai]], and [[Ubisoft Kiev]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-release-date-kyrat/|title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 Welcome To Kyrat|first=Gary|last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018162348/http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-release-date-kyrat/|archive-date=October 18, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The Montreal studio worked on the game's campaign, the Toronto studio worked on the Shangri-La segments of the campaign, Red Storm handled the development of the competitive multiplayer, the Shanghai studio worked on the hunting missions, and the Kiev studio developed the game's PC version.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\">{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/10/14/how-ubisoft-aims-to-dominate-shooter-open-worlds-with-far-cry-4-interview/2/|title=How Ubisoft aims to dominate open-world shooters with Far Cry 4 (interview)|first=Dean|last=Takahashi|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309022749/http://venturebeat.com/2014/10/14/how-ubisoft-aims-to-dominate-shooter-open-worlds-with-far-cry-4-interview/2/|archive-date=March 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>  Development of the game began in late 2012, after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]''.

The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would expand upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as ''Far Cry 3''<nowiki/>'s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters. The team adapted a \"we want it all\" approach, in which they hoped to experiment with all kinds of ideas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=Far Cry 3.5 was a thing \u2013 for about four days, says Ubisoft|first=Stephany|last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=October 15, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815200713/http://www.vg247.com/2014/10/15/far-cry-4-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|archive-date=August 15, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some team members hoped that the game would allow players to fly, which led to the game's verticality.<ref name=\"FarCry3.5\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|title=Why Far Cry 4 Isn't Just Far Cry 3.5|first=Gary|last=Steinman|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|date=October 14, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911184709/http://blog.ubi.com/far-cry-4-isnt-just-far-cry-3-5/|archive-date=September 11, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The game's director also hoped that players would be able to ride a rampaging elephant, in a place with \"exotic mountainsides\" and \"unique culture\".

The decision to bring the two back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.<ref name=\"DSInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|title=Far Cry 4 interview: Alex Hutchinson on Kyrat, Pagan Min and co-op|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906103649/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSome of the gameplay elements were directly taken from ''Far Cry 3''. Exotic locations, hunting, and the freedom for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in ''Far Cry 4''. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make ''Far Cry 4'' an evolution for the series. As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|title=Far Cry 4 Creative Director Discusses The Returning Elements of Far Cry 3|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924225150/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of ''Far Cry 3'', and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/>\n\n===Setting and characters===\nThe game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of ''Far Cry 3'', but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|title=Far Cry 4 interview with creative director Alex Hutchinson at E3 2014|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152917/http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identity for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world.<ref name=\"DSInterview\"/> In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|title=Exclusive: Far Cry 4 behind-the-scenes trailer sees developers visit a Hindu temple|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808081634/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio.

The team hoped that players would be \"shocked, amazed and intrigued\" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a \"punk-rock mentality\", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brothers]]'', and Ichi, a character from ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]''. Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired [[Troy Baker]] to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|title=Far Cry 4: The Face Of Evil: A Look At Ubisoft's Controversial Villain|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 13, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325093120/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|archive-date=March 25, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|title=Exploring Far Cry 4's Sadistic, Complicated Villain Pagan Min|first=Justin|last=Haywald|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828062439/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|archive-date=August 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone.

It is mostly made up of gold, red, orange, white and blue.]]\nFor the Shangri-La mission, the team wanted to have a structure similar to ''Far Cry 3'''s  mushroom missions; a game within a game.<ref name=\"FarCry3.5\"/> The Shangri-La missions are not related to Kyrat, but play an important role in the game's narrative. When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for ''Far Cry 4'' would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an \"ancient, natural world\". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added \"warmth\" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world.

}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Far Cry 4'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\"/><ref name=\"MCPS4\"/><ref name=\"MCXONE\"/>\n\nThe game's story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is \"less in-your-face\" than that of ''Far Cry 3'''s protagonist [[Jason Brody]]. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Josh Harmon from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Aoife Wilson from [[Eurogamer]] thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nick Tan, from [[Game Revolution]], also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for [[GamesRadar]], thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Mike Splechta from ''GameZone'' praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.<ref name=\"GZ\"/>\n\nThe game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long [[draw distance]].<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Ludwig Kietzmann from [[Joystiq]] praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.<ref name=\"Joystiq2\"/>\n\nThe game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from ''Far Cry 3'' and was uninspiring. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''<nowiki/>'s Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from [[IGN]], praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> [[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.<ref name=\"Poly\"/>\n\nThe game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', and called it \"skippable\". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Bertz from ''Game Informer'' also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> In contrast, ''GameZone''{{'s}} Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was \"a surprise\" for him.<ref name=\"GZ\"/> Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nHarmon thought that ''Far Cry 4'' was an improvement over ''Far Cry 3'', but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to ''Far Cry 3'', and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for ''Far Cry 4'' is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by ''Far Cry 4'' did not stray far away from ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to ''Far Cry 3'', but also other Ubisoft franchises like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Watch Dogs]]''.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by ''Far Cry 4'' was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nUbisoft expected the game to sell at least six million copies in its first year of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-goes-gold-ubisoft-expecting-6-million-sa/1100-6423284/|title=Far Cry 4 Goes Gold, Ubisoft Expecting 6 Million Sales in First Year|author=Eddie Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 30, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213033151/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-goes-gold-ubisoft-expecting-6-million-sa/1100-6423284/|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Far Cry 4'' became the fastest-selling game and the most successful launch in the series in the first week of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/far_cry_4/news/far_cry_4_is_the_fastest-selling_game_in_the_series_so_far.html|title=Far Cry 4 is the fastest-selling game in the series so far|author=David Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213054038/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/far_cry_4/news/far_cry_4_is_the_fastest-selling_game_in_the_series_so_far.html|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Far Cry 4'' was the second best selling game in the United Kingdom for all-formats during the week of its release, only behind ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/gta_5/news/uk_video_game_chart_gta_5_is_the_uks_no_1_ahead_of_far_cry_4.html|title=UK Video Game Chart: GTA 5 is the UK's No.1 ahead of Far Cry 4|first=James|last=Orry|work=VideoGamer.com|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705202429/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/gta_5/news/uk_video_game_chart_gta_5_is_the_uks_no_1_ahead_of_far_cry_4.html|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also the sixth best selling game in the US according to [[The NPD Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/xbox-one-the-best-selling-console-in-the-us-and-uk-in-november|title=Xbox One: The Best Selling Console In The US (And UK) In December|first=Colin|last=Moriarty|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910103408/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/xbox-one-the-best-selling-console-in-the-us-and-uk-in-november|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As of December 31, 2014, the game has shipped seven million copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ubisoft\u00ae reports third quarter 2014\u201315 sales|url=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/pressrelease_downloadablemm_20150212_050959_ubisoftq3fy15englishfinaltcm99193930.pdf|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|access-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213212843/https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/pressrelease_downloadablemm_20150212_050959_ubisoftq3fy15englishfinaltcm99193930.pdf|archive-date=February 13, 2015|date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe game received the Best Shooter Award from [[IGN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/best-of-games-genre/shooter|title=Best Games, By Genre|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VT1Px2O3?url=http://www.ign.com/lists/best-of-games-genre/shooter|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was nominated for Best Artistic Achievement, Best Game Design, Best Music, Best Performer (Troy Baker), and Best Story at the [[11th British Academy Games Awards]].

It is the successor to the 2012 video game ''[[Far Cry 3]]'', and the fourth main installment in the ''[[Far Cry]]'' series. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country. The main story follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American, as he is caught in a civil war involving Kyrat's Royal Army, controlled by tyrannical king Pagan Min, and a rebel movement called the Golden Path. Gameplay focuses on combat and exploration; players battle enemy soldiers and dangerous wildlife using a wide array of weapons. The game features many elements found in [[role-playing game]]s, such as a branching storyline, and side quests. The game also features a map editor both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes.\n\nAnnounced in May 2014, development on ''Far Cry 4'' began immediately after the shipment of ''[[Assassin's Creed III]]'' in late 2012. The team originally intended to develop a direct sequel to ''Far Cry 3'' that continues ''3''<nowiki/>'s story, but the idea was later scrapped and the team decided to develop a new setting and new story for the game. Certain aspects of ''Far Cry 4'' were inspired by the [[Nepalese Civil War]], and the costume of the game's antagonist Pagan Min was inspired by Japanese films ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' and ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]''. The game's competitive multiplayer was created by [[Red Storm Entertainment]] while the Shangri-La segments in the campaign were handled by [[Ubisoft Toronto]]. The game was released for the [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], and  [[Microsoft Windows]] in November 2014.\n\n''Far Cry 4'' was met with a mostly positive critical reception upon release. Critics praised the open world design, visuals, soundtrack, and characters, particularly antagonist Pagan Min, as well as new gameplay additions and the wealth of content. However, some critics disliked the story and found the game too similar to its predecessor. The game was a commercial success, selling seven million copies by the end of 2014, and was the biggest launch in the franchise's history. Several releases of downloadable content were subsequently published. A successor, ''[[Far Cry 5]]'', was released in March 2018.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Far Cry 4'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the [[fictional country]] of Kyrat. Ajay may utilize various short and long range firearms, including [[Pistol|pistols]], [[Revolver|revolvers]], [[Shotgun|shotguns]], [[Assault rifle|assault rifles]], [[Submachine gun|submachine guns,]] [[Bow and arrow|bows]], a [[flamethrower]], [[Rocket launcher|rocket launchers]], [[Grenade launcher|grenade launchers]], and [[Sniper rifle|sniper]] rifles. More powerful versions of these weapons become available after considerable progression through the game. Throwable weapons include [[Grenade|fragmentation grenades]], [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov cocktails]], and [[Throwing knife|throwing knives]].  <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|title=Far Cry 4 \u2013 The Gun Show|work=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 23, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322120526/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjYmryqBrc|archive-date=March 22, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or up-close.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|title=Far Cry 4 Review: Surviving War and Wildlife|first=Steven|last=Wong|work=[[Shacknews]]|date=November 18, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910085311/http://www.shacknews.com/article/87165/far-cry-4-review-surviving-war-and-wildlife|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike previous installments in the series, ''Far Cry 4'' gives players the ability to kick objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|title=Far Cry 4 gameplay footage shows co-op, grapple hook, kicking|first=Robert|last=Purchase|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910041405/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-06-10-far-cry-4-gameplay-footage-shows-co-op-grapple-hook-kicking|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> \n[[File:Far Cry 4 gameplay screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|right|In ''Far Cry 4'', players have the ability to ride on elephants.]]\nPlayers can use a variety of methods to approach missions.

Players can earn experience points by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call in support and back-up from members of the Golden Path.<ref name=\"PCTrailer\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-14-why-ajay-ghale-isnt-the-real-star-of-far-cry-4|title=Why Ajay Ghale isn't the real star of Far Cry 4|first=Aoife|last=Wilson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=October 14, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907181857/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-10-14-why-ajay-ghale-isnt-the-real-star-of-far-cry-4|archive-date=September 7, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Players can also gain experience by collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and [[prayer wheel]]s.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> There is also an Arena mode, in which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4s-arena-mode-is-a-gladiator-style-humans-/1100-6422371/|title=Far Cry 4's Arena Mode Is a Gladiator-Style, Humans vs. Animals Affair|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 17, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906190759/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4s-arena-mode-is-a-gladiator-style-humans-/1100-6422371/|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Far Cry 4'' features a [[co-operative gameplay|co-operative multiplayer]] mode known as \"Guns for Hire\", which supports up to two players.

The game follows Ajay Ghale, a young Kyrati-American who returns to his native country of Kyrat (a fictional [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] country derived from the [[Kirati people|Kirat]] ethnicities of Nepal and northern India) to spread his deceased mother's ashes. Kyrat was once an autonomous state in the Himalayas ruled by a royal family before being engulfed in a series of civil wars. Ajay finds the country in a state of conflict between Kyrat's Royal Army, led by the country's eccentric and tyrannical King Pagan Min, and the Golden Path, a rebel movement fighting to free Kyrat from Min's oppressive rule. The choices Ajay makes will determine the fate of Kyrat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|title=Far Cry 4 story details emerge|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829111422/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-story-details-emerge/1100-6419756/|archive-date=August 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nAfter the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale ([[James A. Woods]]) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min ([[Troy Baker]]), the country's eccentric and violent king, who claims to have been romantically involved with Ishwari. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal ([[Naveen Andrews]]), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Troy Baker SDCC 2019 (48378614692) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1 = Photograph of Troy Baker\n | image2 = MyleneDinhRobic.WikiFr.jpg\n | alt2 = Photograph of Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic\n | footer = Troy Baker and Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic voice two of the game's antagonists}}\nIn the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul \"De Pleur\" Harmon ([[Travis Willingham]]), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar ([[Myl\u00e8ne Dinh-Robic]]), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.\n\nHowever the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita ([[Janina Gavankar]]), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.\n\nAs the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley ([[Alain Goulem]]), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.\n\nAjay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother.{{efn|The ''Escape from Durgesh Prison'' downloadable content takes place at this point in the story.}} The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.\n\n===Endings===\nAjay encounters Pagan, who chastises him for fleeing at the start of the game, claiming that he only ever intended to help Ajay. Pagan offers Ajay a final decision: shoot him now, or listen to him. If Ajay shoots Pagan, the game ends immediately and the credits roll. If Ajay instead chooses to listen, Pagan reveals that Mohan sent Ishwari to spy on Pagan in the early days of the Golden Path, but they fell in love and had a daughter together: Lakshmana, Ajay's [[half-sister]]. Mohan killed Lakshmana for Ishwari's betrayal, and Ishwari killed him in turn before leaving the country with the infant Ajay. Pagan shows Ajay to a shrine containing Lakshmana's ashes, and Ajay places Ishwari's ashes inside. Pagan then boards a helicopter and departs peacefully, leaving the country in Ajay's hands. The player can choose to shoot down Pagan's helicopter as it flies away, killing Pagan in the process.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Golden Path seizes control of Kyrat. The final ending depends on which leader Ajay ultimately sided with. If Amita is placed in charge, she turns Kyrat into an [[authoritarian]] drug state, forcing villagers into work in factories and drug fields, and [[Conscription|conscripting]] [[Child soldiers|children]] into the group as soldiers to bolster their ranks against the remnants of the Royal Army; Ajay also learns that she has had her sister, Bhadra, taken away, \"never to come again\". If Sabal is placed in charge, Kyrat becomes a patriarchal fundamentalist theocracy where all of Amita's supporters are executed, women are denied fundamental political rights, and Bhadra is anointed as a religious symbol for the country to rally around. The player has the choice to kill the Golden Path's leader or leave them alive.\n\nAn [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] ending can be found at the beginning of the game. To trigger it, Ajay must simply wait at the dinner table in Pagan's mansion; when Pagan returns, he thanks Ajay for being a \"gentleman\" and leads him to Lakshmana's shrine, telling Ajay of his family history. After Ajay plants his mother's ashes at the shrine, Pagan invites Ajay to join him to \"finally shoot some goddamn guns\".<ref>Good, Owen. (November 15, 2014).

After tending to Ajay's wounds, Min leaves him in a tower in Northern Kyrat, as he is unable to return Ajay to the Golden Path directly. He then leaks news of Ajay's escape to Sabal and Amita, and allows them to secure a Royal Army helicopter so that they can extract him. However, word of this has spread to Yuma, who marshals the forces loyal to her and plans to attack the landing site once Ajay tries to escape. Because of this, Ajay only has a limited window of opportunity to escape, but can buy more time by attacking Yuma's forces. In exchange for disrupting Yuma's plans for a coup, Min promises Ajay support and resources at the landing site. During his missions, Ajay overhears one of the guards of Yuma saying that she was sent to a valley in the northern mountains of Kyrat on an expedition after something of great power called \"The Relic\". After killing Yuma's lieutenants, disrupting her supply lines, and thwarting her plans to sabotage Min's communications, Ajay ventures to the landing site where he is forced to fight off Yuma's attack long enough for the helicopter to power up. With the landing site secured and Yuma's forces in disarray, Ajay is successfully airlifted out contacts Sabal and Amita saying that he was heading to the valley to learn what is behind the expedition and the Relic.\n\n===''Valley of the Yetis''===\n''Valley of the Yetis'' is a downloadable additional chapter of content which takes place directly after ''Escape from Durgesh Prison''.\n\nIn his way to the Lost Valley to learn more about the expedition Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a [[cult]] worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into \"Awakened\", or [[yeti]]s, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay sees himself as an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.\n-->\n\n==Development==\nThe game's development was led by [[Ubisoft Montreal]], which took over the development of the ''Far Cry'' franchise after the release of ''[[Far Cry: Instincts]]'' in 2005.

The sequel would be set on the same tropical island, would expand upon the protagonist's story, and would bring back characters, such as ''Far Cry 3''<nowiki/>'s secondary antagonist, Vaas. However, after four days, the team found that a sequel was not what they wanted to achieve. As a result, they decided to scrap the idea and build a brand new game with a new setting and a new set of characters.

The decision to bring the two back was made because the team thought that they should provide some references to previous games in the series, as all of the games are set in the same universe even though they are not directly related.<ref name=\"DSInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|title=Far Cry 4 interview: Alex Hutchinson on Kyrat, Pagan Min and co-op|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906103649/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a592636/far-cry-4-interview-alex-hutchinson-on-kyrat-pagan-min-and-co-op.html#~pmnhi0dIkd5ao1|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSome of the gameplay elements were directly taken from ''Far Cry 3''. Exotic locations, hunting, and the freedom for players to complete missions through different approaches were maintained in ''Far Cry 4''. The team hoped that by incorporating and expanding upon on these ideas, while introducing new features, they could make ''Far Cry 4'' an evolution for the series. As a result, the size of the game's outposts became larger and players were given more options to customize their weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|title=Far Cry 4 Creative Director Discusses The Returning Elements of Far Cry 3|first=Cassidee|last=Moser|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924225150/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/far-cry-4-creative-director-discusses-the-returning-elements-of-far-cry-3|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also realized that players spent a lot of time interacting with the open world of ''Far Cry 3'', and decided to put more effort and resources into the world's design and add more quests to the game.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/>\n\n===Setting and characters===\nThe game's setting, Kyrat, is a fictional country in the Himalayas region. When building Kyrat, the developers merged elements from real-world regions including [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]], but exaggerated those elements. The map's size is similar to that of ''Far Cry 3'', but is more dense, diverse, and features more varied environments. The developers hoped that players could experience a sense of exploration when traveling between the different terrains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|title=Far Cry 4 interview with creative director Alex Hutchinson at E3 2014|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=June 11, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152917/http://www.pcgamer.com/far-cry-4-interview-with-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-at-e3-2014/|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team also hoped that the new location could be believable, while remaining interesting for players. As a result, they created an identity for Kyrat by doing such things as adding different signboards to the game and creating a fictional mythology and religion for Kyrat. The game's world was also designed to accommodate new features such as the helicopter and the grappling hook. In an effort to make the world feel real, the team added improvements to the design of side-quests. Instead of simply being activities for players to complete, the quests are narrative-driven, which was done to increase the connection between them and the world.<ref name=\"DSInterview\"/> In order to increase the credibility of the game's world, the studio sent a team to Nepal to experience and record the local culture,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|title=Exclusive: Far Cry 4 behind-the-scenes trailer sees developers visit a Hindu temple|first=Matthew|last=Reynolds|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2014|accessdate=October 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808081634/http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a589108/far-cry-4-behind-the-scenes-trailer-sees-developers-visit-a-hindu-temple.html#~prIxN5ZC6YXODx|archive-date=August 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> so that they could bring those ideas back to the studio.

The team hoped that players would be \"shocked, amazed and intrigued\" by him in every encounter. Min has a complex relationship with the playable character, Ghale, as the team wanted players to guess Min's intentions and add a layer of mystery to him.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> The team originally hoped to have a villain that had a \"punk-rock mentality\", but the idea was abandoned as the team thought that the concept was not original. The pink costume Min wears throughout the game was inspired by Beat Takeshi, a character from ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brothers]]'', and Ichi, a character from ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]''. Min is designed to be sadistic yet confident, and the team hired [[Troy Baker]] to provide the voice for Min, as they thought that Baker's voice is charismatic enough to suit Min.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|title=Far Cry 4: The Face Of Evil: A Look At Ubisoft's Controversial Villain|first=Ben|last=Reeves|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=June 13, 2014|access-date=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325093120/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/far_cry_4/b/xboxone/archive/2014/06/13/the-face-of-evil-a-look-at-far-cry-4-controversial-villain.aspx|archive-date=March 25, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|title=Exploring Far Cry 4's Sadistic, Complicated Villain Pagan Min|first=Justin|last=Haywald|date=September 26, 2014|accessdate=August 25, 2015|work=[[GameSpot]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828062439/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/exploring-far-cry-4s-sadistic-complicated-villain-/1100-6422572/|archive-date=August 28, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> According to Baker, Ubisoft gave him a script for the audition but he chose not to follow it, and instead decided to threaten to cut off the face of an assistant using Min's tone.

The developers also hoped that Ghale could be an accessible character for players.<ref name=\"GI\"/>\n\nIn hindsight, the team considered the story of ''Far Cry 3'' \"great\", even though they thought that it was separated from the game's world. In order to increase players' agency and make the story to feel more connected to the world for players, the team introduced a branching storyline which required players to make choices that would lead to different results and alter the game's ending.<ref name=\"PolyE3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/a/e3-2014/far-cry-4|title=Far Cry's new creative director talks story, co-op and scope|first=Alexa|last=Ray Corriea|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912050849/http://www.polygon.com/a/e3-2014/far-cry-4|archive-date=September 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The team hoped that by adding choices, they could add additional depth and meaning to the game's campaign.

When creating these segments, the team put a lot of emphasis on the use of colors. They hoped that the artistic vision for ''Far Cry 4'' would not feature any resemblance to other typical shooter games. It was originally designed to be a small open world, but was later converted into a linear experience due to time constraints and huge creative differences between developers. The team later decided to simplify it, and re-imagined it into an \"ancient, natural world\". It is made up of five different colors. The main color of Shangri-La is gold; the developers thought that using gold as the foundation added \"warmth\" to the dreamland. Meanwhile, red was used heavily to add a sense of strangeness, as well as for establishing a tie to the game's narrative and story. Orange was used as a color of interaction, while white was used to add purity to the world. Blue is the last of Shangri-La's main colors, and represents dangers and honor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|title=Painting Shangri-La|first=Dave|last=Tach|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=March 16, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812091615/http://www.polygon.com/features/2015/3/16/8219481/shangri-la-far-cry-4-artwork-gallery-gdc-2015|archive-date=August 12, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Multiplayer===\nUbisoft promised that ''Far Cry 4'' would have much more of a multiplayer element than ''Far Cry 3''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|title=Far Cry 4 will have \"a lot more multiplayer\" than Far Cry 3|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 16, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904134739/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-will-have-a-lot-more-multiplayer-than-far-cry-3/1100-6419681/|archive-date=September 4, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Some elements that were scrapped for ''Far Cry 3'' due to time constraints were featured in ''Far Cry 4'', such as the \"Guns for Hire\" co-operative multiplayer mode.<ref name=\"VentureBeat interview\"/> Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting from the beginning of the game's development.

}}</ref>\n}}\n\n''Far Cry 4'' received \"generally favorable\" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].<ref name=\"MCPC\"/><ref name=\"MCPS4\"/><ref name=\"MCXONE\"/>\n\nThe game's story received mixed responses. Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] praised the personality of Ajay Ghale, which is \"less in-your-face\" than that of ''Far Cry 3'''s protagonist [[Jason Brody]]. He also praised the villain, Pagan Min, who he considered took the spotlight every time he appeared in the game.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Josh Harmon from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' thought that the characters in this game had more depth, and that the choices made by players throughout the game were meaningful.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Aoife Wilson from [[Eurogamer]] thought that the game's characters were memorable, but was disappointed by the story.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nick Tan, from [[Game Revolution]], also praised Min's personality, but he complained that the character appeared too seldom in the game.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, writing for [[GamesRadar]], thought that the story grew tiresome as players progressed, even though some of its characters were interesting. He further criticized the game's writing, which he thought was lackluster.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Mike Splechta from ''GameZone'' praised the game's voice acting and applauded its storyline, calling it satisfying.<ref name=\"GZ\"/>\n\nThe game's setting received positive responses. Carter thought that the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised the interesting lore and wildlife found within the world, as well as the game's long [[draw distance]].<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon thought that the hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable.<ref name=\"EGM\"/> Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"EuroG\"/> Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from ''[[Game Informer]]'' praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Ludwig Kietzmann from [[Joystiq]] praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.<ref name=\"Joystiq2\"/>\n\nThe game's design also received acclaim. Carter from Destructoid thought that the fortress and the outpost system provided players with a sense of accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from ''Far Cry 3'' and was uninspiring. ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''<nowiki/>'s Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from [[IGN]], praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> [[Justin McElroy]] of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.<ref name=\"Poly\"/>\n\nThe game's multiplayer mode received mixed response. Carter compared the competitive multiplayer to that of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'', and called it \"skippable\". He considered the co-operative multiplayer a fun addition to the game, but was disappointed by its limitations. He also added that the game would still be a strong title without these multiplayer elements.<ref name=\"Destruct\"/> Bertz from ''Game Informer'' also found the multiplayer shallow and poorly-executed. He also criticized the lack of a large player pool and dedicated servers.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Evans-Thirlwell of GamesRadar thought that the game's co-operative multiplayer were fun to play, but the asymmetrical competitive multiplayer was easy to forget.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> In contrast, ''GameZone''{{'s}} Splechta thought that the competitive multiplayer mode was \"a surprise\" for him.<ref name=\"GZ\"/> Dyer echoed similar statement, and he thought that it had successfully captured the scale and freedom offered by both the game's co-op and campaign.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nHarmon thought that ''Far Cry 4'' was an improvement over ''Far Cry 3'', but he thought that the game felt and played too similarly to ''Far Cry 3'', and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for ''Far Cry 4'' is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by ''Far Cry 4'' did not stray far away from ''Far Cry 3''.<ref name=\"GI\"/> Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to ''Far Cry 3'', but also other Ubisoft franchises like ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Watch Dogs]]''.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/> Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by ''Far Cry 4'' was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel.<ref name=\"GRadar\"/> Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\n===Sales===\nUbisoft expected the game to sell at least six million copies in its first year of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-goes-gold-ubisoft-expecting-6-million-sa/1100-6423284/|title=Far Cry 4 Goes Gold, Ubisoft Expecting 6 Million Sales in First Year|author=Eddie Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 30, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213033151/http://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-4-goes-gold-ubisoft-expecting-6-million-sa/1100-6423284/|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Far Cry 4'' became the fastest-selling game and the most successful launch in the series in the first week of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/far_cry_4/news/far_cry_4_is_the_fastest-selling_game_in_the_series_so_far.html|title=Far Cry 4 is the fastest-selling game in the series so far|author=David Scammell|work=VideoGamer.com|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213054038/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/far_cry_4/news/far_cry_4_is_the_fastest-selling_game_in_the_series_so_far.html|archive-date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> ''Far Cry 4'' was the second best selling game in the United Kingdom for all-formats during the week of its release, only behind ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/gta_5/news/uk_video_game_chart_gta_5_is_the_uks_no_1_ahead_of_far_cry_4.html|title=UK Video Game Chart: GTA 5 is the UK's No.1 ahead of Far Cry 4|first=James|last=Orry|work=VideoGamer.com|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705202429/http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/gta_5/news/uk_video_game_chart_gta_5_is_the_uks_no_1_ahead_of_far_cry_4.html|archive-date=July 5, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also the sixth best selling game in the US according to [[The NPD Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/xbox-one-the-best-selling-console-in-the-us-and-uk-in-november|title=Xbox One: The Best Selling Console In The US (And UK) In December|first=Colin|last=Moriarty|work=[[IGN]]|date=December 11, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910103408/http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/xbox-one-the-best-selling-console-in-the-us-and-uk-in-november|archive-date=September 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> As of December 31, 2014, the game has shipped seven million copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ubisoft\u00ae reports third quarter 2014\u201315 sales|url=https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/pressrelease_downloadablemm_20150212_050959_ubisoftq3fy15englishfinaltcm99193930.pdf|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|access-date=February 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213212843/https://www.ubisoftgroup.com/comsite_common/en-US/images/pressrelease_downloadablemm_20150212_050959_ubisoftq3fy15englishfinaltcm99193930.pdf|archive-date=February 13, 2015|date=February 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Awards===\nThe game received the Best Shooter Award from [[IGN]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/lists/best-of-games-genre/shooter|title=Best Games, By Genre|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=August 26, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VT1Px2O3?url=http://www.ign.com/lists/best-of-games-genre/shooter|archive-date=January 10, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The game was nominated for Best Artistic Achievement, Best Game Design, Best Music, Best Performer (Troy Baker), and Best Story at the [[11th British Academy Games Awards]].
