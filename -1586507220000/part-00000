Located in the Northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], it straddles on the southern shore of an inlet of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Ria de Vigo]], the southernmost of the so-called [[R\u00edas Baixas]]. Vigo is the most populated municipality of the [[province of Pontevedra]] and the whole region as well as also the biggest one in the country without the status of provincial capital.\n\nIt has an area of {{cvt|109.06|km\u00b2}} and had a population of 292,817 in 2016. According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]] the city proper has 198,537 inhabitants, while the rest of the municipal population dwell in a number of rural and suburban parishes.\n\nVigo is, along [[A Coru\u00f1a]], one of [[Economy of Galicia|the region's primary economic agents]], owing in part to the Citro\u00ebn automotive factory and to the [[Port of Vigo]], reportedly the biggest fishing port in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corelngashive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CORE-LNGas-HIVE-Study-of-Demand-Consolidation-Top-Down-Bottom-Up.pdf|title=Consolidation Top down and Bottom up Analysis|page=9}}</ref> Close to the [[Portugal\u2013Spain border]], Vigo is part of the [[Galicia\u2013North Portugal Euroregion]]. The [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] is headquartered in Vigo.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the small village of Vigo was part of the territory of Galician-speaking neighbouring towns, particularly [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], and suffered several [[Vikings|Viking]] attacks. However, its number of inhabitants was so small that, historically, it was not considered a real villa until around the 15th century, when the earliest records began.\n[[File:Battle of Vigo bay october 23 1702.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Vigo Bay]], 1702]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was attacked several times. In 1585 and 1589, during an unsuccessful attack by the English counter-Armada, [[Francis Drake]] raided the city and temporarily occupied it, burning many buildings. Several decades later a [[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet tried to attack the city. As a result, the city's walls were built in 1656 in the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. They are still partially preserved.\n\n[[File:Plano de Vigo, Francisco Coello e Pascual Madoz, 1856.jpg|thumb|right|19th century map of the city, by {{ill|Francisco Coello de Portugal y Quesada|es}}.]]\nAt this time, and in spite of the attacks, Vigo developed its earliest commerce and was given several privileges by the kings of Spain.\n\nIn 1702, the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]] occurred, and in 1719, because a Spanish fleet which departed from Vigo attempted to invade Scotland in support of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], the city was [[Capture of Vigo|occupied for ten days by a British force]].\n\nIn 1808, the [[French Army]] annexed Spain to the [[Napoleonic Empire]], although Vigo remained unconquered until January, 1809. Vigo was also the first city of Galicia to be freed from French rule, in what is annually celebrated on March 28 as the ''Reconquista'' (reconquest from the French in the context of the [[Peninsular War]]). In 1833, the city of [[Pontevedra]] was designated the provincial capital of the [[province of Pontevedra]], within which is Vigo.\n\nVigo grew very rapidly in the 20th century thanks to the fact that the Franco government granted it a tax-free zone in 1947 so that companies could set up there for free and an Industrial Development Pole in 1964, a very unusual case for a non-capital of a Spanish province. Continuous urban-planning changes left Vigo less structured than other Galician cities such as [[Pontevedra]] and [[A Coru\u00f1a]].\n{{Wide image|Vigo_y_su_r\u00eda_(5546327816b).jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Vigo, as seen from the opposite shore of the [[ria]].}}\n\n==Toponym==\n[[File:Bandera de la ciudad de Vigo (39023915704).jpg|thumb|right|The municipal flag waving in the wind, featuring the olive tree.]]\nVigo's urban area is built over both a hill-fort (''[[Castros in Spain|Castro]]'') and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement. It is generally accepted that the name Vigo is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:vicus#Latin|vicus]] spacorum'', meaning \"small village\".\n\nThe standard pronunciation of Vigo in both [[Galician language|Galician]] and Spanish is {{IPA-es|\u02c8bi\u0263o|}}.\n\nVigo has been given the nickname ''cidade ol\u00edvica'' (city of olives). It is said that, after the conflict between the [[Isabel de Castilla]] and [[Juana la Beltraneja]]\u2014where Galician nobility fought for the latter\u2014the victor ordered all of Galicia's [[olive tree]]s to be cut down, as they symbolized peace. She couldn't uproot the tree in Vigo, however, because it was planted in [[Sacred#Sacred ground|sacred ground]]. The tree is represented in the city seal, and a descendant of it is still alive in Vigo's city centre.\n\n==Geography==\n=== Location ===\nIn the northeast, it borders the municipality of [[Redondela]]; in the east, [[Mos (Spain)|Mos]]; in the south, [[O Porri\u00f1o]] and [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]]; and in the southwest, [[Nigr\u00e1n]]. On the other side of its bay are the municipalities of [[Cangas do Morrazo|Cangas]] and [[Moa\u00f1a]]. \n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Las Islas C\u00edes.jpg|thumb|right|The [[C\u00edes Islands]], part of the municipality of Vigo, partially obstruct the access from the [[Ria de Vigo]] to the open seas.]]\nVigo's climate is usually classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). Although Vigo is the rainiest city in Galicia, in actuality, with its noticeable drying trend in the summer, Vigo's climate is more similar to the variant of the oceanic climate commonly seen in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America. Substantial rainfall throughout the year prevents it from being classified as a Mediterranean climate, even though there is a drying trend in summer.\nThe average annual temperature in Vigo is {{convert|14|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Compared to many other Galician towns, Vigo experiences warmer summer temperatures than A Coru\u00f1a and milder winters than inland areas.  This is due to its sheltered location, surrounded by mountains inland and the [[Islas C\u00edes|Illas C\u00edes]] out in the bay towards the sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galiciaguide.com/Vigo-index.html |title=Vigo |publisher=galiciaguide.com |accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> The all-time record high for the city is {{convert|39.7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} set on July 5, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/observacion/ultimosdatos?k=gal&l=1495&w=1&datos=img |title=Vigo |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Vigo is known for its extreme rainfall in winter.

Although within the city one will not find much Romanesque architecture, it can be seen a few kilometers away from the city center. In many of the municipality's neighborhoods and parishes a large number of Roman ruins remain. Such is the importance of the Roman remains in Vigo that many Spanish authors have come to coin the term ''Romanesque Vigo'' (''rom\u00e1nico vigu\u00e9s'' in Spanish).

It is often considered with [[A Coru\u00f1a]] one of the economic and industrial engines of Galicia.\n\nVigo is one of the leading industrial areas in Galicia, with a French car factory, shipyards, and auxiliary industry in both automotive and marine sectors. Situated in Vigo, the French factory [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]] since 1958, in 2007 produced a total of 545,000 vehicles, of which more than 82% were sold outside Spain.\n\nIn addition, Vigo has a [[fishing]] port  and is the home port of one of the world's largest fishing company, [[Pescanova]] and the most important centre of the Galician canned fish industry. The headquarters of the [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] are also located in the city.\n\nThe publishing industry in Galician is prominent in the city, with Editorial Galaxia and Editorial Xerais.\n\n=== Port of Vigo ===\n\nThe [[Port of Vigo]] covers a length of more than 20&nbsp;km and offers more than 9&nbsp;km of docks.

The most important artists of this postmodern movement were musicians; particularly punk and new wave bands such as ''[[Siniestro Total]]'', ''[[Golpes Bajos]]'', ''[[Aerol\u00edneas Federales]]'', ''Semen Up'' or ''[[Os Resentidos]]''.\n\nAt the moment, the city still has notorious bands like [[Iv\u00e1n Ferreiro]] (ex-singer of Los Piratas) and Mon.\n\n===Media and entertainment===\n[[File:Faro de Vigo, 1853, 3 de noviembre.jpg|thumb|Frontpage of a 1853 issue of the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]''.]]\nVigo has two daily newspapers; the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]'', the oldest newspaper in Spain still in circulation, and the ''[[Atl\u00e1ntico Diario]]'', a little local newspaper.

Vigo also participated in the Europeanwide free newspapers rush led by \"[[Metro International|Metro]]\" and some free journals were published in 1990s and 2000s: \"[[20 minutos]]\", \"Gaceta Universitaria\", \"Redacci\u00f3n Xove\", etcetera. \"Espa\u00f1a Exterior\" is also printed in Vigo.\n\nThe locally produced award-winning feature movie ''[[Mondays In The Sun]]'' (original title ''Los lunes al sol'') depicts the life of several men who have lost their work at the [[Port of Vigo]].

Institutions such as the ''Real Club Nautico de Vigo'' (RCNV), founded in 1906, and the Liceo Mar\u00edtimo de Bouzas (LMB), founded in 1907, are good examples of promotion of the nautical sports, especially sailing.\n[[File:Regata en la Ria de Vigo (1827331441).jpg|thumb|right|Regatta in the [[Ria de Vigo]].]]\n\nThe RCNV organises important events like Atlantic Week, which in September 2006 included the World Championship of the Platu 25 class. Every August, the RCNV also organises one of the largest sailboat races in the Iberian peninsula: the ''Regata R\u00edas Baixas''. In 2006 more than 130 different boats participated.\n\nThe LMB is a yacht club which counts around 400 associates. The LMB has a long and intense history of sailing and recreational fishing. The LMB organizes two important regattas in the Galician sailing calendar: the ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' and a ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos''.\n\nThe ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' honours the neighbourhood where the LMB is located. The ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos'' is sponsored by the firm Aister and is for crews of one and two members. It is a difficult race with two stages; the first consists of a race through the coastal bay of Vigo while the second stage is a longer race around the [[Cies Islands]] (and/or Ons Islands). The LMB has schools of sailing and fishing.

Located in the Northwest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], it straddles on the southern shore of an inlet of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Ria de Vigo]], the southernmost of the so-called [[R\u00edas Baixas]]. Vigo is the most populated municipality of the [[province of Pontevedra]] and the whole region as well as also the biggest one in the country without the status of provincial capital.\n\nIt has an area of {{cvt|109.06|km\u00b2}} and had a population of 292,817 in 2016. According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica (Spain)|Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]] the city proper has 198,537 inhabitants, while the rest of the municipal population dwell in a number of rural and suburban parishes.\n\nVigo is, along [[A Coru\u00f1a]], one of [[Economy of Galicia|the region's primary economic agents]], owing in part to the Citro\u00ebn automotive factory and to the [[Port of Vigo]], reportedly the biggest fishing port in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://corelngashive.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CORE-LNGas-HIVE-Study-of-Demand-Consolidation-Top-Down-Bottom-Up.pdf|title=Consolidation Top down and Bottom up Analysis|page=9}}</ref> Close to the [[Portugal\u2013Spain border]], Vigo is part of the [[Galicia\u2013North Portugal Euroregion]]. The [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] is headquartered in Vigo.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], the small village of Vigo was part of the territory of Galician-speaking neighbouring towns, particularly [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], and suffered several [[Vikings|Viking]] attacks. However, its number of inhabitants was so small that, historically, it was not considered a real villa until around the 15th century, when the earliest records began.\n[[File:Battle of Vigo bay october 23 1702.jpg|thumb|left|[[Battle of Vigo Bay]], 1702]]\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, the city was attacked several times. In 1585 and 1589, during an unsuccessful attack by the English counter-Armada, [[Francis Drake]] raided the city and temporarily occupied it, burning many buildings. Several decades later a [[Turkey|Turkish]] fleet tried to attack the city. As a result, the city's walls were built in 1656 in the reign of [[Philip IV of Spain]]. They are still partially preserved.\n\n[[File:Plano de Vigo, Francisco Coello e Pascual Madoz, 1856.jpg|thumb|right|19th century map of the city, by {{ill|Francisco Coello de Portugal y Quesada|es}}.]]\nAt this time, and in spite of the attacks, Vigo developed its earliest commerce and was given several privileges by the kings of Spain.\n\nIn 1702, the [[Battle of Vigo Bay]] occurred, and in 1719, because a Spanish fleet which departed from Vigo attempted to invade Scotland in support of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], the city was [[Capture of Vigo|occupied for ten days by a British force]].\n\nIn 1808, the [[French Army]] annexed Spain to the [[Napoleonic Empire]], although Vigo remained unconquered until January, 1809. Vigo was also the first city of Galicia to be freed from French rule, in what is annually celebrated on March 28 as the ''Reconquista'' (reconquest from the French in the context of the [[Peninsular War]]). In 1833, the city of [[Pontevedra]] was designated the provincial capital of the [[province of Pontevedra]], within which is Vigo.\n\nVigo grew very rapidly in the 20th century thanks to the fact that the Franco government granted it a tax-free zone in 1947 so that companies could set up there for free and an Industrial Development Pole in 1964, a very unusual case for a non-capital of a Spanish province. Continuous urban-planning changes left Vigo less structured than other Galician cities such as [[Pontevedra]] and [[A Coru\u00f1a]].\n{{Wide image|Vigo_y_su_r\u00eda_(5546327816b).jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Vigo, as seen from the opposite shore of the [[ria]].}}\n\n==Toponym==\n[[File:Bandera de la ciudad de Vigo (39023915704).jpg|thumb|right|The municipal flag waving in the wind, featuring the olive tree.]]\nVigo's urban area is built over both a hill-fort (''[[Castros in Spain|Castro]]'') and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement. It is generally accepted that the name Vigo is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:vicus#Latin|vicus]] spacorum'', meaning \"small village\".\n\nThe standard pronunciation of Vigo in both [[Galician language|Galician]] and Spanish is {{IPA-es|\u02c8bi\u0263o|}}.\n\nVigo has been given the nickname ''cidade ol\u00edvica'' (city of olives). It is said that, after the conflict between the [[Isabel de Castilla]] and [[Juana la Beltraneja]]\u2014where Galician nobility fought for the latter\u2014the victor ordered all of Galicia's [[olive tree]]s to be cut down, as they symbolized peace. She couldn't uproot the tree in Vigo, however, because it was planted in [[Sacred#Sacred ground|sacred ground]]. The tree is represented in the city seal, and a descendant of it is still alive in Vigo's city centre.\n\n==Geography==\n=== Location ===\nIn the northeast, it borders the municipality of [[Redondela]]; in the east, [[Mos (Spain)|Mos]]; in the south, [[O Porri\u00f1o]] and [[Gondomar, Pontevedra|Gondomar]]; and in the southwest, [[Nigr\u00e1n]]. On the other side of its bay are the municipalities of [[Cangas do Morrazo|Cangas]] and [[Moa\u00f1a]]. \n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Las Islas C\u00edes.jpg|thumb|right|The [[C\u00edes Islands]], part of the municipality of Vigo, partially obstruct the access from the [[Ria de Vigo]] to the open seas.]]\nVigo's climate is usually classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). Although Vigo is the rainiest city in Galicia, in actuality, with its noticeable drying trend in the summer, Vigo's climate is more similar to the variant of the oceanic climate commonly seen in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America. Substantial rainfall throughout the year prevents it from being classified as a Mediterranean climate, even though there is a drying trend in summer.\nThe average annual temperature in Vigo is {{convert|14|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. Compared to many other Galician towns, Vigo experiences warmer summer temperatures than A Coru\u00f1a and milder winters than inland areas.  This is due to its sheltered location, surrounded by mountains inland and the [[Islas C\u00edes|Illas C\u00edes]] out in the bay towards the sea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galiciaguide.com/Vigo-index.html |title=Vigo |publisher=galiciaguide.com |accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> The all-time record high for the city is {{convert|39.7|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} set on July 5, 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aemet.es/es/eltiempo/observacion/ultimosdatos?k=gal&l=1495&w=1&datos=img |title=Vigo |accessdate=5 July 2013}}</ref> Vigo is known for its extreme rainfall in winter.

Although within the city one will not find much Romanesque architecture, it can be seen a few kilometers away from the city center. In many of the municipality's neighborhoods and parishes a large number of Roman ruins remain. Such is the importance of the Roman remains in Vigo that many Spanish authors have come to coin the term ''Romanesque Vigo'' (''rom\u00e1nico vigu\u00e9s'' in Spanish).

It is often considered with [[A Coru\u00f1a]] one of the economic and industrial engines of Galicia.\n\nVigo is one of the leading industrial areas in Galicia, with a French car factory, shipyards, and auxiliary industry in both automotive and marine sectors. Situated in Vigo, the French factory [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]] since 1958, in 2007 produced a total of 545,000 vehicles, of which more than 82% were sold outside Spain.\n\nIn addition, Vigo has a [[fishing]] port  and is the home port of one of the world's largest fishing company, [[Pescanova]] and the most important centre of the Galician canned fish industry. The headquarters of the [[European Fisheries Control Agency]] are also located in the city.\n\nThe publishing industry in Galician is prominent in the city, with Editorial Galaxia and Editorial Xerais.\n\n=== Port of Vigo ===\n\nThe [[Port of Vigo]] covers a length of more than 20&nbsp;km and offers more than 9&nbsp;km of docks.

The most important artists of this postmodern movement were musicians; particularly punk and new wave bands such as ''[[Siniestro Total]]'', ''[[Golpes Bajos]]'', ''[[Aerol\u00edneas Federales]]'', ''Semen Up'' or ''[[Os Resentidos]]''.\n\nAt the moment, the city still has notorious bands like [[Iv\u00e1n Ferreiro]] (ex-singer of Los Piratas) and Mon.\n\n===Media and entertainment===\n[[File:Faro de Vigo, 1853, 3 de noviembre.jpg|thumb|Frontpage of a 1853 issue of the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]''.]]\nVigo has two daily newspapers; the ''[[Faro de Vigo]]'', the oldest newspaper in Spain still in circulation, and the ''[[Atl\u00e1ntico Diario]]'', a little local newspaper.

Vigo also participated in the Europeanwide free newspapers rush led by \"[[Metro International|Metro]]\" and some free journals were published in 1990s and 2000s: \"[[20 minutos]]\", \"Gaceta Universitaria\", \"Redacci\u00f3n Xove\", etcetera. \"Espa\u00f1a Exterior\" is also printed in Vigo.\n\nThe locally produced award-winning feature movie ''[[Mondays In The Sun]]'' (original title ''Los lunes al sol'') depicts the life of several men who have lost their work at the [[Port of Vigo]]. This film is not based on a single individual's experiences but on the perceived collective experiences of many local port workers.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Daniel Wass - RC Celta de Vigo - WMES 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Celta de Vigo]] players during a fixture versus Espanyol]]\nVigo has one of the most important women's basketball team in Spain, [[Celta Indepo|Celta]], more commonly referred to today by its sponsorship name of Celta Indepo.

Institutions such as the ''Real Club Nautico de Vigo'' (RCNV), founded in 1906, and the Liceo Mar\u00edtimo de Bouzas (LMB), founded in 1907, are good examples of promotion of the nautical sports, especially sailing.\n[[File:Regata en la Ria de Vigo (1827331441).jpg|thumb|right|Regatta in the [[Ria de Vigo]].]]\n\nThe RCNV organises important events like Atlantic Week, which in September 2006 included the World Championship of the Platu 25 class. Every August, the RCNV also organises one of the largest sailboat races in the Iberian peninsula: the ''Regata R\u00edas Baixas''. In 2006 more than 130 different boats participated.\n\nThe LMB is a yacht club which counts around 400 associates. The LMB has a long and intense history of sailing and recreational fishing. The LMB organizes two important regattas in the Galician sailing calendar: the ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' and a ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos''.\n\nThe ''Regata Vila de Bouzas'' honours the neighbourhood where the LMB is located. The ''Regata de Solitarios y a Dos'' is sponsored by the firm Aister and is for crews of one and two members. It is a difficult race with two stages; the first consists of a race through the coastal bay of Vigo while the second stage is a longer race around the [[Cies Islands]] (and/or Ons Islands). The LMB has schools of sailing and fishing. Yearly it organizes a cephalopods fishing competition.\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Azc\u00e1rate]], art historian, author, researcher, curator, and professor, specializing in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] Castilian art and [[Renaissance]] sculpture.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.museodelprado.es/aprende/enciclopedia/voz/azcarate-y-ristori-jose-maria/6cfe9a91-151a-433a-920c-8e9e6c6b549d|title=Azc\u00e1rate y Ristori, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda|website=Museo Nacional del Prado|language=es|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref> Born in Vigo.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*[[Antonio M.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the [https://www.smartworking1.in/2020/03/what-is-difference-between-nse-and-bse.html exchange] of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.

Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets | date=2013-01-01 | first = Kristian | last=Rydqvist | first2=Joshua | last2=Spizman | first3=Ilya A. | last3=Strebulaev | ssrn=1428442}}</ref>\n\n==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income.

Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation====\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing.

A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading.

In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.

At that time, I wasn't sure that any definite criterion existed to make that sort of clear-cut judgment. And so I was pleasantly surprised at the clarity and decisiveness of Mises's answer. \"A stock market,\" he answered promptly. \"A stock market is crucial to the existence of [[capitalism]] and [[private property]].

The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other immoveable assets.\n\nHistory has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood. An economy where the stock market is on the rise is considered to be an up-and-coming economy. The stock market is often considered the primary indicator of a country's economic strength and development.<ref>Mahipal Singh, 2011, {{ISBN|9788182055193}}, April 2011</ref>\n\nRising share prices, for instance, tend to be associated with increased business investment and vice versa. Share prices also affect the wealth of households and their consumption. Therefore, [[central bank]]s tend to keep an eye on the control and behavior of the stock market and, in general, on the smooth operation of [[financial system]] functions.

(Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[randomness]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D. Poterba, J. & Summers, L. 1991 520\u2013546\"/>\n\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot ''systematically'' profit from any momentary '[[market anomaly]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group.

In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Irrational behavior ===\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

Investment in the stock market is most often done via [[stockbroker]]ages and [[electronic trading platform]]s. Investment is usually made with an [[investment strategy]] in mind.\n\nStocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]], so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\n\n==Size of the markets==\nThe total [[market capitalization]] of equity backed securities worldwide rose from $2.5 trillion in 1980 to $68.65 trillion at the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref> As of December 31, 2019, the total [[market capitalization]] of all stocks worldwide was approximately US$70.75 trillion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/cm.mkt.lcap.cd | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|}}, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.

Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder.

Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Determinants and possible explanations of stock market participation====\nIn a 2003 paper by Vissing-J\u00f8rgensen attempts to explain disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing.

From predominantly Dutch-speaking cities of the [[Low Countries]] (like [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]]), the term 'beurs' spread to other European states where it was corrupted into 'bourse', 'borsa', 'bolsa', 'b\u00f6rse', etc.]]\n\n===Early history===\nIn 12th-century France, the ''courretiers de change'' were concerned with managing and regulating the debts of agricultural communities on behalf of the banks. Because these men also traded with debts, they could be called the first [[broker]]s. A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading. The idea quickly spread around [[Flanders]] and neighboring countries and \"Beurzen\" soon opened in [[Ghent]] and [[Rotterdam]].\n\nIn the middle of the 13th century, [[Venice|Venetian]] bankers began to trade in government securities. In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.  Around this time, a [[joint stock company]]--one whose stock is owned jointly by the shareholders--emerged and became important for colonization of what Europeans called the \"New World\".<ref>[Ralph Dahrendorft, Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society (Stanford, CA:  Stanford University Press, 1959)]</ref>\n\n===Birth of formal stock markets===\n{{See also|Economic history of the Dutch Republic|Financial history of the Dutch Republic|Dutch East India Company}}\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).

The [[liquidity]] that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as [[property]] and other immoveable assets.\n\nHistory has shown that the price of [[stock]]s and other assets is an important part of the dynamics of economic activity, and can influence or be an indicator of social mood.

It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D.

Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''.

In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market.

Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

{"title_page": "Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor", "text_new": "{{For|more information|Causes of World War II}}\n{{Use American English|date=December 2018}}{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2018}}\nA series of events led to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. War between [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and the [[United States]] had been a possibility that each nation's military forces planned for in the 1920s, though real tension did not begin until the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan. Over the next decade, Japan expanded slowly into [[Republic of China|China]], leading to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. In 1940, Japan invaded [[Invasion of French Indochina|French Indochina]] in an effort to embargo all imports into China including the war supplies that are purchased from the U.S. This move prompted the United States to embargo all oil exports, leading the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to estimate that it had less than two years of [[bunker oil]] remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The planning was underway for some time on an attack on the \"Southern Resource Area\" to add it to the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] that Japan envisioned in the Pacific.\n\nThe [[Philippines]] which was an [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|American protectorate]] are also a Japanese target. The Japanese military concluded that an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response. Rather than seize and fortify the islands and wait for the inevitable U.S. counterattack, Japan's military leaders instead decided on the [[Preventive war|preventive]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]] which they assumed that it would negate the American forces that are needed for the liberation and reconquest of the islands. (Later, that same day [December 8 local time], the Japanese launched their [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion of the Philippines]]).\n\nThe planning for the attack on Pearl Harbor began in very early 1941 by Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]. He finally won assent from the Naval High Command by among other things threatening to resign. The attack was approved in the summer at an Imperial Conference and again at a second Conference in the fall. Simultaneously over the year, the pilots are trained and the ships are prepared for its execution. Authority for the attack was granted at the second Imperial Conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to Japan was not reached. After the [[Hull note]] and final approval by [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa|Emperor Hirohito]], the order to attack was issued at the beginning of December.\n\n==Background to conflict==\nTensions between Japan and the prominent Western countries (The United States, France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands) increased significantly during the increasingly militaristic early [[Sh\u014dwa period|reign of Emperor Hirohito]]. The Japanese nationalists and military leaders increasingly influenced government policy, promoting a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] as part of Japan's alleged [[Hakko ichiu|\"divine right\"]] to unify Asia under [[Emperor Hirohito|Hirohito]]'s rule.{{efn|1=The effort to establish the [[Imperial Way]] (''k\u014dd\u014d'') had begun with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (called ''seisen'', or \"holy war\", by Japan).<ref>{{cite book|ref= harv |author-link= Herbert Bix |last= Bix |first= Herbert |title= Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan |title-link= Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan |date= 2001 |pp=326\u2013327}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Hirohito wartime.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]]]]\n\nDuring the 1930s, Japan's increasingly expansionist policies brought it into renewed conflict with its neighbors, Russia and China (Japan fought the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] with China in 1894\u201395 and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with Russia in 1904\u201305. Japan's imperialist ambitions had a hand in precipitating both conflicts). In March 1933, Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in response to the international condemnation of its conquest of [[Manchuria]] and subsequent establishment of the [[Manchukuo]] [[puppet government]] there.<ref>{{cite web|title= Imperial Rescript to Withdraw from League of Nations|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/pre-war/330327a.html|accessdate= 2009-10-24}}</ref> On January 15, 1936, Japan withdrew from the [[Second London Naval Treaty|Second London Naval Disarmament Conference]] because the United States and the United Kingdom refused to grant the Japanese Navy parity with theirs.<!--It was the USN that Japan was mainly concerned with.

The Japanese atrocities during the conflict such as the notorious [[Nanking Massacre]] that December, served to further complicate relations with the rest of the world. The U.S.,{{efn|1= Possessing the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]] and [[Wake Island]]}} Britain,{{efn|1=With [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Singapore|Singapore]] and the territory of the future [[British Malaya|Malaysia]]}} France{{efn|1=With [[French Indochina]] ([[French Indochina in World War II|in WWII]]) including [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]}} and the Netherlands{{efn|1=With Indonesia, the former [[Dutch East Indies]]}} each possessed colonies in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Japan's new military power and willingness to use it threatened these Western economic and territorial interests in Asia.\n\nBeginning in 1938, the U.S. adopted a succession of increasingly restrictive trade restrictions with Japan.  This included terminating its 1911 commercial treaty with Japan in 1939, further tightened by the [[Export Control Act]] of 1940. These efforts failed to deter Japan from continuing its war in China or from signing the [[Tripartite Pact]] in 1940 with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]], officially forming the [[Axis Powers]].\n\nJapan would take advantage of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country that was not already involved in conflict with the signatory. This implicitly meant that the U.S.<!-- and not the Soviet Union ? --> By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores{{citation needed|date= May 2012}}\u2014with Germany and Italy in the Atlantic and with Japan in the Pacific.

Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a [[neutral power]] to one preparing for war.<ref>Parkes, Henry Bamford. ''Recent America, A History Of The United States Since 1900'' (Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1946)Page. 635-645</ref>\n\nIn mid-1940, Roosevelt moved the U.S. [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to deter Japan.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1940/06/23/113094328.pdf Shift Of Our Fleet To Atlantic Studied], New York Times, June 23, 1940</ref> On October 8, 1940, Admiral [[James O. Richardson]], [[Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet|Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet]], provoked a confrontation with Roosevelt by repeating his earlier arguments to [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Harold Rainsford Stark|Harold R.

Roosevelt believed relocating the fleet to Hawaii would exert a \"restraining influence\" on Japan.{{citation needed|date= May 2012}}\n\nRichardson asked the President if the United States was going to war. Roosevelt's view was:\n<blockquote>\nAt least as early as October 8, 1940, ...affairs had reached such a state that the United States would become involved in a war with Japan. ... 'that if the Japanese attacked Thailand, or the Kra Peninsula, or the Dutch East Indies we would not enter the war, that if they even attacked the Philippines he doubted whether we would enter the war, but that they (the Japanese) could not always avoid making mistakes and that as the war continued and that area of operations expanded sooner or later they would make a mistake and we would enter the war.' ... .<ref>Joint Congressional Hearings on the Pearl Harbor Attack, Part 40, ^p.506, \"Conclusions Restated With Supporting Evidence\".</ref><ref>Richardson, \"On the Treadmill\", pp.425 and 434; Baker, \"Human Smoke\", p.239, {{ISBN|1-4165-6784-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJapan's 1940 move into [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled [[French Indochina|Indochina]] further raised tensions. Along with Japan's war with China, withdrawal from the League of Nations, alliance with Germany and Italy and increasing militarization, the move induced the United States to intensify its measures to restrain Japan economically. The United States [[embargo]]ed scrap-metal shipments to Japan and closed the [[Panama Canal]] to Japanese shipping.<ref>Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, translated by Wen Ha-hsiung.

Diplomats from the Japanese embassy in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], including the Japanese ambassador, Admiral [[Kichisabur\u014d Nomura]] and special representative [[Sabur\u014d Kurusu]], had been conducting extended talks with the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] regarding the U.S. reactions to the Japanese move into [[French Indochina]] in the summer.\n\nIn the days before the attack, a long 14-part message was sent to the embassy from the Foreign Office in Tokyo (encrypted with the Type 97 cypher machine, in a cipher named <small>[[Purple (cipher machine)|PURPLE]]</small> by U.S. [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]]), with instructions to deliver it to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]] at {{Format date|1941|December|7|13|0|time_joiner=Washington time on|hour_format=g}}. The last part arrived late Saturday night (Washington time), but because of decryption and typing delays, as well as Tokyo's failure to stress the crucial necessity of the timing, embassy personnel did not deliver the message to Secretary Hull until several hours after the attack.\n\nThe United States had decrypted the 14th part well before the Japanese managed to, and long before embassy staff composed a clean typed copy. The final part, with its instruction for the time of delivery, had been decoded Saturday night but was not acted upon until the next morning (according to [[Henry Clausen]]{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}).\n\nAmbassador Nomura asked for an appointment to see Hull at {{Format time|hour=13|minute=0|hour_format=g}}, but later asked it be postponed to 1:45 as the ambassador was not quite ready. Nomura and Kurusu arrived at {{Format time|hour=14|minute=05|hour_format=g}} and were received by Hull at 2:20. Nomura apologized for the delay in presenting the message. After Hull had read several pages, he asked Nomura whether the document was presented under instructions of the Japanese government; the Ambassador replied it was. After reading the full document, Hull turned to the ambassador and said:\n<blockquote>I must say that in all my conversations with you...during the last nine months I have never uttered one word of untruth. This is borne out absolutely by the record. In all my fifty years of public service I have never seen a document that was more crowded with infamous falsehoods and distortions--infamous falsehoods and distortions on a scale so huge that I never imagined until today that any Government on this planet was capable of uttering them.<ref>[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/WorldWar2/memo.htm Memorandum 95 Regarding a Conversation, Between the Secretary of State, the Japanese Ambassador (Nomura), and Mr. Kurusu ''Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy 1931-1941'' (Department of State, Washington, DC 1943)]</ref></blockquote>\n\nJapanese records, admitted into evidence during congressional hearings on the attack after the war, established that Japan had not even written a declaration of war until hearing news of the successful attack. The two-line declaration was finally delivered to U.S. ambassador [[Joseph Grew]] in Tokyo about ten hours after the completion of the attack.

In August 1941, Japanese prime minister [[Fumimaro Konoe]] proposed a summit with President Roosevelt to discuss differences. Roosevelt replied Japan must leave China before a summit meeting could be held.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} On {{Date|Sep 6 1941|mdy}}, at the second Imperial Conference concerning attacks on the Western colonies in Asia and [[Hawaii]], Japanese leaders met to consider the attack plans prepared by [[Imperial General Headquarters]].

However, military leaders such as Sugiyama, [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of War]] General [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], and chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|IJN General Staff]] [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Osami Nagano]] asserted time had run out and that additional negotiations would be pointless. They urged swift military actions against all American and European colonies in Southeast Asia and Hawaii. T\u014dj\u014d argued that yielding to the American demand to withdraw troops would wipe out all the gains of the Second Sino-Japanese War, depress Army [[morale]], endanger [[Manchukuo]] and jeopardize control of Korea; hence, doing nothing was the same as defeat and a [[loss of face]].\n\nOn October 16, 1941, Konoe resigned and proposed Prince [[Naruhiko Higashikuni]], who was also the choice of the army and navy, as his successor.

Ogawa already had spies in Hawaii, including Japanese Consular officials with an intelligence remit, and he arranged for help from a German already living in Hawaii who was an ''[[Abwehr]]'' agent. None had been providing much militarily useful information. He planned to add 29-year-old Ensign [[Takeo Yoshikawa]]. By the spring of 1941, Yamamoto officially requested additional Hawaiian intelligence, and Yoshikawa boarded the liner ''Nitta-maru'' at [[Yokohama]]. He had grown his hair longer than military length, and assumed the cover name Tadashi Morimura.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv |author-link=John Toland (author) |last=Toland |first=John |title=The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 |title-link=The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 |publisher=Random House |date=1970 |pp=152\u201353}}</ref>\n\nYoshikawa began gathering intelligence in earnest by taking auto trips around the main islands, and toured Oahu in a small plane, posing as a tourist. He visited Pearl Harbor frequently, sketching the harbor and location of ships from the crest of a hill. Once, he gained access to [[Hickam Air Force Base|Hickam Field]] in a taxi, memorizing the number of visible planes, pilots, hangars, barracks and soldiers. He was also able to discover that Sunday was the day of the week on which the largest number of ships were likely to be in harbor, that [[PBY Catalina|PBY]] patrol planes went out every morning and evening, and that there was an antisubmarine net in the mouth of the harbor.{{sfn|Toland|1970|p=167}} Information was returned to Japan in coded form in Consular communications, and by direct delivery to intelligence officers aboard Japanese ships calling at Hawaii by consulate staff.\n\nIn June 1941, German and Italian consulates were closed, and there were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well.

For the next several months, planning and organizing a simultaneous attack on Pearl Harbor and invasion of British and Dutch colonies to the south occupied much of the Japanese Navy's <!--in this context, it's a proper noun--> time and attention. The plans for the Pearl Harbor attack arose out of the Japanese expectation the U.S. would be inevitably drawn into war after a Japanese attack against Malaya and Singapore.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=David C.|last2=Peattie|first2=Mark R.|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887-1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSDOAwAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|isbn=978-1-84832-159-5|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=iSDOAwAAQBAJ*pg=462 462].

The U.S. fleet would be defeated in a [[Kantai Kessen|\"decisive battle\"]], as Russia's [[Baltic Fleet]] had been in 1905. A surprise attack posed a twofold difficulty compared to longstanding expectations. First, the Pacific Fleet was a formidable force, and would not be easy to defeat or to surprise. Second, Pearl Harbor's shallow waters made using conventional [[aerial torpedo]]es ineffective. On the other hand, Hawaii's distance meant a successful surprise attack could not be blocked or quickly countered by forces from the continental U.S.\n\nSeveral Japanese naval officers had been impressed by the British action in the [[Battle of Taranto]], in which 21 obsolete [[Fairey Swordfish]] disabled half the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Italian Navy). Admiral Yamamoto even dispatched a delegation to Italy, which concluded a larger and better-supported version of Cunningham's strike could force the U.S. Pacific Fleet to retreat to bases in California, thus giving Japan the time necessary to establish a \"barrier\" defense to protect Japanese control of the Dutch East Indies. The delegation returned to Japan with information about the shallow-running torpedoes Cunningham's engineers had devised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nJapanese strategists were undoubtedly influenced by Admiral [[Heihachiro Togo|Togo]]'s surprise attack on the [[Russian Pacific Fleet]] at [[Battle of Port Arthur|Port Arthur]] in 1904. Yamamoto's emphasis on destroying the American battleships was in keeping with the [[Alfred Mahan|Mahan]]ian doctrine shared by all major navies during this period, including  the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier''; Miller, ''War Plan Orange''.; Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''; Mahan, ''The Influence of Sea Power on History''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Minoru Genda.jpg|thumb|upright|Planner [[Commander]] [[Minoru Genda]] stressed surprise would be critical.]]\n\nIn a letter dated January 7, 1941, Yamamoto finally delivered a rough outline of his plan to [[Koshiro Oikawa]], then Navy Minister, from whom he also requested to be made Commander in Chief of the air fleet to attack Pearl Harbor. A few weeks later, in yet another letter, Yamamoto requested Admiral [[Takijiro Onishi]], chief of staff of the [[11th Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Eleventh Air Fleet]], study the technical feasibility of an attack against the American base. Onishi gathered as many facts as possible about Pearl Harbor.\n\nAfter first consulting with [[Kosei Maeda]], an expert on aerial torpedo warfare, and being told the harbor's shallow waters rendered such an attack almost impossible, Onishi summoned Commander [[Minoru Genda]]. After studying the original proposal put forth by Yamamoto, Genda agreed: \"[T]he plan is difficult but not impossible\".{{sfn|Prange |Dillon |Goldstein |1991 |pp=25-27}} Yamamoto gave the bulk of the planning to Rear Admiral [[Ryunosuke Kusaka]], who was very worried about the area's air defenses. Yamamoto encouraged Kusaka by telling him, \"Pearl Harbor is my idea and I need your support.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnrTdRy6t8MC&pg=PT14 |page=14 |last=Lord |first=Walter |title=Day of Infamy |publisher=Open Road Media |year=2012 |isbn=1453238425}}</ref> Genda emphasized the attack should be carried out early in the morning and in total secrecy, employing an [[aircraft carrier]] [[task force|force]] and several types of bombing.{{sfn|Prange |Dillon |Goldstein |1991 |pp=25-27}}\n\nAlthough attacking the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchor would achieve surprise, it also carried two distinct disadvantages. The targeted ships would be sunk or damaged in very shallow water, meaning it would be quite likely that they could be salvaged and possibly returned to duty (as six of the eight battleships eventually were). Also, most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on [[shore leave]] or would be rescued from the harbor afterward. Despite these concerns, Yamamoto and Genda pressed ahead.\n\nBy April 1941, the Pearl Harbor plan became known as ''Operation Z'', after the famous Z signal given by Admiral T\u014dg\u014d at Tsushima.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}<!--Toland made the claim...--> Over the summer, pilots trained in earnest near [[Kagoshima City]] on [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. Genda chose it because its geography and infrastructure presented most of the same problems bombers would face at Pearl Harbor. In training, each crew flew over the {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain behind Kagoshima and dove into the city, dodging buildings and smokestacks before dropping to {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the piers. Bombardiers released torpedoes at a breakwater some {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} away.<!--away from what?-->{{sfn|Toland|1970|p=160}}\n\nHowever, even this low-altitude approach would not overcome the problem of torpedoes bottoming<!--& this was a real problem, & a reason USN felt safe, so it needs mentioning--> in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Japanese weapons engineers created and tested modifications allowing successful shallow water drops. The effort resulted in a heavily modified version of the [[Type 91 torpedo]], which inflicted most of the ship damage during the eventual attack.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Japanese weapons technicians also produced special [[armor-piercing bomb]]s by fitting fins and release shackles to 14- and 16-inch (356- and 406-mm) naval shells. These were able to penetrate the lightly armored decks of the old battleships.\n\n===Concept of a Japanese invasion of Hawaii===\nAt several stages during 1941, Japan's military leaders discussed the possibility of [[Invasion of the United States|launching an invasion]] to seize the [[Hawaiian Islands]]; this would provide Japan with a strategic base to shield its new empire, deny the United States any bases beyond the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and further isolate Australia and New Zealand.\n\nGenda, who saw Hawaii as vital for American operations against Japan after war began, believed Japan must follow any attack on Pearl Harbor with an invasion of Hawaii or risk losing the war. He viewed Hawaii as a base to threaten the west coast of North America, and perhaps as a negotiating tool for ending the war. He believed, following a successful air attack, 10,000-15,000 men could capture Hawaii, and saw the operation as a precursor or alternative to a [[Japanese invasion of the Philippines]]. In September 1941, Commander Yasuji Watanabe of the Combined Fleet staff estimated two divisions (30,000 men) and 80 ships, in addition to the carrier strike force, could capture the islands. He identified two possible landing sites, near [[Haleiwa]] and [[Kaneohe Bay]], and proposed both be used in an operation that would require up to four weeks with Japanese air superiority.{{r|caravaggio2014}}\n\nAlthough this idea gained some support, it was soon dismissed for several reasons:\n*Japan's ground forces, logistics, and resources were already fully committed, not only to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] but also for [[Pacific War#Japanese offensives.2C 1941.E2.80.9342|offensives in Southeast Asia]] that were planned to occur almost simultaneously with the Pearl Harbor attack.\n*The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) insisted it needed to focus on operations in China and Southeast Asia, and refused to provide substantial support elsewhere. Because of a lack of cooperation between the services, the IJN never discussed the Hawaiian invasion proposal with the IJA.{{r|caravaggio2014}}{{efn|1=It was for these reasons IJA also rejected proposals for [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia]].}}\n*Most of the senior officers of the Combined Fleet, in particular Admiral Nagano, believed an invasion of Hawaii was too risky.{{efn|1=For a more detailed analysis of whether a Japanese invasion of Hawaii could have been successful, see {{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/pearlops.htm |title=Invasion: Pearl Harbor! |website=Combinedfleet.com}} }}{{r|caravaggio2014}}\n\nWith an invasion ruled out, it was agreed a massive carrier-based three wave airstrike against Pearl Harbor to destroy the Pacific Fleet would be sufficient. Japanese planners knew that Hawaii, with its strategic location in the Central Pacific, would serve as a critical base from which the United States could extend its military power against Japan. However, the confidence of Japan's leaders that the conflict would be over quickly and that the United States would choose to negotiate a compromise, rather than fight a long, bloody war, overrode this concern.{{efn|1=In late April or early May of 1942, Yamamoto reportedly secured a tentative agreement that an invasion of Hawaii would be launched after military operations in the Western Pacific were completed and additional ground troops and warships were available. By mid-1942, Yamamoto had assembled sufficient forces for an invasion of the [[Midway Islands|Midway Atoll]], which was expected to serve as a base for further attacks against Hawaii. However, in the subsequent [[Battle of Midway]], the loss of four of Japan's six largest aircraft carriers made any future air and naval operations (let alone an invasion) against Hawaii impossible.}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Donald M.|title=The Pearl Harbor Papers: Inside the Japanese Plans|url=https://archive.org/details/pearlharborpaper00gold|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington}}</ref><ref>[[Gerhard Weinberg|Weinberg, Gerhard L.]], ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II''.

At the time, no reports specifically indicated an attack against Pearl Harbor. Public press reports during summer and fall, including Hawaiian newspapers, contained extensive reports on the growing tension in the Pacific. Late in November, all Pacific commands, including both the Navy and Army in Hawaii, were separately and explicitly warned<ref name=\"hart\">[http://ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411128acno.html November 28, 1941, message]<!--retrieval date?--></ref> war with Japan was expected in the very near future, and it was preferred Japan make the first hostile act.<ref name=\"'FSOCNS 1201\">[http://ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411201afns.html ibiblio.org]<!--retrieval date?--></ref> It was felt war would most probably start with attacks in the Far East: the [[Philippines]],<ref name=\"hart1\">[http://ibiblio.org/pha/timeline/411127acno.html War warning, dated 27 November 1941]<!--retrieval date?--></ref> [[Indochina]], [[Thailand]], or the [[Russian Far East]]; Pearl Harbor was never mentioned as a potential target. The warnings were not specific to any area, noting only that war with Japan was expected in the near future and all commands should act accordingly. Had any of these warnings produced an active alert status in Hawaii, the attack might have been resisted more effectively, and perhaps resulted in less death and damage. On the other hand, recall of men on shore leave to the ships in harbor might have led to still more being casualties from bombs and torpedoes, or trapped in capsized ships by shut watertight doors (as the attack alert status would have required),{{efn|1=Technically called \"Condition Zed\".{{sfn|Prange |Dillon |Goldstein |1991}} }} or killed (in their obsolete aircraft) by more experienced Japanese aviators. When the attack actually arrived, Pearl Harbor was effectively unprepared: anti-aircraft weapons not manned, most ammunition locked down, anti-submarine measures not implemented (''e.g.'', no [[torpedo nets]] in the harbor), combat air patrol not flying, available scouting aircraft not in the air at first light, Air Corps aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip to reduce sabotage risks (not ready to fly at a moment's warning), and so on.\n\nBy 1941, U.S. [[signals intelligence]], through the Army's [[Signal Intelligence Service]] and the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]'s [[OP-20-G]], had intercepted and decrypted considerable Japanese diplomatic and naval [[cipher]] traffic, though nothing actually carrying significant information about Japanese military plans in 1940\u201341. Decryption and distribution of this intelligence, including such decrypts as were available, was capricious and sporadic, some of which can be accounted for by lack of resources and manpower.<ref>Kahn, David. ''The Codebreakers''; Prange ''et al''., ''Peaarl Harbor: The Verdict of History''.</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2015}} At best, the information available to decision makers in Washington was fragmentary, contradictory, or poorly distributed, and was almost entirely raw, without supporting analysis. It was thus, incompletely understood. Nothing in it pointed directly to an attack at Pearl Harbor,{{efn|1=In August 1941 Yugoslav/English agent [[Du\u0161an Popov]] submitted a report to the [[F.B.I.]] [[J.

Only one message from the Hawaiian Japanese consulate (sent on 6 December), in a low level consular cipher, included mention of an attack at Pearl; it was not decrypted until 8 December.<ref>{{cite book | last = Costello  | first = John | authorlink = John Costello (historian) | title = Days of Infamy: MacArthur, Roosevelt, Churchill \u2013 the Shocking Truth Revealed | publisher = Pocket Books | date = 1994 | location = New York  | page = 174 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-671-76985-7}}</ref> While the Japanese ''Diplomatic'' codes ([[Purple code]]) could be read, the current version (JN-25C) of the Japanese ''Naval'' code ([[JN-25]]) which had replaced JN-25B on 4 December 1941 could not be read until May 1942.\n\nIn 1924, General [[Billy Mitchell (general)|William L. Mitchell]] produced a 324-page report warning that future wars (including with Japan) would include a new role for aircraft against existing ships and facilities. He even discussed the possibility of an air attack on Pearl Harbor, but his warnings were ignored. Navy Secretary Knox had also appreciated the possibility of an attack at Pearl Harbor in a written analysis shortly after taking office. American commanders had been warned that tests had demonstrated shallow-water aerial torpedo attacks were possible, but no one in charge in Hawaii fully appreciated this. And in a 1932 [[fleet problem]], a surprise [[airstrike]] led by Admiral [[Harry E. Yarnell]] had been judged a success and to have caused considerable damage, a finding corroborated in a 1938 exercise by Admiral [[Ernest King]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rebekah|title=The Day that Will Live in Infamy\u2026but it didn't have to.|url=http://www.ussflierproject.com/tags/ernest-king/|publisher=The USS Flier Project|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, because it was believed Pearl Harbor had natural defenses against torpedo attack (e.g., the shallow water), the Navy did not deploy torpedo nets or baffles, which were judged to inconvenience ordinary operations. As a result of limited numbers of long-range aircraft (including Army Air Corps bombers), reconnaissance patrols were not being made as often or as far out as required for adequate coverage against possible surprise attack (they improved considerably, with far fewer remaining planes,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} after the attack). The Navy had 33 [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBYs]] in the islands, but only three on patrol at the time of the attack.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-kan.htm Naval Air Station, Kanoehe Bay, during the Pearl Harbor Raid<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107185843/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-kan.htm |date=2012-01-07 }}</ref> Hawaii was low on the priority list for the [[Boeing B-17|B-17]]s finally becoming available for the Pacific, largely because General MacArthur in the Philippines was successfully demanding as many as could be made available to the Pacific (where they were intended as a deterrent).

At the time of the attack, Army and Navy were both on training status rather than operational alert.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThere was also confusion about the Army's readiness status as General Short had changed local alert level designations without clearly informing Washington. Most of the Army's mobile anti-aircraft guns were secured, with ammunition locked down in armories. To avoid upsetting property owners, and in keeping with Washington's admonition not to alarm civil populations (e.g., in the late November war warning messages from the Navy and War Departments), guns were not dispersed around Pearl Harbor (i.e., on private property){{citation needed|date=December 2013}}.

War between [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and the [[United States]] had been a possibility that each nation's military forces planned for in the 1920s, though real tension did not begin until the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invasion of Manchuria]] by Japan. Over the next decade, Japan expanded slowly into [[Republic of China|China]], leading to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937. In 1940, Japan invaded [[Invasion of French Indochina|French Indochina]] in an effort to embargo all imports into China including the war supplies that are purchased from the U.S. This move prompted the United States to embargo all oil exports, leading the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) to estimate that it had less than two years of [[bunker oil]] remaining and to support the existing plans to seize oil resources in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The planning was underway for some time on an attack on the \"Southern Resource Area\" to add it to the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] that Japan envisioned in the Pacific.\n\nThe [[Philippines]] which was an [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|American protectorate]] are also a Japanese target. The Japanese military concluded that an invasion of the Philippines would provoke an American military response. Rather than seize and fortify the islands and wait for the inevitable U.S. counterattack, Japan's military leaders instead decided on the [[Preventive war|preventive]] [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor attack]] which they assumed that it would negate the American forces that are needed for the liberation and reconquest of the islands. (Later, that same day [December 8th local time], the Japanese launched their [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u201342)|invasion of the Philippines]]).\n\nThe planning for the attack on Pearl Harbor began in very early 1941 by Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]. He finally won assent from the Naval High Command by among other things threatening to resign. The attack was approved in the summer at an Imperial Conference and again at a second Conference in the fall. Simultaneously over the year, the pilots are trained and the ships are prepared for it's execution. Authority for the attack was granted at the second Imperial Conference if a diplomatic result satisfactory to Japan was not reached. After the [[Hull note]] and final approval by [[Emperor Sh\u014dwa|Emperor Hirohito]], the order to attack was issued at the beginning of December.\n\n==Background to conflict==\nTensions between Japan and the prominent Western countries (The United States, France, United Kingdom and the Netherlands) increased significantly during the increasingly militaristic early [[Sh\u014dwa period|reign of Emperor Hirohito]]. The Japanese nationalists and military leaders increasingly influenced government policy, promoting a [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] as part of Japan's alleged [[Hakko ichiu|\"divine right\"]] to unify Asia under [[Emperor Hirohito|Hirohito]]'s rule.{{efn|1=The effort to establish the [[Imperial Way]] (''k\u014dd\u014d'') had begun with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (called ''seisen'', or \"holy war\", by Japan).<ref>{{cite book|ref= harv |author-link= Herbert Bix |last= Bix |first= Herbert |title= Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan |title-link= Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan |date= 2001 |pp=326\u2013327}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Hirohito wartime.jpg|thumb|right|[[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Hirohito]]]]\n\nDuring the 1930s, Japan's increasingly expansionist policies brought it into renewed conflict with it's neighbors, Russia and China (Japan fought the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] with China in 1894\u201395 and the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with Russia in 1904\u201305. Japan's imperialist ambitions had a hand in precipitating both conflicts). In March 1933, Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in response to the international condemnation of it's conquest of [[Manchuria]] and subsequent establishment of the [[Manchukuo]] [[puppet government]] there.<ref>{{cite web|title= Imperial Rescript to Withdraw from League of Nations|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/pre-war/330327a.html|accessdate= 2009-10-24}}</ref> On January 15, 1936, Japan withdrew from the [[Second London Naval Treaty|Second London Naval Disarmament Conference]] because the United States and the United Kingdom refused to grant the Japanese Navy parity with theirs.<!--It was the USN that Japan was mainly concerned with.

The Japanese atrocities during the conflict such as the notorious [[Nanking Massacre]] that December, served to further complicate relations with the rest of the world. The U.S.,{{efn|1= Possessing the [[Philippines]], [[Guam]] and [[Wake Island]]}} Britain,{{efn|1=With [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Singapore|Singapore]] and the territory of the future [[British Malaya|Malaysia]]}} France{{efn|1=With [[French Indochina]] ([[French Indochina in World War II|in WWII]]) including [[Vietnam]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]]}} and the Netherlands{{efn|1=With Indonesia, the former [[Dutch East Indies]]}} each possessed colonies in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Japan's new military power and willingness to use it threatened these Western economic and territorial interests in Asia.\n\nBeginning in 1938, the U.S. adopted a succession of increasingly restrictive trade restrictions with Japan.  This included terminating it's 1911 commercial treaty with Japan in 1939, further tightened by the [[Export Control Act]] of 1940. These efforts failed to deter Japan from continuing it's war in China or from signing the [[Tripartite Pact]] in 1940 with [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]], officially forming the [[Axis Powers]].\n\nJapan would take advantage of Hitler's war in Europe to advance it's own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country that was not already involved in conflict with the signatory. This implicitly meant that the U.S.<!-- and not the Soviet Union ? --> By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent the unmistakable message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores{{citation needed|date= May 2012}}\u2014with Germany and Italy in the Atlantic and with Japan in the Pacific.

Roosevelt's view was:\n<blockquote>\nAt least as early as October 8, 1940, ...affairs had reached such a state that the United States would become involved in a war with Japan. ... 'that if the Japanese attacked Thailand, or the Kra Peninsula, or the Dutch East Indies we would not enter the war, that if they even attacked the Philippines he doubted whether we would enter the war, but that they (the Japanese) could not always avoid making mistakes and that as the war continued and that area of operations expanded sooner or later they would make a mistake and we would enter the war.' ... .<ref>Joint Congressional Hearings on the Pearl Harbor Attack, Part 40, ^p.506, \"Conclusions Restated With Supporting Evidence\".</ref><ref>Richardson, \"On the Treadmill\", pp.425 and 434; Baker, \"Human Smoke\", p.239, {{ISBN|1-4165-6784-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nJapan's 1940 move into [[Vichy France|Vichy]]-controlled [[French Indochina|Indochina]] further raised tensions. Along with Japan's war with China, withdrawal from the League of Nations, alliance with Germany and Italy and increasing militarization, the move induced the United States to intensify its measures to restrain Japan economically.

Roosevelt replied Japan must leave China before a summit meeting could be held.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} On {{Date|Sep 6 1941|mdy}}, at the second Imperial Conference concerning attacks on the Western colonies in Asia and [[Hawaii]], Japanese leaders met to consider the attack plans prepared by [[Imperial General Headquarters]].

However, military leaders such as Sugiyama, [[Ministry of War of Japan|Minister of War]] General [[Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]], and chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff|IJN General Staff]] [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Osami Nagano]] asserted time had run out and that additional negotiations would be pointless. They urged swift military actions against all American and European colonies in Southeast Asia and Hawaii. T\u014dj\u014d argued that yielding to the American demand to withdraw troops would wipe out all the gains of the Second Sino-Japanese War, depress Army [[morale]], endanger [[Manchukuo]] and jeopardize control of Korea; hence, doing nothing was the same as defeat and a [[loss of face]].\n\nOn October 16, 1941, Konoe resigned and proposed Prince [[Naruhiko Higashikuni]], who was also the choice of the army and navy, as his successor.

Ogawa already had spies in Hawaii, including Japanese Consular officials with an intelligence remit, and he arranged for help from a German already living in Hawaii who was an ''[[Abwehr]]'' agent. None had been providing much militarily useful information. He planned to add 29-year-old Ensign [[Takeo Yoshikawa]]. By the spring of 1941, Yamamoto officially requested additional Hawaiian intelligence, and Yoshikawa boarded the liner ''Nitta-maru'' at [[Yokohama]]. He had grown his hair longer than military length, and assumed the cover name Tadashi Morimura.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv |author-link=John Toland (author) |last=Toland |first=John |title=The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 |title-link=The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936-1945 |publisher=Random House |date=1970 |pp=152\u201353}}</ref>\n\nYoshikawa began gathering intelligence in earnest by taking auto trips around the main islands, and toured Oahu in a small plane, posing as a tourist. He visited Pearl Harbor frequently, sketching the harbor and location of ships from the crest of a hill. Once, he gained access to [[Hickam Air Force Base|Hickam Field]] in a taxi, memorizing the number of visible planes, pilots, hangars, barracks and soldiers. He was also able to discover that Sunday was the day of the week on which the largest number of ships were likely to be in harbor, that [[PBY Catalina|PBY]] patrol planes went out every morning and evening, and that there was an antisubmarine net in the mouth of the harbor.{{sfn|Toland|1970|p=167}} Information was returned to Japan in coded form in Consular communications, and by direct delivery to intelligence officers aboard Japanese ships calling at Hawaii by consulate staff.\n\nIn June 1941, German and Italian consulates were closed, and there were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well. They were not, because they continued to provide valuable information (''via'' [[Magic (cryptography)|<small>MAGIC</small>]]) and neither President [[Franklin D.

For the next several months, planning and organizing a simultaneous attack on Pearl Harbor and invasion of British and Dutch colonies to the south occupied much of the Japanese Navy's <!--in this context, it's a proper noun--> time and attention. The plans for the Pearl Harbor attack arose out of the Japanese expectation the U.S. would be inevitably drawn into war after a Japanese attack against Malaya and Singapore.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=David C.|last2=Peattie|first2=Mark R.|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics, and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887-1941|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iSDOAwAAQBAJ|year=2012|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|isbn=978-1-84832-159-5|pages=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=iSDOAwAAQBAJ*pg=462 462].

The U.S. fleet would be defeated in a [[Kantai Kessen|\"decisive battle\"]], as Russia's [[Baltic Fleet]] had been in 1905. A surprise attack posed a twofold difficulty compared to longstanding expectations. First, the Pacific Fleet was a formidable force, and would not be easy to defeat or to surprise. Second, Pearl Harbor's shallow waters made using conventional [[aerial torpedo]]es ineffective. On the other hand, Hawaii's distance meant a successful surprise attack could not be blocked or quickly countered by forces from the continental U.S.\n\nSeveral Japanese naval officers had been impressed by the British action in the [[Battle of Taranto]], in which 21 obsolete [[Fairey Swordfish]] disabled half the ''[[Regia Marina]]'' (Italian Navy). Admiral Yamamoto even dispatched a delegation to Italy, which concluded a larger and better-supported version of Cunningham's strike could force the U.S. Pacific Fleet to retreat to bases in California, thus giving Japan the time necessary to establish a \"barrier\" defense to protect Japanese control of the Dutch East Indies. The delegation returned to Japan with information about the shallow-running torpedoes Cunningham's engineers had devised.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nJapanese strategists were undoubtedly influenced by Admiral [[Heihachiro Togo|Togo]]'s surprise attack on the [[Russian Pacific Fleet]] at [[Battle of Port Arthur|Port Arthur]] in 1904. Yamamoto's emphasis on destroying the American battleships was in keeping with the [[Alfred Mahan|Mahan]]ian doctrine shared by all major navies during this period, including  the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[Royal Navy]].<ref>Willmott, ''Barrier''; Miller, ''War Plan Orange''.; Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''; Mahan, ''The Influence of Sea Power on History''.</ref>\n\n[[File:Minoru Genda.jpg|thumb|upright|Planner [[Commander]] [[Minoru Genda]] stressed surprise would be critical.]]\n\nIn a letter dated January 7, 1941, Yamamoto finally delivered a rough outline of his plan to [[Koshiro Oikawa]], then Navy Minister, from whom he also requested to be made Commander in Chief of the air fleet to attack Pearl Harbor. A few weeks later, in yet another letter, Yamamoto requested Admiral [[Takijiro Onishi]], chief of staff of the [[11th Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|Eleventh Air Fleet]], study the technical feasibility of an attack against the American base. Onishi gathered as many facts as possible about Pearl Harbor.\n\nAfter first consulting with [[Kosei Maeda]], an expert on aerial torpedo warfare, and being told the harbor's shallow waters rendered such an attack almost impossible, Onishi summoned Commander [[Minoru Genda]]. After studying the original proposal put forth by Yamamoto, Genda agreed: \"[T]he plan is difficult but not impossible\".{{sfn|Prange |Dillon |Goldstein |1991 |pp=25-27}} Yamamoto gave the bulk of the planning to Rear Admiral [[Ryunosuke Kusaka]], who was very worried about the area's air defenses. Yamamoto encouraged Kusaka by telling him, \"Pearl Harbor is my idea and I need your support.\"<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnrTdRy6t8MC&pg=PT14 |page=14 |last=Lord |first=Walter |title=Day of Infamy |publisher=Open Road Media |year=2012 |isbn=1453238425}}</ref> Genda emphasized the attack should be carried out early in the morning and in total secrecy, employing an [[aircraft carrier]] [[task force|force]] and several types of bombing.{{sfn|Prange |Dillon |Goldstein |1991 |pp=25-27}}\n\nAlthough attacking the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchor would achieve surprise, it also carried two distinct disadvantages. The targeted ships would be sunk or damaged in very shallow water, meaning it would be quite likely that they could be salvaged and possibly returned to duty (as six of the eight battleships eventually were). Also, most of the crews would survive the attack, since many would be on [[shore leave]] or would be rescued from the harbor afterward. Despite these concerns, Yamamoto and Genda pressed ahead.\n\nBy April 1941, the Pearl Harbor plan became known as ''Operation Z'', after the famous Z signal given by Admiral T\u014dg\u014d at Tsushima.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}<!--Toland made the claim...--> Over the summer, pilots trained in earnest near [[Kagoshima City]] on [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]]. Genda chose it because its geography and infrastructure presented most of the same problems bombers would face at Pearl Harbor. In training, each crew flew over the {{convert|5,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} mountain behind Kagoshima and dove into the city, dodging buildings and smokestacks before dropping to {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} at the piers. Bombardiers released torpedoes at a breakwater some {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} away.<!--away from what?-->{{sfn|Toland|1970|p=160}}\n\nHowever, even this low-altitude approach would not overcome the problem of torpedoes bottoming<!--& this was a real problem, & a reason USN felt safe, so it needs mentioning--> in the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Japanese weapons engineers created and tested modifications allowing successful shallow water drops. The effort resulted in a heavily modified version of the [[Type 91 torpedo]], which inflicted most of the ship damage during the eventual attack.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Japanese weapons technicians also produced special [[armor-piercing bomb]]s by fitting fins and release shackles to 14- and 16-inch (356- and 406-mm) naval shells. These were able to penetrate the lightly armored decks of the old battleships.\n\n===Concept of a Japanese invasion of Hawaii===\nAt several stages during 1941, Japan's military leaders discussed the possibility of [[Invasion of the United States|launching an invasion]] to seize the [[Hawaiian Islands]]; this would provide Japan with a strategic base to shield its new empire, deny the United States any bases beyond the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and further isolate Australia and New Zealand.\n\nGenda, who saw Hawaii as vital for American operations against Japan after war began, believed Japan must follow any attack on Pearl Harbor with an invasion of Hawaii or risk losing the war. He viewed Hawaii as a base to threaten the west coast of North America, and perhaps as a negotiating tool for ending the war. He believed, following a successful air attack, 10,000-15,000 men could capture Hawaii, and saw the operation as a precursor or alternative to a [[Japanese invasion of the Philippines]]. In September 1941, Commander Yasuji Watanabe of the Combined Fleet staff estimated two divisions (30,000 men) and 80 ships, in addition to the carrier strike force, could capture the islands. He identified two possible landing sites, near [[Haleiwa]] and [[Kaneohe Bay]], and proposed both be used in an operation that would require up to four weeks with Japanese air superiority.{{r|caravaggio2014}}\n\nAlthough this idea gained some support, it was soon dismissed for several reasons:\n*Japan's ground forces, logistics, and resources were already fully committed, not only to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] but also for [[Pacific War#Japanese offensives.2C 1941.E2.80.9342|offensives in Southeast Asia]] that were planned to occur almost simultaneously with the Pearl Harbor attack.\n*The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) insisted it needed to focus on operations in China and Southeast Asia, and refused to provide substantial support elsewhere. Because of a lack of cooperation between the services, the IJN never discussed the Hawaiian invasion proposal with the IJA.{{r|caravaggio2014}}{{efn|1=It was for these reasons IJA also rejected proposals for [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|an invasion of Australia]].}}\n*Most of the senior officers of the Combined Fleet, in particular Admiral Nagano, believed an invasion of Hawaii was too risky.{{efn|1=For a more detailed analysis of whether a Japanese invasion of Hawaii could have been successful, see {{cite web |url=http://www.combinedfleet.com/pearlops.htm |title=Invasion: Pearl Harbor! |website=Combinedfleet.com}} }}{{r|caravaggio2014}}\n\nWith an invasion ruled out, it was agreed a massive carrier-based three wave airstrike against Pearl Harbor to destroy the Pacific Fleet would be sufficient. Japanese planners knew that Hawaii, with its strategic location in the Central Pacific, would serve as a critical base from which the United States could extend its military power against Japan. However, the confidence of Japan's leaders that the conflict would be over quickly and that the United States would choose to negotiate a compromise, rather than fight a long, bloody war, overrode this concern.{{efn|1=In late April or early May of 1942, Yamamoto reportedly secured a tentative agreement that an invasion of Hawaii would be launched after military operations in the Western Pacific were completed and additional ground troops and warships were available. By mid-1942, Yamamoto had assembled sufficient forces for an invasion of the [[Midway Islands|Midway Atoll]], which was expected to serve as a base for further attacks against Hawaii. However, in the subsequent [[Battle of Midway]], the loss of four of Japan's six largest aircraft carriers made any future air and naval operations (let alone an invasion) against Hawaii impossible.}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Donald M.|title=The Pearl Harbor Papers: Inside the Japanese Plans|url=https://archive.org/details/pearlharborpaper00gold|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Brassey's|location=Washington}}</ref><ref>[[Gerhard Weinberg|Weinberg, Gerhard L.]], ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II''.

The warnings were not specific to any area, noting only that war with Japan was expected in the near future and all commands should act accordingly. Had any of these warnings produced an active alert status in Hawaii, the attack might have been resisted more effectively, and perhaps resulted in less death and damage. On the other hand, recall of men on shore leave to the ships in harbor might have led to still more being casualties from bombs and torpedoes, or trapped in capsized ships by shut watertight doors (as the attack alert status would have required),{{efn|1=Technically called \"Condition Zed\".{{sfn|Prange |Dillon |Goldstein |1991}} }} or killed (in their obsolete aircraft) by more experienced Japanese aviators. When the attack actually arrived, Pearl Harbor was effectively unprepared: anti-aircraft weapons not manned, most ammunition locked down, anti-submarine measures not implemented (''e.g.'', no [[torpedo nets]] in the harbor), combat air patrol not flying, available scouting aircraft not in the air at first light, Air Corps aircraft parked wingtip to wingtip to reduce sabotage risks (not ready to fly at a moment's warning), and so on.\n\nBy 1941, U.S. [[signals intelligence]], through the Army's [[Signal Intelligence Service]] and the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]'s [[OP-20-G]], had intercepted and decrypted considerable Japanese diplomatic and naval [[cipher]] traffic, though nothing actually carrying significant information about Japanese military plans in 1940-41.

Yarnell]] had been judged a success and to have caused considerable damage, a finding corroborated in a 1938 exercise by Admiral [[Ernest King]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rebekah|title=The Day that Will Live in Infamy\u2026but it didn't have to.|url=http://www.ussflierproject.com/tags/ernest-king/|publisher=The USS Flier Project|accessdate=7 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, because it was believed Pearl Harbor had natural defenses against torpedo attack (e.g., the shallow water), the Navy did not deploy torpedo nets or baffles, which were judged to inconvenience ordinary operations. As a result of limited numbers of long-range aircraft (including Army Air Corps bombers), reconnaissance patrols were not being made as often or as far out as required for adequate coverage against possible surprise attack (they improved considerably, with far fewer remaining planes,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} after the attack). The Navy had 33 [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|PBYs]] in the islands, but only three on patrol at the time of the attack.<ref>[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-kan.htm Naval Air Station, Kanoehe Bay, during the Pearl Harbor Raid<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107185843/http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/wwii-pac/pearlhbr/ph-kan.htm |date=2012-01-07 }}</ref> Hawaii was low on the priority list for the [[Boeing B-17|B-17]]s finally becoming available for the Pacific, largely because General MacArthur in the Philippines was successfully demanding as many as could be made available to the Pacific (where they were intended as a deterrent). The British, who had contracted for them, even agreed to accept fewer to facilitate this buildup. At the time of the attack, Army and Navy were both on training status rather than operational alert.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nThere was also confusion about the Army's readiness status as General Short had changed local alert level designations without clearly informing Washington. Most of the Army's mobile anti-aircraft guns were secured, with ammunition locked down in armories. To avoid upsetting property owners, and in keeping with Washington's admonition not to alarm civil populations (e.g., in the late November war warning messages from the Navy and War Departments), guns were not dispersed around Pearl Harbor (i.e., on private property){{citation needed|date=December 2013}}. Additionally, aircraft were parked on airfields to lessen the risk of [[sabotage]], not in anticipation of air attack, in keeping with Short's interpretation of the war warnings.\n\n[[Chester Nimitz]] said later, \"It was God's mercy that our fleet was in Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.\" Nimitz believed if Kimmel had discovered the Japanese approach, he would have sortied to meet them. With the three American aircraft carriers ({{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}}, and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}) absent and Kimmel's battleships at a severe disadvantage to the Japanese carriers, the likely result would have been the sinking of the American battleships at sea in deep water, where they would have been lost forever with tremendous casualties (as many as twenty thousand dead), instead of in Pearl Harbor, where the crews could easily be rescued, and six battleships ultimately raised.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv |author-link=Gordon Prange |last=Prange |first=Gordon W. |last2=Goldstein |first2=Donald M |last3=Dillon |first3=Katherine V. |title=Miracle at Midway |url=https://archive.org/details/miracleatmidway1982pran |url-access=registration |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1982 |ISBN=978-0-07-050672-5 |p=[https://archive.org/details/miracleatmidway1982pran/page/9 9]}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|World War II}}\n*[[Pearl Harbor advance-knowledge conspiracy theory]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|60em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Pearl Harbor attack}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Events Leading To The Attack On Pearl Harbor}}\n[[Category:Attack on Pearl Harbor]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling - it's->its,typo(s) fixed: 1940-41 \u2192 1940\u201341", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Events_leading_to_the_attack_on_Pearl_Harbor"}

In January 1981, the revolutionary government formed the Revolutionary Armed Forces (PRAF), an umbrella organization that included the army, the militia, the police service, the prison service, the Coast Guard and the fire service.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000696919.pdf p. 2.</ref> The Grenadian uniformed force far outnumbered the combined police and military of all their [[Eastern Caribbean]] neighbors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Lee|last2=Mendez|first2=Albert|title=Grenada 1983|year=1985|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|location=12-14 Long Acre, London WC2E 9LP|page=3}}</ref> The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] supplied most of the weapons. Promising soldiers and officers were trained in those countries. By 1983 the Movement was split over who should lead the party forward. Some believe the faction led by Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] wanted closer ties with the West, while the faction led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] wanted to speed up the conversion to a [[communist state]]. Others contend the power struggle had more to do with leadership style and rivalry than differences in ideology between the two estranged friends.\n\nOn 13 October, the NJM's Central Committee placed Bishop under house arrest after he balked at a power-sharing agreement. Foreign Minister [[Unison Whiteman]] returned from New York, where he was scheduled to address the United Nations, and instead began to negotiate with Coard for Bishop's release. Over the next few days, pro-Bishop demonstrations occurred throughout the island and a general strike was called in [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. On 18 October, demonstrators surged through the city chanting pro-Bishop and anti-Coard slogans while police and PRA soldiers watched. The protests reached a climax on 19 October. Whiteman addressed a growing crowd in the streets of St. George's. The crowd marched to Mount Wheldale to free Bishop from his home. At first, Bishop's guards held their ground and even fired warning shots. Eventually they were overwhelmed and the demonstrators freed Bishop. Bishop, Whiteman and the demonstrators then marched downhill to [[Fort|Fort Rupert]] to take over the headquarters for the People's Revolutionary Army by sheer weight of numbers.\n\nThe PRA leadership called in reinforcements, including 3 [[BTR-60]]s and additional troops.

Many of these soldiers were pointed out by their opponents to U.S. troops and arrested. The PRAF was disbanded and the island's police force was reconstituted and retrained.\n\nIn 1986, 18 Grenadians were tried by a Grenadian court for the 19 deaths that occurred at Ft. Rupert on Oct. 19, 1983. Seventeen defendants were convicted by a jury of murder or manslaughter, including eight PRA officers and three soldiers. All were imprisoned on the island while supporters waged a long-running campaign to free the so-called [[Grenada 17]].

In January 1981, the revolutionary government formed the Revolutionary Armed Forces (PRAF), an umbrella organization that included the army, the militia, the police service, the prison service, the Coast Guard and the fire service.<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/DOC_0000696919.pdf p. 2.</ref> The Grenadian uniformed force far outnumbered the combined police and military of all their [[Eastern Caribbean]] neighbors.<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Lee|last2=Mendez|first2=Albert|title=Grenada 1983|year=1985|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|location=12-14 Long Acre, London WC2E 9LP|page=3}}</ref> The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] supplied most of the weapons. Promising soldiers and officers were trained in those countries. By 1983 the Movement was split over who should lead the party forward. Some believe the faction led by Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] wanted closer ties with the West, while the faction led by Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] wanted to speed up the conversion to a [[communist state]]. Others contend the power struggle had more to do with leadership style and rivalry than differences in ideology between the two estranged friends.\n\nOn 13 October, the NJM's Central Committee placed Bishop under house arrest after he balked at a power-sharing agreement. Foreign Minister [[Unison Whiteman]] returned from New York, where he was scheduled to address the United Nations, and instead began to negotiate with Coard for Bishop's release. Over the next few days, pro-Bishop demonstrations occurred throughout the island and a general strike was called in [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. On 18 October, demonstrators surged through the city chanting pro-Bishop and anti-Coard slogans while police and PRA soldiers watched. The protests reached a climax on 19 October. Whiteman addressed a growing crowd in the streets of St. George's. The crowd marched to Mount Wheldale to free Bishop from his home. At first, Bishop's guards held their ground and even fired warning shots. Eventually they were overwhelmed and the demonstrators freed Bishop. Bishop, Whiteman and the demonstrators then marched downhill to [[Fort|Fort Rupert]] to take over the headquarters for the People's Revolutionary Army by sheer weight of numbers.\n\nThe PRA leadership called in reinforcements, including 3 [[BTR-60]]s and additional troops. Shooting broke out at the fort under disputed circumstances.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Kukielski|first=Philip|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1139352788|title=The U.S. INVASION OF GRENADA legacy of a flawed victory.|date=2019|publisher=MCFARLAND|year=2019|isbn=978-1-4766-3832-4|location=Jefferson, NC|pages=184|oclc=1139352788}}</ref> Three soldiers and eight civilians were killed in the ensuing melee, and about 100 civilians wounded, a 2003 study found.<ref name=\":1\" /> The PRA quickly rearrested Bishop, Whiteman, two other government ministers, a trade union leader and three Bishop supporters.

Martial law was declared and 24-hour immediate curfew imposed. Violators were to be shot on sight, but none were. The curfew lasted four days and many prominent citizens were arrested. They included former Bishop officials, PRA officers and NJM members thought to be disloyal.<ref>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Lee|last2=Mendez|first2=Albert|title=Grenada 1983|year=1985|publisher=Osprey Publishing Ltd.|location=12-14 Long Acre, London WC2E 9LP|page=5}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 October 1983, the vanguard of 7,600 troops from the [[United States|United States,]] and 350 from the [[Caribbean Peace Force]], invaded Grenada, encountering resistance from the People's Revolutionary Army.  On the morning before the invasion, the PRAF mustered a permanent force of 463 men, supplemented by 257 militia and 58 untrained NJM party members.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Raines|first=Edgar F.|title=The Rucksack War|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=168}}</ref> The multinational intervention was also opposed by 636 armed Cuban construction workers under the leadership of 43 Cuban military advisers. The combat was occasionally intense for two days, but hostilities were declared ceased by U.S. forces on Nov. 2, 1983.\n\nA Pentagon historical study of [[Operation Urgent Fury]] later reported: \"US forces lost 19 killed and 116 wounded. Cuban forces lost 25 killed, 59 wounded and 638 captured.

Many of these soldiers were pointed out by their opponents to U.S. troops and arrested. The PRAF was disbanded and the island's police force was reconstituted and retrained.\n\nIn 1986, 18 Grenadians were tried by a Grenadian court for the 19 deaths that occurred at Ft. Rupert on Oct. 19, 1983. Seventeen defendants were convicted by a jury of murder or manslaughter, including eight PRA officers and three soldiers. All were imprisoned on the island while supporters waged a long-running campaign to free the so-called [[Grenada 17]].
