It was developed as one of the international installments of ''The Real Housewives'', an American television series franchise. The series chronicles the lives of several women living in [[Melbourne]], Australia.\n\nThe series originally focused on [[Gina Liano]], [[Jackie Gillies]], Andrea Moss, Janet Roach, [[Chyka Keebaugh]] and Lydia Schiavello; the lineup currently consists of Liano, Roach, Schiavello, Gamble Breaux, Anjali Rao, Cherry Dipietrantonio and Kyla Kirkpatrick. Of the original housewives, Moss left after the first season, whilst Keebaugh departed after the third and Gillies after the fourth. The remaining housewives joined in later seasons: Breaux in the second, Rao, Dipietrantonio and Kirkpatrick in the fifth. Other housewives include [[Pettifleur Berenger]] (seasons 2\u20133), Susie McLean (season 3), Sally Bloomfield (season 4) and Venus Behbahani-Clark (season 4).\n\nIts success has allowed for the development of ''The Real Housewives'' franchise by [[Matchbox Pictures]] and similar spin-off series based in [[The Real Housewives of Sydney|Sydney]] and [[The Real Housewives of Auckland|Auckland, New Zealand]].\n\nFoxtel announced on 10 September 2019 that the show had been renewed for a fifth season to be aired on Arena in 2020.\n\n==Overview and casting ==\n[[File:The Real Housewives Of Melbourne 2016 TV Week Logie Awards (26871490886).jpg|thumb|left|The cast at the 2016 Logie Awards.]]\n\n''The Real Housewives of Melbourne'' was first announced by Matchbox Pictures as ''The Real Housewives of Australia'' and was set to air in 2013.<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=David|title=The Real Housewives of Melbourne revealed|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/07/the-real-housewives-of-melbourne-revealed.html|website=TV Tonight|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=28 July 2013}}</ref> On 28 July 2013 it was announced that the series had been renamed to ''The Real Housewives of Melbourne'', along with the full cast of the six women.

The series chronicles the lives of several women living in [[Melbourne]], Australia.\n\nThe series originally focused on [[Gina Liano]], [[Jackie Gillies]], Andrea Moss, Janet Roach, [[Chyka Keebaugh]] and Lydia Schiavello; the lineup currently consists of Liano, Roach, Schiavello, Gamble Breaux, Anjali Rao, Cherry Dipietrantonio and Kyla Kirkpatrick. Of the original housewives, Moss left after the first season, whilst Keebaugh departed after the third and Gillies after the fourth. The remaining housewives joined in later seasons: Breaux in the second, Rao, Dipietrantonio and Kirkpatrick in the fifth. Other housewives include [[Pettifleur Berenger]] (seasons 2\u20133), Susie McLean (season 3), Sally Bloomfield (season 4) and Venus Behbahani-Clark (season 4).\n\nIts success has allowed for the development of ''The Real Housewives'' franchise by [[Matchbox Pictures]] and similar spin-off series based in [[The Real Housewives of Sydney|Sydney]] and [[The Real Housewives of Auckland|Auckland, New Zealand]].\n\nFoxtel announced on 10 September 2019 that the show had been renewed for a fifth season to be aired on Arena in 2020.\n\n==Overview and casting ==\n[[File:The Real Housewives Of Melbourne 2016 TV Week Logie Awards (26871490886).jpg|thumb|left|The cast at the 2016 Logie Awards.]]\n\n''The Real Housewives of Melbourne'' was first announced by Matchbox Pictures as ''The Real Housewives of Australia'' and was set to air in 2013.<ref name=\"Announcement\">{{cite web|last1=Knox|first1=David|title=The Real Housewives of Melbourne revealed|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2013/07/the-real-housewives-of-melbourne-revealed.html|website=TV Tonight|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=28 July 2013}}</ref> On 28 July 2013 it was announced that the series had been renamed to ''The Real Housewives of Melbourne'', along with the full cast of the six women.

For statistical purposes, Midway is grouped as one of the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]].

The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger [[Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument]].\n\nUntil 1993, the atoll was the home of the [[Naval Air Facility Midway Island]]. The [[Battle of Midway]], which was fought from June 4 until June 6, 1942, was a critical Allied victory of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The [[United States Navy]] successfully defended the atoll from a Japanese invasion, defeating a Japanese battle group, marking a turning point in the war in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. [[USAAF]] aircraft based at the then named [[Henderson Field (Midway)|Henderson Field]] on Eastern Island joined the attack against the Japanese fleet, which suffered losses of four carriers and one heavy cruiser.\n\nApproximately 100 to 200 people live on the atoll, which includes staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and contract workers. Visitation to the atoll is possible only for business reasons (which includes permanent and temporary staff, contractors and volunteers) as the tourism program has been suspended due to budget cutbacks. In 2012, the last year that the visitor program was in operation, 332 people made the trip to Midway.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140128062001/http://www.fws.gov/midway/visit.html Visiting Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge].

The economy is derived solely from governmental sources and tourist fees. Nearly all supplies must be brought to the island by ship or plane, though a [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] greenhouse and garden supply some fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n==Location==\nAs its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia, and lies almost halfway around the world longitudinally from [[Greenwich]], UK. It is near the northwestern end of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian archipelago]], about one-third of the way from [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, to [[Tokyo]], Japan. Midway island is not considered part of the State of Hawaii due to the passage of the Hawaii Organic Act, which formally annexed Hawaii to the United States as a territory, only defined Hawaii as \"the islands acquired by the United States of America under an Act of Congress entitled 'Joint resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States,' approved July seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.\" Although it could be argued that Midway became part of Hawaii when Middlebrooks discovered it in 1859, it was assumed at the time that Midway was independently acquired by the U.S. when Reynolds visited in 1867, and so was not considered part of the Territory.\n\nIn defining which islands the State of Hawaii would inherit from the Territory, the Hawaii Admissions Act clarified the question, specifically excluding Midway (along with [[Palmyra Island]], [[Johnston Island]], and [[Kingman Reef]]) from the jurisdiction of the state.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2009|title=GET /dgs HTTP/1.1 Host: www.WebComposition.net|journal=2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=1\u201310|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hicss.2009.229|isbn=9780769534503}}</ref>\n\nMidway Atoll is approximately {{convert|140|nmi|km mi|0}} east of the [[International Date Line]], about {{convert|2800|nmi|km mi|-2}} west of [[San Francisco]], and {{convert|2200|nmi|km mi|-2}} east of Tokyo.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+Geography of Midway<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service|title=More About Midway|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/more_about_midway.html|website=Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial|publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Island\n! scope=\"col\" | acres\n! scope=\"col\" | hectares\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sand Island\n| 1,117\n| 452\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Eastern Island\n| 336\n| 136\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Spit Island\n| 15\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Total land\n| 1,549\n| 627\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Submerged reef/ocean\n| 580,392\n| 234,876\n|}\n\nMidway Atoll is part of a chain of volcanic islands, [[atoll]]s, and [[seamount]]s extending from [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] up to the tip of the [[Aleutian Islands]] and known as the [[Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain]].

In fact, Midway was once a [[shield volcano]], perhaps as large as the island of [[Lanai|Lana'i]]. As the volcano piled up lava flows building the island, its weight depressed the crust and the island slowly subsided over a period of millions of years, a process known as [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]].\n\nAs the island subsided, a [[coral reef]] around the former volcanic island was able to maintain itself near sea level by growing upwards.

Brooks claimed Midway for the United States under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856, which authorized Americans to occupy uninhabited islands temporarily to obtain [[guano]]. There is no record of any attempt to mine guano on the island. On August 28, 1867, Captain [[William Reynolds (naval officer)|William Reynolds]] of {{USS|Lackawanna|1862|6}} formally took possession of the atoll for the United States;<ref>{{cite web|first= |last= |title = GAO/OGC-98-5 \u2013 U.S. Insular Areas: Application of the U.S. Constitution | date = November 7, 1997|url= http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GAOREPORTS-OGC-98-5/content-detail.html|publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}</ref> the name changed to \"Midway\" some time after this.

The purpose was to establish a mid-ocean [[coaling station]] to avoid the high taxes imposed at ports controlled by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. The project was shortly a complete failure, and {{USS|Saginaw|1859|6}} evacuated the last of the channel project's work force in October 1871. The ship ran aground at [[Kure Atoll]], stranding everyone. All were rescued, with the exception of four of the five persons who sailed to [[Kauai]] in an open boat to seek help.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Aerial view of Midway Atoll on 24 November 1941 (80-G-451086).jpg|thumb|Midway Atoll in November 1941, looking west]]\n\nIn 1903, workers for the [[Commercial Pacific Cable Company]] took up residence on the island as part of the effort to lay a trans-Pacific [[electric telegraph|telegraph]] cable. These workers introduced many non-native species to the island, including the [[Domestic Canary|canary]], [[Cycas|cycad]], [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]], [[Casuarina|she-oak]], [[coconut]], and various [[deciduous]] trees; along with ants, cockroaches, termites, centipedes, and countless others.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn January 20, 1903, the United States Navy opened a radio station in response to complaints from cable company workers about [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[squatting|squatters]] and [[Poaching|poachers]]. Between 1904 and 1908, President Roosevelt stationed 21 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] on the island to end wanton destruction of bird life and keep Midway safe as a [[United States territory|U.S. possession]], protecting the cable station.\n\nIn 1935, operations began for the [[Martin M-130]] [[flying boat]]s operated by [[Pan American Airlines]]. The M-130s island-hopped from San Francisco to China, providing the fastest and most luxurious route to the Far East and bringing tourists to Midway until 1941. Only the very wealthy could afford the trip, which in the 1930s cost more than three times the annual salary of an average American. With Midway on the route between [[Honolulu]] and [[Wake Island]], the flying boats landed in the atoll and pulled up to a float offshore in the lagoon. Tourists transferred to the Pan Am Hotel or the \"Gooneyville Lodge\", named after the ubiquitous \"Gooney birds\" ([[albatross]]es).\n\n{{Infobox NRHP | name =[[World War II Facilities at Midway]]\n  | nrhp_type = nhld\n  | nocat = yes\n  | image = Battle of Midway (Japanese air raid).jpg\n  | image_size = 263px\n  | caption = Burning oil tanks during the [[Battle of Midway]]\n  | location= Sand Island, [[Midway Islands]], [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]]\n  | locmapin = \n  | area =\n  | built =1941\n  | architect= [[United States Navy]]\n  | architecture=\n| designated_nrhp_type=May 28, 1987<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2005&ResourceType=District |title=World War II Facilities at Midway |accessdate=September 5, 2009|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n  | added = May 28, 1987<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/USMinor.pdf NHL designations]</ref>\n  | governing_body = [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]<ref name=nhlsum/>\n| refnum=87001302\n}}\n\n===World War II===\n{{Main article|Battle of Midway}}\n\nThe location of Midway in the Pacific became important militarily. Midway was a convenient refueling stop on transpacific flights, and was also an important stop for Navy ships. Beginning in 1940, as tensions with the Japanese rose, Midway was deemed second only to [[Pearl Harbor]] in importance to the protection of the U.S. west coast. Airstrips, gun emplacements and a seaplane base quickly materialized on the tiny atoll.<ref name=\"preparing\">[http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/preserving_the_past/Preparing_for_War.html Preparing for War] Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial.</ref>\n\nThe channel was widened, and [[Naval Air Station Midway]] was completed. Midway was also an important submarine base.<ref name=\"preparing\"/>\n\nOn February 14, 1941, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order (United States)|Executive Order]] 8682 to create naval defense areas in the central Pacific territories. The proclamation established \"Midway Island Naval Defensive Sea Area\", which encompassed the territorial waters between the extreme high-water marks and the three-mile marine boundaries surrounding Midway. \"Midway Island Naval Airspace Reservation\" was also established to restrict access to the airspace over the naval defense sea area. Only U.S. government ships and aircraft were permitted to enter the naval defense areas at Midway Atoll unless authorized by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]].\n\nMidway's importance to the U.S. was brought into focus on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. Midway was [[First Bombardment of Midway|attacked]] by two destroyers on the same day,<ref name=\"preparing\"/> and the Japanese force was successfully repulsed in the first American victory of the war.

The U.S. lost the aircraft carrier {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}}, along with a number of its carrier- and land-based aircraft that were either shot down by Japanese forces or bombed on the ground at the airfields. The [[Battle of Midway]] was, by most accounts, the beginning of the end of the Japanese Navy's control of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nStarting in July 1942, a [[submarine tender]] was always stationed at the atoll to support submarines patrolling Japanese waters. In 1944, a [[Dry dock#Floating|floating dry dock]] joined the tender.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/preserving_the_past/After_the_Battle_of_Midway.html\n | title =After the Battle of Midway\n | last =\n | first =\n | date =November 23, 2016\n | website =Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge\n | publisher =Fish & Wildlife Service\n | access-date =June 5, 2017\n | quote = }}</ref>\nAfter the Battle of Midway, a second airfield was developed, this one on Sand Island. This work necessitated enlarging the size of the island through land fill techniques, that when concluded, more than doubled the size of the island.\n\n===Korean and Vietnam Wars===\nFrom August 1, 1941 to 1945, it was occupied by U.S. military forces. In 1950, the Navy decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Midway]], only to re-commission it again to support the [[Korean War]]. Thousands of troops on ships and aircraft stopped at Midway for refueling and emergency repairs. From 1968 to September 10, 1993, Midway Island was a Naval Air Facility.\n\n[[File:Watch floor.gif|250px|thumb|right|Lofargram writers on NAVFAC watch floor.]]\nDuring the [[Cold War]] the U.S. established a shore terminal of the [[SOSUS|Sound Surveillance System]] (SOSUS), Naval Facility (NAVFAC) Midway Island, to track [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] submarines. The facility became operational in 1968 and was commissioned  13 January 1969.

In June 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] held a secret meeting with [[South Vietnam]]ese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]] at the Officer-in-Charge house or \"Midway House\".\n\n===Civilian handover===\n\nIn 1978, the Navy downgraded Midway from a Naval Air Station to a Naval Air Facility and large numbers of personnel and dependents began leaving the island. With the war in Vietnam over, and with the introduction of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s and nuclear submarines, Midway's significance to U.S. national security was diminished. The [[World War II Facilities at Midway|World War II facilities]] at Sand and Eastern Islands were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on May 28, 1987 and were simultaneously added

The refuge and most of its surrounding area are part of the larger [[Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument]].\n\nUntil 1993, the atoll was the home of the [[Naval Air Facility Midway Island]]. The [[Battle of Midway]], which was fought from June 4 until June 6, 1942, was a critical Allied victory of the [[Pacific War|Pacific campaign]] of [[World War II]]. The [[United States Navy]] successfully defended the atoll from a Japanese invasion, defeating a Japanese battle group, marking a turning point in the war in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]]. [[USAAF]] aircrafts based at the then named [[Henderson Field (Midway)|Henderson Field]] on Eastern Island joined the attack against the Japanese fleet, which suffered losses of four carriers and one heavy cruiser.\n\nApproximately 100 to 200 people live on the atoll, which includes staff of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and contract workers. Visitation to the atoll is possible only for business reasons (which includes permanent and temporary staff, contractors and volunteers) as the tourism program has been suspended due to budget cutbacks. In 2012, the last year that the visitor program was in operation, 332 people made the trip to Midway.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140128062001/http://www.fws.gov/midway/visit.html Visiting Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge].

Nearly all supplies must be brought to the island by ship or plane, though a [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] greenhouse and garden supply some fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n==Location==\nAs its name suggests, Midway is roughly equidistant between North America and Asia, and lies almost halfway around the world longitudinally from [[Greenwich]], UK. It is near the northwestern end of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian archipelago]], about one-third of the way from [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, to [[Tokyo]], Japan. Midway island is not considered part of the State of Hawaii due to the passage of the Hawaii Organic Act, which formally annexed Hawaii to the United States as a territory, only defined Hawaii as \"the islands acquired by the United States of America under an Act of Congress entitled 'Joint resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States,' approved July seventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight.\" Although it could be argued that Midway became part of Hawaii when Middlebrooks discovered it in 1859, it was assumed at the time that Midway was independently acquired by the U.S. when Reynolds visited in 1867, and so was not considered part of the Territory.\n\nIn defining which islands the State of Hawaii would inherit from the Territory, the Hawaii Admissions Act clarified the question, specifically excluding Midway (along with [[Palmyra Island]], [[Johnston Island]], and [[Kingman Reef]]) from the jurisdiction of the state.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2009|title=GET /dgs HTTP/1.1 Host: www.WebComposition.net|journal=2009 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|pages=1\u201310|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/hicss.2009.229|isbn=9780769534503}}</ref>\n\nMidway Atoll is approximately {{convert|140|nmi|km mi|0}} east of the [[International Date Line]], about {{convert|2800|nmi|km mi|-2}} west of [[San Francisco]], and {{convert|2200|nmi|km mi|-2}} east of Tokyo.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+Geography of Midway<ref>{{cite web|last1=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service|title=More About Midway|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/more_about_midway.html|website=Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial|publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Island\n! scope=\"col\" | acres\n! scope=\"col\" | hectares\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Sand Island\n| 1,117\n| 452\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Eastern Island\n| 336\n| 136\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Spit Island\n| 15\n| 6\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Total land\n| 1,549\n| 627\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Submerged reef/ocean\n| 580,392\n| 234,876\n|}\n\nMidway Atoll is part of a chain of volcanic islands, [[atoll]]s, and [[seamount]]s extending from [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] up to the tip of the [[Aleutian Islands]] and known as the [[Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain]].

Brooks claimed Midway for the United States under the [[Guano Islands Act]] of 1856, which authorized Americans to occupy uninhabited islands temporarily to obtain [[guano]]. There is no record of any attempt to mine guano on the island.

The purpose was to establish a mid-ocean [[coaling station]] to avoid the high taxes imposed at ports controlled by the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. The project was shortly a complete failure, and {{USS|Saginaw|1859|6}} evacuated the last of the channel project's work force in October 1871. The ship ran aground at [[Kure Atoll]], stranding everyone. All were rescued, with the exception of four of the five persons who sailed to [[Kauai]] in an open boat to seek help.\n\n===Early 20th century===\n[[File:Aerial view of Midway Atoll on 24 November 1941 (80-G-451086).jpg|thumb|Midway Atoll in November 1941, looking west]]\n\nIn 1903, workers for the [[Commercial Pacific Cable Company]] took up residence on the island as part of the effort to lay a trans-Pacific [[electric telegraph|telegraph]] cable. These workers introduced many non-native species to the island, including the [[Domestic Canary|canary]], [[Cycas|cycad]], [[Araucaria heterophylla|Norfolk Island pine]], [[Casuarina|she-oak]], [[coconut]], and various [[deciduous]] trees; along with ants, cockroaches, termites, centipedes, and countless others.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nOn January 20, 1903, the United States Navy opened a radio station in response to complaints from cable company workers about [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] [[squatting|squatters]] and [[Poaching|poachers]]. Between 1904 and 1908, President Roosevelt stationed 21 [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] on the island to end wanton destruction of bird life and keep Midway safe as a [[United States territory|U.S. possession]], protecting the cable station.\n\nIn 1935, operations began for the [[Martin M-130]] [[flying boat]]s operated by [[Pan American Airlines]]. The M-130s island-hopped from San Francisco to China, providing the fastest and most luxurious route to the Far East and bringing tourists to Midway until 1941. Only the very wealthy could afford the trip, which in the 1930s cost more than three times the annual salary of an average American. With Midway on the route between [[Honolulu]] and [[Wake Island]], the flying boats landed in the atoll and pulled up to a float offshore in the lagoon. Tourists transferred to the Pan Am Hotel or the \"Gooneyville Lodge\", named after the ubiquitous \"Gooney birds\" ([[albatross]]es).\n\n{{Infobox NRHP | name =[[World War II Facilities at Midway]]\n  | nrhp_type = nhld\n  | nocat = yes\n  | image = Battle of Midway (Japanese air raid).jpg\n  | image_size = 263px\n  | caption = Burning oil tanks during the [[Battle of Midway]]\n  | location= Sand Island, [[Midway Islands]], [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]]\n  | locmapin = \n  | area =\n  | built =1941\n  | architect= [[United States Navy]]\n  | architecture=\n| designated_nrhp_type=May 28, 1987<ref name=\"nhlsum\">{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2005&ResourceType=District |title=World War II Facilities at Midway |accessdate=September 5, 2009|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>\n  | added = May 28, 1987<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/Lists/USMinor.pdf NHL designations]</ref>\n  | governing_body = [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]<ref name=nhlsum/>\n| refnum=87001302\n}}\n\n===World War II===\n{{Main article|Battle of Midway}}\n\nThe location of Midway in the Pacific became important militarily. Midway was a convenient refueling stop on transpacific flights, and was also an important stop for Navy ships. Beginning in 1940, as tensions with the Japanese rose, Midway was deemed second only to [[Pearl Harbor]] in importance to the protection of the U.S. west coast. Airstrips, gun emplacements and a seaplane base quickly materialized on the tiny atoll.<ref name=\"preparing\">[http://www.fws.gov/refuge/Midway_Atoll/preserving_the_past/Preparing_for_War.html Preparing for War] Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge and Battle of Midway National Memorial.</ref>\n\nThe channel was widened, and [[Naval Air Station Midway]] was completed. Midway was also an important submarine base.<ref name=\"preparing\"/>\n\nOn February 14, 1941, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order (United States)|Executive Order]] 8682 to create naval defense areas in the central Pacific territories. The proclamation established \"Midway Island Naval Defensive Sea Area\", which encompassed the territorial waters between the extreme high-water marks and the three-mile marine boundaries surrounding Midway. \"Midway Island Naval Airspace Reservation\" was also established to restrict access to the airspace over the naval defense sea area. Only U.S. government ships and aircraft were permitted to enter the naval defense areas at Midway Atoll unless authorized by the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]].\n\nMidway's importance to the U.S. was brought into focus on December 7, 1941 when the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked Pearl Harbor]]. Midway was [[First Bombardment of Midway|attacked]] by two destroyers on the same day,<ref name=\"preparing\"/> and the Japanese force was successfully repulsed in the first American victory of the war.

The U.S. lost the aircraft carrier {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}}, along with a number of its carrier- and land-based aircraft that were either shot down by Japanese forces or bombed on the ground at the airfields. The [[Battle of Midway]] was, by most accounts, the beginning of the end of the Japanese Navy's control of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nStarting in July 1942, a [[submarine tender]] was always stationed at the atoll to support submarines patrolling Japanese waters.

The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] added renunciation of the new citizen's former sovereign to the oath.  The [[Naturalization Act of 1906]] added the section of the oath requiring new citizens to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\n\nThe Oath acquired a standard text in 1929.<ref name=uscis/> Prior to then, spoken oaths were adapted from naturalization law, and each court could develop its own procedures for administering the oath.\n\nThe [[McCarran Internal Security Act|Internal Security Act]] of 1950 added the text about bearing arms and performing noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States.  The section about performing work of national importance under civilian direction was added by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]].\n\n==Changing the oath==\n\nThe current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch.  Under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time, so long as the new text reasonably meets the \"five principles\" mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953. These principles are:\n\n*allegiance to the [[United States Constitution]],\n*renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances\n*defense of the Constitution against enemies \"foreign and domestic\"\n*promise to serve in the [[United States Armed Forces]] when required by law (either combat or non-combat)\n*promise to perform civilian duties of \"national importance\" when required by law\n\nThere has been some controversy about the wording of the oath, parts of which are based on the British [[Oath of Supremacy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} which was written in the 16th Century. As a result, some{{who|date=October 2013}} have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing. In the fall of 2003, CIS planned to change the oath of citizenship in time for [[Citizenship Day]] (September 17).<ref>[http://www.uscis.gov/files/pressrelease/Citizen_Day_13_Sep_05.pdf US Citizenship and Immigration Services Fact Sheet]</ref> The proposed oath was as follows:\n\n{{Quote|Solemnly, freely, and without mental reservation, I hereby renounce under oath all allegiance to any foreign state.

The applicant, Hungarian-born female suffragist [[Rosika Schwimmer]], had written that she was an \"uncompromising pacifist\" with \"no sense of nationalism, only a cosmic consciousness of belonging to the human family\". The Court found that persons holding such views were \"liable to be incapable of the attachment for and devotion to the principles of our Constitution\" that are required for naturalization.<ref>''[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/279/644/case.html United States v.

When asked if he would bear arms and perform noncombatant military service as required by the Oath, Huxley answered in the negative and was summoned before a judge. Huxley explained that his objection was based on philosophical convictions about the evil of war rather than religious beliefs. The judge adjourned proceedings and postponed a decision on Huxley's application in order to report to Washington. Huxley never received U.S. citizenship.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bedford |first=Sybille |title=Aldous Huxley: A Biography |year=2002 |publisher=Ivan R Dee |isbn=978-1-56663-454-0}}, p. 531-535, 545-546.</ref>\n\nIn the 1968 case ''[[In re Weitzman]]'', a U.S. district court considered the naturalization petition of Brenda Weitzman, a 25-year-old mother of two children from South Africa and religious [[non-believer]] who had refused to take the part of the Oath requiring her to serve in the Armed Forces.  She expressed a total \"objection to warfare and the bearing of arms\" ([[conscientious objector]]ship), being \"repulsed by no particular war, but by all killing.\"  The court, finding that her stance was \"based on a personal moral code and not on religious training and belief\" and that she did not recognize anything \"tantamount to a God or a Supreme Being\", denied her petition.<ref>''[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/284/514/1815591/ In re Weitzman]''</ref>\n\nThe precedent relied upon was ''[[United States v.

The [[Naturalization Act of 1795]] added renunciation of the new citizen's former sovereign to the oath.  The [[Naturalization Act of 1906]] added the section of the oath requiring new citizens to defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\n\nThe Oath acquired a standard text in 1929.<ref name=uscis/> Prior to then, spoken oaths were adapted from naturalization law, and each court could develop its own procedures for administering the oath.\n\nThe [[McCarran Internal Security Act|Internal Security Act]] of 1950 added the text about bearing arms and performing noncombatant service in the armed forces of the United States.  The section about performing work of national importance under civilian direction was added by the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952]].\n\n==Changing the oath==\n\nThe current exact text of the Oath of Citizenship is established only in the form of an administrative regulation promulgated by the executive branch.  Under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], CIS could theoretically change the text of the oath at any time, so long as the new text reasonably meets the \"five principles\" mandated by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1953. These principles are:\n\n*allegiance to the [[United States Constitution]],\n*renunciation of allegiance to any foreign country to which the immigrant has had previous allegiances\n*defense of the Constitution against enemies \"foreign and domestic\"\n*promise to serve in the [[United States Armed Forces]] when required by law (either combat or non-combat)\n*promise to perform civilian duties of \"national importance\" when required by law\n\nThere has been some controversy about the wording of the oath, parts of which are based on the British [[Oath of Supremacy]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} which was written in the 16th Century. As a result, some{{who|date=October 2013}} have suggested much of the language is antiquated and confusing.

When asked if he would bear arms and perform noncombatant military service as required by the Oath, Huxley answered in the negative and was summoned before a judge.

She expressed a total \"objection to warfare and the bearing of arms\" ([[conscientious objector]]ship), being \"repulsed by no particular war, but by all killing.\"  The court, finding that her stance was \"based on a personal moral code and not on religious training and belief\" and that she did not recognize anything \"tantamount to a God or a Supreme Being\", denied her petition.<ref>''[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/284/514/1815591/ In re Weitzman]''</ref>\n\nThe precedent relied upon was ''[[United States v.
