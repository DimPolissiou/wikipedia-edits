The border creates an effect like a [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photograph.

The band was formed in 2009 and was originally just a studio project. However, after gaining a wide popularity and signing to [[Unique Leader Records]], the band formed a full line-up and became a full-time touring band. Rings of Saturn's music features a highly technical style, heavily influenced by themes of [[Extraterrestrial life|alien life]] and [[outer space]]. They have released five full-length albums, with their third, ''[[Lugal Ki En]]'', released in 2014 and peaking at 126 on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart while their fourth, ''[[Ultu Ulla]]'' was released in 2017 and peaked at 76 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making it the band's highest peak to date. ''[[Gidim (album)|Gidim]]'' was released in October 2019.<ref name=\"Billboard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/1561870/rings-of-saturn/chart|title=Billboard|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=August 28, 2015}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\nRings of Saturn was formed in 2009 in high school only as a studio recording project with Lucas Mann on guitars, bass, and keyboards, [https://soci.ubc.ca/persons/peter-pawlak/ Peter Pawlak] on vocals, and Brent Silletto on drums. The band posted a track titled \"Abducted\" online and quickly gained listeners.

Brent Silletto and Peter Pawlak both left the band in December 2011.\n\nRings of Saturn, which at this point only included Lucas Mann and Joel Omans, toured with many different touring members before forming a line-up which added Ian Bearer, Sean Martinez and Ian Baker on vocals, bass, and drums respectively. This line-up recorded their second album, ''[[Dingir (album)|Dingir]]'', with the same producer from ''Embryonic Anomaly''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecirclepit.com/2012/10/rings-of-saturn-dingir-album-review.html |title=Rings Of Saturn \"Dingir\" Album Review / Stream! |publisher=The Circle Pit |date=October 28, 2012 |accessdate=August 22, 2014}}</ref> The album was originally scheduled to be released on November 20, 2012, but due to legal issues, the album release was pushed back to February 5, 2013.

The band toured the United States, Canada, and for the first time Mexico shortly after but no new songs were played from the newly released album.

Four passengers were killed, and 39 were injured, when a tyre broke on one of the wheels of the 8:54am express from Brighton to Flinders Street Station, causing the derailment of five carriages near Jolimont. The first car to leave the rails, the fourth in a train of nine, was dragged along the metals for some distance. When the forward coupling eventually broke, the carriage fell over an embankment about three feet high, into swampy ground. With the rear coupling of the toppled carriage still attached to those behind, the remainder of the train was suddenly checked, and the momentum of the fifth and sixth carriages caused them to shoot upwards, and then fall in the same direction. The carriage that had fallen was completely crushed beneath the one to which it had been coupled. The remainder of the carriages were brought to a standstill, and although the seventh and eighth had left the rails, they did not fall. There were about 120 passengers in the three carriages that toppled over the embankment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Disaster at Jolimont|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15169077?searchTerm=beaufort%20train%20crash%20victorian%20railways&searchLimits=|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Partial Reference - George Stephen dies in crash|url=http://www.foskc.org/pdf/CC28.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Picnic, 1882===\nOn the evening of 2 December 1882, one passenger was killed and 178 were injured when a collision occurred between a special train, which had been engaged to convey intending purchasers of land from the sale of the Box Hill estate, and the ordinary train from Melbourne to Camberwell. The disaster happened about 100 yards from a small wayside station called Picnic, between East Richmond and Hawthorn. The drivers knew nothing of the impending catastrophe until they got within two or three hundred yards of each other, and, as both trains were travelling at a fair rate of speed, the distance was too short to enable them to avoid a collision. The drivers stuck to their locomotives until they were just within a few feet of each other, when they jumped off. The buffers of the engines snapped, and the front of the engine attached to the train from Melbourne was smashed in right up to the funnel. Two carriages in each train were telescoped.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disastrous Railway Accident |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11561223 |accessdate=2019-07-19 |work=The Argus |date=1882-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Hawthorn Mishap|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15169077?searchTerm=beaufort%20train%20crash%20victorian%20railways&searchLimits=|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Little River, 1884===\nOn Wednesday, 2 April 1884, the 8.20 p.m. goods train from Melbourne to Geelong received the [[token (railway signalling)|staff]] from the porter at Werribee station and proceeded to Little River, where the train was to cross with the 7.10 p.m. passenger train from Geelong to Melbourne. In the unauthorised absence of the Werribee stationmaster at choir practice, his 17-year-old daughter inexplicably telegraphed to Little River that the line was clear. Consequently, Little River station released the passenger train to travel to Werribee. In darkness and heavy rain, the two trains collided head on near Little River. The two drivers and one passenger were killed. One of the drivers killed was Thomas Kitchen, who had been driving one of the trains involved in the accident at Picnic 18 months before.<ref>{{cite news|title=Serious Railway Accident: Collision Near Little River|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6046848|accessdate=2013-03-25|newspaper=The Argus|date=1884-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Harrigan|first=Leo J.|title=Victorian Railways to \u201862|location=Melbourne|publisher=Victorian Railways Public Relations and Betterment Board|year=1962|pages=177\u20138}}</ref>\n\n===Windsor, 1887===\nOn 11 May 1887 the 5.30 p.m. train from [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] to [[Balaclava railway station, Melbourne|Balaclava]] came to a standstill just before [[Windsor railway station, Melbourne|Windsor station]] because the [[Railway semaphore signal#Outer home|outer home signal]] was at danger. When the signal changed to proceed, the train would not move because the [[railway air brake|air brake]] hose pipe between the locomotive and the first carriage had broken, meaning that the brakes could not be released.\n\nThe [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard .28United Kingdom and Australasia.29|guard]] of the train did not go back to warn approaching trains, as required by the rules. Instead he walked forward to examine the brake problem. An express train to [[Brighton Beach railway station|Brighton]], which had left Flinders Street ten minutes after the disabled train, crashed into it from the rear. The driver of the express could not see the stationary train until far too late, owing to the curve in the track just beyond the High Street bridge over the line.\n\nThe locomotive of the express demolished the guard's van of the Balaclava train, as well as three of its carriages. Six people were killed, including the driver and fireman of the express.

When the train passed under the road overpass adjacent to the Ocean Child Hotel in [[North Geelong, Victoria|North Geelong]], Henry Walter, the locomotive superintendent of the company, was knocked off the locomotive and fatally injured.<ref>{{cite news|title=Opening of the Geelong and Melbourne Railway|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7134247|accessdate=2014-05-19|newspaper=The Argus|date=1857-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Harrigan|first=Leo J.|title=Victorian Railways to \u201862|location=Melbourne|publisher=Victorian Railways Public Relations and Betterment Board|year=1962|page=34}}</ref>\n\n===Jolimont, 1881===\nOn 30 August 1881, the first accident in Victoria involving passenger deaths and multiple injuries occurred. Four passengers were killed, and 39 were injured, when a tyre broke on one of the wheels of the 8:54am express from Brighton to Flinders Street Station, causing the derailment of five carriages near Jolimont. The first car to leave the rails, the fourth in a train of nine, was dragged along the metals for some distance. When the forward coupling eventually broke, the carriage fell over an embankment about three feet high, into swampy ground. With the rear coupling of the toppled carriage still attached to those behind, the remainder of the train was suddenly checked, and the momentum of the fifth and sixth carriages caused them to shoot upwards, and then fall in the same direction. The carriage that had fallen was completely crushed beneath the one to which it had been coupled. The remainder of the carriages were brought to a standstill, and although the seventh and eighth had left the rails, they did not fall. There were about 120 passengers in the three carriages that toppled over the embankment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Disaster at Jolimont|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15169077?searchTerm=beaufort%20train%20crash%20victorian%20railways&searchLimits=|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Partial Reference - George Stephen dies in crash|url=http://www.foskc.org/pdf/CC28.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Picnic, 1882===\nOn the evening of 2 December 1882, one passenger was killed and 178 were injured when a collision occurred between a special train, which had been engaged to convey intending purchasers of land from the sale of the Box Hill estate, and the ordinary train from Melbourne to Camberwell. The disaster happened about 100 yards from a small wayside station called Picnic, between East Richmond and Hawthorn. The drivers knew nothing of the impending catastrophe until they got within two or three hundred yards of each other, and, as both trains were travelling at a fair rate of speed, the distance was too short to enable them to avoid a collision. The drivers stuck to their locomotives until they were just within a few feet of each other, when they jumped off. The buffers of the engines snapped, and the front of the engine attached to the train from Melbourne was smashed in right up to the funnel. Two carriages in each train were telescoped.<ref>{{cite news |title=Disastrous Railway Accident |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11561223 |accessdate=2019-07-19 |work=The Argus |date=1882-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Hawthorn Mishap|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15169077?searchTerm=beaufort%20train%20crash%20victorian%20railways&searchLimits=|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Little River, 1884===\nOn Wednesday, 2 April 1884, the 8.20 p.m. goods train from Melbourne to Geelong received the [[token (railway signalling)|staff]] from the porter at Werribee station and proceeded to Little River, where the train was to cross with the 7.10 p.m. passenger train from Geelong to Melbourne. In the unauthorised absence of the Werribee stationmaster at choir practice, his 17-year-old daughter inexplicably telegraphed to Little River that the line was clear. Consequently, Little River station released the passenger train to travel to Werribee. In darkness and heavy rain, the two trains collided head on near Little River. The two drivers and one passenger were killed. One of the drivers killed was Thomas Kitchen, who had been driving one of the trains involved in the accident at Picnic 18 months before.<ref>{{cite news|title=Serious Railway Accident: Collision Near Little River|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6046848|accessdate=2013-03-25|newspaper=The Argus|date=1884-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Harrigan|first=Leo J.|title=Victorian Railways to \u201862|location=Melbourne|publisher=Victorian Railways Public Relations and Betterment Board|year=1962|pages=177\u20138}}</ref>\n\n===Windsor, 1887===\nOn 11 May 1887 the 5.30 p.m. train from [[Flinders Street railway station|Flinders Street station]] to [[Balaclava railway station, Melbourne|Balaclava]] came to a standstill just before [[Windsor railway station, Melbourne|Windsor station]] because the [[Railway semaphore signal#Outer home|outer home signal]] was at danger. When the signal changed to proceed, the train would not move because the [[railway air brake|air brake]] hose pipe between the locomotive and the first carriage had broken, meaning that the brakes could not be released.\n\nThe [[Conductor (transportation)#Train guard .28United Kingdom and Australasia.29|guard]] of the train did not go back to warn approaching trains, as required by the rules. Instead he walked forward to examine the brake problem. An express train to [[Brighton Beach railway station|Brighton]], which had left Flinders Street ten minutes after the disabled train, crashed into it from the rear. The driver of the express could not see the stationary train until far too late, owing to the curve in the track just beyond the High Street bridge over the line.\n\nThe locomotive of the express demolished the guard's van of the Balaclava train, as well as three of its carriages. Six people were killed, including the driver and fireman of the express. Ironically, the Chairman of the Victorian Railways Commissioners, [[Richard Speight]], and his fellow commissioner William Green, were travelling in the express. They were uninjured.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shocking Railway Disaster|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article7892089|accessdate=2013-03-25|newspaper=The Argus|date=1887-05-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Harrigan|first=Leo J.|title=Victorian Railways to \u201862|location=Melbourne|publisher=Victorian Railways Public Relations and Betterment Board|year=1962|page=178}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Potts|first=Don|title=The Windsor Accident|year=1968|publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society - Victorian Division|location=Melbourne}}</ref>\n\n===Hawksburn, 1896===\nOn Friday 30 May 1896, Charles Heatley, the stationmaster of Hawksburn station, was struck and killed by a goods train while he was crossing the tracks at the station. As a passenger train was pulling up there, Heatley jumped down from the opposite platform and stood between the tracks, waiting for an opportunity to cross to the platform at which the train has arrived. He was not aware of a goods train approaching from the other direction and was hit by the locomotive, throwing him against the passenger train.

A light engine (i.e. one without a train) was standing in Beaufort station as the runaway train approached, and the signalman turned the oncoming train into a dead-end siding.\n\nWhen the train struck the buffers at the end of the siding, the leading locomotive derailed, with its tender in an almost perpendicular position. The second locomotive and its tender were jammed together in the form of a \"V\". The driver of the leading locomotive and the fireman of the second one were killed outright, and the fireman of the first engine was trapped in the wreckage and could not be extricated before he died. The driver of the second engine was able to jump clear, but suffered scalding to the face and internal injuries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Railway Smash|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/10832726|accessdate=2018-01-10|work=The Argus|date=1910-02-07}}</ref> The accident was caused by brake failure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brake Failure|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/railways/theme.aspx?lvl=3&IRN=510&gall=548|accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Richmond, 1910===\nOn 18 July 1910, nine people were killed and over 400 were injured when, in heavy fog, a train from Elsternwick crashed into the rear of a train from Brighton at Richmond station.

The [[railway air brake|air brakes]] on the train had become defective, so the driver and guard decided to use the hand brakes on the goods wagons to control the train on its descent. These proved ineffective and the train ran away down the grade. It was diverted on to a {{convert|66|yd|m|0|adj=on}} runaway siding which had recently been provided at the junction to prevent out-of-control trains from running on to the main line.

The accident occurred on the [[Dudley Street]] bridge, between [[Southern Cross railway station|Spencer Street]] and [[North Melbourne railway station|North Melbourne]] stations. The Show special was supposed to be held at a signal so that the Coburg train could cross in front of it while switching tracks. However, the special ran through the signal and the locomotives of the two trains collided. Three carriages of the Coburg train were telescoped and two compartments of the first carriage of the show train were badly damaged.<ref>{{cite news|title=Railway Collision|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/10507750|accessdate=2016-09-06|work=The Argus|date=1912-09-05}}</ref>\n\n===Highett, 1925===\nOn 23 March 1925 eight people were killed when a car was run into by an electric parcels van at a gated level crossing at Wickham Road, Highett.

The guard of the stationary train, Thomas Middlin, jumped clear just before the crash, but died later that day from injuries he received. The signalman at the previous station, [[Mangalore railway station|Mangalore]], had fallen asleep after the passage of the first train, and awoke as the second train approached, allowing it to proceed despite not having received a \"line clear\" signal from Seymour.

The university was established in 1968. It has an excellent reputation in electrical and mechanical engineering{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} and has a partnership with the German car manufacturer [[Audi]].\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1963 the government made a resolution to establish an architectural university. In 1968 the resolution was changed and the government wished to build a telecommunication university. The university\u2019s predecessor in title, the Transportation and Telecommunication Faculty of Technical Sciences, was established in this year.  The faculty trained engineers for the transportation and telecommunication infrastructure. The building of the university was built\u2014an unmatched exception in Hungary, originally for education purposes\u2014on the picturesque bend of the Moson [[Danube]] within walking distance of the baroque city. In the early 1990s beyond the technical sciences, economical, medical and social programmes became in demand. In 1995 the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]] set up a law programme here, so the juridical training returned to the city and, since 2002, it is its own programme at Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n University.\n\nThe institution bears the name of [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] the \"greatest Hungarian\" since 1986.

The university has several projects underway including AUTOPOLIS: The construction of a new building will expand the capacity of the university and will serve for research and development purposes. Within this project a foot-bridge will be re-located and two multi-storey car parks will be built. The project is estimated to be finished in 2011.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n== Student life ==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:SZE race.jpg|thumb|right|150px| Sz\u00e9chenyi race]] -->\n\nThere are several opportunities for entertainment in Gy\u0151r and at the university. Every year there is a Sz\u00e9chenyi-week, where famous Hungarian people (writers, comedians, etc.) are invited. The university offers opportunities to do sport (rowing, soccer, swimming etc.).

In 1968 the resolution was changed and the government wished to build a telecommunication university. The university\u2019s predecessor in title, the Transportation and Telecommunication Faculty of Technical Sciences, was established in this year.  The faculty trained engineers for the transportation and telecommunication infrastructure. The building of the university was built\u2014an unmatched exception in Hungary, originally for education purposes\u2014on the picturesque bend of the Moson [[Danube]] within walking distance of the baroque city. In the early 1990s beyond the technical sciences, economical, medical and social programmes became in demand. In 1995 the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University]] set up a law programme here, so the juridical training returned to the city and, since 2002, it is its own programme at Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n University.\n\nThe institution bears the name of [[Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi]] the \"greatest Hungarian\" since 1986.

As a M\u0101ori-led organisation grounded in M\u0101ori values, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is committed to the revitalisation of M\u0101ori cultural knowledge. It is also focused on breaking inter-generational cycles of non-participation in tertiary education to reduce poverty and eliminate associated social issues.

The genesis of what would become Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa emerged as the brainchild of [http://www.teawamutucol.school.nz/ Te Awamutu College] board of governors' member [[Rongo Wetere]] and [[M\u0101ori Studies]] teacher Iwi Kohuru (Boy) Mangu. The two men wanted to provide a \u2018[[marae]] of learning' as an educational alternative for the large number of predominantly M\u0101ori students being expelled from Te Awamutu College.\n\nTheir solution was to lead a group of these students to create a [[wharenui]] on the college's grounds. The two men were joined in their endeavours by [[tohunga]] whakairo (master carvers) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110813182746/http://www.thearts.co.nz/artist_page.php%26aid%3D11 Pakariki Harrison] and [http://www.waipadc.govt.nz/Council/NewsNoticesAndEvents/Fifteen+acknowledged+at+Waipa+Heritage+Awards.htm Mac Bell]) and [[tohunga raranga]] (master weaver) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120404134248/http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/en/news/couple-share-te-waka-toi-award Hinemoa Harrison]. The resulting structure, ''O-T\u0101whao Marae'', was opened on 26 April 1985 and is still used to introduce students to ''[[M\u0101ori language|te ao M\u0101ori]]'' (the world of M\u0101ori). Although the project encountered resistance at the time, O-T\u0101whao is now recognised as an  [http://www.teawamutu.co.nz/courier/archive/2009/2009-08-04.pdf invaluable resource] for the college and [[Te Awamutu]] community.\n\nIn 1984, Mr Wetere led a project to create the ''Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre''.  The centre would provide further educational opportunities for the students who were involved in the O-T\u0101whao Marae project and engage others in the community who had no qualifications.  The aim was to provide these people with a future beyond the unemployment queues. Although some government funding was available, further fundraising and, in some cases, personal loans from founders were needed to complete the centre.  On completion of the centre, new government funding became available that enabled the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre to expand its programme portfolio.  Office administration, computer technology studies and trades training programmes in building and plumbing were added to the [[whakairo]] (carving), raranga (weaving) and [[M\u0101ori language|Te reo M\u0101ori]] programmes already running.  The centre also became involved in community projects, including renovating [[marae]] throughout the country and producing carving and weaving to adorn these buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the 1980s (a time of high unemployment in [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand), the kaupapa (philosophy) of the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre was to increase M\u0101ori participation in tertiary training by taking education to the people, particularly those without qualifications. With travel a major barrier for many, the founders began opening campuses in other areas, including [[Te Kuiti]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Manukau]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1987, Buck Nin (a leading New Zealand educationalist and artist)<ref>http://nzchinese.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=noted&action=display&thread=98</ref>{{better source|date=November 2016}} and Mr Wetere advanced the concept of creating a tertiary education institute, or [[w\u0101nanga]]. Dr Nin believed that, by gaining tertiary status, Aotearoa Institute would earn recognition for its qualifications throughout [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand and the world. In 1988, the pair submitted an application to the Ministry of Education and the following year the government changed the Education Act to open the way for recognition of w\u0101nanga as tertiary education institutions.  The same year (1989), Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre changed its name to Aotearoa Institute and shortly afterwards became the first registered private training establishment (under [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]]) in the country.\n\nThe Aotearoa Institute lobbied government for a further five years before being granted tertiary status in 1993. This gave the organisation statutory recognition as a w\u0101nanga and placed it alongside universities, polytechnics and teachers' training colleges. In 1994, Aotearoa Institute changed its name to Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa to reflect this change in status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa experienced phenomenal growth during the early 2000s (growing from 3,127 students in 2000 to 66,756 students in 2004) and quickly become the largest tertiary education institution in the country; however, there was a price to pay for this rapid expansion. The organisation became mired under the weight of its own popularity; it was struggling to keep pace with the insatiable desire for learning amongst those who had previously been sidelined by an exclusive education system and its internal processes were struggling to cope.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2005, the government appointed a group of Crown managers to help consolidate the organisation and put in place systems and processes more befitting a nationwide institution of this magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2005/twoa/summary.htm |title=Inquiry into certain aspects of Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa  |publisher=[[Controller and Auditor-General of New Zealand|Office of the Auditor-General]] New Zealand |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> This work included a nationwide restructure, reorganisation of the executive level of the institution, and a review of the curriculum portfolio.

To eliminate these barriers, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa strives to keep fees to an absolute minimum, to maximise programme options and locations, to offer a range of flexible learning hours and to provide as much student support as possible.

Most notably, 91% of students across the country were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their tutor and 90% of students were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their learning environment. Students also recorded high levels of satisfaction with the quality of learning resources, their programmes and the quality of facilities on their campus.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2010, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa achieved an overall programme graduation rate of 70%, and course completion and retention rates of 78% and 81% respectively.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==''M\u0101t\u0101tahi Mataora'' - Youth Initiatives==\nDuring the 25 years since its foundation, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa has been catering for an increasingly more mature student group as the organisation's reputation for delivering inclusive and engaging adult education has spread.

The genesis of what would become Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa emerged as the brainchild of [http://www.teawamutucol.school.nz/ Te Awamutu College] board of governors' member [[Rongo Wetere]] and [[M\u0101ori Studies]] teacher Iwi Kohuru (Boy) Mangu. The two men wanted to provide a \u2018[[marae]] of learning' as an educational alternative for the large number of predominantly M\u0101ori students being expelled from Te Awamutu College.\n\nTheir solution was to lead a group of these students to create a [[wharenui]] on the college's grounds. The two men were joined in their endeavours by [[tohunga]] whakairo (master carvers) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110813182746/http://www.thearts.co.nz/artist_page.php%26aid%3D11 Pakariki Harrison] and [http://www.waipadc.govt.nz/Council/NewsNoticesAndEvents/Fifteen+acknowledged+at+Waipa+Heritage+Awards.htm Mac Bell]) and [[tohunga raranga]] (master weaver) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120404134248/http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/en/news/couple-share-te-waka-toi-award Hinemoa Harrison]. The resulting structure, ''O-T\u0101whao Marae'', was opened on 26 April 1985 and is still used to introduce students to ''[[M\u0101ori language|te ao M\u0101ori]]'' (the world of M\u0101ori). Although the project encountered resistance at the time, O-T\u0101whao is now recognised as an  [http://www.teawamutu.co.nz/courier/archive/2009/2009-08-04.pdf invaluable resource] for the college and [[Te Awamutu]] community.\n\nIn 1984, Mr Wetere led a project to create the ''Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre''.  The centre would provide further educational opportunities for the students who were involved in the O-T\u0101whao Marae project and engage others in the community who had no qualifications.  The aim was to provide these people with a future beyond the unemployment queues. Although some government funding was available, further fundraising and, in some cases, personal loans from founders were needed to complete the centre.  On completion of the centre, new government funding became available that enabled the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre to expand its programme portfolio.  Office administration, computer technology studies and trades training programmes in building and plumbing were added to the [[whakairo]] (carving), raranga (weaving) and [[M\u0101ori language|Te reo M\u0101ori]] programmes already running.  The centre also became involved in community projects, including renovating [[marae]] throughout the country and producing carving and weaving to adorn these buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the 1980s (a time of high unemployment in [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand), the kaupapa (philosophy) of the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre was to increase M\u0101ori participation in tertiary training by taking education to the people, particularly those without qualifications. With travel a major barrier for many, the founders began opening campuses in other areas, including [[Te Kuiti]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Manukau]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1987, Buck Nin (a leading New Zealand educationalist and artist)<ref>http://nzchinese.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=noted&action=display&thread=98</ref>{{better source|date=November 2016}} and Mr Wetere advanced the concept of creating a tertiary education institute, or [[w\u0101nanga]]. Dr Nin believed that, by gaining tertiary status, Aotearoa Institute would earn recognition for its qualifications throughout [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand and the world. In 1988, the pair submitted an application to the Ministry of Education and the following year the government changed the Education Act to open the way for recognition of w\u0101nanga as tertiary education institutions.  The same year (1989), Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre changed its name to Aotearoa Institute and shortly afterwards became the first registered private training establishment (under [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]]) in the country.\n\nThe Aotearoa Institute lobbied government for a further five years before being granted tertiary status in 1993. This gave the organisation statutory recognition as a w\u0101nanga and placed it alongside universities, polytechnics and teachers' training colleges. In 1994, Aotearoa Institute changed its name to Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa to reflect this change in status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa experienced phenomenal growth during the early 2000s (growing from 3,127 students in 2000 to 66,756 students in 2004) and quickly become the largest tertiary education institution in the country; however, there was a price to pay for this rapid expansion. The organisation became mired under the weight of its own popularity; it was struggling to keep pace with the insatiable desire for learning amongst those who had previously been sidelined by an exclusive education system and its internal processes were struggling to cope.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2005, the government appointed a group of Crown managers to help consolidate the organisation and put in place systems and processes more befitting a nationwide institution of this magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2005/twoa/summary.htm |title=Inquiry into certain aspects of Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa  |publisher=[[Controller and Auditor-General of New Zealand|Office of the Auditor-General]] New Zealand |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> This work included a nationwide restructure, reorganisation of the executive level of the institution, and a review of the curriculum portfolio.

It won the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]].\n\nLiu Ye plays a young scientist whose rising star must confront the dark forces of politics, ego, and cultural insensitivity. The film is loosely based on the [[University of Iowa shooting]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is inspired by the true story of [[Gang Lu]], a former graduate student who killed four faculty members and one student at the [[University of Iowa]]. However, the story has substantial differences in plot and character motivation.\n\nLiu Xing ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]) is a humble but brilliant Chinese student who arrives at Valley State University and makes a bumpy transition into American life with the help of Joanna Silver ([[Meryl Streep]]). Silver is a wealthy university patron who has a fascination with Chinese culture and takes a liking to Liu Xing. Xing joins a select [[cosmology]] group under the direction of his hero, the famous cosmologist Professor Jacob Reiser ([[Aidan Quinn]]). The group is working to create a model of the [[origins of the universe]], based on Reiser's theory. Xing's enormous talent leads him quickly to become Reiser's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and it seems that only hard work stands between him and a bright future in science.\n\nXing is obsessed with the study of [[dark matter]], an unseen substance that he believes shapes the universe, and a theory that conflicts with the Reiser model. Xing makes scientific breakthroughs of his own which improve the Reiser model. Without Professor Reiser's approval, Liu Xing proposes to research dark matter for his [[thesis#United States|doctoral dissertation]]. Reiser explains to Xing that this type of research is too complicated and suggests that he should pick a simpler dissertation topic.\n\nRefusing to work with Xing, Reiser finds a new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Feng Gang (Lloyd Suh), another Chinese student who was Xing's rival in undergraduate school in [[Beijing]]. Professor Reiser approves of Feng's dissertation proposal as it sticks to the Reiser model. Feng's English skills are far superior to his fellow Chinese students', and he refuses to speak in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] with them. Feng changes his name to Laurence so that Americans would be more comfortable pronouncing his name.\n\nWithout the permission of Professor Reiser, Xing publishes an article in an astronomy journal. Reiser is enraged by this and refuses to accept Xing's doctoral dissertation.\n\nAt a graduation party for the Chinese students it is announced that Laurence Feng has won the university's [[Murray Gell-Mann#Awards and honors|Gell-Mann]] honorary doctorate prize for that year. Joanna Silver urges Professor Reiser to do something to help Liu Xing. Reiser informs her that he has written a \"very fine\" recommendation for him. \n  \nXing does not graduate and finds his dream of winning the Nobel Prize shattered.

[[IMDb]] |accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n'''''Dark Matter'''''  is a 2007 American [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] and the first feature film by opera director [[Chen Shi-zheng]], starring [[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]], [[Aidan Quinn]] and [[Meryl Streep]]. It won the [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]] at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]].\n\nLiu Ye plays a young scientist whose rising star must confront the dark forces of politics, ego, and cultural insensitivity. The film is loosely based on the [[University of Iowa shooting]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is inspired by the true story of [[Gang Lu]], a former graduate student who killed four faculty members and one student at the [[University of Iowa]]. However, the story has substantial differences in plot and character motivation.\n\nLiu Xing ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]) is a humble but brilliant Chinese student who arrives at Valley State University and makes a bumpy transition into American life with the help of Joanna Silver ([[Meryl Streep]]). Silver is a wealthy university patron who has a fascination with Chinese culture and takes a liking to Liu Xing. Xing joins a select [[cosmology]] group under the direction of his hero, the famous cosmologist Professor Jacob Reiser ([[Aidan Quinn]]). The group is working to create a model of the [[origins of the universe]], based on Reiser's theory. Xing's enormous talent leads him quickly to become Reiser's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and it seems that only hard work stands between him and a bright future in science.\n\nXing is obsessed with the study of [[dark matter]], an unseen substance that he believes shapes the universe, and a theory that conflicts with the Reiser model. Xing makes scientific breakthroughs of his own which improve the Reiser model. Without Professor Reiser's approval, Liu Xing proposes to research dark matter for his [[thesis#United States|doctoral dissertation]]. Reiser explains to Xing that this type of research is too complicated and suggests that he should pick a simpler dissertation topic.\n\nRefusing to work with Xing, Reiser finds a new prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Feng Gang (Lloyd Suh), another Chinese student who was Xing's rival in undergraduate school in [[Beijing]]. Professor Reiser approves of Feng's dissertation proposal as it sticks to the Reiser model. Feng's English skills are far superior to his fellow Chinese students', and he refuses to speak in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] with them. Feng changes his name to Laurence so that Americans would be more comfortable pronouncing his name.\n\nWithout the permission of Professor Reiser, Xing publishes an article in an astronomy journal. Reiser is enraged by this and refuses to accept Xing's doctoral dissertation.\n\nAt a graduation party for the Chinese students it is announced that Laurence Feng has won the university's [[Murray Gell-Mann#Awards and honors|Gell-Mann]] honorary doctorate prize for that year. Joanna Silver urges Professor Reiser to do something to help Liu Xing. Reiser informs her that he has written a \"very fine\" recommendation for him. \n  \nXing does not graduate and finds his dream of winning the Nobel Prize shattered. He goes on to sell beauty products to try to make money. His roommate offers to find him a job in China, but Xing refuses to leave. A few months pass and Xing mails all of his money to his parents in China.\n\nOne day, Xing returns to campus. He heads into an auditorium where Laurence Feng is giving a presentation to the cosmology department. Unable to cope with his emotions, Xing pulls a revolver out of his coat and begins firing, shooting Laurence and Reiser before making his way to Reiser's office and shooting himself in the head.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]] as [[Gang Lu#Popular culture|Liu Xing]] (S: \u5218 \u5174, T: \u5289 \u8208, P: ''Li\u00fa X\u012bng'')\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Jacob Reiser\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Joanna Silver\n* Lloyd Suh as Laurence Feng (S: \u51af \u521a, T: \u99ae \u525b, P: ''F\u00e9ng G\u0101ng'')\n* Peng Chi as Mama\n* [[Blair Brown]] as Hildy\n* [[Boris McGiver]] as Reverend Hollings\n* [[Bill Irwin]] as Hal Silver\n* [[Zhang Hui (actor)|Hui Zhang]] as Monkey King\n* [[Taylor Schilling]] as Jackie\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Professor Colby\n* [[Rob Campbell]] as Gary Small\n* Jodi Russell as Claire Reiser\n* Qian Ye as Cindy Feng\n\n==Release==\nThis film's general U.S. release date, originally set for April 2007, was pushed back over a year  because its plot line of an East Asian student involved in a mass shooting on a U.S. college campus too closely resembled the [[Virginia Tech shooting]].<ref>[https://www.today.com/popculture/streep-film-delayed-because-campus-shooting-wbna23189744 nbcnews.com, Streep film delayed because of campus shooting, updated 5:37 p.m. ET, Fri., Feb. 15, 2008]</ref> It was finally released in the US market in April 2008.\n\n==Response==\n===Box office===\n''Dark Matter'' grossed $30,591 in the United States and Canada<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Dark-Matter#tab=summary |title=''Dark Matter'' (2018) - Financial Information |publisher=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]], Nash Information Services, LLC |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> and $38,788 in other territories, for a total worldwide of $69,379.<ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 40 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 4.99/10.
