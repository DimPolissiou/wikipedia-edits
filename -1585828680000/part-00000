The championship takes place over three days and features 11 games, with teams seeded 1-8. Teams are ranked by a committee as well as by the ELO ranking used to determine weekly Top 10 rankings nationally.<ref name=Regulations/> Conference champions can be ranked no lower than 6th place. The team ranked 1st plays the 8th ranked team, 2nd plays 7th, 3rd plays 6th, and 4th plays 5th in the quarter-finals. To ensure common rest times, teams are not re-seeded after the first round, so the winner of 1v8 plays the winner of 4v5 and the winner of 2v7 plays the winner of 3v6.<ref name=Regulations/> There is also a [[Third place playoff|consolation bracket]] to determine the third place winner (bronze medalist) and fifth place winner.

The championship takes place over three days and features 11 games, with teams seeded 1-8. Teams are ranked by a committee as well as by the ELO ranking used to determine weekly Top 10 rankings nationally.<ref name=Regulations/> Conference champions can be ranked no lower than 6th place. The team ranked 1st plays the 8th ranked team, 2nd plays 7th, 3rd plays 6th, and 4th plays 5th in the quarter-finals. To ensure common rest times, teams are not re-seeded after the first round, so the winner of 1v8 plays the winner of 4v5 and the winner of 2v7 plays the winner of 3v6.<ref name=Regulations/> There is also a [[Third place playoff|consolation bracket]] to determine the third place winner (bronze medalist) and fifth place winner. The gold medal game is the last game played in the tournament.<ref name=Regulations/>\n\n==Results==\n===Round Robin Format (1971\u20131982)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;

At the age of 17, in 1908, she organised an international reading room for the children of foreign works at a tobacco factory in an industrial quarter of Stuttgart.\n\nIn 1913 she married Gustav Horace Lepman (1877-1922), the German-American co-owner of a bedspring factory in [[Stuttgart-Feuerbach]]. Together they had two children: (Anne-Marie, born in 1918, G\u00fcnther, born in 1921). During the [[World War I]] Gustav Lepman served as an officer in the German army on the battlefields in France. He died as the result of his war injuries in 1922, leaving her widowed at age 31.\n \nAfter the death of her husband, Jella Lepman became editor of the ''Stuttgarter Neues Tagblatt'', the first woman ever to hold this position. She wrote socio-political contributions and in 1927 introduced the newspaper supplement for women titled  \"The woman in house, profession and society\". In addition, she published her first children's book (1927 ''The Sleeping Sunday'') and a theatrical play for children (1929 ''The Singing Pfennig'') which was performed on the smaller state of the W\u00fcrttemberg State Theatre. She became a member of the [[German Democratic Party]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Partei'', DDP), where she was a leader in the women's group. In 1929, she ran, unsuccessfully, for the German [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stadtlexikon-stuttgart.de/article/d6a07d28-640b-4bcb-b202-a823655f6cbd/Jella_Lepman_%281891-1970%29.html | title=Jella Lepman (1891 \u2013 1970) |accessdate=April 1, 2020|date=April 19, 2018| work=Stadtlexikon| author=Ferchl, Irene |language=de}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933, Jella Lepman, as a Jew, lost her job at the newspaper, but was able to continue working for it as a freelancer until 1935.

In 1938 she helped organise the papers of [[Arthur Schnitzler]] which had recently arrived at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Later, she worked for the [[BBC]] and the [[American Broadcasting Station in Europe]] (ABSIE). In 1942 she published a German-language reader titled '' Die Kinder vom Kuckuckshof, eine Detektivgeschichte aus dem Schwarzwald '' for the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] and in 1943, under the [[pseudonym]] Katherine Thomas, the book '' Women in Nazi Germany ''.\n\n== After the war ==\nAfter the end of [[World War II]], she returned to Germany in October 1945 as a consultant to the [[United States Army|US Army]] as part of the {{ill|Reeducation (denazification)|lt=Reeducation|de|Reeducation}} program of the American occupied zone,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://libreas.eu/ausgabe25/05becchi/ | title=Jella Lepman: Die Gr\u00fcnderin der Internationalen Jugendbibliothek | author=Anna Becchi | date=2014 | website= | publisher=LIBREAS.

It was shown in several large cities around Germany and visited by over one million people. These books became the founding collection for the [[International Youth Library]] which was opened in the [[Schwabing]] section of Munich 14 September 1949. She remained its director until her retirement in 1957.\n\nDuring the [[reconstruction of Germany]], she was convinced that placing books into the hands of the children would offer them hope for the future. In 1952 she initiated a conference about international understanding through children's books, which led to the foundation of the non-profit [[International Board on Books for Young People]] in [[Zurich]] in 1953. Lepman wrote more in detail about this time of her life in her autobiographical book ''A Bridge of Children's Books''. She was one of the initiators of the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]], the world's most important award for writers and illustrators of young people's literature. It was first issued in 1956, and she served as its jury president from 1956 to 1960.\n\nJella Lepman wrote many children\u2019s books and collections of children\u2019s stories, including a multivolume collection of bedtime stories that she collected over the years. Her books have been translated into many different languages. She gave her friend [[Erich K\u00e4stner]] the idea that inspired his children's book ''The Animals' Conference'' (''Die Konferenz der Tiere'', 1949).\n\nLepman died in 1970 at the age of 79 years in Zurich and her final resting place was in the [[Zurich Enzenb\u00fchl cemetery]] on Forchstra\u00dfe.

The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the [[Dirac equation]] to [[quantum field theory]], by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is a strictly classical approximation to reality and yields accurate results in many situations, but only to a certain extent (see [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[relativistic quantum field theory]]).\n\nTo apply the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, write down the Hamiltonian for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energies of the particles constituting the system, then insert it into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The resulting partial differential equation is solved for the wave function, which contains information about the system.\n\n==={{anchor|Time independent equation}}Time-independent equation===\nThe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation described above predicts that wave functions can form [[standing wave]]s, called [[stationary state]]s.<ref group=\"note\">In chemistry, stationary states are atomic and molecular orbitals.</ref> These states are particularly important as their individual study later simplifies the task of solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for ''any'' state.

This is only used when the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] itself is not dependent on time explicitly. However, even in this case the total wave function still has a time dependency.\n\nIn the language of [[linear algebra]], this equation is an [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalue equation]]. Therefore, the wave function is an [[eigenfunction]] of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) <math>E</math>.\n\nAs before, the most common manifestation is the [[relativistic quantum mechanics|nonrelativistic]] Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation''' (''single nonrelativistic particle'')\n|equation=<math>\\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = rgb(0,115,207)\n|background colour = rgb(0,115,207,10%)}}\n\nwith definitions as above. Here, the form of the Hamiltonian operator comes from classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian ''function'' is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. That is, <math>H = T + V = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{p}\\|^2}{2m} + V(x, y, z)</math> for a single particle in the non-relativistic limit.\n\nThe time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is discussed further below.\n\n==Derivation==\nOne may derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation starting from the [[Dirac-von Neumann axioms]]. Suppose the [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(t_0)</math> represents a unit vector defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] at some initial time <math>t_0</math>. The [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity principle]] requires that there must exist a linear operator, <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math>, such that for any time <math>t > t_0</math>,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\psi(t) = \\hat{U}(t)\\psi(t_0).</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nGiven that <math>\\psi(t)</math> must remain a unit vector, the operator <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> must therefore be a [[Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)|unitary transformation]]. As such, there exists an [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] such that <math>\\hat{U}(t) = e^{-i\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}</math> where <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is a [[Hermitian operator]] (given by the fact that the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] is generated by skew-[[Hermitian operators]], and if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is Hermitian, then <math>-i \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> centered at <math>t_0</math> takes the form\n:<math>\\hat{U}(t) \\approx 1 - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}.</math>\n\nAnd so, substituting the above expansion into ({{EquationNote|1}}) thus yields\n:<math>\\psi(t) = \\psi(t_0) - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi(t_0),</math>\n\nwhich, when rearranged and taken in the limit <math>t \\rightarrow t_0</math>, provides an equation of the same form as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation\n:<math>i\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi,</math>\n\nwhere the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> used here denotes an ''arbitrary'' Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the [[correspondence principle]] it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|date=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|page=68}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n===Energy===\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed in the same manner as in classical mechanics. However, in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a scalar-valued function, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is an operator on a space of functions. It is not surprising that the [[eigenvalues]] of <math>\\hat{H}</math> are the energy levels of the system.\n\n===Quantization===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be ''quantized'', meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is ''energy quantization'': the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the [[Energy level|quantized energy levels]], a fact discovered via [[atomic spectroscopy]]. (Energy quantization is discussed [[#Time-independent|below]].) Another example is [[angular momentum operator|quantization of angular momentum]]. This was an ''assumption'' in the earlier [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]], but it is a ''prediction'' of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAnother result of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<ref name=\"Zettili2009\">{{cite book|author=Nouredine Zettili|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6}}</ref>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n===Quantum tunneling===\n{{main|Quantum tunneling}}\n[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|width = 300px|thumb|[[Quantum tunneling]] through a barrier. A particle coming from the left does not have enough energy to climb the barrier. However, it can sometimes \"tunnel\" to the other side. ]]\n\nIn classical physics, when a ball is rolled slowly up a large hill, it will come to a stop and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy to get over the top of the hill to the other side. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called [[quantum tunneling]]. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.\n\n===Particles as waves===\n{{main|Matter wave|Wave\u2013particle duality|Double-slit experiment}}\n\n[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|175px|thumb|A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.]]\n\nThe nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a type of [[partial differential equation]] called a [[wave equation]]. Therefore, it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In some modern interpretations this description is reversed \u2013 the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior. However, Ballentine<ref name=Ballentine>{{citation|last=Ballentine|first=Leslie|title=Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1998| isbn = 978-9810241056}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 4, p.99}} shows that such an interpretation has problems. Ballentine points out that whilst it is arguable to associate a physical wave with a single particle, there is still only ''one'' Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation for many particles. He points out:\n:''\"If a physical wave field were associated with a particle, or if a particle were identified with a wave packet, then corresponding to N interacting particles there should be N interacting waves in ordinary three-dimensional space. But according to (4.6) that is not the case; instead there is one \"wave\" function in an abstract 3N-dimensional configuration space. The misinterpretation of psi as a physical wave in ordinary space is possible only because the most common applications of quantum mechanics are to one-particle states, for which configuration space and ordinary space are isomorphic.\"''\n\n[[Double-slit experiment|Two-slit diffraction]] is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.\n\nHowever, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[wave equation]], a single particle fired through a double-slit ''does'' show this same pattern (figure on right). The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, [[electron diffraction]] and [[neutron diffraction]] are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.\n\nRelated to [[diffraction]], particles also display [[Superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].\n\nThe superposition property allows the particle to be in a [[quantum superposition]] of two or more quantum states at the same time. However, a \"quantum state\" in quantum mechanics means the ''probability'' that a system will be, for example at a position {{math|''x''}}, not that the system will actually be at position {{math|''x''}}. It does not imply that the particle itself may be in two classical states at once. Indeed, quantum mechanics is generally unable to assign values for properties prior to measurement at all.\n\n====Measurement and uncertainty====\n{{main|Measurement in quantum mechanics|Heisenberg uncertainty principle|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nIn classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change [[determinism|deterministically]] as the particle moves according to [[Newton's laws]]. Under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a [[probability distribution]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.\n\nThe [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is one statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the [[wave function]] of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.\n\n==Interpretation of the wave function==\n{{main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not directly say ''what'', exactly, the wave function is. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.\n\nAn important aspect is the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and [[wave function collapse]]. In the oldest [[Copenhagen interpretation]], particles follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation ''except'' during wave function collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of [[quantum decoherence|quantum decoherence theory]] allowed alternative approaches (such as the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] and [[consistent histories]]), wherein the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is ''always'' satisfied, and wave function collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn 1952, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] gave a lecture during which he commented,\n:Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this ''or'' that or that ... happening\u2014with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but ''all'' really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him, just ''impossible.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Schr\u00f6dinger |first=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|title=The interpretation of quantum mechanics: Dublin seminars (1949\u20131955) and other unpublished essays |year=1995 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |isbn=9781881987086}}</ref>\n\n[[David Deutsch]] regarded this as the earliest known reference to a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an interpretation generally credited to [[Hugh Everett III]],<ref>David Deutsch, ''The Beginning of Infinity'', page 310</ref> while [[Jeffrey A.

Since energy and [[momentum]] are related in the same way as [[frequency]] and [[wavenumber|wave number]] in [[special relativity]], it followed that the momentum <math>p</math> of a photon is inversely proportional to its [[wavelength]] <math>\\lambda</math>, or proportional to its wave number <math>k</math>:\n\n:<math>p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} = \\hbar k,</math>\n\nwhere <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\hbar = {h}/{2\\pi}</math> is the reduced Planck constant (or the Dirac constant). [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that this is true for all particles, even particles which have mass such as electrons. He showed that, assuming that the matter waves propagate along with their particle counterparts, electrons form [[standing wave]]s, meaning that only certain discrete rotational frequencies about the nucleus of an atom are allowed.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n |last        = de Broglie\n |first       = L.\n |year        = 1925\n |title       = Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta\n |trans-title = On the Theory of Quanta\n |url         = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/70/78/PDF/tel-00006807.pdf\n |journal     = [[Annales de Physique]]\n |volume      = 10\n |issue       = 3\n |pages       = 22\u2013128\n |doi         = 10.1051/anphys/192510030022\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090509012910/http://www.ensmp.fr/aflb/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf\n |archivedate = 9 May 2009\n |df          = dmy-all\n|bibcode       = 1925AnPh...10...22D\n }} .</ref>\nThese quantized orbits correspond to discrete [[energy level]]s, and de Broglie reproduced the [[Bohr model]] formula for the energy levels.

In practice, [[natural units]] comprising <math>\\hbar = 1</math> are used, as the De Broglie ''equations'' reduce to ''identities'': allowing momentum, wave number, energy and frequency to be used interchangeably, to prevent duplication of quantities, and reduce the number of dimensions of related quantities. For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's insight,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} late in 1925, was to express the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[plane wave]] as a [[complex number|complex]] [[phase factor]] using these relations:\n\n:<math>\\Psi = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} </math>\n\nand to realize that the first order [[partial derivatives]] with respect to space were\n\n:<math> \\nabla\\Psi = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}\\Psi. </math>\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to time gives\n\n:<math> \\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} \\Psi. </math>\n\nAnother postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by [[linear operator|linear]] [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] which act on the wave function, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the [[energy operator]] (or Hamiltonian operator), corresponding to the time derivative,\n\n:<math>\\hat{E} \\Psi = i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = E\\Psi  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} are the energy [[eigenvalue]]s, and the [[momentum operator]], corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the [[del|gradient]] <math>\\nabla </math>),\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\Psi = -i\\hbar\\nabla \\Psi = \\mathbf{p} \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the \"[[circumflex|hats]]\" ( {{math|\u02c6}} ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are ''[[differential operators]]'', while the potential energy operator <math>V</math> is just a multiplicative factor.\n\nSubstituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:\n\n:<math>E= \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{E} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V </math>\n\nso in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wave function {{math|''\u03a8''}} immediately led Schr\u00f6dinger to his equation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}= -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi +V\\Psi</math>\n\nWave\u2013particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} is related to the square of momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wave number {{math|{{!}}'''k'''{{!}}}} increases the wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p} \\propto \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} \\propto T \\propto \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}</math>\n\nThe kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the ''[[curvature]]'' of the wave, in terms of operators:\n\n:<math> \\hat{T} \\Psi = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla  \\Psi \\, \\propto \\, \\nabla^2 \\Psi \\,.</math>\n\nAs the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>\n\n===Wave and particle motion===\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | image1    = Quantum mechanics travelling wavefunctions.svg\n   | caption1  = Increasing levels of [[wavepacket]] localization, meaning the particle has a more localized position.\n   | width1     = 400\n   | image2    = Perfect localization.svg\n   | caption2  = In the limit ''\u0127'' \u2192 0, the particle's position and momentum become known exactly.

Since, for a given spread in {{math|'''k'''}}, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <math>\\hbar</math> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L. N. Hand, J. D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{isbn|978-0-521-57572-0}}</ref> Great care is required in how that limit is taken, and in what cases.\n\nThe limiting short-wavelength is equivalent to <math>\\hbar</math> tending to zero because this is limiting case of increasing the wave packet localization to the definite position of the particle (see images right). Using the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for position and momentum, the products of uncertainty in position and momentum become zero as <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant 0 \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c3''}} denotes the (root mean square) [[measurement uncertainty]] in {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p<sub>x</sub>''}} (and similarly for the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} directions) which implies the position and momentum can only be known to arbitrary precision in this limit.\n\nOne simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential <math>V</math>, the Ehrenfest theorem says<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5</ref>\n:<math>m\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle;\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle p\\rangle =  -\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle .</math>\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair <math>(\\langle X\\rangle,\\langle P\\rangle)</math> were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be\n:<math>-V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math>,\nwhich is typically not the same as <math>-\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math>. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, <math>V'</math> is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math> and <math>\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math> will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to <math>V'(x_0)</math>. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78</ref> When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its general form\n\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) = \\hat{H} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis closely related to the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] (HJE)\n\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\\left(q_i,\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_i},t \\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the classical [[action (physics)|action]] and <math>H</math> is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian function]] (not operator).

On the contrary, the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.\n\n==Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics==\nThe quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of [[special relativity]], for example particles propagating at speeds much less than [[speed of light|light]], is known as '''nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'''. Following are several forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and {{math|''N''}} particles.\n\nIn actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\">''Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles'' (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, {{isbn|978-0-471-87373-0}}</ref>\n\n===Time-independent===\nIf the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, the equation is [[Separation of variables|separable]] into a product of spatial and temporal parts. In general, the wave function takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(\\text{space coords},t)=\\psi(\\text{space coords})\\tau(t)\\,.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''(space coords)}} is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and {{math|''\u03c4''(''t'')}} is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting for {{math|''&psi;''}} into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by [[separation of variables]] implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<ref name=\"verlagsgesellschaft1991\"/>\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\text{space coords},t) = \\psi(\\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\\hbar}} \\,.</math>\n\nSince the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator {{math|''\u00ca'' {{=}} ''i\u0127''{{sfrac|\u2202|\u2202''t''}}}} can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue {{math|''E''}}, thus the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[eigenvalue]] equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<ref name=Shankar1994/>{{rp|143ff}}\n:<math>\\hat{H} \\psi = E \\psi </math>\n\nThis is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the [[standing wave]] solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called \"[[stationary state]]s\" or \"[[energy eigenstate]]s\"; in chemistry they are called \"[[atomic orbital]]s\" or \"[[molecular orbital]]s\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis \u2013 any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is the [[spectral theorem]] in mathematics, and in a finite state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a [[Hermitian matrix]].\n\n===One-dimensional examples===\nFor a particle in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:\n \n:<math> \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \\,, \\quad \\hat{p} = -i\\hbar \\frac{d}{d x}  </math>\n\nand substituting this into the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:\n\n:<math> \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{d x^2} + V(x) \\right]\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x) </math>\n\nThis is the only case the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[ordinary derivative|ordinary]] differential equation, rather than a [[partial derivative|partial]] differential equation.

Oscillatory solutions have a classically allowed energy and correspond to actual classical motions, while the exponential solutions have a disallowed energy and describe a small amount of quantum bleeding into the classically disallowed region, due to [[quantum tunneling]]. If the potential {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} grows to infinity, the motion is classically confined to a finite region.

The negative sign arises in the potential term since the proton and electron are oppositely charged. The reduced mass in place of the electron mass is used since the electron and proton together orbit each other about a common centre of mass, and constitute a two-body problem to solve. The motion of the electron is of principle interest here, so the equivalent one-body problem is the motion of the electron using the reduced mass.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger for a hydrogen atom can be solved by separation of variables.<ref>''Physics for Scientists and Engineers \u2013 with Modern Physics'' (6th Edition), P.

Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and the solutions to the equation.\n\n===Linearity===\n{{See also|Linear differential equation}}\n\nIn the development above, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] of the two:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\psi = a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wave functions). This property allows [[Quantum superposition|superpositions of quantum states]] to be solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation are given by {{math|''\u03c8<sub>E</sub>''(''x'')}} with amplitude {{math|''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and time dependent phase factor is given by\n\n:<math>e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}, </math>\n\nthen a valid general solution is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi(x,t) = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}. </math>\n\nAdditionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions {{math|''\u03c8<sub>n</sub>''}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_n </math>\n\ncan be normalized by ensuring that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1. </math>\n\nThis is much more convenient than having to verify that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x)|^2\\,dx = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x)\\Psi^{*}(x)\\,dx = 1. </math>\n\n=== Momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi \\rangle </math> is often presented in the position basis form <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi(x) + V(x)\\psi(x) </math> (with <math>\\langle x |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv \\psi(x) </math>). But as a vector operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in [[Hilbert space]]. For example, in the momentum space basis the equation reads\n\n<math>\\displaystyle i\\hbar \\partial_t f(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}f(p) + (\\tilde{V}*f) (p) </math>\n\nwhere <math>|p\\rangle </math> is the plane wave state of definite momentum <math>p </math>, <math>\\langle p |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv f(p) = \\int \\psi(x)e^{-ipx}dx </math>, <math>\\tilde{V} </math> is the Fourier transform of <math>V </math>, and <math>* </math> denotes [[Convolution theorem|Fourier convolution]].\n\nIn the 1D example with absence of a potential, <math>\\tilde V = 0 </math> (or similarly <math>\\tilde V(k) \\propto \\delta(k) </math> in the case of a background potential constant throughout space), each stationary state of energy <math> \\hbar \\omega = q^2/2m </math> is of the form\n\n<math> f_q(p) = (c_{+}\\delta(p-q)+c_{-}\\delta(p+q))e^{-i\\omega t} </math>\n\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients <math> c_{\\pm} </math>. Such a wave function, as expected in free space, is a superposition of plane waves moving right and left with momenta <math> \\pm q </math>; upon momentum measurement the state would collapse to one of definite momentum <math> \\pm q </math> with probability <math> \\propto |c_{\\pm}|^2 </math>.\n\nA version of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation is often used in [[solid-state physics]], as [[Bloch's Theorem|Bloch's theorem]] ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples <math>f(p) </math> with <math>f(p+K) </math> for only discrete [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors <math>K </math>. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation at each [[Crystal momentum|point]] in the [[Brillouin zone]] independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Real energy eigenstates ===\nFor the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy {{math|''E''}}, then so is any linear combination:\n\n:<math> \\hat H (a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 ) = a \\hat H \\psi_1 + b \\hat H \\psi_2 = E (a \\psi_1 + b\\psi_2). </math>\n\nTwo different solutions with the same energy are called ''degenerate''.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n\nIn an arbitrary potential, if a wave function {{math|''\u03c8''}} solves the time-independent equation, so does its [[complex conjugate]], denoted {{math|''\u03c8''*}}. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of {{math|''\u03c8''}} are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.\n\nIn the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} is one solution, then so is {{math|''\u03a8''*(''x'', \u2013''t'')}}. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Space and time derivatives===\n[[File:Wavefunction continuity space.svg|250px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates not shown), at some time {{math|''t''}}.]]\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).\n\nExplicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates \u2013 the equation is\n\n:<math>i\\hbar{\\partial \\Psi \\over \\partial t} = - {\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\left ( {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial y^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial z^2} \\right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\\Psi.\\,\\!</math>\n\nThe first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) of the wave function\n\n:<math> \\Psi(x,y,z,0) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis an arbitrary constant. Likewise \u2013 the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wave function ''and'' its first order spatial derivatives\n\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n& \\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \n\\end{align} \\,\\!</math>\n\nare all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where {{math|''x<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''y<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''z<sub>b</sub>''}} are a set of points describing boundary {{math|''b''}} (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the [[step potential]] and [[particle in a box]] respectively.\n\nAs the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wave function can be a [[smooth function|continuously differentiable function]] of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wave function can be matched.\n\nOn the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually ''second order in time'', notable are the family of classical [[wave equation]]s and the quantum [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]].\n\n=== Local conservation of probability ===\n{{Main|Probability current|Continuity equation}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is consistent with [[conservation of probability|probability conservation]]. Multiplying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wave function, and multiplying the wave function to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and subtracting, gives the [[Continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for probability:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\">''Quantum Mechanics'', E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, {{isbn|978-0-13-146100-0}}</ref>\n:<math>{ \\partial \\over \\partial t} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0, </math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\rho=|\\Psi|^2=\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability density function|probability density]] (probability per unit volume, {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = {1 \\over 2m} \\left( \\Psi^*\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi  - \\Psi\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi^* \\right)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability current]] (flow per unit area).\n\nHence predictions from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation do not violate probability conservation.\n\n=== Positive energy ===\nIf the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the [[variational principle]], as follows. (See also below).\n\nFor any linear operator {{math|''\u00c2''}} [[Bounded operator|bounded]] from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector {{math|''\u03c8''}} that minimizes the quantity\n\n:<math> \\langle \\psi |\\hat{A}|\\psi \\rangle </math>\n\nover all {{math|''\u03c8''}} which are [[normalizable wave function|normalized]].<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> In this way, the smallest eigenvalue is expressed through the [[variational principle]]. For the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian {{math|''\u0124''}} bounded from below, the smallest eigenvalue is called the ground state energy. That energy is the minimum value of\n\n:<math>\\langle \\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left[ - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) + V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) |\\psi|^2 \\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\hat{H}\\rangle </math>\n\n(using [[integration by parts]]). Due to the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|complex modulus]] of {{math|''\u03c8''<sup>2</sup>}} (which is positive definite), the right hand side is always greater than the lowest value of {{math|''V''(''x'')}}. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is everywhere positive.\n\nFor potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wave function is real and positive definite \u2013 meaning the wave function can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wave function) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schr\u00f6dinger equation if this wave function is positive definite.\n\nThe lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy {{math|''E''}}, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.\n\n===Analytic continuation to diffusion===\n{{see also|path integral formulation#The Schr\u00f6dinger equation|label 1=Path integral formulation (The Schr\u00f6dinger equation)}}\n\nThe above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the [[analytic continuation]] of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be identified as a [[stochastic process]]. This can be interpreted as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability amplitudes.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> \nFor a free particle (not subject to a potential) in a [[random walk]], substituting {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} ''it''}} into the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.011132 |pmid=20866590|url=http://www.stt.msu.edu/~mcubed/Relativistic.pdf|title=Stochastic models for relativistic diffusion|journal=Physical Review E|volume=82|issue=1 Pt 1|pages=011132|year=2010|last1=Baeumer|first1=Boris|last2=Meerschaert|first2=Mark M.|last3=Naber|first3=Mark|bibcode=2010PhRvE..82a1132B}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {\\partial \\over \\partial \\tau} X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m} \\nabla ^2 X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) \\, , \\quad X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau/i)</math>\n\nwhich has the same form as the [[diffusion equation]], with diffusion coefficient {{math|{{sfrac|''\u0127''|2''m''}}}}.\n\n===Regularity===\nOn the space <math>L^2</math> of square-integrable densities, the Schr\u00f6dinger semigroup <math>e^{it\\hat{H}}</math> is a unitary evolution, and therefore surjective. The flows satisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\partial_t u = \\hat{H}u</math>, where the derivative is taken in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense. However, since <math>\\hat{H}</math> for most physically reasonable Hamiltonians (e.g., the [[Laplace operator]], possibly modified by a potential) is unbounded in <math>L^2</math>, this shows that the semigroup flows lack Sobolev regularity in general. Instead, solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfy a [[Strichartz estimate]].\n\n==Relativistic quantum mechanics==\n[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]] is obtained where quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]] simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build [[relativistic wave equations]] from the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n\n:<math>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\, , </math>\n\ninstead of classical energy equations. The [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] are two such equations. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation,\n\n:<math> \\frac {1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi - \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac {m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\psi = 0. </math>,\n\nwas the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the \"square root\" of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators \u2013 one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation.

For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} and electric charge {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field (described by the [[electromagnetic potential]]s {{math|''\u03c6''}} and {{math|'''A'''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{H}_{\\text{Dirac}}= \\gamma^0 \\left[c  \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\cdot\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q \\mathbf{A}\\right) + mc^2 + \\gamma^0q \\varphi \\right]\\,, </math>\n\nin which the {{math|'''\u03b3''' {{=}} (''\u03b3''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>)}} and {{math|''\u03b3''<sup>0</sup>}} are the Dirac [[gamma matrices]] related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all {{nobreak|[[spin-1/2|spin-{{frac|2}}]]}} particles, and the solutions to the equation are {{nobreak|4-component}} [[spinor field]]s with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the [[antiparticle]].\n\nFor the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, the general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] and using the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for fields, or use the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\n\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices. Also, the solutions to a relativistic wave equation, for a massive particle of spin {{math|''s''}}, are complex-valued {{nobreak|{{math|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component}} [[spinor field]]s.\n\n==Quantum field theory==\nThe general equation is also valid and used in [[quantum field theory]], both in relativistic and nonrelativistic situations. However, the solution {{math|''\u03c8''}} is no longer interpreted as a \"wave\", but should be interpreted as an operator acting on states existing in a [[Fock space]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==First order form==\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation can also be derived from a first order form<ref  name=\"one\">{{cite journal|last1=Ajaib|first1=Muhammad Adeel|title=A Fundamental Form of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation|journal=Found.

Therefore, the wave function is an [[eigenfunction]] of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) <math>E</math>.\n\nAs before, the most common manifestation is the [[relativistic quantum mechanics|nonrelativistic]] Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation''' (''single nonrelativistic particle'')\n|equation=<math>\\left[ \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\Psi(\\mathbf{r})</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = rgb(0,115,207)\n|background colour = rgb(0,115,207,10%)}}\n\nwith definitions as above.

Suppose the [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(t_0)</math> represents a unit vector defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] at some initial time <math>t_0</math>. The [[Unitarity (physics)|unitarity principle]] requires that there must exist a linear operator, <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math>, such that for any time <math>t > t_0</math>,\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\psi(t) = \\hat{U}(t)\\psi(t_0).</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nGiven that <math>\\psi(t)</math> must remain a unit vector, the operator <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> must therefore be a [[Unitary transformation (quantum mechanics)|unitary transformation]]. As such, there exists an [[Exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] such that <math>\\hat{U}(t) = e^{-i\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}t}</math> where <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is a [[Hermitian operator]] (given by the fact that the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[unitary group]] is generated by skew-[[Hermitian operators]], and if <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is Hermitian, then <math>-i \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of <math>\\hat{U}(t)</math> centered at <math>t_0</math> takes the form\n:<math>\\hat{U}(t) \\approx 1 - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}.</math>\n\nAnd so, substituting the above expansion into ({{EquationNote|1}}) thus yields\n:<math>\\psi(t) = \\psi(t_0) - i(t-t_0)\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi(t_0),</math>\n\nwhich, when rearranged and taken in the limit <math>t \\rightarrow t_0</math>, provides an equation of the same form as the Schr&ouml;dinger equation\n:<math>i\\frac{d\\psi}{dt} = \\hat{\\mathcal{H}}\\psi,</math>\n\nwhere the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> used here denotes an ''arbitrary'' Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the [[correspondence principle]] it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of <math>\\hat{\\mathcal{H}}</math> indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last1=Sakurai|first1=J. J.|date=1995|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|page=68}}</ref>\n\n==Implications==\n===Energy===\nThe Hamiltonian is constructed in the same manner as in classical mechanics. However, in classical mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a scalar-valued function, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is an operator on a space of functions. It is not surprising that the [[eigenvalues]] of <math>\\hat{H}</math> are the energy levels of the system.\n\n===Quantization===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that if certain properties of a system are measured, the result may be ''quantized'', meaning that only specific discrete values can occur. One example is ''energy quantization'': the energy of an electron in an atom is always one of the [[Energy level|quantized energy levels]], a fact discovered via [[atomic spectroscopy]]. (Energy quantization is discussed [[#Time-independent|below]].) Another example is [[angular momentum operator|quantization of angular momentum]]. This was an ''assumption'' in the earlier [[Bohr model|Bohr model of the atom]], but it is a ''prediction'' of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nAnother result of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is that not every measurement gives a quantized result in quantum mechanics. For example, position, momentum, time, and (in some situations) energy can have any value across a continuous range.<ref name=\"Zettili2009\">{{cite book|author=Nouredine Zettili|title=Quantum Mechanics: Concepts and Applications|date=17 February 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-02678-6}}</ref>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n===Quantum tunneling===\n{{main|Quantum tunneling}}\n[[File:TunnelEffektKling1.png|width = 300px|thumb|[[Quantum tunneling]] through a barrier.

However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called [[quantum tunneling]]. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.\n\n===Particles as waves===\n{{main|Matter wave|Wave\u2013particle duality|Double-slit experiment}}\n\n[[File:Double-slit experiment results Tanamura 2.jpg|175px|thumb|A double slit experiment showing the accumulation of electrons on a screen as time passes.]]\n\nThe nonrelativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a type of [[partial differential equation]] called a [[wave equation]]. Therefore, it is often said particles can exhibit behavior usually attributed to waves. In some modern interpretations this description is reversed \u2013 the quantum state, i.e. wave, is the only genuine physical reality, and under the appropriate conditions it can show features of particle-like behavior. However, Ballentine<ref name=Ballentine>{{citation|last=Ballentine|first=Leslie|title=Quantum Mechanics: A Modern Development | publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co.|year=1998| isbn = 978-9810241056}}</ref>{{rp|Chapter 4, p.99}} shows that such an interpretation has problems. Ballentine points out that whilst it is arguable to associate a physical wave with a single particle, there is still only ''one'' Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation for many particles. He points out:\n:''\"If a physical wave field were associated with a particle, or if a particle were identified with a wave packet, then corresponding to N interacting particles there should be N interacting waves in ordinary three-dimensional space. But according to (4.6) that is not the case; instead there is one \"wave\" function in an abstract 3N-dimensional configuration space. The misinterpretation of psi as a physical wave in ordinary space is possible only because the most common applications of quantum mechanics are to one-particle states, for which configuration space and ordinary space are isomorphic.\"''\n\n[[Double-slit experiment|Two-slit diffraction]] is a famous example of the strange behaviors that waves regularly display, that are not intuitively associated with particles. The overlapping waves from the two slits cancel each other out in some locations, and reinforce each other in other locations, causing a complex pattern to emerge. Intuitively, one would not expect this pattern from firing a single particle at the slits, because the particle should pass through one slit or the other, not a complex overlap of both.\n\nHowever, since the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a [[wave equation]], a single particle fired through a double-slit ''does'' show this same pattern (figure on right). The experiment must be repeated many times for the complex pattern to emerge. Although this is counterintuitive, the prediction is correct; in particular, [[electron diffraction]] and [[neutron diffraction]] are well understood and widely used in science and engineering.\n\nRelated to [[diffraction]], particles also display [[Superposition principle#Application to waves|superposition]] and [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]].\n\nThe superposition property allows the particle to be in a [[quantum superposition]] of two or more quantum states at the same time. However, a \"quantum state\" in quantum mechanics means the ''probability'' that a system will be, for example at a position {{math|''x''}}, not that the system will actually be at position {{math|''x''}}. It does not imply that the particle itself may be in two classical states at once. Indeed, quantum mechanics is generally unable to assign values for properties prior to measurement at all.\n\n====Measurement and uncertainty====\n{{main|Measurement in quantum mechanics|Heisenberg uncertainty principle|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nIn classical mechanics, a particle has, at every moment, an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change [[determinism|deterministically]] as the particle moves according to [[Newton's laws]]. Under the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, particles do not have exactly determined properties, and when they are measured, the result is randomly drawn from a [[probability distribution]]. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.\n\nThe [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] is one statement of the inherent measurement uncertainty in quantum mechanics. It states that the more precisely a particle's position is known, the less precisely its momentum is known, and vice versa.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the (deterministic) evolution of the [[wave function]] of a particle. However, even if the wave function is known exactly, the result of a specific measurement on the wave function is uncertain.\n\n==Interpretation of the wave function==\n{{main|Interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation provides a way to calculate the wave function of a system and how it changes dynamically in time. However, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation does not directly say ''what'', exactly, the wave function is. [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]] address questions such as what the relation is between the wave function, the underlying reality, and the results of experimental measurements.\n\nAn important aspect is the relationship between the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and [[wave function collapse]]. In the oldest [[Copenhagen interpretation]], particles follow the Schr\u00f6dinger equation ''except'' during wave function collapse, during which they behave entirely differently. The advent of [[quantum decoherence|quantum decoherence theory]] allowed alternative approaches (such as the [[Everett many-worlds interpretation]] and [[consistent histories]]), wherein the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is ''always'' satisfied, and wave function collapse should be explained as a consequence of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\nIn 1952, [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] gave a lecture during which he commented,\n:Nearly every result [a quantum theorist] pronounces is about the probability of this ''or'' that or that ... happening\u2014with usually a great many alternatives. The idea that they be not alternatives but ''all'' really happen simultaneously seems lunatic to him, just ''impossible.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Schr\u00f6dinger |first=Erwin |authorlink=Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|title=The interpretation of quantum mechanics: Dublin seminars (1949\u20131955) and other unpublished essays |year=1995 |publisher=Ox Bow Press |isbn=9781881987086}}</ref>\n\n[[David Deutsch]] regarded this as the earliest known reference to a many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, an interpretation generally credited to [[Hugh Everett III]],<ref>David Deutsch, ''The Beginning of Infinity'', page 310</ref> while [[Jeffrey A.

For familiarity SI units are still used in this article.\n\nSchr\u00f6dinger's insight,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} late in 1925, was to express the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] of a [[plane wave]] as a [[complex number|complex]] [[phase factor]] using these relations:\n\n:<math>\\Psi = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-\\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} </math>\n\nand to realize that the first order [[partial derivatives]] with respect to space were\n\n:<math> \\nabla\\Psi = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = \\dfrac{i}{\\hbar}\\mathbf{p}\\Psi. </math>\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to time gives\n\n:<math> \\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} Ae^{i(\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}-Et)/\\hbar} = -\\dfrac{i E}{\\hbar} \\Psi. </math>\n\nAnother postulate of quantum mechanics is that all observables are represented by [[linear operator|linear]] [[Self-adjoint operator|Hermitian operators]] which act on the wave function, and the eigenvalues of the operator are the values the observable takes. The previous derivatives are consistent with the [[energy operator]] (or Hamiltonian operator), corresponding to the time derivative,\n\n:<math>\\hat{E} \\Psi = i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = E\\Psi  </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''}} are the energy [[eigenvalue]]s, and the [[momentum operator]], corresponding to the spatial derivatives (the [[del|gradient]] <math>\\nabla </math>),\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} \\Psi = -i\\hbar\\nabla \\Psi = \\mathbf{p} \\Psi </math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''p'''}} is a vector of the momentum eigenvalues. In the above, the \"[[circumflex|hats]]\" ( {{math|\u02c6}} ) indicate these observables are operators, not simply ordinary numbers or vectors. The energy and momentum operators are ''[[differential operators]]'', while the potential energy operator <math>V</math> is just a multiplicative factor.\n\nSubstituting the energy and momentum operators into the classical energy conservation equation obtains the operator:\n\n:<math>E= \\dfrac{\\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}}{2m}+V \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\hat{E} = \\dfrac{\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}}{2m}  + V </math>\n\nso in terms of derivatives with respect to time and space, acting this operator on the wave function {{math|''\u03a8''}} immediately led Schr\u00f6dinger to his equation:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n:<math>i\\hbar\\dfrac{\\partial \\Psi}{\\partial t}= -\\dfrac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\Psi +V\\Psi</math>\n\nWave\u2013particle duality can be assessed from these equations as follows. The kinetic energy {{math|''T''}} is related to the square of momentum {{math|'''p'''}}. As the particle's momentum increases, the kinetic energy increases more rapidly, but since the wave number {{math|{{!}}'''k'''{{!}}}} increases the wavelength {{math|''\u03bb''}} decreases. In terms of ordinary scalar and vector quantities (not operators):\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{p}\\cdot\\mathbf{p} \\propto \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{k} \\propto T \\propto \\dfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}</math>\n\nThe kinetic energy is also proportional to the second spatial derivatives, so it is also proportional to the magnitude of the ''[[curvature]]'' of the wave, in terms of operators:\n\n:<math> \\hat{T} \\Psi = \\frac{-\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla\\cdot\\nabla  \\Psi \\, \\propto \\, \\nabla^2 \\Psi \\,.</math>\n\nAs the curvature increases, the amplitude of the wave alternates between positive and negative more rapidly, and also shortens the wavelength. So the inverse relation between momentum and wavelength is consistent with the energy the particle has, and so the energy of the particle has a connection to a wave, all in the same mathematical formulation.<ref name=\"Quanta 1974\"/>\n\n===Wave and particle motion===\n {{multiple image\n   | align = right\n   | direction = horizontal\n   | image1    = Quantum mechanics travelling wavefunctions.svg\n   | caption1  = Increasing levels of [[wavepacket]] localization, meaning the particle has a more localized position.\n   | width1     = 400\n   | image2    = Perfect localization.svg\n   | caption2  = In the limit ''\u0127'' \u2192 0, the particle's position and momentum become known exactly.

Since, for a given spread in {{math|'''k'''}}, the spread in velocity is proportional to Planck's constant <math>\\hbar</math>, it is sometimes said that in the limit as <math>\\hbar</math> approaches zero, the equations of classical mechanics are restored from quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\">''Analytical Mechanics'', L. N. Hand, J. D. Finch, Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{isbn|978-0-521-57572-0}}</ref> Great care is required in how that limit is taken, and in what cases.\n\nThe limiting short-wavelength is equivalent to <math>\\hbar</math> tending to zero because this is limiting case of increasing the wave packet localization to the definite position of the particle (see images right). Using the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] for position and momentum, the products of uncertainty in position and momentum become zero as <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad \\sigma(x) \\sigma(p_x) \\geqslant 0 \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c3''}} denotes the (root mean square) [[measurement uncertainty]] in {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p<sub>x</sub>''}} (and similarly for the {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} directions) which implies the position and momentum can only be known to arbitrary precision in this limit.\n\nOne simple way to compare classical to quantum mechanics is to consider the time-evolution of the ''expected'' position and ''expected'' momentum, which can then be compared to the time-evolution of the ordinary position and momentum in classical mechanics. The quantum expectation values satisfy the [[Ehrenfest theorem]]. For a one-dimensional quantum particle moving in a potential <math>V</math>, the Ehrenfest theorem says<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Section 3.7.5</ref>\n:<math>m\\frac{d}{dt}\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle;\\quad \\frac{d}{dt}\\langle p\\rangle =  -\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle .</math>\nAlthough the first of these equations is consistent with the classical behavior, the second is not: If the pair <math>(\\langle X\\rangle,\\langle P\\rangle)</math> were to satisfy Newton's second law, the right-hand side of the second equation would have to be\n:<math>-V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math>,\nwhich is typically not the same as <math>-\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math>. In the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator, however, <math>V'</math> is linear and this distinction disappears, so that in this very special case, the expected position and expected momentum do exactly follow the classical trajectories.\n\nFor general systems, the best we can hope for is that the expected position and momentum will ''approximately'' follow the classical trajectories. If the wave function is highly concentrated around a point <math>x_0</math>, then <math>V'\\left(\\left\\langle X\\right\\rangle\\right)</math> and <math>\\left\\langle V'(X)\\right\\rangle</math> will be ''almost'' the same, since both will be approximately equal to <math>V'(x_0)</math>. In that case, the expected position and expected momentum will remain very close to the classical trajectories, at least for as long as the wave function remains highly localized in position.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} p. 78</ref> When Planck's constant is small, it is possible to have a state that is well localized in ''both'' position and momentum. The small uncertainty in momentum ensures that the particle ''remains'' well localized in position for a long time, so that expected position and momentum continue to closely track the classical trajectories.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation in its general form\n\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) = \\hat{H} \\Psi\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis closely related to the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] (HJE)\n\n:<math> -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} S(q_i,t) = H\\left(q_i,\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial q_i},t \\right) \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>S</math> is the classical [[action (physics)|action]] and <math>H</math> is the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian function]] (not operator). Here the [[generalized coordinates]] <math>q_i</math> for <math>i = 1, 2, 3</math> (used in the context of the HJE) can be set to the position in Cartesian coordinates as <math>\\mathbf{r} = (q_1, q_2, q_3) = (x, y, z)</math>.<ref name=\"Analytical Mechanics 2008\"/>\n\nSubstituting\n\n:<math> \\Psi = \\sqrt{\\rho(\\mathbf{r},t)} e^{iS(\\mathbf{r},t)/\\hbar}\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the probability density, into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and then taking the limit <math>\\hbar \\longrightarrow 0</math> in the resulting equation yield the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation.\n\nThe implications are as follows:\n\n* The motion of a particle, described by a (short-wavelength) wave packet solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is also described by the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation of motion.\n* The Schr\u00f6dinger equation includes the wave function, so its wave packet solution implies the position of a (quantum) particle is fuzzily spread out in wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.\n\n==Nonrelativistic quantum mechanics==\nThe quantum mechanics of particles without accounting for the effects of [[special relativity]], for example particles propagating at speeds much less than [[speed of light|light]], is known as '''nonrelativistic quantum mechanics'''. Following are several forms of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in this context for different situations: time independence and dependence, one and three spatial dimensions, and one and {{math|''N''}} particles.\n\nIn actuality, the particles constituting the system do not have the numerical labels used in theory. The language of mathematics forces us to label the positions of particles one way or another, otherwise there would be confusion between symbols representing which variables are for which particle.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\">''Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles'' (2nd Edition), R. Resnick, R. Eisberg, John Wiley & Sons, 1985, {{isbn|978-0-471-87373-0}}</ref>\n\n===Time-independent===\nIf the Hamiltonian is not an explicit function of time, the equation is [[Separation of variables|separable]] into a product of spatial and temporal parts. In general, the wave function takes the form:\n\n:<math>\\Psi(\\text{space coords},t)=\\psi(\\text{space coords})\\tau(t)\\,.</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''\u03c8''(space coords)}} is a function of all the spatial coordinate(s) of the particle(s) constituting the system only, and {{math|''\u03c4''(''t'')}} is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting for {{math|''&psi;''}} into the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the relevant number of particles in the relevant number of dimensions, solving by [[separation of variables]] implies the general solution of the time-dependent equation has the form:<ref name=\"verlagsgesellschaft1991\"/>\n\n:<math> \\Psi(\\text{space coords},t) = \\psi(\\text{space coords}) e^{-i{E t/\\hbar}} \\,.</math>\n\nSince the time dependent phase factor is always the same, only the spatial part needs to be solved for in time independent problems. Additionally, the energy operator {{math|''\u00ca'' {{=}} ''i\u0127''{{sfrac|\u2202|\u2202''t''}}}} can always be replaced by the energy eigenvalue {{math|''E''}}, thus the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[eigenvalue]] equation for the Hamiltonian operator:<ref name=Shankar1994/>{{rp|143ff}}\n:<math>\\hat{H} \\psi = E \\psi </math>\n\nThis is true for any number of particles in any number of dimensions (in a time independent potential). This case describes the [[standing wave]] solutions of the time-dependent equation, which are the states with definite energy (instead of a probability distribution of different energies). In physics, these standing waves are called \"[[stationary state]]s\" or \"[[energy eigenstate]]s\"; in chemistry they are called \"[[atomic orbital]]s\" or \"[[molecular orbital]]s\". Superpositions of energy eigenstates change their properties according to the relative phases between the energy levels.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues from this equation form a discrete [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of values, so mathematically energy must be quantized. More specifically, the energy eigenstates form a basis \u2013 any wave function may be written as a sum over the discrete energy states or an integral over continuous energy states, or more generally as an integral over a measure. This is the [[spectral theorem]] in mathematics, and in a finite state space it is just a statement of the completeness of the eigenvectors of a [[Hermitian matrix]].\n\n===One-dimensional examples===\nFor a particle in one dimension, the Hamiltonian is:\n \n:<math> \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{p}^2}{2m} + V(x) \\,, \\quad \\hat{p} = -i\\hbar \\frac{d}{d x}  </math>\n\nand substituting this into the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:\n\n:<math> \\left[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2}{d x^2} + V(x) \\right]\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x) </math>\n\nThis is the only case the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is an [[ordinary derivative|ordinary]] differential equation, rather than a [[partial derivative|partial]] differential equation.

Oscillatory solutions have a classically allowed energy and correspond to actual classical motions, while the exponential solutions have a disallowed energy and describe a small amount of quantum bleeding into the classically disallowed region, due to [[quantum tunneling]]. If the potential {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} grows to infinity, the motion is classically confined to a finite region. Viewed far enough away, every solution is reduced to an exponential; the condition that the exponential is decreasing restricts the energy levels to a discrete set, called the allowed energies.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Harmonic oscillator====\n[[File:QuantumHarmonicOscillatorAnimation.gif|300px|thumb|right|A [[harmonic oscillator]] in classical mechanics (A\u2013B) and quantum mechanics (C\u2013H).

The motion of the electron is of principle interest here, so the equivalent one-body problem is the motion of the electron using the reduced mass.\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger for a hydrogen atom can be solved by separation of variables.<ref>''Physics for Scientists and Engineers \u2013 with Modern Physics'' (6th Edition), P.

Ultimately, these properties arise from the Hamiltonian used, and the solutions to the equation.\n\n===Linearity===\n{{See also|Linear differential equation}}\n\nIn the development above, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation was made to be linear for generality, though this has other implications. If two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions, then so is any [[linear combination]] of the two:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\psi = a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are any complex numbers (the sum can be extended for any number of wave functions). This property allows [[Quantum superposition|superpositions of quantum states]] to be solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Even more generally, it holds that a general solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be found by taking a weighted sum over all single state solutions achievable. For example, consider a wave function {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} such that the wave function is a product of two functions: one time independent, and one time dependent. If states of definite energy found using the time independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation are given by {{math|''\u03c8<sub>E</sub>''(''x'')}} with amplitude {{math|''A<sub>n</sub>''}} and time dependent phase factor is given by\n\n:<math>e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}, </math>\n\nthen a valid general solution is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi(x,t) = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_{E_n}(x) e^{{-iE_n t}/\\hbar}. </math>\n\nAdditionally, the ability to scale solutions allows one to solve for a wave function without normalizing it first. If one has a set of normalized solutions {{math|''\u03c8<sub>n</sub>''}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\Psi = \\sum\\limits_{n} A_n \\psi_n </math>\n\ncan be normalized by ensuring that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\sum\\limits_{n}|A_n|^2 = 1. </math>\n\nThis is much more convenient than having to verify that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\Psi(x)|^2\\,dx = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\Psi(x)\\Psi^{*}(x)\\,dx = 1. </math>\n\n=== Momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation ===\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t |\\psi\\rangle = \\hat{H}|\\psi \\rangle </math> is often presented in the position basis form <math>i\\hbar \\partial_t \\psi(x) = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\psi(x) + V(x)\\psi(x) </math> (with <math>\\langle x |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv \\psi(x) </math>). But as a vector operator equation it has a valid representation in any arbitrary complete basis of kets in [[Hilbert space]]. For example, in the momentum space basis the equation reads\n\n<math>\\displaystyle i\\hbar \\partial_t f(p) = \\frac{p^2}{2m}f(p) + (\\tilde{V}*f) (p) </math>\n\nwhere <math>|p\\rangle </math> is the plane wave state of definite momentum <math>p </math>, <math>\\langle p |\\psi\\rangle \\equiv f(p) = \\int \\psi(x)e^{-ipx}dx </math>, <math>\\tilde{V} </math> is the Fourier transform of <math>V </math>, and <math>* </math> denotes [[Convolution theorem|Fourier convolution]].\n\nIn the 1D example with absence of a potential, <math>\\tilde V = 0 </math> (or similarly <math>\\tilde V(k) \\propto \\delta(k) </math> in the case of a background potential constant throughout space), each stationary state of energy <math> \\hbar \\omega = q^2/2m </math> is of the form\n\n<math> f_q(p) = (c_{+}\\delta(p-q)+c_{-}\\delta(p+q))e^{-i\\omega t} </math>\n\nfor arbitrary complex coefficients <math> c_{\\pm} </math>. Such a wave function, as expected in free space, is a superposition of plane waves moving right and left with momenta <math> \\pm q </math>; upon momentum measurement the state would collapse to one of definite momentum <math> \\pm q </math> with probability <math> \\propto |c_{\\pm}|^2 </math>.\n\nA version of the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation is often used in [[solid-state physics]], as [[Bloch's Theorem|Bloch's theorem]] ensures the periodic crystal lattice potential couples <math>f(p) </math> with <math>f(p+K) </math> for only discrete [[reciprocal lattice]] vectors <math>K </math>. This makes it convenient to solve the momentum space Schr\u00f6dinger equation at each [[Crystal momentum|point]] in the [[Brillouin zone]] independently of the other points in the Brillouin zone.\n\n=== Real energy eigenstates ===\nFor the time-independent equation, an additional feature of linearity follows: if two wave functions {{math|''\u03c8''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''&psi;''<sub>2</sub>}} are solutions to the time-independent equation with the same energy {{math|''E''}}, then so is any linear combination:\n\n:<math> \\hat H (a\\psi_1 + b \\psi_2 ) = a \\hat H \\psi_1 + b \\hat H \\psi_2 = E (a \\psi_1 + b\\psi_2). </math>\n\nTwo different solutions with the same energy are called ''degenerate''.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics Demystified 2006\"/>\n\nIn an arbitrary potential, if a wave function {{math|''\u03c8''}} solves the time-independent equation, so does its [[complex conjugate]], denoted {{math|''\u03c8''*}}. By taking linear combinations, the real and imaginary parts of {{math|''\u03c8''}} are each solutions. If there is no degeneracy they can only differ by a factor.\n\nIn the time-dependent equation, complex conjugate waves move in opposite directions. If {{math|''\u03a8''(''x'', ''t'')}} is one solution, then so is {{math|''\u03a8''*(''x'', \u2013''t'')}}. The symmetry of complex conjugation is called [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Space and time derivatives===\n[[File:Wavefunction continuity space.svg|250px|thumb|Continuity of the wave function and its first spatial derivative (in the {{math|''x''}} direction, {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''z''}} coordinates not shown), at some time {{math|''t''}}.]]\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is first order in time and second in space, which describes the time evolution of a quantum state (meaning it determines the future amplitude from the present).\n\nExplicitly for one particle in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates \u2013 the equation is\n\n:<math>i\\hbar{\\partial \\Psi \\over \\partial t} = - {\\hbar^2\\over 2m} \\left ( {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial x^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial y^2} + {\\partial^2 \\Psi \\over \\partial z^2} \\right ) + V(x,y,z,t)\\Psi.\\,\\!</math>\n\nThe first time partial derivative implies the initial value (at {{math|''t'' {{=}} 0}}) of the wave function\n\n:<math> \\Psi(x,y,z,0) \\,\\!</math>\n\nis an arbitrary constant. Likewise \u2013 the second order derivatives with respect to space implies the wave function ''and'' its first order spatial derivatives\n\n:<math> \\begin{align} \n& \\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\\\\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\Psi(x_b,y_b,z_b,t) \n\\end{align} \\,\\!</math>\n\nare all arbitrary constants at a given set of points, where {{math|''x<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''y<sub>b</sub>''}}, {{math|''z<sub>b</sub>''}} are a set of points describing boundary {{math|''b''}} (derivatives are evaluated at the boundaries). Typically there are one or two boundaries, such as the [[step potential]] and [[particle in a box]] respectively.\n\nAs the first order derivatives are arbitrary, the wave function can be a [[smooth function|continuously differentiable function]] of space, since at any boundary the gradient of the wave function can be matched.\n\nOn the contrary, wave equations in physics are usually ''second order in time'', notable are the family of classical [[wave equation]]s and the quantum [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]].\n\n=== Local conservation of probability ===\n{{Main|Probability current|Continuity equation}}\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger equation is consistent with [[conservation of probability|probability conservation]]. Multiplying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the right by the complex conjugate wave function, and multiplying the wave function to the left of the complex conjugate of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and subtracting, gives the [[Continuity equation#Quantum mechanics|continuity equation]] for probability:<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\">''Quantum Mechanics'', E. Abers, Pearson Ed., Addison Wesley, Prentice Hall Inc, 2004, {{isbn|978-0-13-146100-0}}</ref>\n:<math>{ \\partial \\over \\partial t} \\rho\\left(\\mathbf{r},t\\right) + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} = 0, </math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\rho=|\\Psi|^2=\\Psi^*(\\mathbf{r},t)\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability density function|probability density]] (probability per unit volume, {{math|*}} denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} = {1 \\over 2m} \\left( \\Psi^*\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi  - \\Psi\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}\\Psi^* \\right)\\,\\!</math>\nis the [[probability current]] (flow per unit area).\n\nHence predictions from the Schr\u00f6dinger equation do not violate probability conservation.\n\n=== Positive energy ===\nIf the potential is bounded from below, meaning there is a minimum value of potential energy, the eigenfunctions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation have energy which is also bounded from below. This can be seen most easily by using the [[variational principle]], as follows. (See also below).\n\nFor any linear operator {{math|''\u00c2''}} [[Bounded operator|bounded]] from below, the eigenvector with the smallest eigenvalue is the vector {{math|''\u03c8''}} that minimizes the quantity\n\n:<math> \\langle \\psi |\\hat{A}|\\psi \\rangle </math>\n\nover all {{math|''\u03c8''}} which are [[normalizable wave function|normalized]].<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> In this way, the smallest eigenvalue is expressed through the [[variational principle]]. For the Schr\u00f6dinger Hamiltonian {{math|''\u0124''}} bounded from below, the smallest eigenvalue is called the ground state energy. That energy is the minimum value of\n\n:<math>\\langle \\psi|\\hat{H}|\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\psi^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left[ - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2\\psi(\\mathbf{r}) + V(\\mathbf{r})\\psi(\\mathbf{r})\\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\int \\left[ \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\nabla\\psi|^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) |\\psi|^2 \\right] d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\langle \\hat{H}\\rangle </math>\n\n(using [[integration by parts]]). Due to the [[Absolute value#Complex numbers|complex modulus]] of {{math|''\u03c8''<sup>2</sup>}} (which is positive definite), the right hand side is always greater than the lowest value of {{math|''V''(''x'')}}. In particular, the ground state energy is positive when {{math|''V''(''x'')}} is everywhere positive.\n\nFor potentials which are bounded below and are not infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wave function is real and positive definite \u2013 meaning the wave function can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends at the sign change (to minimize the wave function) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schr\u00f6dinger equation if this wave function is positive definite.\n\nThe lack of sign changes also shows that the ground state is nondegenerate, since if there were two ground states with common energy {{math|''E''}}, not proportional to each other, there would be a linear combination of the two that would also be a ground state resulting in a zero solution.\n\n===Analytic continuation to diffusion===\n{{see also|path integral formulation#The Schr\u00f6dinger equation|label 1=Path integral formulation (The Schr\u00f6dinger equation)}}\n\nThe above properties (positive definiteness of energy) allow the [[analytic continuation]] of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to be identified as a [[stochastic process]]. This can be interpreted as the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]] applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are diffusive probability amplitudes.<ref name=\"Quantum Mechanics 2004\"/> \nFor a free particle (not subject to a potential) in a [[random walk]], substituting {{math|''\u03c4'' {{=}} ''it''}} into the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation gives:<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.82.011132 |pmid=20866590|url=http://www.stt.msu.edu/~mcubed/Relativistic.pdf|title=Stochastic models for relativistic diffusion|journal=Physical Review E|volume=82|issue=1 Pt 1|pages=011132|year=2010|last1=Baeumer|first1=Boris|last2=Meerschaert|first2=Mark M.|last3=Naber|first3=Mark|bibcode=2010PhRvE..82a1132B}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {\\partial \\over \\partial \\tau} X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\frac{\\hbar}{2m} \\nabla ^2 X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) \\, , \\quad X(\\mathbf{r},\\tau) = \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},\\tau/i)</math>\n\nwhich has the same form as the [[diffusion equation]], with diffusion coefficient {{math|{{sfrac|''\u0127''|2''m''}}}}.\n\n===Regularity===\nOn the space <math>L^2</math> of square-integrable densities, the Schr\u00f6dinger semigroup <math>e^{it\\hat{H}}</math> is a unitary evolution, and therefore surjective. The flows satisfy the Schr\u00f6dinger equation <math>i\\partial_t u = \\hat{H}u</math>, where the derivative is taken in the [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] sense. However, since <math>\\hat{H}</math> for most physically reasonable Hamiltonians (e.g., the [[Laplace operator]], possibly modified by a potential) is unbounded in <math>L^2</math>, this shows that the semigroup flows lack Sobolev regularity in general. Instead, solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation satisfy a [[Strichartz estimate]].\n\n==Relativistic quantum mechanics==\n[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]] is obtained where quantum mechanics and [[special relativity]] simultaneously apply. In general, one wishes to build [[relativistic wave equations]] from the relativistic [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]\n\n:<math>E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m_0c^2)^2 \\, , </math>\n\ninstead of classical energy equations. The [[Klein\u2013Gordon equation]] and the [[Dirac equation]] are two such equations. The Klein\u2013Gordon equation,\n\n:<math> \\frac {1}{c^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} \\psi - \\nabla^2 \\psi + \\frac {m^2 c^2}{\\hbar^2} \\psi = 0. </math>,\n\nwas the first such equation to be obtained, even before the nonrelativistic one, and applies to massive spinless particles. The Dirac equation arose from taking the \"square root\" of the Klein\u2013Gordon equation by factorizing the entire relativistic wave operator into a product of two operators \u2013 one of these is the operator for the entire Dirac equation. Entire Dirac equation:\n:<math>\\left(\\beta mc^2 + c\\left(\\sum_{n \\mathop =1}^{3}\\alpha_n p_n\\right)\\right) \\psi = i \\hbar \\frac{\\partial\\psi }{\\partial t} </math>\n\nThe general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation remains true in relativity, but the Hamiltonian is less obvious. For example, the Dirac Hamiltonian for a particle of mass {{math|''m''}} and electric charge {{math|''q''}} in an electromagnetic field (described by the [[electromagnetic potential]]s {{math|''\u03c6''}} and {{math|'''A'''}}) is:\n\n:<math>\\hat{H}_{\\text{Dirac}}= \\gamma^0 \\left[c  \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\cdot\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} - q \\mathbf{A}\\right) + mc^2 + \\gamma^0q \\varphi \\right]\\,, </math>\n\nin which the {{math|'''\u03b3''' {{=}} (''\u03b3''<sup>1</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>2</sup>, ''\u03b3''<sup>3</sup>)}} and {{math|''\u03b3''<sup>0</sup>}} are the Dirac [[gamma matrices]] related to the spin of the particle. The Dirac equation is true for all {{nobreak|[[spin-1/2|spin-{{frac|2}}]]}} particles, and the solutions to the equation are {{nobreak|4-component}} [[spinor field]]s with two components corresponding to the particle and the other two for the [[antiparticle]].\n\nFor the Klein\u2013Gordon equation, the general form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is inconvenient to use, and in practice the Hamiltonian is not expressed in an analogous way to the Dirac Hamiltonian. The equations for relativistic quantum fields can be obtained in other ways, such as starting from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian density]] and using the [[Euler\u2013Lagrange equation]]s for fields, or use the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]] in which certain representations can be used to fix the equation for a free particle of given spin (and mass).\n\nIn general, the Hamiltonian to be substituted in the general Schr\u00f6dinger equation is not just a function of the position and momentum operators (and possibly time), but also of spin matrices.
