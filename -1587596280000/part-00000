In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

In some jurisdictions (countries, states, provinces or regions), a [[sign language]] is an official language, whereas in others it has a protected status in certain areas such as education. Governments sometimes stipulate in their constitutions or laws that 'sign language' is recognised or protected, but they fail to specify ''which'' sign language exactly, as there may be several different sign languages in common use within its borders, which has led to problems.\n\nExtending legal recognition is one of the major concerns of the international [[Deaf community]], however, symbolic recognition is no guarantee for an effective improvement of the life of sign language users, and it has been argued that sign languages should be recognized and supported not merely as an accommodation for the disabled, but as the communication medium of language communities.<ref>Sarah C.

{"title_page": "Seqlock", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=August 2011}}\n\nA '''seqlock''' (short for ''sequential lock'') is a special [[lock (computer)|lock]]ing mechanism used in [[Linux]] for supporting fast writes of shared variables between two parallel [[operating system]] routines. The semantics stabilized as of version 2.5.59, and they are present in the 2.6.x stable kernel series. The seqlocks were developed by Stephen Hemminger  and originally called frlocks, based on earlier work by Andrea Arcangeli. The first implementation was in the x86-64 time code where it was needed to synchronize with user space where it was not possible to use a real lock.\n\nIt is a [[readers-writers problem|reader-writer]] consistent mechanism which avoids the problem of [[readers\u2013writer lock|writer starvation]]. A seqlock consists of storage for saving a sequence number in addition to a lock. The lock is to support synchronization between two writers and the counter is for indicating consistency in readers. In addition to updating the shared data, the writer increments the sequence number, both after acquiring the lock and before releasing the lock. Readers read the sequence number before and after reading the shared data. If the sequence number is odd on either occasion, a writer had taken the lock while the data was being read and it may have changed.

The semantics stabilized as of version 2.5.59, and they are present in the 2.6.x stable kernel series. The seqlocks were developed by Stephen Hemminger  and originally called frlocks, based on earlier work by Andrea Arcangeli. The first implementation was in the x86-64 time code where it was needed to synchronize with user space where it was not possible to use a real lock.\n\nIt is a [[Readers-writers problem|reader-writer]] consistent mechanism which avoids the problem of [[Readers\u2013writer lock|writer starvation]]. A seqlock consists of storage for saving a sequence number in addition to a lock. The lock is to support synchronization between two writers and the counter is for indicating consistency in readers. In addition to updating the shared data, the writer increments the sequence number, both after acquiring the lock and before releasing the lock. Readers read the sequence number before and after reading the shared data. If the sequence number is odd on either occasion, a writer had taken the lock while the data was being read and it may have changed. If the sequence numbers are different, a writer has changed the data while it was being read. In either case readers simply retry (using a loop) until they read the same even sequence number before and after.\n\nThe reader never blocks, but it may have to retry if a write is in progress; this speeds up the readers in the case where the data was not modified, since they do not have to acquire the lock as they would with a traditional read-write lock.

In Bangladesh rock music is often recognized as \"band music\". From the 1970s to 2000s, it was sometimes considered as the most popular genre in the country. \n\nFrom the mid 1960s to late 1990s, Bangladeshi rock was heavily influential in the development of various kinds of fusion in [[southern Asia]] like: [[folk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In the 2000s, Bangladeshi rock music saw the development of heavy metal music as many subgenres emerged in the scene like: \n[[Thrash metal|thrash]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[Progressive metal|progressive]]. \n\nFrom the 2000s to 2010s, genres that emerged in the music scene, included [[Art rock|art]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[post-grunge]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] rock. Though considered the declining decade, the 2010s produced bands that pushed boundaries in the Bangladeshi rock music scene and earned huge popularity.  \n\n\n==Rock and roll (1960s to mid 1980s)==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe foundations of Bangladeshi rock was in 1950s [[American rock|American rock and roll]] and Bengali classical music. Back in the 1960s, American rock and roll artist [[Elvis Presley]] had influenced many great rock bands like: [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Drawing influences from the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists Bangladeshi bands were starting to form to introduce a new kind of music in the country. In the 1960s, the Gramophone Company of Pakistan had imported many [[Long playing|LP]] and [[Single (music)|singles]] of rock and roll artists like [[Cliff Richard and the Shadows]], Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Hollies]], which were sold very well in Bangladesh. These artists was favored mostly by the high school and college students in Bangladesh. Hence, the mid 1960s rock music was influenced and developed a sound that was very similar to the [[Beat (music)|beat]], the [[British Invasion]] and late 1960s [[psychedelic rock]].\n\nZinga formed by Shafaat Ali in Chittagong introduced [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[piano]] to the classical music loving generation and most of the people were getting excited about it. They were also the first one to perform [[Rabindra Sangeet|Tagore songs]] with guitar and piano in the [[Bangladesh Television|East Pakistan TV]] (now BTV).<ref name=\"zg\">{{Cite web|url=http://zingagoshty.com/id38.htm|title=Zinga Biography|website=zingagoshty.com|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> And around that time in 1964 in Dhaka, the Windy Side of Care was formed and they started performing songs of Elvis Presley and [[Cliff Richard]] in the clubs and hotels. \n\nThere's much debate to who is the first 'rock' band of the country. Zinga is the first contender, they were formed in 1963 in Chittagong, but there music was more like adhunik and didn't have the rock and roll sound. It has been argued that the Windy Side of Care was the first rock band of the country formed in 1964. They were also the first band to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock. Their self titled debut album also featured [[raga rock]] song \"Raag Bageshri\". At that time in Chittagong was formed the Lightnings, who were more improved and skilled then the other bands and had the rock and roll sound. In 1968, Zinga released their first song ''Tomari Jiboney'' which became very popular as it was aired on Shadhin Bangla Betar and East Pakistan TV a lot. Shafaat Ali is considered to be the first singer-songwriter of Bangladesh. From the late 1960s, inspired by the Beatles, Zinga became interested in the singer-songwriter concept. Though the song propelled the band, it failed to capture the rock and roll sound. Insex Dui was an American-Bangladeshi band who performed American and British psychedelic rock music in the 1960s. Formed by American students living in Dhaka, they had a complete different sound than the other rock bands of the decade. \n\nBefore becoming a successful Dhallywood actor [[Zafar Iqbal (actor)|Zafar Iqbal]] was a singer in a band named, the Rambling Stones. It was formed in 1966. Other rock bands of the 1960s included Ugly Phases, Fire in Ice and Time Ago Motion. None of this bands released an album.\n\n===Post-Independence===\n\nMost of the bands from the 1960s did not become that successful and disbanded after the war in 1971. Some musicians went abroad or some of them formed new bands. Bands like Uccharon and Spondon were formed. And they were responsible for taking Bangladeshi rock to a new level, to a new crowd. Writing songs about poverty, the struggles of the people in a new born country, about romance and about the famine. Their songwriting and on stage performance was more improved than the bands of 1960s. \n\nUccharon were the biggest band of that era in South Asia after [[Moheener Ghoraguli]]. Inspired by the 1960s rock music and some Indian classical musician, their frontman [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], a freedom fighter, introduced the [[Hippie|hippie fashion]]. He is sometimes considered to be the first musician with long hair in Bangladesh. With his long hair, bell-bottom jeans, powerful lyrics and open air concerts, Khan cemented himself as a pop culture phenomenon. Their first song, \"Hai Allah Re!\" became a big hit in 1973, after it's release. \"Bangladesh\" a song released by the band in 1975 was a protest song, and inspired many bands to write songs about the struggle of the poor. The had more major hit songs in the decade including \"Ami Jare Chaire\" (1975), \"Ashi Ashi Bole Tumi\" (1977) and \"Papri Keno Bojhena\" (1978).\n\nOn the other hand, Spondon was a band mostly doing classical folk songs. They are the first one in Bangladesh, to perform Lalon geeti as a band, which later inspired many bands of the 2000s and 2010s. Their debut album, ''Spondon Bangladesh'' released in 1975 was the best-selling album of the decade, as told by Bichitra. As in the United States a decade prior, where rock music helped change cultural values about race, religion and sexuality, Bangladeshi rock and roll\u2014dominated by Uccharon\u2014showed people that a different life was possible. The protest songs of Uccharon inspired many bands of the 1980s and 1990s to write songs against the autocrat government.\n\n===Pop rock===\n\nIn late 1970s Bangladesh a flourishing culture of groups emerged, sometimes from the declining early rock and roll scene, mostly in [[Chittagong]] and [[Dhaka]]. There was like twenty to thirtie bands in these two cities playing in clubs, hotels and halls. \nMost of these bands were influenced by the [[British Invasion]], [[Music of Bangladesh#Modern Bangla music|Adhunik music]] and the early rock and roll scene in Bangladesh. The pop rock music was lead by the Chittagong-based rock band [[Souls (band)|Souls]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/04/05/coverstory.htm|title=Star Magazine|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref> After their first single \"Mon Shudhu Mon Chuyeche\" came out in 1980, the band were appreciated by the older rock bands and they released their debut album two years later named, ''Super Souls'', which cemented themselves as one of the best bands of the country. Just like Souls, a band from [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]], Dhaka named Shocking Blue were also doing pop rock music, writing romantic songs. \n\nThough not considered a rock band by many critics, [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]] was successful during the decade, used keyboards as a lead instrument, and had a more techno sound than any earlier band. Inspired by Azam Khan, they imitated hippie fashions, wrote songs to change the cultural values of Bangladesh, and were often political.<ref>https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/2018/11/29/we-practised-music-from-our-hearts</ref> [[Miles (band)|Miles]]' [[Miles (Miles album)|self titled debut album]], released in 1982, was the first all-English album in the country. It only featured two original songs by the band. \n\nMost 1970s bands disbanded because of their vocalists' prominence. But, in the 1980s, members maintained cohesion and continued to release hit singles and albums into the 1990s.\n\n== Progression (1980s to early 1990s) ==\n\n=== Psychedelic rock ===\n\n[[James (musician)|Feelings]] was formed in 1978 in [[Chittagong]] by [[James (musician)|James]]. They were the first psychedelic band in the region. Vocalist and singer [[James (musician)|James]] formed the band when he was 13 years old. [[Ayub Bachchu]] also worked with them from 1978 to '82. Their first album ''Station Road'' came out in 1985. It contained hit songs like ''Station Road'', ''Glass Beat Games'' etc.  Their second album  ''\u099c\u09c7\u09b2 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09bf (Speaking from Jail)'' was a major success for them. In 2000, Feelings changed their name to ''Nagar Baul''. Their last album was released in 2001, which was ''\u09a6\u09c1\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09c1 \u099b\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09b2 (Bad Boys Group)''. They have released only one album under the new name.<ref>{{cite news |title=To Rock or Not to Rock| url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends | publisher=dhakatribune.com| access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough early Bangladeshi rock is characterised by romantic songs and mellow tunes, the scene began to change during the 1980s. Waves introduced Heavy Metal music in Bangladesh. Warfaze was also a progressive band during this period. Feedback was another band, who released the albums ''Ullash'' and ''Mela''. From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, hard rock became more popular.  \"It was around 1986 when Miles performed hard rock in Dhaka. They performed songs of Iron Maiden which was rocking to people. The next concert was a mind blowing performance, in which they covered several numbers of Iron Maiden and they did very well indeed!\" The band was called In Dhaka, Warfaze and Rock Strata. Different Touch was also active during the late 1980s and early 1990s, playing \"Sraboner Meghgulo\". Nova (1986) and Renaissance were bands from the same period. The era also witnessed the emergence of artists such as [[Ayub Bachchu]] (who created [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]]) and solo performers [[Tapan Chowdhury (singer)|Tapan Chowdhury]] and [[Kumar Bishwajit]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A Lesson in Evolution of Bangladeshi Rock |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192694 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)]] |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Emergence (mid-to-late 1990s) ==\nThe early 1990s was arguably the most productive phase<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\" /> of Bangladeshi rock, featuring bands such as [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]] and [[Ark (Bangladeshi band)|Ark]]. [[Cryptic Fate]] and Maqsood O Dhaka were other notable groups from the era.<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\" />\n\nThe heavy-metal scene further developed during the early 1990s. \"Mixed album ''Hooray'' was, back then, a huge inspiration and boost for many celebrated bands from today\", said Shakib of [[Cryptic Fate]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Warfaze and Rock Strata also released albums. Another band was Winning, which later disbanded.\nThat year metal bands such as [[Cryptic Fate]], Mysteria, Dethrow and PsychoDeth also emerged, playing at underground shows. [[Shironaamhin]], formed in 1996, is still active as of 2013. Around 1998, Koprophilia, Clovermind and Spanking Monkeys began playing alternative music. After a period of turmoil, around 1999 [[Artcell]] (formerly Tantrik), Metal Maze, Migraine, [[Black (Bangladeshi band)|Black]], Wire, and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]] surfaced.<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\">{{cite web |title=90'z Rocking the decade |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2006/06/04/special.htm |work=Rising Stars |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Underground |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/2010/10/03/centre.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>\n\n== New Millennium (the 2000s) ==\nBy the early ears of the 21st century, bands such as [[Aurthohin]], [[Dalchhut]], [[Shironamhin]], [[Black]], [[Artcell]], Poizon Green, Kronic, Reborn and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]] became active on the Bangladeshi music scene with the release of debut albums and songs. Newer bands emerging during this period, such as [[Stentorian]], [[Arbovirus (band)|Arbovirus]], [[Shunno]] and Lalon, also became established. The era also saw the revival of the Chittagong rock-music scene. Although the city is considered the birthplace of Bangladeshi rock it declined during the 1990s, when most local musicians and bands began moving to Dhaka for more opportunity and better facilities. During the early 2010s, the Bangladesh Music Bands Association (BAMBA) and the Chittagong Musical Band Association (CMBA) began organising rock concerts in the city, which gave exposure to local underground bands. This resulted to the emergence of new rock bands in the city, such as Hemorrhage and Blunderware.<ref>{{cite news |title=Silent tears of underground music in Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/03/04/feature_silent.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NSR IV rocks Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/feature_nsr.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Indie Wave (the 2010s) ==\nNearing the end of the first decade of the millennia, bands like [[Blunderware]], [[Joler Gaan]], Ashes, [[Chirkutt]] and the likes started to penetrate the scene, swaying away from traditional rock to cater to niche audience. With the fall of many major labels, and no availability of streaming platforms, rock musicians took to the internet to self-publish their songs and albums. Many bands such as Minerva, Owned, [[Poraho]] released their album through digital platforms. One of the emerging bands of the current decade is Indalo, a post-grunge band with modern influences, who self published and self distributed their own album without the help of sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news |title=BANDS WHO ARE ABOUT TO BRING GOOD MUSIC |url=https://medium.com/@humanotrobot/bangladeshi-rock-bands-who-are-about-to-bring-some-good-music-21f234095542 |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref> While metal and rock music are still heavily heard throughout the rock scene, a budding indie scene started to flourish in smaller concert arenas.

There are so many Progressive Rock and Experimental Rock bands have come up with new genre and new sound which people have not experienced before. Bands like Karnival and Owned have made an exceptional example of progressing our industry. Although the market is growing slowly, they already have created their own ground. Karnival released their three successful albums; whereas Owned has given two exceptional albums to the listeners.\n\nEclipse is one of the finest band who have successfully moving with symphonic rock musical patterns. They have an album which became more famous these days. they were in the D-Rockstar contest sponsored by D-Juice along with the popular bands like Power Surge, Dreek, Radioactive & so on. Recently, there are some experimental rock bands who are cracking the ground with their unique sound and musicality. Following the unique trends, some bands like Messianic Era, Seventh Sign, Jogot, Attic; are moving forward with dedication.\n\nAt the end part or 2019. a new band named The Perfect Criminals emerged and introduced a new genre in Bangladeshi music scene called [[Power Pop]].\n\n== Notable bands of Bangladesh ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

is the rock music in Bangladesh that derived from the [[British rock|British]] and [[American rock|American]] rock music and mixed up with [[Bangladeshi classical music|Bengali classical]] and adhunik music from the 1960s. In Bangladesh rock music is often recognized as \"band music\". From the 1970s to 2000s, it was sometimes considered as the most popular genre in the country. \n\nFrom the mid 1960s to late 1990s, Bangladeshi rock was heavily influential in the development of various kinds of fusion in [[Southern Asia|southern asia]] like: [[Folk rock|folk rock]], [[Pop rock|pop rock]], [[Hard rock music|hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In the 2000s, Bangladeshi rock music saw the development of heavy metal music as many subgenres emerged in the scene like: \n[[Thrash metal|thrash]], [[Death metal|death]], and [[Progressive metal|progressive]]. \n\nFrom the 2000s to 2010s, genres that emerged in the music scene, included [[Art rock|art]], [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]], [[Post-grunge|post-grunge]], [[Progressive rock|progressive]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] rock. Though considered the declining decade, the 2010s produced bands that pushed boundaries in the Bangladeshi rock music scene and earned huge popularity.  \n\n\n==Rock and roll (1960s to mid 1980s)==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe foundations of Bangladeshi rock was in 1950s [[American rock|American rock and roll]] and Bengali classical music. Back in the 1960s, American rock and roll artist [[Elvis Presley]] had influenced many great rock bands like: [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Drawing influences from the 1950s and 1960s rock and roll artists Bangladeshi bands were starting to form to introduce a new kind of music in the country. In the 1960s, the Gramophone Company of Pakistan had imported many [[Long playing|LP]] and [[Single (music)|singles]] of rock and roll artists like [[Cliff Richard and the Shadows]], Elvis Presley, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, [[The Beach Boys|the Beach Boys]] and [[The Hollies|the Hollies]], which were sold very well in Bangladesh. These artists was favored mostly by the high school and college students in Bangladesh. Hence, the mid -60s rock music was influenced and developed a sound that was very similar to the [[Beat (music)|beat]], the [[British Invasion]] and late -60s [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic rock]].\n\nZinga formed by Shafaat Ali in Chittagong introduced [[guitar]], [[drums]] and [[piano]] to the classical music loving generation and most of the people were getting excited about it. They were also the first one to perform [[Rabindra Sangeet|Tagore songs]] with guitar and piano in the [[Bangladesh Television|East Pakistan TV]] (now BTV)<ref name=\"zg\">{{Cite web|url=http://zingagoshty.com/id38.htm|title=Zinga Biography|website=zingagoshty.com|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>. And around that time in 1964 in Dhaka, the Windy Side of Care was formed and they started performing songs of Elvis Presley and [[Cliff Richard]] in the clubs and hotels. \n\nThere's much debate to who is the first 'rock' band of the country. Zinga is the first contender, they were formed in 1963 in Chittagong, but there music was more like adhunik and didn't have the rock and roll sound. It has been argued that the Windy Side of Care was the first rock band of the country formed in 1964. They were also the first band to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock. Their self titled debut album also featured [[Raga rock|raga rock]] song \"Raag Bageshri\". At that time in Chittagong was formed the Lightnings, who were more improved and skilled then the other bands and had the rock and roll sound. In 1968, Zinga released their first song ''Tomari Jiboney'' which became very popular as it was aired on Shadhin Bangla Betar and East Pakistan TV a lot. Shafaat Ali is considered to be the first singer-songwriter of Bangladesh. From the late 1960s, inspired by the Beatles, Zinga became interested in the singer-songwriter concept. Though the song propelled the band, it failed to capture the rock and roll sound. Insex Dui was an American-Bangladeshi band who performed American and British psychedelic rock music in the 1960s. Formed by American students living in Dhaka, they had a complete different sound than the other rock bands of the decade. \n\nBefore becoming a successfull Dhallywood actor [[Zafar Iqbal (actor)|Zafar Iqbal]] was a singer in a band named, the Rambling Stones. It was formed in 1966. Other rock bands of the 1960s included Ugly Phases, Fire in Ice and Time Ago Motion. None of this bands released an album.\n\n===Post-Independence===\n\nMost of the bands from the 1960s, didn't become that successful and disbanded after the war in 1971. Some musicians went abroad or some of them formed new bands. Bands like Uccharon and Spondon were formed. And they were responsible for taking Bangladeshi rock to a new level, to a new crowd. Writing songs about poverty, the struggles of the people in a new born country, about romance and about the famine. Their songwriting and on stage performance was more improved than the bands of 60s. \n\nUccharon were the biggest band of that era in South Asia after [[Moheener Ghoraguli]]. Inspired by the 1960s rock music and some Indian classical musician, their frontman [[Azam Khan (singer)|Azam Khan]], a freedom fighter, introduced the [[Hippie|hippie fashion]]. He is sometimes considered to be the first musician with long hair in Bangladesh. With his long hair, bell-bottom jeans, powerful lyrics and open air concerts, Khan cemented himself as a pop culture phenomenon. Their first song, \"Hai Allah Re!\" became a big hit in 1973, after it's release. \"Bangladesh\" a song released by the band in 1975 was a protest song, and inspired many bands to write songs about the struggle of the poor. The had more major hit songs in the decade including \"Ami Jare Chaire\" (1975), \"Ashi Ashi Bole Tumi\" (1977) and \"Papri Keno Bojhena\" (1978).\n\nOn the other hand, Spondon was a band mostly doing classical folk songs. They are the first one in Bangladesh, to perform Lalon geeti as a band, which later inspired many bands of the 2000s and 2010s. Their debut album, ''Spondon Bangladesh'' released in 1975 was the best-selling album of the decade, as told by Bichitra. As in the United States a decade prior, where rock music helped change cultural values about race, religion and sexuality, Bangladeshi rock and roll\u2014dominated by Uccharon\u2014showed people that a different life was possible. The protest songs of Uccharon inspired many bands of the 1980s and 1990s to write songs against the autocrat government.\n\n===Pop rock===\n\nIn late 1970s Bangladesh a flourishing culture of groups emerged, sometimes from the declining early rock and roll scene, mostly in [[Chittagong]] and [[Dhaka]]. There was like twenty to thirtie bands in these two cities playing in clubs, hotels and halls. \nMost of these bands were influenced by the [[British Invasion]], [[Music of Bangladesh#Modern Bangla music|Adhunik music]] and the early rock and roll scene in Bangladesh. The pop rock music was lead by the Chittagong based rock band [[Souls (band)|Souls]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/04/05/coverstory.htm|title=Star Magazine|website=archive.thedailystar.net|access-date=2019-06-08}}</ref>. After their first single \"Mon Shudhu Mon Chuyeche\" came out in 1980, the band were appreciated by the older rock bands and they released their debut album two years later named, ''Super Souls'', which cemented themselves as one of the best bands of the country. Just like Souls, a band from [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]], Dhaka named Shocking Blue were also doing pop rock music, writing romantic songs. \n\nThough not considered a rock band by many critics, [[Feedback (band)|Feedback]] was successful during the decade, used keyboards as a lead instrument, and had a more techno sound than any earlier band. Inspired by Azam Khan, they imitated hippie fashions, wrote songs to change the cultural values of Bangladesh, and were often political.<ref>https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/2018/11/29/we-practised-music-from-our-hearts</ref> [[Miles (band)|Miles]]' [[Miles (Miles album)|self titled debut album]], released in 1982, was the first all-English album in the country. It only featured two original songs by the band. \n\nMost 1970s bands disbanded because of their vocalists' prominence. But, in the 1980s, members maintained cohesion and continued to release hit singles and albums into the 1990s.\n\n== Progression (1980s to early 1990s) ==\n\n=== Psychedelic rock ===\n\n[[James (musician)|Feelings]] was formed in 1978 in [[Chittagong]] by [[James (musician)|James]]. They were the first psychedelic band in the region. Vocalist and singer [[James (musician)|James]] formed the band when he was 13 years old. [[Ayub Bachchu]] also worked with them from 1978 to '82. Their first album ''Station Road'' came out in 1985. It contained hit songs like ''Station Road'', ''Glass Beat Games'' etc.  Their second album  ''\u099c\u09c7\u09b2 \u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7 \u09ac\u09b2\u099b\u09bf (Speaking from Jail)'' was a major success for them. In 2000, Feelings changed their name to ''Nagar Baul''. Their last album was released in 2001, which was ''\u09a6\u09c1\u09b7\u09cd\u099f\u09c1 \u099b\u09c7\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09a6\u09b2 (Bad Boys Group)''. They have released only one album under the new name.<ref>{{cite news |title=To Rock or Not to Rock| url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends | publisher=dhakatribune.com| access-date=15 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAlthough early Bangladeshi rock is characterised by romantic songs and mellow tunes, the scene began to change during the 1980s. Waves introduced Heavy Metal music in Bangladesh. Warfaze was also a progressive band during this period. Feedback was another band, who released the albums ''Ullash'' and ''Mela''. From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, hard rock became more popular.  \"It was around 1986 when Miles performed hard rock in Dhaka. They performed songs of Iron Maiden which was rocking to people. The next concert was a mind blowing performance, in which they covered several numbers of Iron Maiden and they did very well indeed!\" The band was called In Dhaka, Warfaze and Rock Strata. Different Touch was also active during the late 1980s and early 1990s, playing \"Sraboner Meghgulo\". Nova (1986) and Renaissance were bands from the same period. The era also witnessed the emergence of artists such as [[Ayub Bachchu]] (who created [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]]) and solo performers [[Tapan Chowdhury (singer)|Tapan Chowdhury]] and [[Kumar Bishwajit]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A Lesson in Evolution of Bangladeshi Rock |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=192694 |newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)]] |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Emergence (mid-to-late 1990s) ==\nThe early 1990s was arguably the most productive phase<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\" /> of Bangladeshi rock, featuring bands such as [[Love Runs Blind|LRB]] and [[Ark (Bangladeshi band)|Ark]]. [[Cryptic Fate]] and Maqsood O Dhaka were other notable groups from the era.<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\" />\n\nThe heavy-metal scene further developed during the early 1990s. \"Mixed album ''Hooray'' was, back then, a huge inspiration and boost for many celebrated bands from today\", said Shakib of [[Cryptic Fate]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Warfaze and Rock Strata also released albums. Another band was Winning, which later disbanded.\nThat year metal bands such as [[Cryptic Fate]], Mysteria, Dethrow and PsychoDeth also emerged, playing at underground shows. [[Shironaamhin]], formed in 1996, is still active as of 2013. Around 1998, Koprophilia, Clovermind and Spanking Monkeys began playing alternative music. After a period of turmoil, around 1999 [[Artcell]] (formerly Tantrik), Metal Maze, Migraine, [[Black (Bangladeshi band)|Black]], Wire, and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]] surfaced.<ref name=\"90'z Rocking the decade\">{{cite web |title=90'z Rocking the decade |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/rising/2006/06/04/special.htm |work=Rising Stars |publisher=The Daily Star |accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Underground |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/2010/10/03/centre.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star |accessdate=2013-06-21}}</ref>\n\n== New Millennium (the 2000s) ==\nBy the early ears of the 21st century, bands such as [[Aurthohin]], [[Dalchhut]], [[Shironamhin]], [[Black]], [[Artcell]], Poizon Green, Kronic, Reborn and [[Nemesis (Bangladeshi band)|Nemesis]] became active on the Bangladeshi music scene with the release of debut albums and songs. Newer bands emerging during this period, such as [[Stentorian]], [[Arbovirus (band)|Arbovirus]], [[Shunno]] and Lalon, also became established. The era also saw the revival of the Chittagong rock-music scene. Although the city is considered the birthplace of Bangladeshi rock it declined during the 1990s, when most local musicians and bands began moving to Dhaka for more opportunity and better facilities. During the early 2010s, the Bangladesh Music Bands Association (BAMBA) and the Chittagong Musical Band Association (CMBA) began organising rock concerts in the city, which gave exposure to local underground bands. This resulted to the emergence of new rock bands in the city, such as Hemorrhage and Blunderware.<ref>{{cite news |title=Silent tears of underground music in Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2007/03/04/feature_silent.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=NSR IV rocks Chittagong |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/campus/2009/07/03/feature_nsr.htm |work=Star Campus |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |accessdate=23 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Indie Wave (the 2010s) ==\nNearing the end of the first decade of the millennia, bands like [[Blunderware]], [[Joler Gaan]], Ashes, [[Chirkutt]] and the likes started to penetrate the scene, swaying away from traditional rock to cater to niche audience. With the fall of many major labels, and no availability of streaming platforms, rock musicians took to the internet to self-publish their songs and albums. Many bands such as Minerva, Owned, [[Poraho]] released their album through digital platforms. One of the emerging bands of the current decade is Indalo, a post-grunge band with modern influences, who self published and self distributed their own album without the help of sponsorship.<ref>{{cite news |title=BANDS WHO ARE ABOUT TO BRING GOOD MUSIC |url=https://medium.com/@humanotrobot/bangladeshi-rock-bands-who-are-about-to-bring-some-good-music-21f234095542 |publisher=medium.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref> While metal and rock music are still heavily heard throughout the rock scene, a budding indie scene started to flourish in smaller concert arenas. Bands like The Crowd, Embers in Snow, Pieket, Orfred, Headline, and Attic - to name a few - have brought about a change in the sound of rock with English songwriting being a common practice in their music.<ref>{{cite news |title=Legacy Of Bangladeshi Rock and Roll |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2018/05/12/legacy-of-rock-and-roll-bangladeshi-rock-bands-pay-tribute-to-rock-legends |publisher=dhakatribune.com |accessdate=14 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Progressive/Experimental Rock Wave (the 2000s onwards) ==\nBangladeshi music scene has been changed a lot for couple of years.

While Safran's definitions were influenced by the idea of the Jewish diaspora, he recognised the expanding use of the term. [[Rogers Brubaker]] (2005) also noted that use of the term \"diaspora\" had started to take on an increasingly general sense. He suggests that one element of this expansion in use \"involves the application of the term diaspora to an ever-broadening set of cases: essentially to any and every nameable population category that is to some extent dispersed in space\".

Beginning in the 8th century, Arabs took African slaves from the [[Central Africa|central]] and [[East Africa|eastern]] portions of the African continent (where they were known as the [[Zanj]]) and sold them into markets in the [[Middle East]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Far East]].

The dispersal through [[slave trading]] represents the largest forced migrations in human history. The economic effect on the African continent proved devastating, as generations of young people were taken from their communities and societies were disrupted. Some communities formed by descendants of African slaves in the Americas, Europe, and Asia have survived to the present day. In other cases, [[blacks]] intermarried with non-blacks, and their descendants blended into the local population.\n\nIn the Americas, the confluence of multiple [[ethnic]] groups from around the world contributed to multi-ethnic societies. In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], most people are descended from European, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], and African ancestry. In Brazil, where in 1888 nearly half the population descended from African slaves, the variation of physical characteristics extends across a broad range. In the United States, there was historically a greater European colonial population in relation to African slaves, especially in the [[Northern Tier (United States)|Northern Tier]]. There was considerable racial intermarriage in [[colonial Virginia]], and other forms of racial mixing during the slavery and post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] years.

For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of [[racialization]]. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like [[W. E. B. Dubois]] and more recently [[Robin Kelley]], for example, have argued that black politics of survival reveal more about the meaning of the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the \"world-historical processes\" of racial colonization, capitalism, and Western domination defines blacks' links to Africa.<ref name=\"DECOLONIAL MOVES\">{{cite journal |title = Decolonial Moves: Trans-locating African Diaspora Spaces |author = Lao-Montes, Agust\u00edn |journal = Cultural Studies |year = 2007 |volume = 21 |issue = 2\u20133 |pages = 309\u201338 |doi = 10.1080/09502380601164361 }}</ref>\n\n=== African diaspora and modernity ===\n\nIn the last decades, studies on the African diaspora have shown an interest in the roles that blacks played in bringing about modernity. This trend also opposes the traditional [[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]] perspective that has dominated history books showing Africans and its diasporans as primitive victims of slavery, and without historical agency. According to [[historian]] [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], blacks toiled at the center of forces that created the modern world. Paul Gilroy describes the suppression of blackness due to imagined and created ideals of nations as \"cultural insiderism.\" Cultural insiderism is used by nations to separate deserving and undeserving groups<ref>Gilroy, 3</ref> and requires a \"sense of ethnic difference\" as mentioned in his book ''The Black Atlantic''. Recognizing their contributions offers a comprehensive appreciation of global history.<ref>Manning, Patrick. ''The African Diaspora: A History Through Culture.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 2009, Kindle.</ref>\n\n=== Richard Iton's view of diaspora ===\n\nThe late cultural and political theorist Richard Iton suggested that diaspora be understood as a \"culture of dislocation.\" For Iton, the traditional approach to the African diaspora focuses on the ruptures associated with the Atlantic slave trade and Middle Passage, notions of dispersal, and \"the cycle of retaining, redeeming, refusing, and retrieving 'Africa.'\"<ref name=Iton>Iton, Richard. ''In Search of the Black Fantastic: Politics and Popular Culture in the Post-Civil Rights Era''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2010.</ref>{{rp|199}} This conventional framework for analyzing the diaspora is dangerous, according to Iton, because it presumes that diaspora exists outside of Africa, thus simultaneously disowning and desiring Africa. Further, Iton suggests a new starting principle for the use of diaspora: \"the impossibility of settlement that correlates throughout the modern period with the cluster of disturbances that trouble not only the physically dispersed but those moved without traveling.\"<ref name=Iton />{{rp|199\u2013200}} Iton adds that this impossibility of settlement\u2014this \"modern matrix of strange spaces\u2014outside the state but within the empire,\"\u2014renders notions of black citizenship fanciful, and in fact, \"undesirable.\" Iton argues that we  citizenship, a state of statelessness thereby deconstructing colonial sites and narratives in an effort to \"de-link geography and power,\" putting \"''all'' space into play\" (emphasis added)<ref name=Iton />{{rp|199\u2013200}} For Iton, diaspora's potential is represented by a \"rediscursive albeit agonistic field of play that might denaturalize the hegemonic representations of modernity as unencumbered and self-generating and bring into clear view its repressed, colonial subscript\".<ref name=Iton />{{rp|201}}\n\n=== Diaspora citizenship ===\nIn the eighth chapter of her book ''Rihanna Barbados World-Gurl in Global Popular Culture'' Heather Russell describes diasporic citizenship as an identity where you \u201csimultaneously negotiate the entailments of civic responsibility, public discourse, nostalgia, nationhood, belonging and migration, transnational cultural affiliations and shifting/fluid subject positionalities across material and symbolic boundaries\u201d<ref name=\"editor. 2015\">{{Cite book|title=Rihanna : Barbados world-gurl in global popular culture|last=editor.|first=Beckles, Hilary, 1955- editor. Russell, Heather, 1970-|isbn=9789766405021|oclc=907426161|year = 2015}}</ref> Musical artists are prime figures to be appraised with this theory due to their acclaim bringing them public discourse and their music bringing cultural affiliations. As such, for musicians who reach this level of transnational stardom and music production, they have to balance their relationship to their identity and their home with the transnational populations they engage with through their music, performance and public image.\n\n[[Rihanna|Robyn Rihanna Fenty]] is a global superstar whose music transcends national borders and as such is a perfect case for the diaspora citizen framework. She is one of the few black women to achieve this level of global success and gain diasporic citizenship that forces her to balance her identities with her relationship to her diverse viewership.<ref name=\"editor. 2015\"/>  While Rihanna is by no means the first artist, or even the first black female artist to reach this level of stardom, unlike her peers her diasporic citizenship is characterized by her Caribbean identity. In her book, Russel further describes Rihanna's diasporic citizenship by saying:<blockquote>\u201cRihanna must navigate inevitably conflicting, contesting and reinforcing sites of national and transnational belongings. In other words, she is a Barbadian citizen shining in a US-global sphere within which most citizens can hardly find Barbados on the map. She is a hugely commercially successful artist operating in a popular-cultural market dictated by US global musical tastes. At the same time, Rihanna is Barbados\u2019s honorary ambassador of youth and culture and has signed a multi-year deal to promote Barbados for the Barbados Tourism Authority. Moreover, local discussions surrounding Barbadian national pride, Victorian notions of female propriety and Christian ideas about decency which Rihanna\u2019s emergence and ascendancy have provoked, continue to capture the Barbadian public\u2019s imaginations and dominate the opinions expressed in their newspaper columns and call-in programmes\u201d<ref name=\"editor. 2015\"/> </blockquote>The diaspora citizen theory allows us to better understand the complexities associated with stars like Rihanna whose cultural influence has transcended national borders and created a complex relationship between the artist and the various cultural regions they are associated with.\n\n== Populations and estimated distribution ==\n\nAfrican diaspora populations include:\n* [[African Americans]], [[Afro-Caribbeans]], [[Black Canadians]] \u2013 descendants of enslaved [[West Africa]]ns brought to the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[South America]] during the [[Atlantic slave trade]].\n* [[Zanj]] \u2013 descendants of [[Zanj]] slaves whose ancestors were brought to the [[Near East]] and other parts of Asia during the [[Arab slave trade]].<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A6645-2004Jan10&notFound=true |title =A Legacy Hidden in Plain Sight|work =The Washington Post|date=11 January 2004|first = Theola |last =Labb\u017c |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025929/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A6645-2004Jan10&notFound=true|archivedate = 14 May 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Siddi]]s \u2013 descendants of [[Zanj]] slaves whose ancestors were brought to the [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Pakistan]] and [[India]]).

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085).

Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o]], a black Spanish seafarer, piloted one of Columbus's ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes as freedmen, but most often as enslaved servants and workers. Demand for African labour increased in the Caribbean because of the massive deaths among the [[Ta\u00edno]] and other indigenous populations, resulting primarily from [[Eurasia]]n infectious diseases to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], as well as conflict with the Spanish, and harsh working conditions. By the mid-16th century, [[slave trading|slave trade]] from Africa to the Caribbean was so profitable that the Englishmen [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] engaged in piracy and violated Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonialism in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery, so that, by the end of the 18th century, on many islands, enslaved [[Afro-Caribbeans]] far outnumbered their European masters.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stephen D.

In 1804, Haiti, with what had been an overwhelmingly black slave population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state and create a republic. Continuous waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]] led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in [[Jamaica]], created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region, with Great Britain abolishing it in 1838. [[Cuba]] (under the Spanish Crown) was the last island to emancipate its slaves.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people began to assert their cultural, economic and political rights on the world stage. The Jamaican [[Marcus Garvey]] formed the [[UNIA]] movement in the United States, continuing with [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]]'s [[n\u00e9gritude]] movement, which was intended to create a pan-African movement across national lines. From the 1960s, the former slave populations in the Caribbean began to win their independence from British colonial rule. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae music]], and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a new Afro-Caribbean diaspora, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]] in the United States, was influential in the creation of the [[black power]] and [[hip hop]] movements. Influential political theorists such as [[Walter Rodney]], [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] contributed to anti-colonial theory and movements in Africa, as well as cultural developments in Europe.\n\n=== North America ===\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|African Americans}}\n[[File:Majority Black Counties.PNG|alt=A map of the United States|thumb|A map of [[United States counties]] that have majority-black populations: although the African-American population is still predominantly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] created several black populations in [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Harlem]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Oakland]], and [[Washington, D.

These were primarily former slaves who had escaped to British lines for promised freedom during the Revolution.\n\nLater during the antebellum years, other individual African Americans escaped to Canada, mostly to locations in [[Southwestern Ontario]], via the [[Underground Railroad#Arrival in Canada|Underground Railroad]], a system supported by both blacks and whites to assist fugitive slaves. After achieving independence, northern states in the U.S. had begun to abolish slavery as early as 1793, but slavery was not abolished in the South until 1865, following the [[American Civil War]].\n\nBlack immigration to Canada in the twentieth century consisted mostly of Caribbean descent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The African Diaspora in Canada: negotiating identity & belonging|last=Tettey|first=Wisdom J.|last2=Puplampu|first2=Korbla P.|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85109-700-5|location=Calgary, Alberta, Canada|pages=205}}</ref> As a result of the prominence of Caribbean immigration, the term \"African Canadian\", while sometimes used to refer to the minority of Canadian blacks who have direct African or African-American heritage, is ''not'' normally used to denote black Canadians.

However, in places like Brazil and the Dominican Republic, blackness is performed in more taboo ways than it is in, say, the United States. The idea behind [[Trey Ellis#Cultural Mulatto|Trey Ellis Cultural Mulatto]] comes into play as there are blurred lines between what is considered as black.\n\nIn [[Peru]], the African population was very mixed with the other white, Indian and mestizo population; so someone is identified as ''negro'' if he or she has visible African features. Some mestizos and whites have a degree of African admixture.\n\nIn [[Colombia]], the African slaves were first brought to work in the gold mines of the Department of Antioquia. After this was no longer a profitable business, these slaves slowly moved to the Pacific coast, where they have remained unmixed with the white or Indian population until today. The whole Department of Choc\u00f3 remains a black area. Mixture with white population happened mainly in the Caribbean coast, which is a mestizo area until today. There was also a greater mixture in the south-western departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca. In these mestizo areas the African culture has had a great influence.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Afro-European}}\nSome European countries make it illegal to collect demographic census information based on ethnicity or ancestry (e.g. France), but some others do query along racial lines (e.g. the UK).

Beginning in the 8th century, Arabs took African slaves from the [[Central Africa|central]] and [[East Africa|eastern]] portions of the African continent (where they were known as the [[Zanj]]) and sold them into markets in the [[Middle East]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Far East]]. Beginning in the 15th century, Europeans captured or bought [[Africa]]n slaves from [[West Africa]] and brought them to the Americas and to Europe.

The dispersal through [[slave trading]] represents the largest forced migrations in human history. The economic effect on the African continent proved devastating, as generations of young people were taken from their communities and societies were disrupted. Some communities formed by descendants of African slaves in the Americas, Europe, and Asia have survived to the present day. In other cases, [[blacks]] intermarried with non-blacks, and their descendants blended into the local population.\n\nIn the Americas, the confluence of multiple [[ethnic]] groups from around the world contributed to multi-ethnic societies. In [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], most people are descended from European, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]], and African ancestry. In Brazil, where in 1888 nearly half the population descended from African slaves, the variation of physical characteristics extends across a broad range. In the United States, there was historically a greater European colonial population in relation to African slaves, especially in the [[Northern Tier (United States)|Northern Tier]]. There was considerable racial intermarriage in [[colonial Virginia]], and other forms of racial mixing during the slavery and post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] years. [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] and [[anti-miscegenation laws]] passed after the 1863-1877 [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] in the [[Southern United States|South]] in the late-19th century, plus waves of vastly increased [[immigration]] from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, maintained much distinction between racial groups.

For them, it is a movement of liberation that opposes the implications of [[racialization]]. Their position assumes that Africans and their descendants abroad struggle to reclaim power over their lives through voluntary migration, cultural production and political conceptions and practices. It also implies the presence of cultures of resistance with similar objectives throughout the global diaspora. Thinkers like [[W. E. B. Dubois]] and more recently [[Robin Kelley]], for example, have argued that black politics of survival reveal more about the meaning of the African diaspora than labels of ethnicity and race, and degrees of skin hue. From this view, the daily struggle against what they call the \"world-historical processes\" of racial colonization, capitalism, and Western domination defines blacks' links to Africa.<ref name=\"DECOLONIAL MOVES\">{{cite journal |title = Decolonial Moves: Trans-locating African Diaspora Spaces |author = Lao-Montes, Agust\u00edn |journal = Cultural Studies |year = 2007 |volume = 21 |issue = 2\u20133 |pages = 309\u201338 |doi = 10.1080/09502380601164361 }}</ref>\n\n=== African diaspora and modernity ===\n\nIn the last decades, studies on the African diaspora have shown an interest in the roles that blacks played in bringing about modernity. This trend also opposes the traditional [[Eurocentrism|eurocentric]] perspective that has dominated history books showing Africans and its diasporans as primitive victims of slavery, and without historical agency. According to [[historian]] [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], blacks toiled at the center of forces that created the modern world. Paul Gilroy describes the suppression of blackness due to imagined and created ideals of nations as \"cultural insiderism.\" Cultural insiderism is used by nations to separate deserving and undeserving groups<ref>Gilroy, 3</ref> and requires a \"sense of ethnic difference\" as mentioned in his book ''The Black Atlantic''. Recognizing their contributions offers a comprehensive appreciation of global history.<ref>Manning, Patrick. ''The African Diaspora: A History Through Culture.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 2009, Kindle.</ref>\n\n=== Richard Iton's view of diaspora ===\n\nThe late cultural and political theorist Richard Iton suggested that diaspora be understood as a \"culture of dislocation.\" For Iton, the traditional approach to the African diaspora focuses on the ruptures associated with the Atlantic slave trade and Middle Passage, notions of dispersal, and \"the cycle of retaining, redeeming, refusing, and retrieving 'Africa.'\"<ref name=Iton>Iton, Richard. ''In Search of the Black Fantastic: Politics and Popular Culture in the Post-Civil Rights Era''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2010.</ref>{{rp|199}} This conventional framework for analyzing the diaspora is dangerous, according to Iton, because it presumes that diaspora exists outside of Africa, thus simultaneously disowning and desiring Africa. Further, Iton suggests a new starting principle for the use of diaspora: \"the impossibility of settlement that correlates throughout the modern period with the cluster of disturbances that trouble not only the physically dispersed but those moved without traveling.\"<ref name=Iton />{{rp|199\u2013200}} Iton adds that this impossibility of settlement\u2014this \"modern matrix of strange spaces\u2014outside the state but within the empire,\"\u2014renders notions of black citizenship fanciful, and in fact, \"undesirable.\" Iton argues that we  citizenship, a state of statelessness thereby deconstructing colonial sites and narratives in an effort to \"de-link geography and power,\" putting \"''all'' space into play\" (emphasis added)<ref name=Iton />{{rp|199\u2013200}} For Iton, diaspora's potential is represented by a \"rediscursive albeit agonistic field of play that might denaturalize the hegemonic representations of modernity as unencumbered and self-generating and bring into clear view its repressed, colonial subscript\".<ref name=Iton />{{rp|201}}\n\n=== Diaspora citizenship ===\nIn the eighth chapter of her book ''Rihanna Barbados World-Gurl in Global Popular Culture'' Heather Russell describes diasporic citizenship as an identity where you \u201csimultaneously negotiate the entailments of civic responsibility, public discourse, nostalgia, nationhood, belonging and migration, transnational cultural affiliations and shifting/fluid subject positionalities across material and symbolic boundaries\u201d<ref name=\"editor. 2015\">{{Cite book|title=Rihanna : Barbados world-gurl in global popular culture|last=editor.|first=Beckles, Hilary, 1955- editor.

As such, for musicians who reach this level of transnational stardom and music production, they have to balance their relationship to their identity and their home with the transnational populations they engage with through their music, performance and public image.\n\n[[Rihanna|Robyn Rihanna Fenty]] is a global superstar whose music transcends national borders and as such is a perfect case for the diaspora citizen framework. She is one of the few black women to achieve this level of global success and gain diasporic citizenship that forces her to balance her identities with her relationship to her diverse viewership.<ref name=\"editor. 2015\"/>  While Rihanna is by no means the first artist, or even the first black female artist to reach this level of stardom, unlike her peers her diasporic citizenship is characterized by her Caribbean identity. In her book, Russel further describes Rihanna's diasporic citizenship by saying:<blockquote>\u201cRihanna must navigate inevitably conflicting, contesting and reinforcing sites of national and transnational belongings. In other words, she is a Barbadian citizen shining in a US-global sphere within which most citizens can hardly find Barbados on the map. She is a hugely commercially successful artist operating in a popular-cultural market dictated by US global musical tastes. At the same time, Rihanna is Barbados\u2019s honorary ambassador of youth and culture and has signed a multi-year deal to promote Barbados for the Barbados Tourism Authority. Moreover, local discussions surrounding Barbadian national pride, Victorian notions of female propriety and Christian ideas about decency which Rihanna\u2019s emergence and ascendancy have provoked, continue to capture the Barbadian public\u2019s imaginations and dominate the opinions expressed in their newspaper columns and call-in programmes\u201d<ref name=\"editor. 2015\"/> </blockquote>The diaspora citizen theory allows us to better understand the complexities associated with stars like Rihanna whose cultural influence has transcended national borders and created a complex relationship between the artist and the various cultural regions they are associated with.\n\n== Populations and estimated distribution ==\n\nAfrican diaspora populations include:\n* [[African Americans]], [[Afro-Caribbeans]], [[Black Canadians]] \u2013 descendants of enslaved [[West Africa]]ns brought to the [[United States]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[South America]] during the [[Atlantic slave trade]].\n* [[Zanj]] \u2013 descendants of [[Zanj]] slaves whose ancestors were brought to the [[Near East]] and other parts of Asia during the [[Arab slave trade]].<ref>{{cite news|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A6645-2004Jan10&notFound=true |title =A Legacy Hidden in Plain Sight|work =The Washington Post|date=11 January 2004|first = Theola |last =Labb\u017c |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514025929/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&contentId=A6645-2004Jan10&notFound=true|archivedate = 14 May 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Siddi]]s \u2013 descendants of [[Zanj]] slaves whose ancestors were brought to the [[Indian subcontinent]] ([[Pakistan]] and [[India]]).

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations\".<ref name= \"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\"/> It is important to note that \"the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers, thus as the researchers made it explicit: \"the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of variable socioeconomic strata, although ''likely to be leaning slightly towards the \"pardo\" group''\".<ref name=\"onlinelibrary.wiley.com\">{{cite journal |title = Genetic composition of Brazilian population samples based on a set of twenty-eight ancestry informative SNPs |doi = 10.1002/ajhb.20976 |pmid = 19639555 |volume = 22 |issue = 2 |year = 2010 |journal = Am.

Specifically, in 1492, [[Pedro Alonso Ni\u00f1o]], a black Spanish seafarer, piloted one of Columbus's ships. He returned in 1499, but did not settle. In the early 16th century, more Africans began to enter the population of the Spanish Caribbean colonies, sometimes as freedmen, but most often as enslaved servants and workers. Demand for African labour increased in the Caribbean because of the massive deaths among the [[Ta\u00edno]] and other indigenous populations, resulting primarily from [[Eurasia]]n infectious diseases to which they had no [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], as well as conflict with the Spanish, and harsh working conditions. By the mid-16th century, [[slave trading|slave trade]] from Africa to the Caribbean was so profitable that the Englishmen [[Francis Drake]] and [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] engaged in piracy and violated Spanish colonial laws, in order to forcibly transport approximately 1500 enslaved people from [[Sierra Leone]] to [[Hispaniola]] ([[Haiti]] and [[Dominican Republic]]).\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, European colonialism in the Caribbean became increasingly reliant on plantation slavery, so that, by the end of the 18th century, on many islands, enslaved [[Afro-Caribbeans]] far outnumbered their European masters.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Stephen D.

In 1804, Haiti, with what had been an overwhelmingly black slave population and leadership, became the second nation in the Americas to win independence from a European state and create a republic. Continuous waves of rebellion, such as the [[Baptist War]] led by [[Sam Sharpe]] in [[Jamaica]], created the conditions for the incremental abolition of slavery in the region, with Great Britain abolishing it in 1838. [[Cuba]] (under the Spanish Crown) was the last island to emancipate its slaves.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Afro-Caribbean people began to assert their cultural, economic and political rights on the world stage. The Jamaican [[Marcus Garvey]] formed the [[UNIA]] movement in the United States, continuing with [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]]'s [[n\u00e9gritude]] movement, which was intended to create a pan-African movement across national lines. From the 1960s, the former slave populations in the Caribbean began to win their independence from British colonial rule. They were pre-eminent in creating new cultural forms such as [[Calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae music]], and [[rastafari]]anism within the Caribbean. Beyond the region, a new Afro-Caribbean diaspora, including such figures as [[Stokely Carmichael]] and [[DJ Kool Herc]] in the United States, was influential in the creation of the [[black power]] and [[hip hop]] movements. Influential political theorists such as [[Walter Rodney]], [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] contributed to anti-colonial theory and movements in Africa, as well as cultural developments in Europe.\n\n=== North America ===\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|African Americans}}\n[[File:Majority Black Counties.PNG|alt=A map of the United States|thumb|A map of [[United States counties]] that have majority-black populations: although the African-American population is still predominantly in the [[Southern United States|South]], the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] created several black populations in [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Harlem]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Oakland]], and [[Washington, D.

These were primarily former slaves who had escaped to British lines for promised freedom during the Revolution.\n\nLater during the antebellum years, other individual African Americans escaped to Canada, mostly to locations in [[Southwestern Ontario]], via the [[Underground Railroad#Arrival in Canada|Underground Railroad]], a system supported by both blacks and whites to assist fugitive slaves. After achieving independence, northern states in the U.S. had begun to abolish slavery as early as 1793, but slavery was not abolished in the South until 1865, following the [[American Civil War]].\n\nBlack immigration to Canada in the twentieth century consisted mostly of Caribbean descent.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The African Diaspora in Canada: negotiating identity & belonging|last=Tettey|first=Wisdom J.|last2=Puplampu|first2=Korbla P.|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85109-700-5|location=Calgary, Alberta, Canada|pages=205}}</ref> As a result of the prominence of Caribbean immigration, the term \"African Canadian\", while sometimes used to refer to the minority of Canadian blacks who have direct African or African-American heritage, is ''not'' normally used to denote black Canadians.

However, in places like Brazil and the Dominican Republic, blackness is performed in more taboo ways than it is in, say, the United States. The idea behind [[Trey Ellis#Cultural Mulatto|Trey Ellis Cultural Mulatto]] comes into play as there are blurred lines between what is considered as black.\n\nIn [[Peru]], the African population was very mixed with the other white, Indian and mestizo population; so someone is identified as ''negro'' if he or she has visible African features. Some mestizos and whites have a degree of African admixture.\n\nIn [[Colombia]], the African slaves were first brought to work in the gold mines of the Department of Antioquia. After this was no longer a profitable business, these slaves slowly moved to the Pacific coast, where they have remained unmixed with the white or Indian population until today. The whole Department of Choc\u00f3 remains a black area. Mixture with white population happened mainly in the Caribbean coast, which is a mestizo area until today. There was also a greater mixture in the south-western departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca. In these mestizo areas the African culture has had a great influence.\n\n== Europe ==\n{{See also|Afro-European}}\nSome European countries make it illegal to collect demographic census information based on ethnicity or ancestry (e.g. France), but some others do query along racial lines (e.g. the UK).

These cores are optimized for low-cost and energy-efficient microcontrollers, which have been embedded in tens of billions of consumer devices.<ref>[http://www.arm.com/products/processors/cortex-m ARM Cortex-M website; arm.com]</ref>   The cores consist of the Cortex-M0, Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M1, Cortex-M3, Cortex-M4, Cortex-M7, Cortex-M23, Cortex-M33, Cortex-M35P, Cortex-M55.<ref name=\"M0-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M0+-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M1-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M3-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M4-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M7-TRM\"/><ref name=\"M23-TRM\"/>  The Cortex-M4 / M7 / M33 / M35P / M55 cores have an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]] silicon option, and when included in the silicon these cores are sometimes known as \"Cortex-Mx with FPU\" or \"Cortex-MxF\", where 'x' is the core number.\n\n==Overview==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:9px;\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Announced\n|-\n! Year !! Core\n|-\n| 2004 || [[#Cortex-M3|Cortex-M3]]\n|-\n| 2007 || [[#Cortex-M1|Cortex-M1]]\n|-\n| 2009 || [[#Cortex-M0|Cortex-M0]]\n|-\n| 2010 || [[#Cortex-M4|Cortex-M4]]\n|-\n| 2012 || [[#Cortex-M0+|Cortex-M0+]]\n|-\n| 2014 || [[#Cortex-M7|Cortex-M7]]\n|-\n| 2016 || [[#Cortex-M23|Cortex-M23]]\n|-\n| 2016 || [[#Cortex-M33|Cortex-M33]]\n|-\n| 2018 || [[#Cortex-M35P|Cortex-M35P]]\n|-\n| 2020 || [[#Cortex-M55|Cortex-M55]]\n|}\n{{See also|ARM architecture|List of ARM cores}}\n\nThe ARM Cortex-M family are ARM microprocessor cores which are designed for use in [[microcontroller]]s, [[ASIC]]s, [[application-specific integrated circuit#Application-specific standard product|ASSP]]s, [[FPGA]]s, and [[system on a chip|SoC]]s.  Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same.

A documentation package for ARM chips typically consists of a collection of documents from the IC manufacturer as well as the CPU core vendor ([[Arm Holdings]]).\n\nA typical top-down documentation tree is:\n\n;Documentation tree (top to bottom)\n# IC manufacturer website.\n# IC manufacturer marketing slides.\n# IC manufacturer datasheet for the exact physical chip.\n# IC manufacturer reference manual that describes common peripherals and aspects of a physical chip family.\n# ARM core website.\n# ARM core generic user guide.\n# ARM core technical reference manual.\n# ARM architecture reference manual.\n\nIC manufacturers have additional documents, such as: evaluation board user manuals, application notes, getting started guides, software library documents, errata, and more.

Cortex-M cores are commonly used as dedicated microcontroller chips, but also are \"hidden\" inside of SoC chips as power management controllers, I/O controllers, system controllers, touch screen controllers, smart battery controllers, and sensors controllers.\n\nThough 8-bit microcontrollers were very popular in the past, Cortex-M has slowly been chipping away at the 8-bit market as the prices of low-end Cortex-M chips have moved downward.  Cortex-M have become a popular replacements for 8-bit chips in applications that benefit from 32-bit math operations, and replacing older legacy ARM cores such as [[ARM7]] and [[ARM9]].\n\n===License===\n[[Arm Holdings]] neither manufactures nor sells CPU devices based on its own designs, but rather licenses the processor architecture to interested parties. Arm offers a variety of licensing terms, varying in cost and deliverables. To all licensees, Arm provides an integratable hardware description of the ARM core, as well as complete software development toolset and the right to sell manufactured [[silicon]] containing the ARM CPU.\n\n===Silicon customization===\nIntegrated Device Manufacturers (IDM) receive the ARM Processor [[Intellectual property|IP]] as [[Logic synthesis|synthesizable]] [[Register transfer level|RTL]] (written in [[Verilog]]). In this form, they have the ability to perform architectural level optimizations and extensions. This allows the manufacturer to achieve custom design goals, such as higher clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions (including floating point), optimizations for size, debug support, etc.  To determine which components have been included in a particular Arm CPU chip, consult the manufacturer datasheet and related documentation.\n\nSome of the silicon options for the Cortex-M cores are:\n* SysTick timer: A 24-bit system timer that extends the functionality of both the processor and the Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC). When present, it also provides an additional configurable priority SysTick interrupt.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/> Though the SysTick timer is optional, it is very rare to find a Cortex-M microcontroller without it.  If a Cortex-M33 microcontroller has the Security Extension option, then it has two SysTicks, one Secure and one Non-secure.\n* Bit-Band: Maps a complete word of memory onto a single bit in the bit-band region. For example, writing to an alias word will set or clear the corresponding bit in the bit-band region. This allows every individual bit in the bit-band region to be directly accessible from a word-aligned address. In particular, individual bits can be set, cleared, or toggled from C/C++ without performing a read-modify-write sequence of instructions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>  Though the bit-band is optional, it is less common to find a Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 microcontroller without it.  Some Cortex-M0 and Cortex-M0+ microcontrollers have bit-band. \n* Memory Protection Unit (MPU): Provides support for protecting regions of memory through enforcing privilege and access rules. It supports up to eight different regions, each of which can be split into a further eight equal-size sub-regions.<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"ARMv7-M-Manual\"/><ref name=\"AppNote179\"/>\n* Tightly-Coupled Memory (TCM): Low-latency RAM that is used to hold critical routines, data, stacks.  Other than cache, it is typically the fastest RAM in the microcontroller.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <big>ARM Cortex-M optional components</big>\n|-\n! ARM Core !!

Legacy cores allowed \"on-the-fly\" changing of the data [[endianness|endian]] mode.\n* [[Coprocessor|Co-processor]] were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n\nThe capabilities of the 32-bit ARM instruction set is duplicated in many ways by the Thumb-1 and Thumb-2 instruction sets, but some ARM features don't have a similar feature:\n* The SWP and SWPB (swap) ARM instructions don't have a similar feature in Cortex-M.\n\nThe 16-bit Thumb-1 instruction set has evolved over time since it was first released in the legacy [[ARM7|ARM7T]] cores with the ARMv4T architecture.  New Thumb-1 instructions were added as each legacy ARMv5 / ARMv6 / ARMv6T2 architectures were released. Some 16-bit Thumb-1 instructions were removed from the Cortex-M cores:\n* The \"BLX <immediate>\" instruction doesn't exist because it was used to switch from Thumb-1 to ARM instruction set.  The \"BLX <register>\" instruction is still available in the Cortex-M.\n* SETEND doesn't exist because on-the-fly switching of data endian mode is no longer supported.\n* Co-processor instructions were not supported on Cortex-M cores, until the silicon option was reintroduced in \"ARMv8-M Mainline\" for ARM Cortex-M33/M35P cores.\n* The SWI instruction was renamed to SVC, though the instruction binary coding is the same. However, the SVC handler code is different from the SWI handler code, because of changes to the exception models.\n\n==Cortex-M0==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1]] (most),<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2]] (some)\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n\nThe Cortex-M0 core is optimized for small silicon die size and use in the lowest price chips.\n\nKey features of the Cortex-M0 core are:<ref name=\"M0-TRM\">[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0432c/DDI0432C_cortex_m0_r0p0_trm.pdf Cortex-M0 r0p0 Technical Reference Manual; Arm Holdings.]</ref>\n* ARMv6-M architecture<ref name=\"ARMv6-M-Manual\"/>\n* 3-stage [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]\n* Instruction sets:\n** Thumb-1 (most), missing CBZ, CBNZ, IT\n** Thumb-2 (some), only BL, DMB, DSB, ISB, MRS, MSR\n** 32-bit hardware integer multiply with 32-bit result\n* 1 to 32 [[interrupt]]s, plus [[non-maskable interrupt|NMI]]\n\n'''Silicon options:'''\n* Hardware integer multiply speed: 1 or 32 cycles.\n\n===Chips===\nThe following microcontrollers are based on the Cortex-M0 core:\n* ABOV Semiconductor AC30M1x64\n* [[Cypress Semiconductor|Cypress]] PSoC 4000, 4100, 4100M, 4200, 4200DS, 4200L, 4200M \n* [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] [[Infineon XMC|XMC1100]], XMC1200, XMC1300, XMC1400, TLE984x\n*[[Dialog Semiconductor]] DA1458x, DA1468x\n* [[Nordic Semiconductor|Nordic]] [[nRF51]]\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC1100]], [[LPC1200]]\n* [[Nuvoton|nuvoTon]] NuMicro M0 Family\n* Sonix SN32F700\n* [[STMicroelectronics|ST]] [[STM32#STM32 F0|STM32 F0]]\n* [[Toshiba]] TX00\n* Vorago VA10800 (extreme temperature), VA10820 (radiation hardened)\n\nThe following chips have a Cortex-M0 as a secondary core:\n* [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] [[LPC4300]] (one Cortex-M4F + one Cortex-M0)\n* [[Texas Instruments]] SimpleLink Wireless MCUs CC1310 and CC2650 (one programmable Cortex-M3 + one Cortex-M0 network processor + one proprietary Sensor Controller Engine)\n\n==Cortex-M0+==\n{{Infobox CPU\n|name = Cortex-M0+\n|arch = [[ARM architecture#Thumb|Thumb-1 (most)]],<br/>[[ARM architecture#Thumb-2|Thumb-2 (some)]]\n|microarch = ARMv6-M\n}}\n[[File:Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board with KL25Z128VLK (ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU).JPG|thumb|right| [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] ([[Freescale]]) FRDM-KL25Z Board with KL25Z128VLK (Kinetis L)]]\nThe Cortex-M0+ is an optimized superset of the Cortex-M0.

In one such instance, the \"crowd\" (''ochlos''), \"the [[Jews]]\" and \"the multitude\" in some sources, were offered the choice to have either Barabbas or Jesus released from Roman custody.

It is derived ultimately from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] \u05d1\u05e8-\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0, ''Bar-abb\u00e2'', \"son of the father\". However, ''Abba'' has been found as a personal name in a 1st-century burial at [[Giv'at ha-Mivtar]], and it appears fairly often as a personal name in the [[Gemara]] section of the [[Talmud]], dating from AD 200\u2013400.<ref>Brown (1994), pp. 799-800.</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nAccording to Jewish historian [[Max Dimont]], the story of Barabbas as related in the gospels lacks credibility from the Roman standpoint, as it presents the Roman authority, Pontius Pilate, backed by overwhelming military might, being cowed by a small crowd of unarmed civilians into releasing a prisoner condemned to death for insurrection against the [[Roman Empire]].  A Roman governor who had done that could have faced execution himself.\n\nHowever, the Russian novelist [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], in his fictional portrayal of the crucifixion in the novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (c. 1940), creates a more compelling portrait of Pilate as a harassed and despondent provincial official. He imagines a conversation between Pilate and Caiaphas, the high priest of the Jerusalem temple, where the latter threatens Pilate that Jesus of Nazareth will inspire an uprising in Jerusalem if he is released. Pilate, bitter, frustrated, fatigued by a command that doesn't suit him, and ultimately dismissive of Jesus's na\u00efve utopianism, accepts to carry out the death sentence rather than worsten the ill-will of the local priesthood.<ref>Mikhail Bulgakov, ''The Master and Margarita'', ch. 2: \"Pontius Pilate\".</ref>\n\nSome ancient manuscripts of Matthew 27:16\u201317 give the full name of Barabbas as \"Jesus Barabbas\" and this was probably the name as originally written in the text.<ref name=Evans>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Craig A.|title=Matthew (New Cambridge Bible Commentary)|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521011068|page=453}}</ref> The early [[Church Fathers|church father]] [[Origen]] himself admits that he was troubled by the fact that his copies of the gospels gave Barabbas' name as \"Jesus Barabbas\", and he declared that it was impossible this bandit could have had such a holy name, so that \"Jesus\" must have been added to Barabbas's name by a heretic.<ref name=Dimont>{{cite book|last=Dimont|first=Max I.|title=Appointment in Jerusalem|date=1992|publisher=e-reads.com|isbn=978-1585865468}}</ref> \n\nBut the reverse is also possible, i.e. that later scribes, when copying the passage, removed the name \"Jesus\" from \"Jesus Barabbas\" to avoid dishonor to the name of Jesus the Messiah.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue|chapter=Who Changed the Text and Why?

For why would a Christian writer invent a similar name for a criminal, practically equating Christ with a criminal, if he were fictionalizing the story for a polemical or theological purpose?<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Barabbas-biblical-figure|title=Barabbas {{!}} Facts & Significance|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue|chapter=Who Changed the Text and Why?

Jesus, in this view, must have been the planner and leader of the Jewish nonviolent resistance to Pilate's plan to set up Roman Eagle standards on [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem's]] [[Temple Mount]]. The story of this successful resistance is told by [[Josephus]]&mdash;who does not say who the leader was, but [[Josephus on Jesus|does tell of Pilate's crucifixion of Jesus]] just two paragraphs later - though the authenticity of that passage has been disputed.<ref>Urrutia, Benjamin. \"Pilgrimage\", ''The Peaceable Table'' (October 2008)</ref>\n\nA minority of scholars including [[Stevan Davies]], [[Hyam Maccoby]], H.

It is derived ultimately from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] \u05d1\u05e8-\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0, ''Bar-abb\u00e2'', \"son of the father\". However, ''Abba'' has been found as a personal name in a 1st-century burial at [[Giv'at ha-Mivtar]], and it appears fairly often as a personal name in the [[Gemara]] section of the [[Talmud]], dating from AD 200\u2013400.<ref>Brown (1994), pp. 799-800.</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nAccording to Jewish historian [[Max Dimont]], the story of Barabbas as related in the gospels lacks credibility from the Roman standpoint, as it presents the Roman authority, Pontius Pilate, backed by overwhelming military might, being cowed by a small crowd of unarmed civilians into releasing a prisoner condemned to death for insurrection against the [[Roman Empire]].  A Roman governor who had done that could have faced execution himself.\n\nHowever, the Russian novelist [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], in his fictional portrayal of the crucifixion in the novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' (c. 1940), creates a more compelling portrait of Pilate as a harassed and despondent provincial official. He imagines a conversation between Pilate and Caiaphas, the high priest of the Jerusalem temple, where the latter threatens Pilate that Jesus of Nazareth will inspire an uprising in Jerusalem if he is released. Pilate, bitter, frustrated, fatigued by a command that doesn't suit him, and ultimately dismissive of Jesus's na\u00efve utopianism, accepts to carry out the death sentence rather than worsten the ill-will of the local priesthood.<ref>Mikhail Bulgakov, ''The Master and Margarita'', ch. 2: \"Pontius Pilate\".</ref>\n\nSome ancient manuscripts of Matthew 27:16\u201317 give the full name of Barabbas as \"Jesus Barabbas\" and this was probably the name as originally written in the text.<ref name=Evans>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Craig A.|title=Matthew (New Cambridge Bible Commentary)|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521011068|page=453}}</ref> The early [[Church Fathers|church father]] [[Origen]] himself admits that he was troubled by the fact that his copies of the gospels gave Barabbas' name as \"Jesus Barabbas\", and he declared that it was impossible this bandit could have had such a holy name, so that \"Jesus\" must have been added to Barabbas's name by a heretic.<ref name=Dimont>{{cite book|last=Dimont|first=Max I.|title=Appointment in Jerusalem|date=1992|publisher=e-reads.com|isbn=978-1585865468}}</ref> \n\nBut the reverse is also possible, i.e. that later scribes, when copying the passage, removed the name \"Jesus\" from \"Jesus Barabbas\" to avoid dishonor to the name of Jesus the Messiah.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue|chapter=Who Changed the Text and Why?

For why would a Christian writer invent a similar name for a criminal, practically equating Christ with a criminal, if he were fictionalizing the story for a polemical or theological purpose?<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Barabbas-biblical-figure|title=Barabbas {{!}} Facts & Significance|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=William|title=The Reliability of the New Testament: Bart Ehrman and Daniel Wallace in Dialogue|chapter=Who Changed the Text and Why?

Jesus, in this view, must have been the planner and leader of the Jewish nonviolent resistance to Pilate's plan to set up Roman Eagle standards on [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem's]] [[Temple Mount]]. The story of this successful resistance is told by [[Josephus]]&mdash;who does not say who the leader was, but [[Josephus on Jesus|does tell of Pilate's crucifixion of Jesus]] just two paragraphs later - though the authenticity of that passage has been disputed.<ref>Urrutia, Benjamin. \"Pilgrimage\", ''The Peaceable Table'' (October 2008)</ref>\n\nA minority of scholars including [[Stevan Davies]], Hyam Maccoby, H.
