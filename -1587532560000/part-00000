The show was produced by [[CBS Paramount Network Television]] and Junction Entertainment, with executive producers [[Jon Turteltaub]], [[Stephen Chbosky]], and [[Carol Barbee]]. It was shown in more than 30 countries.\n\n''Jericho'' ran on [[CBS]] from September 20, 2006, to March 25, 2008. It was cancelled after its first full season, because of poor ratings.

The series begins with a visible nuclear detonation of unknown origin in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. Despite initial belief that it was an accident, Dale Turner, one of the characters, receives a phone call from his mother in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The call is then cut out by the sound of a nuclear blast. Upon showing this to others, it is revealed that the bombings were deliberate. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government but an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.\n\nWhile the first few episodes are about restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power), built in New Bern's factory, for supplies for food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). Relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the New Bern [[sheriff]] eventually declares war, leading to the season's climax.\n\nSeveral themes regularly addressed in the show include the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.\n\nThe pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green (Jericho)|Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake had fled the town of Jericho five years earlier, when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. He briefly returns home to claim his inheritance, before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It is later revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack but how he obtained it and what side he is on remain anything but clear.\n\nGrey Anderson encounters a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) camp outside of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], where he learns that the attack on [[New York City]] was foiled by alert [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] who shot the bomber before he could detonate the nuclear bomb that he had in the back of a van. Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on board but [[Washington, D.C.]] has been bombed. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Diego]] and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that [[air traffic control]] is non-existent, a mushroom cloud is rising {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been seen towards [[Texas]].\n\nA radiation-burn victim walks into Jericho from Denver, leading a rescue party to Bear Lake but the 20 radiation-burn victims there are dead. Before the unnamed radiation-burn victim dies, while he is interrogated by Hawkins, it is revealed that he is an accomplice of Hawkins and that there is a traitor in the attack. In the season one finale, armed residents of New Bern attack Jericho with crude [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] made at the factories in New Bern. The mortar bombardment injure people in Jericho. Jake and Johnston Green along with Robert Hawkins lead a counter-attack on New Bern's forces outside of town, killing many of the attackers; Johnston Green is mortally wounded. Army units arrive to separate the combatants just as the season ends.\n\n===Second season===\n[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|Flag of the Allied States of America]]\nThe military forces of the new Allied States of America (ASA), which now govern most of what was formerly the [[Western United States]], except the independent Republic of [[Texas]], have restored order to Jericho and its hinterland, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normality returns to Jericho, the plot shifts away from day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.\n\nThe garrison commander of the ASA Army's newly established post in Jericho, Major Edward Beck, asks Jake to accept appointment as the Sheriff of Jericho and the county. Jake reluctantly accepts the appointment with reservations about the ASA government's intentions.\n\nKnown only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government, including the president and the secretary of defense of the new ASA government in Cheyenne. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, piece together the trail of evidence and bring the truth to light, before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.\n\nJericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], led by a [[Private military company|private security]] contracting firm, Ravenwood, owned by Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to and sponsors the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder and the embezzlement.\n\nJake can no longer tolerate the methods of Ravenwood and the ASA government in Jericho and leads an underground movement to remove them from power in the town. He is arrested by Major Beck and interrogated. Jake refuses to break and escapes with the help of his mother and other town residents. The citizens of the town rebel against the local ASA soldiers. All of this causes Major Beck, a decorated former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, to question his duty to a government that would treat its citizens the way the new ASA government is doing. He orders his men to stand down and return to their garrison.\n\nHawkins tries to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and after a brief chase, seizes the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes and the ASA military then transports the weapon to Cheyenne for safekeeping.\n\nHawkins makes contact with Jake and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic of Texas is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the [[Eastern United States]], which is led by the legitimate surviving United States government, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and the Allied States. Texas has not decided which government to back. The Texan ambassador in Cheyenne shelters Jake and Hawkins at his embassy. He informs his military forces at the embassy to tell the ASA forces outside the fence that any incursion into the embassy by ASA troops will be considered an act of war against the Republic of Texas. The ambassador manages to quickly smuggle Jake, Hawkins and the bomb to the Cheyenne airport. At the airport he secures a small diplomatic jet plane to carry Jake, Hawkins and the device to Texas. While they are ''en route'', two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Republic of Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence and Hawkins ominously intones that a [[second American Civil War]] was always coming and the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.\n\n===Third season===\n{{main|Jericho Season 3: Civil War}}\n{{Missing information |section |the plot |date=April 2020}}\nSeason 3 is not a television show, but a six-part comic book series \"from the minds\" of the original ''Jericho'' production team and written by the ''Jericho'' writing team.\n\nIn April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing. In his statement, Chbosky noted, \"you know [[William Morris Endeavor]] Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they've been talking to [[Netflix]] and you never know.

Are you in?\" I said, \"Absolutely, with one proviso: That first script back has to time-jump five years, and the world has devolved way lower than we could ever have imagined.\" And they were on board with it.

It is approximately 47 miles east of the Kansas/Colorado border (which would put it near the location of the real [[Colby, Kansas]]). However, a map (episode 3: Jericho is Ness City, Kansas on the map) in the series seems to show Jericho near the junctions of [[Interstate 70|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]].  That would place it near the real [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]]. Jericho is 90 miles west of the also fictional Rogue River, Kansas, and around 330 miles from the real [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. New Bern, Kansas is a neighboring fictional town which starts a war with Jericho in the wake of the national destruction. Jericho is served by one state highway and the (fictional) Cedar Run Road.\n\nThe city's population is mentioned to be almost 5,000 as mentioned in season 1 Ep. 2 \"Fallout\" (1,000 in 1957). But after the great war between New Bern and Jericho, the population was reduced to 3,000. The city has one grocery store, owned by Gracie Leigh ([[Beth Grant]]).\n\nJericho is run by two mayors throughout the series. Johnston Green ([[Gerald McRaney]]) was the mayor at the show opening and for most of season one, but loses the election in the show. Gray Anderson ([[Michael Gaston]]), the other electoral candidate, wins the election in the show.\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of \"a little character drama\" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads (film)|Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters. Thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.\n\nOne of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, \"[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs.\" Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of \"[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it.\" Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the \"best of people,\" and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the \"worst of people,\" and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing \"lots of inspiration\" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070307/http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Brad Beyer on Set.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Brad Beyer]], who plays [[Stanley Richmond]], on the set of ''Jericho'']]\n''Jericho'' is set in northwestern Kansas, but the series was filmed in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\">{{cite web|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=16239|title=A Visit to the Town of Jericho|publisher=Coming Soon Media|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php|title=Insiders' Commentary: Pilot Episode#2|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608165720/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> The pilot and all episodes involving New Bern, Kansas, were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fillmoregazette.com/node/701|publisher=The Fillmore Gazette|date=March 8, 2007|title=Jericho in Fillmore this week}}</ref> Filming also occurred in [[Pasadena, California]], including in front of the city hall.

The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the \"other survivors\" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and \"webisode\" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.\n\nCBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of \"prequel\" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.\n\n===''Beyond Jericho''===\n{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}\nThe first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.\n\n===''Countdown''===\nStarting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title= Jericho on CBS - Countdown|access-date= 2006-10-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061102023830/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|archive-date= 2006-11-02|url-status= dead}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, and consist primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].\n\nThe mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS' 8-episode plot summary reads: \"A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video.\" The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The \"shadowy military unit\" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.\n\n''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''JenningsandRall.com''===\nCreated for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series.

The series begins with a visible nuclear detonation of unknown origin in [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]. Despite initial belief that it was an accident, Dale Turner, one of the characters, receives a phone call from his mother in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The call is then cut out by the sound of a nuclear blast. Upon showing this to others, it is revealed that the bombings were deliberate. Problems are compounded by loss of power and modern communications, effectively isolating Jericho. Later, power is restored to Jericho by what is alluded to as the efforts of the U.S. government but an [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from an unknown source disables all electronics.\n\nWhile the first few episodes are about restoring life after the attacks, about halfway through the season some of the citizens meet with citizens of a nearby town, New Bern. At first, relations are established, resulting in a trade of windmills (for power), built in New Bern's factory, for supplies for food from Jericho's farms and salt from its mine (neither of which New Bern could supply on its own). Relations sour as New Bern scapegoats Jericho for its problems and the New Bern [[sheriff]] eventually declares war, leading to the season's climax.\n\nSeveral themes regularly addressed in the show include the gathering of information, community identity, public order, limited resources, the value of family, hardships of fatherhood and internal and external threats. The show also features several mysteries involving the backgrounds of major characters, the perpetrators of the attack and the extent of damage to the United States and its government.\n\nThe pivotal character in this story is [[Jake Green (Jericho)|Jake Green]], the 32-year-old son of Mayor [[Johnston Green]]. Jake had fled the town of Jericho five years earlier, when he became mixed up with the wrong people and was involved in questionable activity. He briefly returns home to claim his inheritance, before being stranded by the catastrophe. After a somewhat awkward return home and a tense reunion with his father, Jake steps up to become a leader in Jericho, fighting to protect the town and its citizens. As the people of Jericho struggle to survive in a changed world, most remain unaware that one of the newest residents, [[Robert Hawkins (Jericho character)|Robert Hawkins]], knows a lot more about the attacks than he is letting on. It is later revealed that he is in possession of an unexploded nuclear bomb that was supposed to be used in the attack but how he obtained it and what side he is on remain anything but clear.\n\nGrey Anderson encounters a [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) camp outside of [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], where he learns that the attack on [[New York City]] was foiled by alert [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] who shot the bomber before he could detonate the nuclear bomb that he had in the back of a van. Mayor Green reports that the NYPD captured the van in New York with a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb on board but [[Washington, D.C.]] has been bombed. On the way back from the FEMA camp, Anderson's car is stolen by 12 looters and he is forced to walk home to Jericho. Anderson also reports that Lawrence, Kansas has been attacked. Robert Hawkins receives a morse code message on a ham radio stating that Denver, Atlanta, [[Chicago]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Diego]] and several more cities not shown on screen have been attacked. A black box flight data recorder that Jake recovers from a crashed airliner indicates that [[air traffic control]] is non-existent, a mushroom cloud is rising {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere and that flashes have also been seen towards [[Texas]].\n\nA radiation-burn victim walks into Jericho from Denver, leading a rescue party to Bear Lake but the 20 radiation-burn victims there are dead. Before the unnamed radiation-burn victim dies, while he is interrogated by Hawkins, it is revealed that he is an accomplice of Hawkins and that there is a traitor in the attack. In the season one finale, armed residents of New Bern attack Jericho with crude [[Mortar_(weapon)|mortars]] made at the factories in New Bern. The mortar bombardment injure people in Jericho. Jake and Johnston Green along with Robert Hawkins lead a counter-attack on New Bern's forces outside of town, killing many of the attackers; Johnston Green is mortally wounded. Army units arrive to separate the combatants just as the season ends.\n\n===Second season===\n[[File:Allied States of America flag (Jericho).svg|thumb|Flag of the Allied States of America]]\nThe military forces of the new Allied States of America (ASA), which now govern most of what was formerly the [[Western United States]], except the independent Republic of [[Texas]], have restored order to Jericho and its hinterland, putting an abrupt end to the conflict between Jericho and its rival town, New Bern. As a sense of normality returns to Jericho, the plot shifts away from day-to-day survival to life and political intrigue under the ASA government.\n\nThe garrison commander of the ASA Army's newly established post in Jericho, Major Edward Beck, asks Jake to accept appointment as the Sheriff of Jericho and the county. Jake reluctantly accepts the appointment with reservations about the ASA government's intentions.\n\nKnown only to Hawkins and a select few, the September attacks were neither a foreign nor domestic terrorist act but a conspiracy of unknown perpetrators within the highest level of the former U.S. government, including the president and the secretary of defense of the new ASA government in Cheyenne. Hawkins must calculate his every move to avoid capture, piece together the trail of evidence and bring the truth to light, before the conspiracy's mastermind buries it forever.\n\nJericho's residents deal with the reality of the new ASA government based in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]]. Welcomed as saviors, the government's military and mercenary agents transform life in Jericho into a repressive [[police state]], led by a [[Private military company|private security]] contracting firm, Ravenwood, owned by Jennings & Rall, which has major ties to and sponsors the leaders of the ASA government. When a Ravenwood contractor kills Bonnie, a deaf farm girl from the outskirts of Jericho, to conceal his embezzlement, the town is put on the edge of revolt as Jake and the deputies protect Mimi, the only witness to Bonnie's murder and the embezzlement.\n\nJake can no longer tolerate the methods of Ravenwood and the ASA government in Jericho and leads an underground movement to remove them from power in the town. He is arrested by Major Beck and interrogated. Jake refuses to break and escapes with the help of his mother and other town residents. The citizens of the town rebel against the local ASA soldiers. All of this causes Major Beck, a decorated former [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, to question his duty to a government that would treat its citizens the way the new ASA government is doing. He orders his men to stand down and return to their garrison.\n\nHawkins tries to transport the bomb to his contacts in the reborn [[Republic of Texas]]. The ASA military is tipped off and after a brief chase, seizes the weapon. Hawkins narrowly escapes and the ASA military then transports the weapon to Cheyenne for safekeeping.\n\nHawkins makes contact with Jake and the two travel to Cheyenne, where they retake the bomb from J&R contractors. Hawkins is wounded in a brief gun battle. The two make it to the Republic of Texas embassy in Cheyenne with the only undetonated bomb (in ASA territory) from the September attacks. The ASA's military is right behind them. The Republic of Texas is considered the [[swing state]] in the struggle for power between the [[Eastern United States]], which is led by the legitimate surviving United States government, now governed from [[Columbus, Ohio]] and the Allied States. Texas has not decided which government to back. The Texan ambassador in Cheyenne shelters Jake and Hawkins at his embassy. He informs his military forces at the embassy to tell the ASA forces outside the fence that any incursion into the embassy by ASA troops will be considered an act of war against the Republic of Texas. The ambassador manages to quickly smuggle Jake, Hawkins and the bomb to the Cheyenne airport. At the airport he secures a small diplomatic jet plane to carry Jake, Hawkins and the device to Texas. While they are ''en route'', two ASA [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle|F-15]] fighters intercept Jake and Hawkins and order them to turn around or be shot down. When Jake refuses to be escorted back to Cheyenne, the two jets drop back to open fire. Suddenly, two Republic of Texas [[United States Air National Guard|Air National Guard]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] fighters appear and shoot down the ASA planes. Jake and Hawkins make it to Texas with the evidence and Hawkins ominously intones that a [[second American Civil War]] was always coming and the two of them have made history by giving the United States a fighting chance in the war to come.\n\n===Third season===\n{{main|Jericho Season 3: Civil War}}\n{{Missing information |section |the plot |date=April 2020}}\nSeason 3 is not a television show, but a six-part comic book series \"from the minds\" of the original ''Jericho'' production team and written by the ''Jericho'' writing team.\n\nIn April 2013, ''Jericho'' creator Stephen Chbosky revealed during a chat with Nerdacy that talks about a live-action season 3 remain ongoing. In his statement, Chbosky noted, \"you know [[William Morris Endeavor]] Agency, who represents me, executive producer Jon Turteltaub and many other people, and they've been talking to [[Netflix]] and you never know.

It is approximately 47 miles east of the Kansas/Colorado border (which would put it near the location of the real [[Colby, Kansas]]). However, a map (episode 3: Jericho is Ness City, Kansas on the map) in the series seems to show Jericho near the junctions of [[Interstate 70|I-70]] and [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]].  That would place it near the real [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]]. Jericho is 90 miles west of the also fictional Rogue River, Kansas, and around 330 miles from the real [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]]. New Bern, Kansas is a neighboring fictional town which starts a war with Jericho in the wake of the national destruction. Jericho is served by one state highway and the (fictional) Cedar Run Road.\n\nThe city's population is mentioned to be almost 5,000 as mentioned in season 1 Ep. 2 \"Fallout\" (1,000 in 1957). But after the great war between New Bern and Jericho, the population was reduced to 3,000. The city has one grocery store, owned by Gracie Leigh ([[Beth Grant]]).\n\nJericho is run by two mayors throughout the series. Johnston Green ([[Gerald McRaney]]) was the mayor at the show opening and for most of season one, but loses the election in the show. Gray Anderson ([[Michael Gaston]]), the other electoral candidate, wins the election in the show.\n\n==Production==\n===Early development===\nThe series originated as a feature film idea of co-creators [[Jonathan E. Steinberg|Jonathan Steinberg]] and Josh Schaer: a [[post-apocalyptic]] plot set amidst the trappings of \"a little character drama\" movie, in the vein of ''[[The Day After]]'', ''[[Threads (film)|Threads]]'', and ''[[Testament (1983 film)|Testament]]''. However, they soon realized that a two- or two-and-a-half-hour-long film would still not carry the necessary length they felt such a concept required to properly explore the setting and the characters. Thus, Schaer and Steinberg decided to re-conceive the entire project as a television series, producing a treatment out of the original feature screenplay. Director Jon Turteltaub and producer [[Carol Barbee]] then entered the picture, the pair having pitched the project to them. Turteltaub soon commissioned writer Stephen Chbosky to pen the pilot teleplay based upon Schaer and Steinberg's series treatment.\n\nOne of Chbosky's major contributions to the structure of the series was the introduction of a greater feminine element to the storyline, opining that, \"[We] could use some girls, a little kissing, and some laughs.\" Another significant developmental influence were the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]], and the sense of \"[being] a spectator to a disaster, while not quite being part of it.\" Co-creator Steinberg in particular felt that after 9/11, the United States saw some of the \"best of people,\" and after Hurricane Katrina, some of the \"worst of people,\" and sought to include both in the fabric of ''Jericho'', with Katrina providing \"lots of inspiration\" for the show's overall premise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html|title=Paley Fest - Jericho |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070307/http://tv.ign.com/articles/773/773164p1.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 December 2007 |access-date=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Filming locations===\n[[File:Brad Beyer on Set.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Brad Beyer]], who plays [[Stanley Richmond]], on the set of ''Jericho'']]\n''Jericho'' is set in northwestern Kansas, but the series was filmed in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\">{{cite web|url= https://www.comingsoon.net/news/tvnews.php?id=16239|title=A Visit to the Town of Jericho|publisher=Coming Soon Media|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php|title=Insiders' Commentary: Pilot Episode#2|publisher=CBS|accessdate=2007-06-21 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070608165720/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/videos.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> The pilot and all episodes involving New Bern, Kansas, were filmed in [[Fillmore, California]].<ref name=\"VanNuysFillmore\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fillmoregazette.com/node/701|publisher=The Fillmore Gazette|date=March 8, 2007|title=Jericho in Fillmore this week}}</ref> Filming also occurred in [[Pasadena, California]], including in front of the city hall.

The television program gave the web address for the online companion. ''Beyond Jericho'' was to feature the \"other survivors\" of the nuclear attacks. According to Barbee, the story was intended to be unique to the site, but as the season of ''Jericho'' progressed, the online story would dovetail into the episodes themselves. However, the site and \"webisode\" are now unavailable, having been removed from the CBS website before the second episode of the TV show was broadcast.\n\nCBS since decided to scrap the current webisode storyline, and instead released a new series of \"prequel\" webisodes named ''Countdown'' that take place before the first explosion. Each of these new webisodes appeared concurrently with the broadcast of new episodes during season 1, and showed Robert Hawkins gathering information before the attack.\n\n===''Beyond Jericho''===\n{{Main|Beyond Jericho}}\nThe first installment of ''Beyond Jericho'' began with an unknown man calling someone on a cell phone, requesting a ransom of $1.2 million for a woman he kidnapped. He then disappears underground through a metal trap door. While climbing down, he hears and feels a bang, but thinks nothing of it. After conversing with an associate about their next plans, he picks the woman up and climbs back up to the roof. When he opens the door, it's surrounded by rubble. The entire city around them has been destroyed. Shortly after, rubble falls through the trap door. With the cell phone (apparently actually the victim's cell phone) dead, and assuming that the man's associate is dead as well in the collapse, they start to climb through the rubble to find out what happened. Nearby, a hand with a surgical glove on emerges from the rubble, as the vignette ends.\n\n===''Countdown''===\nStarting on October 26, ''Beyond Jericho'' was replaced by ''Countdown'', which documents Robert Hawkins' efforts to learn as much as possible about the effects of nuclear bombs before he moved to Jericho.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|title= Jericho on CBS - Countdown|access-date= 2006-10-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061102023830/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/digital.php|archive-date= 2006-11-02|url-status= dead}}</ref> The webisodes do not feature any of the regular characters, and consist primarily of Hawkins, draped in shadows, watching mini-[[Documentary film|documentaries]].\n\nThe mini-documentaries feature expert interviews about the effects of a nuclear attack. They are only minimally connected to each episode's plot. For instance, CBS' 8-episode plot summary reads: \"A shadowy military unit bursts into the chamber Hawkins has just vacated. On his computer, they find a video.\" The video was a short documentary about FEMA's response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] and their use of [[paramilitary|paramilitaries]]. The \"shadowy military unit\" then patiently waits until the documentary ends to resume its search for Hawkins.\n\n''Countdown'''s sponsor, [[AT&T]], is heavily promoted in the series using [[product placement]]. Nearly all dialog takes place as [[SMS]] messages on an AT&T cellular phone, and a full-screen AT&T logo appears in every episode when Hawkins views the expert interviews. This web-based programming is not accessible from outside of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===''JenningsandRall.com''===\nCreated for the Tom Tooman game, JenningsandRall.com is the purported website of Jennings & Rall, the corporate giant which plays an increasingly prominent role in the second season of the series. The site contains a wealth of information about the company's post-holocaust global operations, with significant hints regarding events in the show.\n\nOn November 1, 2008, the domain name jenningsandrall.com expired.\n\n===''Tom Tooman''===\n''Tom Tooman'' is an [[alternate reality game]] that CBS ran in conjunction with ''Jericho'', beginning in August 2007. The game began with a cryptic letter posted on a website, supposedly from a Tom Tooman of [[Lame Deer, Montana]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20538|title= Tom Tooman discussion on Unfiction.com|access-date= 2008-03-26|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080119214904/http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=20538|archive-date= 2008-01-19|url-status= dead}}</ref> This letter was accompanied by a series of [[bar codes]], some with decimal numbers and others with [[Maya numerals|Mayan numbers]]. These numbers were used to create an [[IP address]] for a second website. More clues were released, as well as a [[blog]] on the CBS website connecting the game with ''Jericho''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/community/blogs/tom_tooman/|title=Tom Tooman blog on CBS.com}}</ref> The game abruptly ended when the series was cancelled, with no closure offered.

She was the only child of James Eldridge [[Cassidy (surname)|Cassidy]] (1898\u20131957), the town iceman (later a grocer), and Edith (n\u00e9e Grisham) Cassidy (1901\u20131968), a nurse. Her family moved to [[Hope, Arkansas]] when she was a [[toddler]]. During her high school years, she worked as a waitress at a local restaurant. Following her graduation from high school, Virginia moved to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], to study to be a nurse like her mother. During her training in Shreveport, she met her first husband, [[William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.]], whom she married in a civil ceremony in 1943, just before he shipped out for [[World War II]] military duty. Upon completion of her training, she returned to [[Hope, Arkansas]]. When her husband was discharged, he picked her up and they moved for four months to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].\n\nShe moved back to her parents' house while she and William were in the process of getting a new home in the Hope area. While William was on his way back to Hope, he was killed in an automobile accident, three months before [[Bill Clinton]]'s birth. Virginia later spent time in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] training to be a nurse anesthetist. In 1950, Virginia married car salesman [[Roger Clinton Sr.]], the father of the second of her two boys, [[Roger Clinton Jr.|Roger Jr.]] Clinton was an alcoholic and was physically and mentally abusive to Virginia and her boys. He did not adopt Bill, but Bill took his surname legally in 1962. He told his mother that it would be easier if they all had the same last name. Roger Sr. and Virginia divorced in 1962 but remarried each other a few months later.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Last years==\nFollowing Roger's death from [[cancer]] in 1967, Virginia Clinton married hairdresser [[Jeff Dwire]] in 1969; he subsequently died of complications of [[diabetes]] in 1974. On January 17, 1982, she married Richard Kelley (1915\u20132007), an executive at a food distribution brokerage firm. Their marriage lasted until her death on January 6, 1994 from complications of [[breast cancer]], at the age of 70, at her home in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]]. She died a year after [[Bill Clinton|her son]] became the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. She is buried alongside her first husband [[William Jefferson Blythe Jr.|William J.

It will be premiered on March 30, 2020. It was the first ''asadora'' to be recorded in [[4K resolution|4K]], and the first since ''Musume to Watashi'' to be broadcast in only five 15-minute episodes per week Monday through Friday, with omnibus airings on Saturday mornings instead of a fresh episode.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1909, a long-awaited baby boy was born to a family which has run a dry goods store for generations in Fukushima Prefecture. He would later become the talented composer Yuichi Koyama who wrote many famous songs. Although young Yuichi was brought up as the heir of the business, he was rather dreamy and considered a child with no redeeming traits by the people around him. However, when he encountered music, it sparked overflowing happiness and unleashed his liberal gift in composing music through self-study. As a youth, young naive Yuichi secretly put his name down for an overseas songwriting competition. This would change his destiny. He won runner-up for the song he entered for the competition. As a result, he got to know a female student who wanted to be a singer. Despite the long distance between them \u2013 Fukushima and Toyohashi \u2013 the two of them tied the knot. When they came to Tokyo, they met all sorts of people and weathered a dark period to produce a number of hit songs. However, war broke out and Yuichi had to compose wartime songs at the army\u2019s request. It pained him that young men died in battle after singing the songs he had written. After the war, the country began to recover amid the chaos. The couple made a new era of music in an attempt to encourage the wounded through the power of music.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n=== Koyama's family ===\n\n* [[Masataka Kubota]] as Y\u016bichi Koyama (based on

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the City and Borough had a population of 31,276. In 2018, the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,113, making it the second most populous city in [[Alaska]] after [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>  Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from [[Quebec]], [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]], though the place was for a time called ''Harrisburg'' (after Juneau's co-prospector, [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]]) and then Rockwell(in honor of a Navy Commander). The Tlingit name of the town is {{lang|tli|Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni}} (\"Base of the Flounder's River,\" {{lang|tli|dz\u00e1nti}} 'flounder,' {{lang|tli|\u2013k\u02bci}} 'base,' {{lang|tli|h\u00e9en}} 'river'), and [[Auke Bay]] just north of Juneau proper is called {{lang|tli|\u00c1ak'w}} (\"Little lake,\" {{lang|tli|\u00e1a}} 'lake,' {{lang|tli|-k\u02bc}} 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The [[Taku River]], just south of Juneau, was named after the cold {{lang|tli|t'aakh}} wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\nJuneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a ''de facto'' island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's being on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging {{convert|16|ft|m|0}}, below steep mountains about {{convert|3500|ft|m|-2}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} high. Atop these mountains is the [[Juneau Icefield]], a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the [[Mendenhall Glacier]] and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\nThe [[Alaska State Capitol]] in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] and [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]]. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Taku.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913]]\n\nLong before European settlement in the Americas, the [[Gastineau Channel]] was a favorite fishing ground for  the [[Auke Indians|Auke]] (''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'') and [[Taku Indians|Taku]] tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The ''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'' had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season, and celebrated this bounty.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]], have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea. They continue to gather clams, gumboots, grass and sea urchins here, as well as tree bark for medicinal uses.<ref name=\"nrhp\"/> The city and state supported [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]] in documenting the 78-acre site, and in August 2016 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. \"It is the first traditional cultural property in Southeast Alaska to be placed on the register.\"<ref name=\"nrhp\">[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 ICTMN Staff, \"Indian Point Goes on National Register of Historic Places\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000125/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 |date=August 21, 2016 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 18 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref><ref name=\"phu\">[http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection Lisa Phu, \"Feds designate Juneau's Indian Point as sacred, worthy of protection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820155548/http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection |date=August 20, 2016 }}, ''Juneau Empire,'' 16 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref>\n\nDescendants of these indigenous cultures include the [[Tlingit people]]. Native cultures have rich artistic traditions expressed in carving, weaving, orating, singing, and dancing. Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] of Southeast Alaska.\n\n===European encounters===\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was [[Joseph Whidbey]], master of the ''[[HMS Discovery (1789)|Discovery]]'' during [[George Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver Expedition|1791\u201395 expedition]]. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel. He later recorded seeing the channel again, this time from the west. He said it was unnavigable, being filled with ice.<ref name=\"Vancouver\">{{cite book| last1 = Vancouver| first1 = George| last2= Vancouver| first2= John| title = A voyage of discovery to the North Pacific ocean, and round the world| publisher = J.

In 1880, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] mining engineer [[George Pilz]] offered a reward to any local Native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local Native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However,Pilz sent [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]] and [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]] back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book Alaska Days with John Muir, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Juneau City, 1887.jpg|thumb|Juneau City in 1887]]\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first [[European American]] settlement founded in this territory after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]].\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris.  On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after [[prospecting|prospector]] Joe Juneau.<ref name=Spencer>{{Cite book |author=Arthur C.

It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the [[Tlingit language]] in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church.

The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\nMajor mining operations in the [[Juneau mining district]] prior to World War II included the [[Treadwell gold mine|Treadwell Mine]], [[Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company|The Alaska-Juneau Mine]], and [[Alaska-Gastineau Mine]].\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.<ref name=\":0\" /> Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]]. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in [[1950 United States Census|1950]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. [[World War I]] delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco architectural style]]. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by [[James Knox Taylor]] in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is {{convert|14400|sqft|m2}}. It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] became the first president to visit Alaska. Harding visited the Governor's Mansion while Territorial Governor [[Scott Bone]], who was appointed by Harding, was in office. Harding spoke from the porch of the mansion explaining his policies and met with attendees.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], more than 50 Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans residing in Juneau were [[internment of Japanese Americans|evacuated to the internment camps inland]] as a result of [[Executive Order 9066]]\u2014which authorized the forced removal of all ethnic Japanese away from their homes and businesses on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. The removal of Juneau's Japanese community during the war was later commemorated known as the ''[[Empty Chair Memorial]]'' in July 2014 during a dedication ceremony at the neighborhood of Capital School Park in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Empty Chair Project recognizes Juneau's Japanese WWII internees | url=https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | author=Jeremy Hsieh | date=July 13, 2014 | publisher=[[KTOO (FM)|KTOO]] | accessdate=July 8, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709022307/https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | archive-date=July 9, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Atwood]], then publisher of the ''[[Anchorage Times]]'' and an Anchorage \"booster,\" was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], a town {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]]. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.<ref>The Associated Press.

In 2005, the [[cruise ship]] industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise outlook for 2005 shows growth|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|accessdate=November 15, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416002456/http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|archive-date=April 16, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>  While cruise ships provide an economic boost to segments of the economy, not all locals are appreciative.  The Juneau Public Library, built atop a parking garage along South Franklin Street near the [[Red Dog Saloon]], was designed to take advantage of the view of and across Gastineau Channel.  This view is often blocked by docking cruise ships, which have become so large that they tower over the five-story structure.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan.  The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries.

The JUMP Society hosts screenings of locally made short films two times a year.\n\nDowntown Juneau has many art galleries that participate in the monthly First Friday Art Walk and annual Gallery Walk held in the first week of December. The Juneau Arts & Humanities Council coordinates events and operates the Juneau Arts & Culture Center, which features a community center, gallery and lobby shop. The [[University of Alaska Southeast]] Campus offers lectures, concerts, and theater performances.

The remaining six members are elected by [[single-member district]]s: two districts have been defined by the Assembly, as of its last redistricting in 2003:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|title=CBJ Assembly Districts|date=June 30, 2012|work=juneau.org|publisher=Office of the City and Borough of Juneau Clerk|accessdate=April 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831055407/http://www.juneau.org/clerk/elections/documents/Ord_2003-15_amended_assembly_districts_2012_000.pdf|archive-date=August 31, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:60%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 1 precincts\n** [[Douglas, Alaska|Douglas]]\n** Juneau No. 1\n** Juneau No. 2\n** Juneau No. 3\n** [[Juneau International Airport|Juneau Airport]]\n** [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]]\n** [[Douglas Island|North Douglas]]\n| style=\"width:30%;\"|\n* District 2 precincts\n** [[Auke Bay, Alaska|Auke Bay]]\n** [[Out the road|Lynn Canal]]\n** [[Mendenhall Valley]] No. 1\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 2\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 3\n** Mendenhall Valley No. 4\n|} They hire a professional city manager to handle daily affairs.\n\nThese districts are nearly aligned with the boundaries of the 31st and 32nd election districts that were established by the state.  The main difference is that the 32nd District includes communities outside the CBJ: [[Gustavus, Alaska|Gustavus]], [[Kupreanof, Alaska|Kupreanof]], [[Petersburg, Alaska|Petersburg]], [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] and [[Tenakee Springs, Alaska|Tenakee Springs]].  The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during [[redistricting]] in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].  The 31st District is currently represented in the House by Democrat [[Andi Story]], who has been in office since 2018.  The 32nd District is represented by Democrat [[Sara Hannan]].\n\nCombined, these two election districts form [[Alaska Senate]] District Q. That seat is held by Democrat [[Dennis Egan]], a former Juneau mayor who has been in office since 2009. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; margin:15px\"\n|+ '''Presidential Election Results for the City and Borough of Juneau 2004\u20132008'''<ref>\"2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska\".

A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau.  The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from [[Southcentral Alaska]] to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the [[Alaska State Capitol]], which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the [[Alaska Legislative Council|Legislative Affairs Agency]].  These buildings were named for former legislators [[Terry Miller (politician)|Terry Miller]] and Thomas B. Stewart.  Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the [[1st Alaska State Legislature]]. He later served in Juneau's [[Alaska Superior Court]] judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of [[History of Alaska|Alaska's history]].\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along [[Gold Creek (Juneau, Alaska)|Gold Creek]] near its mouth and a short distance east of the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]], the building houses numerous federal agencies, the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]], and Juneau's main [[United States Postal Service|post office]]. It was designed by [[Linn A. Forrest]] and constructed in 1966.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the City and Borough had a population of 31,276. In 2018, the population estimate from the United States Census Bureau was 32,113, making it the second most populous city in [[Alaska]] after [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>  Juneau experiences a daily influx of roughly 6,000 people from visiting cruise ships between the months of May and September.\n\nThe city is named after a gold prospector from [[Quebec]], [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]], though the place was for a time called ''Rockwell'' and then ''Harrisburg'' (after Juneau's co-prospector, [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]]). The Tlingit name of the town is {{lang|tli|Dz\u00e1ntik'i H\u00e9eni}} (\"Base of the Flounder's River,\" {{lang|tli|dz\u00e1nti}} 'flounder,' {{lang|tli|\u2013k\u02bci}} 'base,' {{lang|tli|h\u00e9en}} 'river'), and [[Auke Bay]] just north of Juneau proper is called {{lang|tli|\u00c1ak'w}} (\"Little lake,\" {{lang|tli|\u00e1a}} 'lake,' {{lang|tli|-k\u02bc}} 'diminutive') in Tlingit. The [[Taku River]], just south of Juneau, was named after the cold {{lang|tli|t'aakh}} wind, which occasionally blows down from the mountains.\n\nJuneau is unique among U.S. capitals in that there are no roads connecting the city to the rest of the state. Honolulu, Hawaii, is the only other state capital not connected by road to the rest of North America. The absence of a road network is due to the extremely rugged terrain surrounding the city. This in turn makes Juneau a ''de facto'' island city in terms of transportation, since all goods coming in and out must go by plane or boat, in spite of the city's being on the Alaskan mainland. Downtown Juneau sits at sea level, with tides averaging {{convert|16|ft|m|0}}, below steep mountains about {{convert|3500|ft|m|-2}} to {{convert|4000|ft|m|-2}} high. Atop these mountains is the [[Juneau Icefield]], a large ice mass from which about 30 glaciers flow; two of these, the [[Mendenhall Glacier]] and the Lemon Creek Glacier, are visible from the local road system. The Mendenhall glacier has been gradually retreating; its front face is declining in width and height.\n\nThe [[Alaska State Capitol]] in downtown Juneau was built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, the federal courthouse and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature and many other territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains the home of the [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] and the offices of the [[List of Governors of Alaska|governor]] and [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Alaska|lieutenant governor]]. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Taku.jpg|thumb|right|Chief Anotklosh of the Taku tribe, circa 1913]]\n\nLong before European settlement in the Americas, the [[Gastineau Channel]] was a favorite fishing ground for  the [[Auke Indians|Auke]] (''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'') and [[Taku Indians|Taku]] tribes, who had inhabited the surrounding area for thousands of years. The ''A'akw Kw\u00e1an'' had a village and burying ground here. In the 21st century it is known as Indian Point. They annually harvested herring during the spawning season, and celebrated this bounty.\n\nSince the late 20th century, the A'akw Kw\u00e1an, together with the [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]], have resisted European-American development of Indian Point, including proposals by the [[National Park Service]] and the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA). They consider it sacred territory, both because of the burying ground and the importance of the point in their traditions of gathering sustenance from the sea. They continue to gather clams, gumboots, grass and sea urchins here, as well as tree bark for medicinal uses.<ref name=\"nrhp\"/> The city and state supported [[Sealaska Heritage Institute]] in documenting the 78-acre site, and in August 2016 it was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. \"It is the first traditional cultural property in Southeast Alaska to be placed on the register.\"<ref name=\"nrhp\">[http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 ICTMN Staff, \"Indian Point Goes on National Register of Historic Places\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821000125/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/08/18/indian-point-goes-national-register-historic-places-165498 |date=August 21, 2016 }}, ''Indian Country Today,'' 18 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref><ref name=\"phu\">[http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection Lisa Phu, \"Feds designate Juneau's Indian Point as sacred, worthy of protection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820155548/http://juneauempire.com/local/2016-08-16/feds-designate-juneaus-indian-point-sacred-worthy-protection |date=August 20, 2016 }}, ''Juneau Empire,'' 16 August 2016; accessed 21 August 2016</ref>\n\nDescendants of these indigenous cultures include the [[Tlingit people]]. Native cultures have rich artistic traditions expressed in carving, weaving, orating, singing, and dancing. Juneau has become a major social center for the Tlingit, [[Haida people|Haida]], and [[Tsimshian]] of Southeast Alaska.\n\n===European encounters===\nAlthough the Russians had a colony in the Alaska territory from 1784 to 1867, they did not settle in Juneau. They conducted extensive fur trading with Alaskan Natives of the Aleutian Islands and Kodiak.\n\nThe first European to see the Juneau area was [[Joseph Whidbey]], master of the ''[[HMS Discovery (1789)|Discovery]]'' during [[George Vancouver]]'s [[Vancouver Expedition|1791\u201395 expedition]]. He and his party explored the region in July\u2013August 1794. Early in August he viewed the length of Gastineau Channel from the south, noting a small island in mid-channel. He later recorded seeing the channel again, this time from the west. He said it was unnavigable, being filled with ice.<ref name=\"Vancouver\">{{cite book| last1 = Vancouver| first1 = George| last2= Vancouver| first2= John| title = A voyage of discovery to the North Pacific ocean, and round the world| publisher = J.

In 1880, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] mining engineer [[George Pilz]] offered a reward to any local Native in Alaska who could lead him to gold-bearing ore. A local Native arrived with some ore, and several prospectors were sent to investigate. On their first trip to Gold Creek, they found deposits of little interest. However,Pilz sent [[Joe Juneau (prospector)|Joe Juneau]] and [[Richard Harris (prospector)|Richard Harris]] back to the Gastineau Channel, directing them to Snow Slide Gulch (the head of Gold Creek). According to the Rev. Samuel Young, in his book Alaska Days with John Muir, it was their party's campsite at the creek head that Juneau and Harris decided to explore, in the summer of 1879. There they found nuggets \"as large as peas and beans,\" in Harris' words.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Juneau City, 1887.jpg|thumb|Juneau City in 1887]]\nOn October 18, 1880, the two men marked a {{convert|160|acre|m2|adj=on}} town site where soon a mining camp sprang up. Within a year, so many miners had arrived that the camp became a village, albeit made up mostly of tents and shacks rather than substantial buildings. It was the first [[European American]] settlement founded in this territory after the United States [[Alaska Purchase|purchased Alaska]].\n\nBy the autumn of 1881, the village had a population of over 100 and was known as Rockwell, after Lt. Com. Charles Rockwell; later it was known as Harrisburg after prospector Richard Harris.  On December 14, 1881, a miners' meeting of 72 persons decided to name the settlement Juneau, after [[prospecting|prospector]] Joe Juneau.<ref name=Spencer>{{Cite book |author=Arthur C.

It had given services in northern Tlingit settlements in local languages since 1800 and 1824. One of its priests had translated scripture and liturgy into the [[Tlingit language]] in the 1830s\u20131840s. The Tlingit arranged for an Orthodox priest to come to their settlement in Juneau. In 1890, some 700 people converted, following chief Yees Gaanaalx and his wife of Auke Bay. The Orthodox Church Missionary Society supported the Tlingit in furnishing and constructing a church for this large congregation.<ref name=nrhpdoc/>\n\nSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church was completed in 1894 and has maintained a strong presence among the Tlingit, Serbians, and other Europeans who followed this church.

The neighborhood that developed there was named for him by early settlers, as have been several other landmarks in Juneau.\n\nMajor mining operations in the [[Juneau mining district]] prior to World War II included the [[Treadwell gold mine|Treadwell Mine]], [[Alaska-Juneau Gold Mining Company|The Alaska-Juneau Mine]], and [[Alaska-Gastineau Mine]].\n\nBy 1906, after the decline of whaling and the fur trade, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], the original capital of Alaska, had become less important and the territorial legislature moved the seat of government to Juneau in accordance with a 1900 federal law.<ref name=\":0\" /> Juneau was the largest city in Alaska during the inter-war years, passing [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] in the [[1920 United States Census|1920 census]]. In the post-World War II years, it was displaced by [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] in [[1950 United States Census|1950]].\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nIn 1911, the United States Congress authorized funds for construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. [[World War I]] delayed construction and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the [[Art Deco architecture|Art Deco architectural style]]. The building was originally used by the federal government to house the federal courthouse and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.\n\nThe Alaska Governor's Mansion was commissioned under the Public Building Act in 1910. The mansion was designed by [[James Knox Taylor]] in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]]. Construction was completed in 1912. The territorial governor at that time was the first governor to inhabit the mansion, and he held the first open house for citizens on January 1, 1913. The area of the mansion is {{convert|14400|sqft|m2}}. It has ten bathrooms, six bedrooms, and eight fireplaces. The governor resides here when in Juneau on official business. In June 1923, President [[Warren G. Harding]] became the first president to visit Alaska. Harding visited the Governor's Mansion while Territorial Governor [[Scott Bone]], who was appointed by Harding, was in office. Harding spoke from the porch of the mansion explaining his policies and met with attendees.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], more than 50 Japanese citizens and Japanese Americans residing in Juneau were [[internment of Japanese Americans|evacuated to the internment camps inland]] as a result of [[Executive Order 9066]]\u2014which authorized the forced removal of all ethnic Japanese away from their homes and businesses on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. The removal of Juneau's Japanese community during the war was later commemorated known as the ''[[Empty Chair Memorial]]'' in July 2014 during a dedication ceremony at the neighborhood of Capital School Park in the city.<ref>{{cite web | title=Empty Chair Project recognizes Juneau's Japanese WWII internees | url=https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | author=Jeremy Hsieh | date=July 13, 2014 | publisher=[[KTOO (FM)|KTOO]] | accessdate=July 8, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190709022307/https://www.ktoo.org/2014/07/13/empty-chair-project-recognizes-juneaus-japanese-wwii-internees/ | archive-date=July 9, 2019 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Atwood]], then publisher of the ''[[Anchorage Times]]'' and an Anchorage \"booster,\" was an early leader in efforts to move the capital to Fairbanks, which many in both cities resisted. Some supporters of a move wanted a new capital to be at least {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Anchorage and Fairbanks, to prevent either city from having undue influence. Juneau has continued as the capital. In the 1970s, voters passed a plan to move the capital to [[Willow, Alaska|Willow]], a town {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Anchorage. But pro-Juneau people there and in Fairbanks persuaded voters also to approve a measure (the FRANK Initiative) requiring voter approval of all bondable construction costs before building could begin. Alaskans later voted against spending the estimated $900 million. A 1984 \"ultimate\" capital-move vote also failed, as did a 1996 vote.\n\n[[File:Downtown Juneau with Mount Juneau rising in the background.jpg|thumb|Downtown Juneau, with [[Mount Juneau]] in the background]]\nJuneau remains the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |title=Sean Parnell, 10th Governor of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=2011-12-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223217/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/capmove.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 }}</ref> Once Alaska was granted [[U.S. state|statehood]] in 1959, Juneau's population increased along with the growth of state government.

This includes the state government, federal government (which has regional offices here, especially for resource agencies), municipal government (which includes the local airport, hospital, harbors, and school district), and the [[University of Alaska Southeast]]. State government offices and their indirect economic impact compose approximately one-quarter of Juneau's economy.<ref>The Associated Press.

In 2005, the [[cruise ship]] industry was estimated to bring nearly one million visitors to Juneau for up to 11 hours at a time, between May and September.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise outlook for 2005 shows growth|url=http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|accessdate=November 15, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416002456/http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/041005/loc_20050410003.shtml|archive-date=April 16, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>  While cruise ships provide an economic boost to segments of the economy, not all locals are appreciative.  The Juneau Public Library, built atop a parking garage along South Franklin Street near the [[Red Dog Saloon]], was designed to take advantage of the view of and across Gastineau Channel.  This view is often blocked by docking cruise ships, which have become so large that they tower over the five-story structure.

Juneau was recently the 49th most lucrative U.S. fisheries port by volume and 45th by value. In 2004 it took in 15 million pounds of fish and shellfish, valued at 21.5 million dollars, according to the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]]. While the port of Juneau does comparatively little seafood processing compared to other towns of this size in Alaska, the hundreds of commercial fishing boats sell their fish to plants in nearby Sitka, Hoonah, Petersburg and Ketchikan.  The largest fleets operating from Juneau are the gillnet and troll salmon fleets.\n\nJuneau is also the home to many of the commercial fishing associations in Alaska, as they want to educate and lobby the state legislature. These associations include the Alaska Trollers Association, United Fishermen of Alaska, United Southeast Alaska Gillnetters Association, and the Southeast Alaska Seiners Association.\n\nReal estate agencies, federally funded highway construction, and mining are still viable non-government local industries.

The JUMP Society hosts screenings of locally made short films two times a year.\n\nDowntown Juneau has many art galleries that participate in the monthly First Friday Art Walk and annual Gallery Walk held in the first week of December. The Juneau Arts & Humanities Council coordinates events and operates the Juneau Arts & Culture Center, which features a community center, gallery and lobby shop. The [[University of Alaska Southeast]] Campus offers lectures, concerts, and theater performances.

The Juneau Airport precinct is in the 31st district, which is otherwise identical to the 2nd Assembly District.\n\nSince Juneau was split into two state house districts by the state during [[redistricting]] in the early 1990s, the districts comprising downtown Juneau, Douglas Island and surrounding areas have exclusively elected [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] to the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], while the districts comprising Mendenhall Valley and surrounding areas have mostly elected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].  The 31st District is currently represented in the House by Democrat [[Andi Story]], who has been in office since 2018.  The 32nd District is represented by Democrat [[Sara Hannan]].\n\nCombined, these two election districts form [[Alaska Senate]] District Q. That seat is held by Democrat [[Dennis Egan]], a former Juneau mayor who has been in office since 2009. The last Republican to represent Juneau in the state Senate was Elton Engstrom, Jr., the father of Cathy Mu\u00f1oz. He left office at the end of his term in early 1971, after failing to be re-elected in 1970.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:left; margin:15px\"\n|+ '''Presidential Election Results for the City and Borough of Juneau 2004\u20132008'''<ref>\"2008 Presidential Election Results by House District in Alaska\".

A number of executive branch departments, as well as the legislature, are based in Juneau.  The legislature, in response to repeated pressure from [[Southcentral Alaska]] to move either the capital or the legislature, acquired and renovated several buildings in the vicinity of the [[Alaska State Capitol]], which hold committee meeting rooms and administrative offices for the [[Alaska Legislative Council|Legislative Affairs Agency]].  These buildings were named for former legislators [[Terry Miller (politician)|Terry Miller]] and Thomas B. Stewart.  Stewart, a Juneau native and son of early Juneau mayor Benjamin D. Stewart, represented Juneau in the Senate during the [[1st Alaska State Legislature]]. He later served in Juneau's [[Alaska Superior Court]] judgeship and was noted as an authority on the latter territory/early statehood eras of [[History of Alaska|Alaska's history]].\n\nThe federal government has a nine-story federal building in Juneau in the area known as \"The Flats\". Along [[Gold Creek (Juneau, Alaska)|Gold Creek]] near its mouth and a short distance east of the [[Juneau-Douglas Bridge]], the building houses numerous federal agencies, the [[United States District Court for the District of Alaska]], and Juneau's main [[United States Postal Service|post office]]. It was designed by [[Linn A. Forrest]] and constructed in 1966. Under the [[Alaska Statehood Act]], the Federal and Territorial Building was transferred to the new state for use as its [[Alaska State Capitol|capitol]].\n\n==Education==\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nJuneau is served by the [[Juneau School District]] and includes the following schools:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |title=Schools in the Juneau School District |access-date=December 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111190635/http://www.jsd.k12.ak.us/newdistrict/schools/ |archive-date=November 11, 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{| style=\"width:70%;\"\n|- valign=top\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Gastineau Elementary School\n*Harborview Elementary School\n*Riverbend Elementary School\n*Mendenhall River Elementary School\n*Glacier Valley Elementary School\n*Auke Bay Elementary School\n*Juneau Community Charter School\n*Montessori Borealis School\n| style=\"width:50%;\"|\n*Dzantik'i Heeni Middle School\n*[[Floyd Dryden Middle School]]\n*[[Juneau-Douglas High School]]\n*[[Thunder Mountain High School]]\n*[[Yaa\u1e35oosg\u00e9 Daakah\u00eddi Alternative High School]]\n*HomeBRIDGE ([[homeschooling]] program)\n|}\n\nIn addition, the following private schools also serve Juneau:\n* (Glacier) Valley Baptist Academy\n* Faith Community School\n* Thunder Mountain Learning Center (Formerly Thunder Mountain Academy)\n* Juneau Seventh-day Adventist Christian School\n* Juneau Montessori School\n\n===Colleges and universities===\nThe [[University of Alaska Southeast]] is within the [[Auke Bay]] community along the shore of [[Auke Lake]].

The university was restructured as the University of Alaska Southeast to include Ketchikan and Sitka campuses. The university offers undergraduate and graduate studies.\n\n==Transportation==\nJuneau is not directly accessible by road, although there are road connections to several areas immediately adjacent to the city. Primary access to the city is by air and sea.
