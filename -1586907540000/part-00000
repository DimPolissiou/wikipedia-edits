A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]]. Some manufactured disasters have been ascribed to nature.<ref name=China.NYT/>\n\nSome researchers also differentiate between recurring events such as seasonal flooding, and those considered unpredictable.<ref>{{Cite journal  |journal=Environment and Urbanization\n|author1=L.

However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[landform]]s, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]].\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]\n\n===Human-made disasters===\n{{Main|Anthropogenic hazard}}\nHuman-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, [[industrial accident]]s, [[oil spills]], [[terrorist attacks]], \n[[nuclear explosion]]s/[[nuclear radiation]]. [[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.

However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[landform]]s, coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]].\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]\n\n===Human-made disasters===\n{{Main|Anthropogenic hazard}}\nHuman-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological or human hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, [[industrial accident]]s, [[oil spills]], [[terrorist attacks]], \n[[nuclear explosion]]s/[[nuclear radiation]]. [[War]] and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category.\n\nOther types of induced disasters include the more cosmic scenarios of catastrophic [[global warming]], [[nuclear war]], and [[bioterrorism]].\n\nOne opinion argues that all disasters can be seen as human-made, due to human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.<ref name=atrisk>Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis & Ben Wisner.

Whilst these behaviours appear incredibly adaptive, primary psychopaths are also prone to dysfunctional and pathological traits such as an inability to learn from past mistakes and a lack of responsibility.<ref name=\"four\">{{cite journal |last1=Vaughn |first1=Michael G. |last2=Edens |first2=John F. |last3=Howard |first3=Matthew O. |last4=Smith |first4=Shannon Toney |title=An Investigation of Primary and Secondary Psychopathy in a Statewide Sample of Incarcerated Youth |journal=Youth Violence and Juvenile Injustice |date=July 2009 |volume=7 |issue=3 |page=173 |doi=10.1177/1541204009333792 |url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1541204009333792?journalCode=yvja |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n=== Secondary Psychopathy ===\n\"Secondary\" psychopaths are individuals not dissimilar to primary psychopaths in the sense that they still share many of the same characteristics and traits. However, unlike the primary psychopath, the secondary psychopath is more likely to suffer from intense emotional arousal and psychological issues. As well as this, research conducted on adult psychopaths has suggested that secondary psychopaths are more prone to take part in destructive behaviour including drug abuse, suicide and interpersonal aggression. Overall, what differentiates secondary psychopaths from primary psychopaths is their reactivity, an inability to control their emotions effectively and increased impulsivity.<ref name=\"four\" />\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nStudies have supported the existence of these two subgroups. For example, after a [[questionnaire]] assessing personality was distributed to 96 male psychopathic male prisoners, the researchers conducting the study concluded the best-fitting model for the differences in personality was two separate groups. One group was labelled \"emotionally stable psychopaths\" and the other was labelled \"aggressive psychopaths\". The aggressive psychopaths were more emotionally reactive and lacked control whereas the emotionally stable psychopaths had high levels of achievement and social skills and low levels of stress reaction. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Brian M. |last2=Markon |first2=Kristian E. |last3=Patrick |first3=Christopher J. |last4=Krueger |first4=Rober F. |last5=Newman |first5=Joseph P. |title=Identifying Psychopathy Subtypes on the Basis of Personality Structure |journal=The American Psychological Association |date=2004 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=276-281 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.16.3.276 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15456383 |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Development and Scoring ==\nThe LSRP was based off of [[Robert D. Hare|Robert D. Hare's]] diagnostic [[Psychopathy Checklist-Revised]] (PCL-R) and consists of 26 statements which participants must decide their attitudes towards using a 4-point [[Likert scale]] (\"disagree strongly\", \"disagree somewhat\", \"agree somewhat\" and \"agree strongly\"). Seven of the items were reversed to reduce [[response bias]].<ref name=\"two\">{{cite journal |last1=Brinkley |first1=Chad A. |last2=Schmitt |first2=William A. |last3=Smith |first3=Steven S. |last4=Newman |first4=Joseph P. |title=Construct validation of a self-report psychopathy scale: does Levenson's self-report psychopathy scale measure the same constructs as Hare's psychopathy checklist-revised? |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=28 September 2000 |volume=31 |issue=7 |page=1025 |doi=10.1016/S0191-8869(00)00178-1 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900001781?casa_token=Jj9Lqy7hp4kAAAAA:BeI10XjTH0hugvfpD6HWvDOqFhekT1TZfzg6hMQNkhYyDGdn7s4wE43PsxntcOWUY6LSNhhQqYA |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nA [[factor analysis]] was initially conducted on the items in the LSRP and two factors (primary and secondary psychopathy) were derived from the scale.<ref name=\"two\" />16 of the statements from the scale determined primary psychopathy and the remaining 10 determined secondary psychopathy. The statements that were attributed to primary psychopathy were more to do with manipulation and a lack of empathy whereas the statements attributed to secondary psychopathy were focused on behavioural issues.<ref name=\"one\" />{{rp|152-153}}\n\nBased on the results of the initial study, the following thresholds for the results were established: \n\n* 0-48: Non-psychopathic group\n* 49-57: Mixed group\n* \u226558: Psychopathic group<ref name=\"two\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]] ===\n==== [[Construct validity]] ====\n\nThe LSRP intends to measure the same constructs as the PCL-R. Significant correlations suggest that the LSRP does correlate with the PCL-R for both factors of psychopathy. However, these correlations were small to moderate so suggest that the LSRP and PCL-R are measuring somewhat different constructs.<ref name=\"two\" />{{rp|1035}}\n\n==== Internal validity ====\n\nThe LSRP suffers much of the same problems as other self-reported data. As the participant is completing the form themselves, they are more likely to be subject to biases that can change how they answer questions and thus jeopardise the [[internal validity]] of the data. An example of such is the [[recall bias]] in which participants must recall what they believe to be relevant information to complete the self-report. However, without the presence of an interviewer who is able to guide the participants thought process, the participant may be using incorrect information that they called upon to answer a question. The potential for this problem is much higher in self-reported data than interviews.<ref name= \"three\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowling |first1=Ann |title=Mode of questionnaire administration can have serious effects on data quality |journal=Journal of Public Health |date=3 May 2005 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=281-287 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdi031 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/27/3/281/1511097 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[cognitive]] burden of self-reported data is also higher than interviews. The LSRP, being a visual questionnaire, requires literacy skills, a lack of visual impairment and ability to use your hands as well as the ability to follow instructions. Compared to interviews, this increased cognitive burden could result in a lower quality of data.<ref name= \"three\" />\n\n==== External validity ====\n\nTo create the LSRP, Levenson et al. only used undergraduate students studying psychology at a specific university. This is an example of [[selection bias]] and is likely to have negative implications for the [[external validity]] of the scale as the wider population does not consist of only undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fritz |first1=Kyra N. |last2=Lim |first2=Nicholas K. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation |date=2018 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781506326139 |pages=1490-1491 |url=https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-educational-research-measurement-and-evaluation/i18601.xml?fromsearch=true |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=Selection Bias}}</ref> The development of the LSRP also used a WEIRD sample. This refers to a sample from a western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic society. The problem with this is that due to the restricted sample, the LSRP may not be generalisable to the other 88% of the population who do not live in WEIRD societies, once again decreasing the external validity of the scale. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henrich |first1=Joseph |last2=Heine |first2=Steven J. |last3=Norenzayan |first3=Ara |title=The weirdest people in the world? |journal=Behavioural and Brain Sciences |date=2010 |volume=33 |issue=2-3 |page=3 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999152X |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-in-the-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17 |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Reliability ===\n\n==== Internal consistency reliability ====\nFindings on the [[internal consistency]] [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the LSRP are mixed.

As well as this, research conducted on adult psychopaths has suggested that secondary psychopaths are more prone to take part in destructive behaviour including drug abuse, suicide and interpersonal aggression. Overall, what differentiates secondary psychopaths from primary psychopaths is their reactivity, an inability to control their emotions effectively and increased impulsivity.<ref name=\"four\" />\n\n=== Evaluation ===\nStudies have supported the existence of these two subgroups. For example, after a [[questionnaire]] assessing personality was distributed to 96 male psychopathic male prisoners, the researchers conducting the study concluded the best-fitting model for the differences in personality was two separate groups. One group was labelled \"emotionally stable psychopaths\" and the other was labelled \"aggressive psychopaths\". The aggressive psychopaths were more emotionally reactive and lacked control whereas the emotionally stable psychopaths had high levels of achievement and social skills and low levels of stress reaction. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hicks |first1=Brian M. |last2=Markon |first2=Kristian E. |last3=Patrick |first3=Christopher J. |last4=Krueger |first4=Rober F. |last5=Newman |first5=Joseph P. |title=Identifying Psychopathy Subtypes on the Basis of Personality Structure |journal=The American Psychological Association |date=2004 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=276-281 |doi=10.1037/1040-3590.16.3.276 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15456383 |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Development and Scoring ==\nThe LSRP was based off of [[Robert D.

The statements that were attributed to primary psychopathy were more to do with manipulation and a lack of empathy whereas the statements attributed to secondary psychopathy were focused on behavioural issues.<ref name=\"one\" />{{rp|152-153}}\n\nBased on the results of the initial study, the following thresholds for the results were established: \n\n* 0-48: Non-psychopathic group\n* 49-57: Mixed group\n* \u226558: Psychopathic group<ref name=\"two\" />\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]] ===\n==== [[Construct validity]] ====\n\nThe LSRP intends to measure the same constructs as the PCL-R. Significant correlations suggest that the LSRP does correlate with the PCL-R for both factors of psychopathy. However, these correlations were small to moderate so suggest that the LSRP and PCL-R are measuring somewhat different constructs.<ref name=\"two\" />\n==== Internal validity ====\n\nThe LSRP suffers much of the same problems as other self-reported data. As the participant is completing the form themselves, they are more likely to be subject to biases that can change how they answer questions and thus jeopardise the [[internal validity]] of the data. An example of such is the [[recall bias]] in which participants must recall what they believe to be relevant information to complete the self-report. However, without the presence of an interviewer who is able to guide the participants thought process, the participant may be using incorrect information that they called upon to answer a question. The potential for this problem is much higher in self-reported data than interviews.<ref name= \"three\">{{cite journal |last1=Bowling |first1=Ann |title=Mode of questionnaire administration can have serious effects on data quality |journal=Journal of Public Health |date=3 May 2005 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=281-287 |doi=10.1093/pubmed/fdi031 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jpubhealth/article/27/3/281/1511097 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nThe [[cognitive]] burden of self-reported data is also higher than interviews. The LSRP, being a visual questionnaire, requires literacy skills, a lack of visual impairment and ability to use your hands as well as the ability to follow instructions. Compared to interviews, this increased cognitive burden could result in a lower quality of data.<ref name= \"three\" />\n\n==== External validity ====\n\nTo create the LSRP, Levenson et al. only used undergraduate students studying psychology at a specific university. This is an example of [[selection bias]] and is likely to have negative implications for the [[external validity]] of the scale as the wider population does not consist of only undergraduate students.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fritz |first1=Kyra N. |last2=Lim |first2=Nicholas K. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Educational Research, Measurement, and Evaluation |date=2018 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |location=Thousand Oaks |isbn=9781506326139 |pages=1490-1491 |url=https://methods.sagepub.com/reference/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-educational-research-measurement-and-evaluation/i18601.xml?fromsearch=true |accessdate=12 April 2020 |chapter=Selection Bias}}</ref> The development of the LSRP also used a WEIRD sample. This refers to a sample from a western, educated, industrialised, rich, democratic society. The problem with this is that due to the restricted sample, the LSRP may not be generalisable to the other 88% of the population who do not live in WEIRD societies, once again decreasing the external validity of the scale. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henrich |first1=Joseph |last2=Heine |first2=Steven J. |last3=Norenzayan |first3=Ara |title=The weirdest people in the world? |journal=Behavioural and Brain Sciences |date=2010 |volume=33 |issue=2-3 |page=3 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0999152X |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/weirdest-people-in-the-world/BF84F7517D56AFF7B7EB58411A554C17 |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Reliability ===\n\n==== Internal consistency reliability ====\nFindings on the [[internal consistency]] [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the LSRP are mixed.

Born in [[Atlanta, Texas]], and raised in [[Foreman, Arkansas]], Lawrence began performing at age 15 and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1990 to begin his country music career. He signed to [[Atlantic Records]] Nashville in 1991 and made his debut late that year with the album ''[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence album)|Sticks and Stones]]''. Five more studio albums, as well as a live album and a compilation album, followed throughout the 1990s and into 2000 on Atlantic before the label's country division was closed in 2001. Afterward, he recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[DreamWorks Records]], [[Mercury Records Nashville]], and his own labels, Rocky Comfort Records and Lawrence Music Group.\n\nLawrence has released a total of 14 studio albums. His most commercially successful albums are ''[[Alibis (album)|Alibis]]'' (1993) and ''[[Time Marches On]]'' (1996), both certified double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He has charted more than forty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including eight songs that reached the number one position: \"[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]\", \"[[Alibis (song)|Alibis]]\", \"[[Can't Break It to My Heart]]\", \"[[My Second Home]]\", \"[[If the Good Die Young]]\", \"[[Texas Tornado (song)|Texas Tornado]]\", \"[[Time Marches On (song)|Time Marches On]]\", and \"[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]\". Of these, \"Time Marches On\" is his longest-lasting at three weeks, while \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\" set a record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of that chart. His musical style is defined mainly by [[neotraditional country]] and [[honky-tonk]] influences, although he has also recorded [[country pop]], Christmas music, and [[Christian country music]]. He has won Top New Male Vocalist from ''Billboard'' in 1992 and from [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1993, and Vocal Event of the Year from the [[Country Music Association]] in 2007.\n\n==Biography==\nTracy Lee Lawrence was born in [[Atlanta, Texas]], on January 27, 1968.<ref name=\"arkansas\"/><ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2012|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2012|pages=188\u2013189|isbn=978-0-89820-203-8}}</ref> He was raised by his stay-at-home mother JoAnn Dickens and stepfather Duane Dickens.

Born in [[Atlanta, Texas]], and raised in [[Foreman, Arkansas]], Lawrence began performing at age 15 and moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1990 to begin his country music career. He signed to [[Atlantic Records]] Nashville in 1991 and made his debut late that year with the album ''[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence album)|Sticks and Stones]]''. Five more studio albums, as well as a live album and a compilation album, followed throughout the 1990s and into 2000 on Atlantic before the label's country division was closed in 2001. Afterward, he recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], [[DreamWorks Records]], [[Mercury Records Nashville]], and his own labels, Rocky Comfort Records and Lawrence Music Group.\n\nLawrence has released a total of 14 studio albums. His most commercially successful albums are ''[[Alibis (album)|Alibis]]'' (1993) and ''[[Time Marches On]]'' (1996), both certified double-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). He has charted more than forty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including eight songs that reached the number one position: \"[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]\", \"[[Alibis (song)|Alibis]]\", \"[[Can't Break It to My Heart]]\", \"[[My Second Home]]\", \"[[If the Good Die Young]]\", \"[[Texas Tornado (song)|Texas Tornado]]\", \"[[Time Marches On (song)|Time Marches On]]\", and \"[[Find Out Who Your Friends Are]]\". Of these, \"Time Marches On\" is his longest-lasting at three weeks, while \"Find Out Who Your Friends Are\" set a record at the time for the slowest ascent to the top of that chart. His musical style is defined mainly by [[neotraditional country]] and [[honky-tonk]] influences, although he has also recorded [[country pop]], Christmas music, and [[Christian country music]]. He has won Top New Male Vocalist from ''Billboard'' in 1992 and from [[Academy of Country Music]] in 1993, and Vocal Event of the Year from the [[Country Music Association]] in 2007.\n\n==Biography==\nTracy Lee Lawrence was born in [[Atlanta, Texas]], on January 27, 1968.<ref name=\"arkansas\"/><ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2012|publisher=Record Research, Inc|date=2012|pages=188\u2013189|isbn=978-0-89820-203-8}}</ref> He was raised by his stay-at-home mother JoAnn Dickens and stepfather Duane Dickens.
