It is located in Vietnam's [[South Central Coast]] region. Its Sino-Vietnamese name (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: [[wikt:\u5e73\u5b9a|\u5e73\u5b9a]]) translates as \"pacified\" or \"subjugated.\"\n\n==History==\n===Champa===\n{{main|Vijaya (Champa)}}\n[[File:Banh It.jpg|thumb|left|Cham towers]]\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh was probably one of the places where the Cham first arrived in what is now Vietnam.<ref name=V47>Vickery 2009, 47</ref> Its favourable geography led to the rise of the Cham [[Port of Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i]] where Quy Nh\u01a1n is now located. The city-state of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.<ref name=V47/>\n\t\nVijaya's architecture also distinguishes it from other Champa centers, since it used a combination of stone and brick elements,<ref name=V48>Vickery 2009, 48</ref> while most other Cham structures only used bricks. This suggests some influence from [[Cambodia]]n [[Angkor]].<ref name=V48/> It also points to the relative abundance of labour in Vijaya compared to other Champa centres of power, because processing stones for construction was more labour-intensive than the production of bricks.<ref>Tran 2009, 173</ref> \n\t\nVijaya was involved in various wars with neighbouring countries. Major wars were fought with Angkor (now Cambodia) in the 12th and 13th centuries. Around this time Vijaya seems to have been associated with, and at times even dominated by, the Khmer King [[Jayavarman VII]].<ref>Vickery 2009, 54</ref>  Major wars with Vietnam were fought in 1069 and again in the 15th century, which eventually led to the defeat of Vijaya and the demise of [[Champa]] in 1471.<ref>Vickery 2009, 69</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:Binh Dinh scenery.jpg|thumb|right]]\nThe majority of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province is covered by mountains or hills. Elevations range from 0 at the coast to around 1200 meters above sea level in [[An L\u00e3o District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|An L\u00e3o District]] in the north-west of the province.<ref name=\"atlas10\">''Viet Nam Administrative Atlas''. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> While most of the mountains as well as the highest peaks are in the west, there are mountains throughout the province, even near the coast. Most districts of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh have a topography that is a mix of mountains or hills and lowlands. The districts of An L\u00e3o in the north-west, [[V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh]] in the west, and [[V\u00e2n Canh District|V\u00e2n Canh]] in the south-west are mostly mountainous. All other districts have some lowlands.\n\nThe largest lowland area is located in the south of the province along the lower [[C\u00f4n River]]. It encompasses much of [[Quy Nh\u01a1n]], the districts of [[Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc District|Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc]], [[An Nh\u01a1n District|An Nh\u01a1n]], the western part of [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t District|Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t]], and the eastern part of [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]]. Given its size, and the access to a major port as well as B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's major river, it has long been the place where most of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's people and economic activities concentrate. It was the site of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]], one of the major city-states of [[Champa]]. The majority of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's population lives in the districts around this plain.\n\nOther lowland areas are located in the coastal districts of [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District|Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n]], [[Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9 District|Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9]], [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t District|Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t]], as well as the inland district of [[Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n District|Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n]]. There are some hills or mountains near the coast in all of the coastal provinces, with the highest peak in Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t at 874m (Ba mountain, n\u00fai B\u00e0) and in [[Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9 District|Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9]] at 602m.<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\nMountains form natural borders to the neighbouring provinces. C\u00f9 M\u00f4ng pass (\u0111\u00e8o C\u00f9 M\u00f4ng) is the main border crossing to [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean Province]]. [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]] passes through this pass, while there is another road (1D) along the coast. The border to [[Gia Lai Province]] is the most mountainous, with the only road connection at An Kh\u00ea pass (\u0111\u00e8o An Kh\u00ea) between the towns of [[Ph\u00fa Phong, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|Ph\u00fa Phong]] in [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District]] and [[An Kh\u00ea]] in Gia Lai. The border to [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province]] is also very mountainous, with the major road and railway passing through [[B\u00ecnh \u0110\u00ea Pass]] (\u0111\u00e8o B\u00ecnh \u0110\u00ea) near [[Tam Quan]].<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\n===Hydrography===\n[[C\u00f4n River]] is the largest and most important river in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh. It forms a small delta north of [[Quy Nh\u01a1n]]. Most of it can be used as an inland waterway for transportation. This is probably one of the reasons why a major centre of power of [[Champa]] emerged along this river. Other rivers are [[L\u1ea1i Giang River]] at the centre of the lowland areas of Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n and Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n in northern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, [[M\u1ef9 C\u00e1t River]] in central B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, and [[H\u00e0 Thanh River]] along the valley in V\u00e2n Canh District in southern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh.<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\nThe largest lake is [[\u0110\u1ecbnh B\u00ecnh Lake]], an artificial lake mainly used for irrigation in the highlands of western B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh. Also in western B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh is [[V\u0129nh S\u01a1n Lake]] (h\u1ed3 V\u0129nh S\u01a1n) at V\u0129nh S\u01a1n Hydropower Station. Other major lakes include N\u00fai M\u1ed9t Lake (h\u1ed3 N\u00fai M\u1ed9t) in the south and H\u1ed9i S\u01a1n Lake (h\u1ed3 H\u1ed9i S\u01a1n) in the centre of the province.<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\n===Mineral resources===\n[[Ilmenite]] reserves in Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t and [[graphite]] reserves in northern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh are substantial and support significant local export industries. There is also some gold in western B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh.<ref name=\"Atlat\">''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam).

While being significantly behind the main success stories of the region, namely [[Da Nang]] and [[Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province]], it is more developed than most other provinces in the region. It has been benefiting from its strategic position as one of the main gateways to the [[Central Highlands, Vietnam|Central Highlands]] and [[Quy Nh\u01a1n Port|its port]]. It is the region's third largest industrial center (mainly based on furniture manufacturing) and also has strong agricultural, forestry, livestock, and fishing sectors.\n\nIn 2007 B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh exported goods worth US$327.3 million, while importing goods worth US$141.6 million.<ref name=\"GSO09\"/> Most of the province's exports are furniture.\n\n===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===\n[[File:Binh Dinh farm.jpg|thumb|right|Farm in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh]]\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh has the most productive primary sector (agriculture, fishery, forestry) in the South Central Coast region, mostly because of its large output of rice, coconuts and its strong livestock, forestry and fishing sectors. It contributes roughly 23% of sector 1 GDP and rice output of the South Central Coast (while it has 17.7% of the region's population).<ref name=\"GSO09\">General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities'', Vietnam.

Smaller manufacturing sectors include garments, paper, leather, plastics and rubber products.\n\n[[Nh\u01a1n H\u1ed9i Economic Zone]] is under construction, but behind schedule (as of September 2010).\n\n==Infrastructure and transport==\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's infrastructure has been significant for its economic development. It has traditionally been the site of a major port and the intersection of two national roads has further increased B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's role as a gateway to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and access to the latter's resources. As a result, the province has received one of the highest infrastructure scores in the Provincial Competitiveness Index 2009, second only to [[Da Nang]] in central Vietnam.<ref name=\"PCI09\">[http://pcivietnam.org/province_profile_detail.php?province=54  Vietnam Provincial Competitiveness Index 2009]</ref>\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Binh Dinh NatRoad1.jpg|thumb|[[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]]]]\nThere are national roads with a total length of 208&nbsp;km and provincial roads a total length of 458.5&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"TDS\">Ministry of Transport (2005): National Transport Development Strategy in Vietnam till 2020.

It is served by a daily train from Quy Nh\u01a1n to [[Saigon Railway Station]] and a train three times a week from Quy Nh\u01a1n to [[Vinh Railway Station]]. [[Tam Quan Railway Station]], located along North\u2013South Railway in [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District]], is frequented by only a few trains, such as the train to [[Vinh]].\n\n====Water transport====\n[[File:Quy Nhon Port.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quy Nh\u01a1n Port]]]]\nMuch of [[C\u00f4n River]] \u2013 almost up to the border in [[V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District]] with [[Gia Lai Province]] \u2013 and a small stretch of [[Lai Giang River]] up to [[B\u1ed3ng S\u01a1n]] in [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District]] \u2013 are inland waterways and can be used for transportation.<ref name=\"Road Atlas 2004\"/> There has been a significant change in the use of inland waterways away from passenger and towards freight traffic between 2006 and 2008. The number of passenger decreased from 113,000 in 2006 to 42,000 in 2007 and 7,000 in 2008 and 2009, while freight transport on inland \u2013 apparently almost non-existent until 2008 \u2013 has accounted for 10 tons and around 70 tons km in 2008 and 2009, respectively.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> This is, however, still minuscule compared to other modes of transportation within the province. Maritime transport within the province has showed a declining trend in recent years and was at 171 tons and 31,000 passengers in 2009.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The two main ports of the province \u2013 [[Quy Nh\u01a1n Port]] and [[Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i Port]] \u2013 are both located in [[Quy Nh\u01a1n]]. In 2009 they had a combined freight turnover of 4,500 tons, with 30,856 tons handled by Quy Nh\u01a1n port, including 2016 tons of exported goods (mainly processed wood, furniture and stones).<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i Port, in contrast, mostly handles domestic trade. The volume of cargo handled has increased by more than 50 percent between 2005 and 2009.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\n====Ownership structure====\nWhile [[Vietnam Railways]] and the major seaports are owned and operated by the state sector, almost none of the local transport is state-run. Household businesses are dominant in the passenger sector, accounting for more than 70 percent of passengers and passenger kilometers over the last few years \u2013 although their share has been decreasing.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The other traditionally significant enterprise form have been collective enterprises. Their share has been decreasing, too, while private sector participation has been increasing from a very low base since 2008. As of 2009, the share of the collective sector (11.8 percent) is still slightly ahead of the private sector (11.6 percent), but it has been clearly overtaken in terms of passenger km, with shares of 5.4 and 23.3 percent, respectively.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The freight transport sector is dominated by the household and private sector. While household businesses take the lead in freight volume (54.8 percent compared to 41.4 percent), private companies have a larger share if distance travelled (tons.km) is considered (50 percent compared to 43.4 percent). Both private and household businesses have been able to grow and increase their share in recent years, mainly at the expense of the declining collective sector.\n\n===Telecommunication===\nIn 2009, there were 74.1 telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants. The total number of subscriptions in the province was 1.1 million \u2013 a rapid increase from the 101,230 in 2005, most of which was contributed by mobile phones.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The calling time has also increased rapidly in the same period, from 53 to 488 million minutes.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The quality of telecommunications has received relatively good assessments, with 70.74 percent of respondents to a survey stating that it is good or very good.<ref name=\"PCI09\"/> As of 2009, there were 28,919 Internet subscribers in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, up from 18,260 in 2008 and 8,716 in 2006.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> While telephones and Internet connections have become much more widespread, the number of letters and money telegrams sent has decreased from 119,000 in 2005 to 77,421 in 2009 and telegram services have been discontinued after 2007.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\n==Demography==\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh had a population of 1.488 million in 2009,<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> making it the most populous province of the [[South Central Coast]]. It has been growing slowly from 2000 to 2007 \u2013 at just 0.92% per year on average.<ref name=GSO09calc/> As of 2009, 27.8% of the population live in urban areas, up from 19% in 1995 and 24.2% in 2000.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> More than 40% of the total population is concentrated in [[Qui Nh\u01a1n]] and the two suburban districts of [[An Nh\u01a1n District|An Nh\u01a1n]] and [[Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc District|Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc]]. There is another relatively large concentration in the northern [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District]] with a population of 206,700 (2009) and a population density of 499/km\u00b2. Population density per km\u00b2 in the rest of the province range from 30 to 40 in V\u00e2n Canh, An L\u00e3o, and V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh to 982 in Qui Nh\u01a1n.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\nThe eastern lowlands and [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District]] are largely ethnically homogeneous. There are minorities of [[Bahnar people]] in the sparsely populated districts of [[An L\u00e3o District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|An L\u00e3o]], [[V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh]] and [[V\u00e2n Canh District|V\u00e2n Canh]]. Some [[H're people]] live in An L\u00e3o and some [[Cham people|Cham]] in V\u00e2n Canh. [[Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n District|Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n]]'s population is mostly Kinh, but there are some remote communes that are dominated by Bahnar and H're people.<ref name=minority>General Statistics Office (1996): ''Population Data of Sparsely Populated Areas in Vietnam''.

Its Sino-Vietnamese name (H\u00e1n t\u1ef1: [[wikt:\u5e73\u5b9a|\u5e73\u5b9a]]) translates as \"pacified\" or \"subjugated.\"\n\n==History==\n===Champa===\n{{main|Vijaya (Champa)}}\n[[File:Banh It.jpg|thumb|left|Cham towers]]\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh was probably one of the places where the Cham first arrived in what is now Vietnam.<ref name=V47>Vickery 2009, 47</ref> Its favourable geography led to the rise of the Cham [[Port of Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i]] where Quy Nh\u01a1n is now located. The city-state of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] was located around this port and the main city, which was further inland. Its centre was in the southern lowland of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh. However, its architecture implies that it did not become important until the eleventh or twelfth century.<ref name=V47/>\n\t\nVijaya's architecture also distinguishes it from other Champa centers, since it used a combination of stone and brick elements,<ref name=V48>Vickery 2009, 48</ref> while most other Cham structures only used bricks. This suggests some influence from [[Cambodia]]n [[Angkor]].<ref name=V48/> It also points to the relative abundance of labour in Vijaya compared to other Champa centres of power, because processing stones for construction was more labour-intensive than the production of bricks.<ref>Tran 2009, 173</ref> \n\t\nVijaya was involved in various wars with neighbouring countries. Major wars were fought with Angkor (now Cambodia) in the 12th and 13th centuries. Around this time Vijaya seems to have been associated with, and at times even dominated by, the Khmer King [[Jayavarman VII]].<ref>Vickery 2009, 54</ref>  Major wars with Vietnam were fought in 1069 and again in the 15th century, which eventually led to the defeat of Vijaya and the demise of [[Champa]] in 1471.<ref>Vickery 2009, 69</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:Binh Dinh scenery.jpg|thumb|right]]\nThe majority of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh Province is covered by mountains or hills. Elevations range from 0 at the coast to around 1200 meters above sea level in [[An L\u00e3o District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|An L\u00e3o District]] in the north-west of the province.<ref name=\"atlas10\">''Viet Nam Administrative Atlas''. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> While most of the mountains as well as the highest peaks are in the west, there are mountains throughout the province, even near the coast. Most districts of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh have a topography that is a mix of mountains or hills and lowlands. The districts of An L\u00e3o in the north-west, [[V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh]] in the west, and [[V\u00e2n Canh District|V\u00e2n Canh]] in the south-west are mostly mountainous. All other districts have some lowlands.\n\nThe largest lowland area is located in the south of the province along the lower [[C\u00f4n River]]. It encompasses much of [[Quy Nh\u01a1n]], the districts of [[Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc District|Tuy Ph\u01b0\u1edbc]], [[An Nh\u01a1n District|An Nh\u01a1n]], the western part of [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t District|Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t]], and the eastern part of [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]]. Given its size, and the access to a major port as well as B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's major river, it has long been the place where most of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's people and economic activities concentrate. It was the site of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]], one of the major city-states of [[Champa]]. The majority of B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's population lives in the districts around this plain.\n\nOther lowland areas are located in the coastal districts of [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District|Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n]], [[Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9 District|Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9]], [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t District|Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t]], as well as the inland district of [[Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n District|Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n]]. There are some hills or mountains near the coast in all of the coastal provinces, with the highest peak in Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t at 874m (Ba mountain, n\u00fai B\u00e0) and in [[Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9 District|Ph\u00f9 M\u1ef9]] at 602m.<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\nMountains form natural borders to the neighbouring provinces. C\u00f9 M\u00f4ng pass (\u0111\u00e8o C\u00f9 M\u00f4ng) is the main border crossing to [[Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean Province]]. [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|National Route 1A]] passes through this pass, while there is another road (1D) along the coast. The border to [[Gia Lai Province]] is the most mountainous, with the only road connection at An Kh\u00ea pass (\u0111\u00e8o An Kh\u00ea) between the towns of [[Ph\u00fa Phong]] in [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District]] and [[An Kh\u00ea]] in Gia Lai. The border to [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province]] is also very mountainous, with the major road and railway passing through [[B\u00ecnh \u0110\u00ea Pass]] (\u0111\u00e8o B\u00ecnh \u0110\u00ea) near [[Tam Quan]].<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\n===Hydrography===\n[[C\u00f4n River]] is the largest and most important river in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh. It forms a small delta north of [[Quy Nh\u01a1n]]. Most of it can be used as an inland waterway for transportation. This is probably one of the reasons why a major centre of power of [[Champa]] emerged along this river. Other rivers are [[L\u1ea1i Giang River]] at the centre of the lowland areas of Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n and Ho\u00e0i \u00c2n in northern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, [[M\u1ef9 C\u00e1t River]] in central B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, and [[H\u00e0 Thanh River]] along the valley in V\u00e2n Canh District in southern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh.<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\nThe largest lake is [[\u0110\u1ecbnh B\u00ecnh Lake]], an artificial lake mainly used for irrigation in the highlands of western B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh. Also in western B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh is [[V\u0129nh S\u01a1n Lake]] (h\u1ed3 V\u0129nh S\u01a1n) at V\u0129nh S\u01a1n Hydropower Station. Other major lakes include N\u00fai M\u1ed9t Lake (h\u1ed3 N\u00fai M\u1ed9t) in the south and H\u1ed9i S\u01a1n Lake (h\u1ed3 H\u1ed9i S\u01a1n) in the centre of the province.<ref name=\"atlas10\"/>\n\n===Mineral resources===\n[[Ilmenite]] reserves in Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t and [[graphite]] reserves in northern B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh are substantial and support significant local export industries.

While being significantly behind the main success stories of the region, namely [[Da Nang]] and [[Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province]], it is more developed than most other provinces in the region. It has been benefiting from its strategic position as one of the main gateways to the [[Central Highlands, Vietnam|Central Highlands]] and [[Quy Nh\u01a1n Port|its port]]. It is the region's third largest industrial center (mainly based on furniture manufacturing) and also has strong agricultural, forestry, livestock, and fishing sectors.\n\nIn 2007 B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh exported goods worth US$327.3 million, while importing goods worth US$141.6 million.<ref name=\"GSO09\"/> Most of the province's exports are furniture.\n\n===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===\n[[File:Binh Dinh farm.jpg|thumb|right|Farm in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh]]\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh has the most productive primary sector (agriculture, fishery, forestry) in the South Central Coast region, mostly because of its large output of rice, coconuts and its strong livestock, forestry and fishing sectors. It contributes roughly 23% of sector 1 GDP and rice output of the South Central Coast (while it has 17.7% of the region's population).<ref name=\"GSO09\">General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities'', Vietnam.

B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh is by far the largest producer of pork, both in terms of total output and per capita output (over 50&nbsp;kg per capita).<ref name=Atlat/> As of 2009, there were 684,300 pigs, 288,400 cows, 18,900 buffaloes, 3 million chickens and 2 million other poultry.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh has a large fishing sector. Its [[gross output]] contributes one fifth of the South Central Coast's total, ranking second after [[Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a Province]] (as of 2007).<ref name=GSO09calc>calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''.

Smaller manufacturing sectors include garments, paper, leather, plastics and rubber products.\n\n[[Nh\u01a1n H\u1ed9i Economic Zone]] is under construction, but behind schedule (as of September 2010).\n\n==Infrastructure and transport==\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's infrastructure has been significant for its economic development. It has traditionally been the site of a major port and the intersection of two national roads has further increased B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh's role as a gateway to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and access to the latter's resources.

[[Quy Nh\u01a1n Railway Station]] is around 10&nbsp;km east of the main railway. It is served by a daily train from Quy Nh\u01a1n to [[Saigon Railway Station]] and a train three times a week from Quy Nh\u01a1n to [[Vinh Railway Station]]. [[Tam Quan Railway Station]], located along North\u2013South Railway in [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District]], is frequented by only a few trains, such as the train to [[Vinh]].\n\n====Water transport====\n[[File:Quy Nhon Port.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quy Nh\u01a1n Port]]]]\nMuch of [[C\u00f4n River]] \u2013 almost up to the border in [[V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh|V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh District]] with [[Gia Lai Province]] \u2013 and a small stretch of [[Lai Giang River]] up to [[B\u1ed3ng S\u01a1n]] in [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District]] \u2013 are inland waterways and can be used for transportation.<ref name=\"Road Atlas 2004\"/> There has been a significant change in the use of inland waterways away from passenger and towards freight traffic between 2006 and 2008. The number of passenger decreased from 113,000 in 2006 to 42,000 in 2007 and 7,000 in 2008 and 2009, while freight transport on inland \u2013 apparently almost non-existent until 2008 \u2013 has accounted for 10 tons and around 70 tons km in 2008 and 2009, respectively.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> This is, however, still minuscule compared to other modes of transportation within the province. Maritime transport within the province has showed a declining trend in recent years and was at 171 tons and 31,000 passengers in 2009.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The two main ports of the province \u2013 [[Quy Nh\u01a1n Port]] and [[Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i Port]] \u2013 are both located in [[Quy Nh\u01a1n]]. In 2009 they had a combined freight turnover of 4,500 tons, with 30,856 tons handled by Quy Nh\u01a1n port, including 2016 tons of exported goods (mainly processed wood, furniture and stones).<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> Th\u1ecb N\u1ea1i Port, in contrast, mostly handles domestic trade. The volume of cargo handled has increased by more than 50 percent between 2005 and 2009.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\n====Ownership structure====\nWhile [[Vietnam Railways]] and the major seaports are owned and operated by the state sector, almost none of the local transport is state-run. Household businesses are dominant in the passenger sector, accounting for more than 70 percent of passengers and passenger kilometers over the last few years \u2013 although their share has been decreasing.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The other traditionally significant enterprise form have been collective enterprises. Their share has been decreasing, too, while private sector participation has been increasing from a very low base since 2008. As of 2009, the share of the collective sector (11.8 percent) is still slightly ahead of the private sector (11.6 percent), but it has been clearly overtaken in terms of passenger km, with shares of 5.4 and 23.3 percent, respectively.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The freight transport sector is dominated by the household and private sector. While household businesses take the lead in freight volume (54.8 percent compared to 41.4 percent), private companies have a larger share if distance travelled (tons.km) is considered (50 percent compared to 43.4 percent). Both private and household businesses have been able to grow and increase their share in recent years, mainly at the expense of the declining collective sector.\n\n===Telecommunication===\nIn 2009, there were 74.1 telephone subscribers per 100 inhabitants. The total number of subscriptions in the province was 1.1 million \u2013 a rapid increase from the 101,230 in 2005, most of which was contributed by mobile phones.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The calling time has also increased rapidly in the same period, from 53 to 488 million minutes.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> The quality of telecommunications has received relatively good assessments, with 70.74 percent of respondents to a survey stating that it is good or very good.<ref name=\"PCI09\"/> As of 2009, there were 28,919 Internet subscribers in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, up from 18,260 in 2008 and 8,716 in 2006.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> While telephones and Internet connections have become much more widespread, the number of letters and money telegrams sent has decreased from 119,000 in 2005 to 77,421 in 2009 and telegram services have been discontinued after 2007.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\n==Demography==\nB\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh had a population of 1.488 million in 2009,<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/> making it the most populous province of the [[South Central Coast]].

There is another relatively large concentration in the northern [[Ho\u00e0i Nh\u01a1n District]] with a population of 206,700 (2009) and a population density of 499/km\u00b2. Population density per km\u00b2 in the rest of the province range from 30 to 40 in V\u00e2n Canh, An L\u00e3o, and V\u0129nh Th\u1ea1nh to 982 in Qui Nh\u01a1n.<ref name=\"BDSO09\"/>\n\nThe eastern lowlands and [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n District]] are largely ethnically homogeneous.
