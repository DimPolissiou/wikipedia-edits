For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later- at the [[Council of Tours]]- to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

For instance in ninth-century Spain \u27e8saeculum\u27e9 was simply the correct way to spell [sjeglo], meaning 'century'. The writer would not have actually said [s\u025bkulum] any more than a modern English speaker would pronounce \u27e8knight\u27e9 as *[kn\u026axt].<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 44\u201350</ref> \n\n[[Ecclesiastical Latin]], in its spoken form, was created later during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The British scholar [[Alcuin]], tasked by [[Charlemagne]] with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. A word such as \u27e8viridiarium\u27e9 'orchard' now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than as [[Old French]] ''vergier.''<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 104\u20137</ref>\n\nThis had the effect of rendering [[Sermon|sermons]] completely unintelligible to the general public, which prompted officials a few years later at the [[Council of Tours]] to order sermons to be rendered ''in rusticam romanam linguam'', 'in plain roman speech', i.e. in Romance.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 118-20</ref> Another issue was that now two types of speech, Romance and Church Latin, had to coexist within one writing system. Within the same century the first attempts were made to devise an orthography specifically for Romance, as can be seen in the [[Oaths of Strasbourg]] and the [[Sequence of Saint Eulalia|Canticle of Saint Eulalia]], both written in France. As the Carolingian Reforms spread to other Romance-speaking areas, local scholars devised orthographies for their own varieties of Romance as well.<ref>Wright (1982), pp. 122\u201332, 143\u20134</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist-lg}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=|first=|last2=|date=2014-11-14|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|editor2-last=Schweickard|editor2-first=Wolfgang|editor3-last=Gouvert|editor3-first=Joannes|editor4-last=Kramer|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom)|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110313482|journal=Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=|pages=295|doi=10.1515/9783110313482|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/963581913|title=Dictionnaire \u00c9tymologique Roman (D\u00c9Rom) 2|date=2016|publisher=De Gruyter|year=2016|isbn=3-11-045361-4|editor-last=Buchi|editor-first=\u00c9va|location=|pages=|oclc=963581913|editor-last2=Gouvert|editor-first2=Xavier}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Loporcaro|first=Michele|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1107082342|title=Vowel Length From Latin to Romance|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=978-0-19-965655-4|location=|pages=25-30|oclc=1107082342}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Dworkin|first=Steven N.|date=2016-01-01|title=Do Romanists need to reconstruct Proto-Romance?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr romanische Philologie|volume=132|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1515/zrp-2016-0001|issn=1865-9063|via=}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Ferguson|first=Thaddeus|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9783110806960|title=A History of the Romance Vowel Systems through Paradigmatic Reconstruction|date=1976-01-31|publisher=De Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-080696-0|location=Berlin, Boston|pages=78}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Wilkinson, Hugh E.|first=|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1055897845|title=Notes on the development of -KJ-, -TJ- in Spanish and Portuguese|date=1926|publisher=Aoyama Gakuin University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=11-14|oclc=1055897845}}\n* {{Citation|last=Zampaulo|first=Andr\u00e9|title=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance languages|date=2019-08-22|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198807384.003.0006|work=Palatal Sound Change in the Romance Languages|volume=|pages=150\u2013199|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-880738-4|access-date=2020-04-01}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=De Dardel|first=R.|last2=Gaeng|first2=P.

Not all C or C++ keywords are implemented, however, and some Rust functions (such as the use of the keyword <code>match</code> for [[pattern matching]]) will be less familiar to those versed in these languages. Despite the superficial resemblance to C and C++, the syntax of Rust in a deeper sense is closer to that of the [[ML (programming language)|ML family]] of languages and the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell language]]. Nearly every part of a function body is an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]],<ref name=\"grammar_expr\">{{cite web |url=https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5b13bff5203c1bdc6ac6dc87f69b5359a9503078/src/grammar/parser-lalr.y#L1309-L1573 |title=rust/src/grammar/parser-lalr.y |date=2017-05-23 |access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref> even control flow operators. For example, the ordinary <code>if</code> expression also takes the place of [[?:|C's ternary conditional]]. A function need not end with a <code>return</code> expression: in this case if the semicolon is omitted, the last expression in the function creates the [[return value]].\n\n===Memory safety===\nRust is designed to be [[memory safe]], and thus it does not permit [[null pointer]]s, [[dangling pointer]]s, or [[data race]]s in safe code.<ref name=\"cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-3514_7-57577639/samsung-joins-mozillas-quest-for-rust/ |title=Samsung joins Mozilla's quest for Rust |last=Rosenblatt |first=Seth |date=2013-04-03 |access-date=2013-04-05 |quote=[Brendan Eich] noted that every year browsers fall victim to hacking in the annual Pwn2Own contest at the CanSecWest conference. \"There's no free memory reads\" in Rust, he said, but there are in C++.

Instead, memory and other resources are managed through the ''[[resource acquisition is initialization]]'' (RAII) convention, with optional [[reference counting]]. Rust provides deterministic management of resources, with very low [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]].{{citation needed |date=December 2017}} Rust also favors [[Call stack|stack allocation]] of values and does not perform implicit [[Object type (object-oriented programming)#Boxing|boxing]].\n\nThere is also a concept of references (using the <code>&</code> symbol), which do not involve run-time reference counting. The safety of using such pointers is verified at compile time by the borrow checker, preventing dangling pointers and other forms of [[undefined behavior]].\n\n===Ownership===\nRust has an ownership system where all values have a unique owner, and the scope of the value is the same as the scope of the owner.<ref name=\"RustBook\">{{cite book |last=Klabnik |first=Steve  |last2=Nichols |first2=Carol |date=June 2018 |title=The Rust Programming Language |url=https://nostarch.com/rust |location=San Francisco, California |publisher=No Starch Press |page=44 |chapter=Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership |isbn=978-1-593-27828-1 |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html |title=The Rust Programming Language: What is Ownership |website=Rust-lang.org |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Values can be passed by immutable reference, using <code>&T</code>, by mutable reference, using <code>&mut T</code>, or by value, using <code>T</code>. At all times, there can either be multiple immutable references or one mutable reference (an implicit [[readers-writer lock]]). The Rust compiler enforces these rules at compile time and also checks that all references are valid.\n\n===Types and polymorphism===\nThe [[type system]] supports a mechanism similar to [[type class]]es, called \"[[Trait (computer programming)|traits]]\", inspired directly by the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell language]]. This is a facility for [[ad hoc polymorphism]], achieved by adding constraints to type variable declarations. Other features from Haskell, such as [[Type class#Higher-kinded polymorphism|higher-kinded polymorphism]], are not yet supported.\n\nRust features [[type inference]], for variables declared with the [[Reserved word|keyword]] <code>let</code>. Such variables do not require a value to be initially assigned to determine their type. A [[compile time|compile-time]] error results if any branch of code fails to assign a value to the variable.<ref name=\"type-inference\">{{cite web |url=http://pcwalton.blogspot.com/2010/10/rust-features-i-type-inference.html |title=Rust Features I: Type Inference |last=Walton |first=Patrick |date=2010-10-01 |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref> Variables assigned multiple times must be marked with the keyword <code>mut</code>.\n\nFunctions can be given [[Generic programming|generic]] [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]], which usually require the generic type to implement a certain trait or traits. Within such a function, the generic value can only be used through those traits. This means that a generic function can be type-checked as soon as it is defined. This is in contrast to [[Template (C++)|C++ templates]], which are fundamentally [[Duck typing|duck typed]] and cannot be checked until instantiated with concrete types. C++ [[Concepts (C++)|concepts]] address the same issue and are expected to be part of [[C++20]] (2020), though they still don't allow the C++ compiler to typecheck a template without concrete instantiation.\n\nHowever, the ''implementation'' of Rust generics is similar to the typical implementation of C++ templates: a separate copy of the code is generated for each instantiation. This is called monomorphization and contrasts with the [[type erasure]] scheme typically used in Java and Haskell. The benefit of monomorphization is optimized code for each specific use case; the drawback is increased compile time and size of the resulting binaries.\n\nThe object system within Rust is based around implementations, [[Trait (computer programming)|traits]] and [[Struct (C programming language)|structured types]]. Implementations fulfill a role similar to that of [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] within other languages and are defined with the keyword <code>impl</code>. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] are provided by traits; they allow [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] to be defined and [[Mixin|mixed in]] to implementations. Structured types are used to define fields. Implementations and traits cannot define fields themselves, and only traits can provide inheritance. Among other benefits, this prevents the [[diamond problem]] of [[multiple inheritance]], as in C++. In other words, Rust supports interface inheritance, but replaces implementation inheritance with [[Object composition|composition]]; see [[composition over inheritance]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rustacean-orig-noshadow.svg|alt=A bright orange crab icon|thumb|Rust users refer to themselves as Rustaceans and use Ferris as their mascot]]\nThe language grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare,<ref name=\"Rust Project FAQ\" /> who stated that the project was possibly named after the [[Rust (fungus)|rust family of fungi]].<ref name=\"rust-name\">{{cite web |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/27jvdt/internet_archaeology_the_definitive_endall_source/ |title=Internet archaeology: the definitive, end-all source for why Rust is named \"Rust\" |website=Reddit.com |date=2014-06-07 |access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009<ref name=\"Rust Project FAQ\"/> and announced it in 2010.<ref name=\"future-tense\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/BrendanEich/future-tense-7782010 |title=Future Tense |date=2011-04-29 |access-date=2012-02-06 |quote=At Mozilla Summit 2010, we launched Rust, a new programming language motivated by safety and concurrency for parallel hardware, the \u201cmanycore\u201d future which is upon us.}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |title=Project Servo|format=pdf |conference=Mozilla Annual Summit 2010 |date=7 July 2010|location=Whistler, Canada |url=http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf |access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> The same year, work shifted from the initial [[compiler]] (written in [[OCaml]]) to the [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting compiler]] written in Rust.<ref name=\"rust-in-rust\">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815054745/http://blog.mozilla.org/graydon/2010/10/02/rust-progress/ |url=http://blog.mozilla.com/graydon/2010/10/02/rust-progress/|archive-date=2014-08-15 |title=Rust Progress |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |date=2010-10-02 |access-date=2010-10-30}}</ref>  Named {{mono|rustc}}, it successfully [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|compiled itself]] in 2011.<ref name=\"rust-compiles-rust\">{{cite web |url=https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2011-April/000330.html |title=[rust-dev&#93; stage1/rustc builds |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |date=2011-04-20 |access-date=2011-04-20 |quote=After that last change fixing the logging scope context bug, looks like stage1/rustc builds.

Version 0.2 introduced classes for the first time, with version 0.3 adding several features, including destructors and polymorphism through the use of interfaces.  In Rust 0.4, traits were added as a means to provide inheritance; interfaces were unified with traits and removed as a separate feature. Classes were also removed, replaced by a combination of implementations and structured types.{{citation needed |date=August 2016}}\n\nStarting in Rust 0.9 and ending in Rust 0.11, Rust had two built-in pointer types: <code>~</code> and <code>@</code>, simplifying the core memory model.

One of the goals of Rust's type system is to support these patterns exactly as C++ does, but to enforce their safe usage. In this way, the goal is to be competitive with the vast majority of idiomatic C++ in performance, while remaining memory-safe&nbsp;...}}</ref><ref name=\"how-fast-is-rust\">{{cite web |url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/complement-lang-faq.html#how-fast-is-rust? |title=How Fast Is Rust? |last=|first=|date= |website=The Rust Programming Language FAQ |publisher= |access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Syntax ===\n\nThe concrete [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntax]] of Rust is similar to [[C (programming language)|C]] and C++, with blocks of code delimited by [[Bracket#Curly brackets|curly brackets]], and [[control flow]] keywords such as <code>[[Conditional (computer programming)|if]]</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>for</code>. Not all C or C++ keywords are implemented, however, and some Rust functions (such as the use of the keyword <code>match</code> for [[pattern matching]]) will be less familiar to those versed in these languages. Despite the superficial resemblance to C and C++, the syntax of Rust in a deeper sense is closer to that of the [[ML (programming language)|ML family]] of languages and the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell language]]. Nearly every part of a function body is an [[Expression (computer science)|expression]],<ref name=\"grammar_expr\">{{cite web |url=https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5b13bff5203c1bdc6ac6dc87f69b5359a9503078/src/grammar/parser-lalr.y#L1309-L1573 |title=rust/src/grammar/parser-lalr.y |date=2017-05-23 |access-date=2017-05-23}}</ref> even control flow operators. For example, the ordinary <code>if</code> expression also takes the place of [[?:|C's ternary conditional]]. A function need not end with a <code>return</code> expression: in this case if the semicolon is omitted, the last expression in the function creates the [[return value]].\n\n===Memory safety===\nRust is designed to be [[memory safe]], and thus it does not permit [[null pointer]]s, [[dangling pointer]]s, or [[data race]]s in safe code.<ref name=\"cnet\">{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-3514_7-57577639/samsung-joins-mozillas-quest-for-rust/ |title=Samsung joins Mozilla's quest for Rust |last=Rosenblatt |first=Seth |date=2013-04-03 |access-date=2013-04-05 |quote=[Brendan Eich] noted that every year browsers fall victim to hacking in the annual Pwn2Own contest at the CanSecWest conference. \"There's no free memory reads\" in Rust, he said, but there are in C++.

Instead, memory and other resources are managed through the ''[[resource acquisition is initialization]]'' (RAII) convention, with optional [[reference counting]]. Rust provides deterministic management of resources, with very low [[Overhead (computing)|overhead]].{{citation needed |date=December 2017}} Rust also favors [[Call stack|stack allocation]] of values and does not perform implicit [[Object type (object-oriented programming)#Boxing|boxing]].\n\nThere is also a concept of references (using the <code>&</code> symbol), which do not involve run-time reference counting. The safety of using such pointers is verified at compile time by the borrow checker, preventing dangling pointers and other forms of [[undefined behavior]].\n\n===Ownership===\nRust has an ownership system where all values have a unique owner, and the scope of the value is the same as the scope of the owner.<ref name=\"RustBook\">{{cite book |last=Klabnik |first=Steve  |last2=Nichols |first2=Carol |date=June 2018 |title=The Rust Programming Language |url=https://nostarch.com/rust |location=San Francisco, California |publisher=No Starch Press |page=44 |chapter=Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership |isbn=978-1-593-27828-1 |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html |title=The Rust Programming Language: What is Ownership |website=Rust-lang.org |language=en |access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref> Values can be passed by immutable reference, using <code>&T</code>, by mutable reference, using <code>&mut T</code>, or by value, using <code>T</code>. At all times, there can either be multiple immutable references or one mutable reference (an implicit [[readers-writer lock]]). The Rust compiler enforces these rules at compile time and also checks that all references are valid.\n\n===Types and polymorphism===\nThe [[type system]] supports a mechanism similar to [[type class]]es, called \"[[Trait (computer programming)|traits]]\", inspired directly by the [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell language]]. This is a facility for [[ad hoc polymorphism]], achieved by adding constraints to type variable declarations. Other features from Haskell, such as [[Type class#Higher-kinded polymorphism|higher-kinded polymorphism]], are not yet supported.\n\nRust features [[type inference]], for variables declared with the [[Reserved word|keyword]] <code>let</code>. Such variables do not require a value to be initially assigned to determine their type. A [[compile time|compile-time]] error results if any branch of code fails to assign a value to the variable.<ref name=\"type-inference\">{{cite web |url=http://pcwalton.blogspot.com/2010/10/rust-features-i-type-inference.html |title=Rust Features I: Type Inference |last=Walton |first=Patrick |date=2010-10-01 |access-date=2011-01-21}}</ref> Variables assigned multiple times must be marked with the keyword <code>mut</code>.\n\nFunctions can be given [[Generic programming|generic]] [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]], which usually require the generic type to implement a certain trait or traits. Within such a function, the generic value can only be used through those traits. This means that a generic function can be type-checked as soon as it is defined. This is in contrast to [[Template (C++)|C++ templates]], which are fundamentally [[Duck typing|duck typed]] and cannot be checked until instantiated with concrete types. C++ [[Concepts (C++)|concepts]] address the same issue and are expected to be part of [[C++20]] (2020), though they still don't allow C++ compiler to typecheck a template without concrete instantiation.\n\nHowever, the ''implementation'' of Rust generics is similar to the typical implementation of C++ templates: a separate copy of the code is generated for each instantiation. This is called monomorphization and contrasts with the [[type erasure]] scheme typically used in Java and Haskell. The benefit of monomorphization is optimized code for each specific use case; the drawback is increased compile time and size of the resulting binaries.\n\nThe object system within Rust is based around implementations, [[Trait (computer programming)|traits]] and [[Struct (C programming language)|structured types]]. Implementations fulfill a role similar to that of [[Class (computer programming)|classes]] within other languages and are defined with the keyword <code>impl</code>. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance]] and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphism]] are provided by traits; they allow [[Method (computer programming)|methods]] to be defined and [[Mixin|mixed in]] to implementations. Structured types are used to define fields. Implementations and traits cannot define fields themselves, and only traits can provide inheritance. Among other benefits, this prevents the [[diamond problem]] of [[multiple inheritance]], as in C++. In other words, Rust supports interface inheritance, but replaces implementation inheritance with [[Object composition|composition]]; see [[composition over inheritance]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rustacean-orig-noshadow.svg|alt=A bright orange crab icon|thumb|Rust users refer to themselves as Rustaceans and use Ferris as their mascot]]\nThe language grew out of a personal project begun in 2006 by Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare,<ref name=\"Rust Project FAQ\" /> who stated that the project was possibly named after the [[Rust (fungus)|rust family of fungi]].<ref name=\"rust-name\">{{cite web |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/27jvdt/internet_archaeology_the_definitive_endall_source/ |title=Internet archaeology: the definitive, end-all source for why Rust is named \"Rust\" |website=Reddit.com |date=2014-06-07 |access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009<ref name=\"Rust Project FAQ\"/> and announced it in 2010.<ref name=\"future-tense\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slideshare.net/BrendanEich/future-tense-7782010 |title=Future Tense |date=2011-04-29 |access-date=2012-02-06 |quote=At Mozilla Summit 2010, we launched Rust, a new programming language motivated by safety and concurrency for parallel hardware, the \u201cmanycore\u201d future which is upon us.}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |title=Project Servo|format=pdf |conference=Mozilla Annual Summit 2010 |date=7 July 2010|location=Whistler, Canada |url=http://venge.net/graydon/talks/intro-talk-2.pdf |access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> The same year, work shifted from the initial [[compiler]] (written in [[OCaml]]) to the [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting compiler]] written in Rust.<ref name=\"rust-in-rust\">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815054745/http://blog.mozilla.org/graydon/2010/10/02/rust-progress/ |url=http://blog.mozilla.com/graydon/2010/10/02/rust-progress/|archive-date=2014-08-15 |title=Rust Progress |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |date=2010-10-02 |access-date=2010-10-30}}</ref>  Named {{mono|rustc}}, it successfully [[Bootstrapping (compilers)|compiled itself]] in 2011.<ref name=\"rust-compiles-rust\">{{cite web |url=https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/rust-dev/2011-April/000330.html |title=[rust-dev&#93; stage1/rustc builds |last=Hoare |first=Graydon |date=2011-04-20 |access-date=2011-04-20 |quote=After that last change fixing the logging scope context bug, looks like stage1/rustc builds.

The typestate system modeled assertions before and after program statements, through use of a special <code>check</code> statement. Discrepancies could be discovered at compile time, rather than when a program was running, as might be the case with [[Assertion (computing)|assertions]] in C or C++ code. The typestate concept was not unique to Rust, as it was first introduced in the language [[NIL (programming language)|NIL]].<ref name=\"typestate\">{{cite journal |last=Strom |first=Robert E. |last2=Yemini |first2=Shaula |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/classic/tse12-typestate.pdf |title=Typestate: A Programming Language Concept for Enhancing Software Reliability|year=1986|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|issn=0098-5589 |access-date=2010-11-14}}</ref> Typestates were removed because in practice they were little used, though the same function can still be achieved with a ''branding pattern''.<ref name=\"brand-pattern\">{{cite web |url=https://pcwalton.github.io/2012/12/26/typestate-is-dead.html |title=Typestate Is Dead, Long Live Typestate! |last=Walton |first=Patrick |date=2012-12-26 |website=GitHub |access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref>\n\nThe style of the object system changed considerably within versions 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 of Rust. Version 0.2 introduced classes for the first time, with version 0.3 adding several features, including destructors and polymorphism through the use of interfaces.  In Rust 0.4, traits were added as a means to provide inheritance; interfaces were unified with traits and removed as a separate feature. Classes were also removed, replaced by a combination of implementations and structured types.{{citation needed |date=August 2016}}\n\nStarting in Rust 0.9 and ending in Rust 0.11, Rust had two built-in pointer types: <code>~</code> and <code>@</code>, simplifying the core memory model.

Initially conceived in the early 1990s for [[aerial reconnaissance]] and forward observation roles, the Predator carries cameras and other sensors. It was modified and upgraded to carry and fire two [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] [[missile]]s or other munitions. The aircraft entered service in 1995, and saw combat in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]], [[War in North-West Pakistan|Pakistan]], the [[NATO intervention in Bosnia]], [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]], the [[Iraq War]], [[Yemen]], the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[2014 US-Coalition intervention in Syria|2014 intervention in Syria]], and [[Somalia]].\n\nThe USAF describes the Predator as a \"Tier II\" MALE UAS (medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system). The UAS consists of four aircraft or \"air vehicles\" with sensors, a [[ground control station]] (GCS), and a primary satellite link communication suite.<ref name=\"USAF Tier system scheme\" /> Powered by a [[Rotax]] engine and driven by a propeller, the air vehicle can fly up to {{convert|400|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} to a target, loiter overhead for 14&nbsp;hours, then return to its base.\n\nThe RQ-1 Predator was the primary remotely piloted aircraft used for offensive operations by the USAF and the CIA in Afghanistan and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Pakistani tribal areas]] from 2001 until the introduction of the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]]; it has also been deployed elsewhere. Because offensive uses of the Predator are [[Classified information in the United States|classified by the U.S.]], U.S. military officials have reported an appreciation for the intelligence and reconnaissance-gathering abilities of RPAs but declined to publicly discuss their offensive use.<ref name=\"Drone aircraft in a stepped-up war in Afghanistan and Pakistan\" /> The United States Air Force retired the Predator in 2018.<ref name=\"ain13march18\">[https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2018-03-13/us-air-force-ends-predator-operations U.S. Air Force Ends Predator Operations].

The CIA preferred small, lightweight, unobtrusive drones, in contrast to the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). In the early 1990s, the CIA became interested in the \"[[History of unmanned aerial vehicles#Amber|Amber]]\", a drone developed by Leading Systems, Inc.<ref name=\"spyflight.co.uk\" /> The company's owner, [[Abraham Karem]], was the former chief designer for the [[Israeli Air Force]], and had immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1970s. Karem's company had since gone bankrupt and been bought up by a U.S. defense contractor, from whom the CIA secretly bought five drones (now called the \"[[General Atomics GNAT|GNAT]]\"). Karem agreed to produce a quiet engine for the vehicle, which had until then sounded like \"a lawnmower in the sky\". The new development became known as the \"Predator\".<ref name=\"penguin\" /><ref name=\"indispensable\" />\n\n[[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]] (GA) was awarded a contract to develop the Predator in January 1994, and the initial Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) phase lasted from January 1994 to June 1996. First flight took place on 3 July 1994 at the [[El Mirage Field|El Mirage airfield]] in the [[Mojave Desert]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whittle|first1=Richard|title=Predator : The Secret Origins of the Drone Revolution|date=2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Co|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-9964-5|pages=85, 86|edition=First}}</ref> The aircraft itself was a derivative of the [[General Atomics GNAT|GA Gnat 750]]. During the ACTD phase, three systems were purchased from GA, comprising twelve aircraft and three ground control stations.<ref name=\"FOS\" />\n\nFrom April through May 1995, the Predator ACTD aircraft were flown as a part of the Roving Sands 1995 exercises in the U.S. The exercise operations were successful, and this led to the decision to deploy the system to the Balkans later in the summer of 1995.<ref name=\"FOS\" />\n\nDuring the ACTD, Predators were operated by a combined Army/Navy/Air Force/Marine team managed by the Navy's Joint Program Office for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (JPO-UAV) and first deployed to Gjader, Albania, for operations in the Former Yugoslavia in spring 1995.<ref name=\"FOS\" />\n\nBy the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States Afghan campaign in 2001]], the USAF had acquired 60 Predators, and said it had lost 20 of them in action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Few if any of the losses were from enemy action, the worst problem apparently being foul weather, particularly icy conditions. Some critics within the Pentagon saw the high loss rate as a sign of poor operational procedures. In response to the losses caused by cold weather conditions, a few of the later USAF Predators were fitted with [[Deicing|de-icing]] systems, along with an uprated turbocharged engine and improved avionics. This improved \"Block 1\" version was referred to as the \"RQ-1B\", or the \"MQ-1B\" if it carried munitions; the corresponding [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|air vehicle designation]] was \"RQ-1L\" or \"MQ-1L\".\n\nThe Predator system was initially designated the '''RQ-1 Predator'''. The \"R\" is the [[United States Department of Defense]] designation for reconnaissance and the \"Q\" refers to an unmanned aircraft system.<ref name=\"A Short Primer on Military Aircraft Designations\" /> The \"1\" describes it as being the first of a series of aircraft systems built for unmanned reconnaissance. Pre-production systems were designated as RQ-1A, while the RQ-1B (not to be confused with the Predator B, which became the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]]) denotes the baseline production configuration. These are designations of the ''system'' as a unit. The actual aircraft themselves were designated RQ-1K for pre-production models, and RQ-1L for production models.<ref name=\"vector\" /> In 2002, the USAF officially changed the designation to MQ-1 (\"M\" for multi-role) to reflect its growing use as an armed aircraft.<ref name=\"FS1\" />\n\n===Command and sensor systems===\nDuring campaign in the former Yugoslavia, a Predator's pilot would sit with several payload specialists in a van near the runway of the drone's operating base. Direct radio signals controlled the drone's takeoff and initial ascent. Then communications shifted to military satellite networks linked to the pilot's van. Pilots experienced a delay of several seconds between moving their [[Joystick|sticks]] and the drone's response. But by 2000, improvements in communications systems made it possible, at least in theory, to fly the drone remotely from great distances. It was no longer necessary to use close-up radio signals during the Predator's takeoff and ascent. The entire flight could be controlled by satellite from any [[command and control]] center with the right equipment. The CIA proposed to attempt over Afghanistan the first fully remote Predator flight operations, piloted from the agency's headquarters at [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]].<ref name=\"penguin1\" />\n\nThe Predator air vehicle and sensors are controlled from the ground station via a [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] data link or a [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 [[Multi-spectral]] Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture [[thermographic camera]] (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame [[radar imaging|radar images]]. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAll later Predators are equipped with a [[laser designator]] that allows the pilot to identify targets for other aircraft and even provide the [[laser guidance]] for manned aircraft. This laser is also the designator for the [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] that are carried on the MQ-1.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Deployment methodology===\n[[File:MQ-1 Predator controls 2007-08-07.jpg|thumb|Predator operators at Balad Camp Anaconda, Iraq, August 2007]]\n\nEach Predator air vehicle can be disassembled into six main components and loaded into a container nicknamed \"the coffin.\" This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station and it is designed to roll into a [[C-130 Hercules]]. The Predator primary satellite link consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40&nbsp;meters (5,000 by 125&nbsp;ft) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Air Force uses a concept called \"Remote-Split Operations\" where the satellite datalink is located in a different location and is connected to the GCS through fiber optic cabling. This allows Predators to be launched and recovered by a small \"Launch and Recovery Element\" and then handed off to a \"Mission Control Element\" for the rest of the flight. This allows a smaller number of troops to be deployed to a forward location, and consolidates control of the different flights in one location.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe improvements in the MQ-1B production version include an ARC-210 radio, an APX-100 IFF/SIF with mode 4, a glycol-weeping \"wet wings\" ice mitigation system, upgraded turbo-charged engine, fuel injection, longer wings, dual alternators as well as other improvements.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nOn 18 May 2006, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a certificate of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|M/RQ-9]] aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests had been made in 2005 for the aircraft to be used in [[search and rescue]] operations following [[Hurricane Katrina]], but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]] with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the [[infrared signature]] of a human body from an altitude of 3&nbsp;km (10,000&nbsp;ft), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.<ref name=\"www2006\" />\n\nThe longest declassified Predator flight to date lasted for 40&nbsp;hours, 5&nbsp;minutes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The total flight time reached 1 million hours in April 2010, according to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.<ref name=\"Predator-series UAVs surpass one million flight hours\" />\n\n===Armed versions===\n[[File:AGM-114 Hellfire hung on a Predator drone.JPEG|thumb|Close-up of the [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] missile [[Hardpoint#Pylon|pylon]], 2004.]]\n\nThe USAF [[Big Safari|BIG SAFARI program office]] managed the Predator program and was given direction on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. This led to it being fitted with reinforced wings and stores [[Hardpoint#Pylon|pylons]] to carry munitions, as well as a [[laser designator]]. The RQ-1 conducted its first firing of a [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] [[anti-tank missile]] on 16 February 2001; over a bombing range near [[Creech Air Force Base|Indian Springs Air Force Station]] north of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], an inert AGM-114C successfully hit a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, the decision was made to move immediately to increment two of the testing phase, which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack; it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.<ref name=\"vector\" /><ref name=\"Predator missile launch test totally successful\" /><ref>[http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-q-1-predator-became-a-history-changing-deadly-missi-1760408544 The Q-1 Predator Became A History-Changing Deadly Missile Slinger 15 Years Ago Today] \u2013 Foxtrotalpha.Japolnik.com, 21 February 2016</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 2000\u20132001, after seeing the results of Predator reconnaissance in Afghanistan (see below), [[Cofer Black]], head of the CIA's [[Counterterrorist Center]] (CTC), became a \"vocal advocate\" of arming the Predator with missiles to target [[Osama bin Laden]] in the country. He also believed that CIA pressure and practical interest were causing the USAF's armed Predator program to be significantly accelerated. Black, and \"Richard\", who was in charge of the CTC's [[Bin Laden Issue Station]], continued to press during 2001 for a Predator armed with Hellfire missiles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nFurther weapons tests occurred between 22 May and 7 June 2001, with mixed results. While missile accuracy was excellent, there were some problems with missile fuzing...\" In the first week of June, in the Nevada Desert, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan [[Tarnak Farms|Tarnak]] residence. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. However, the armed Predator did not go into action before the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref name=\"penguin2\" /><ref name=\"The CIA and the Predator Drone (2000\u20131)\" /><ref name=\"9-11commission15\" /><ref name=\"washingtonpost2002\" />\n\nThe USAF has also investigated using the Predator to drop battlefield ground sensors and to carry and deploy the [[Miniature UAVs#NRL \"Dragon Eye\", \"Swallow\" and \"Finder\"|\"Finder\"]] [[Miniature UAV|mini-UAV]].<ref name=\"vector\" />\n\n===Later development and future===\nTwo unarmed versions, known as the [[General Atomics ALTUS]] were built, ALTUS I for the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] and ALTUS II for the [[NASA]] [[ERAST Project]] in 1997 and 1996, respectively.<ref name=\"NASA Dryden Fact Sheet \u2013 ALTUS II\" />\n\nBased on the MQ-1 Predator, the [[General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle]] was developed for the U.S. Army.\n\nThe USAF ordered a total of 259 Predators, and due to retirements and crashes the number in Air Force operation was reduced to 154 as of May 2014.  Budget proposals planned to retire the Predator fleet between FY 2015 and 2017 in favor of the larger [[MQ-9 Reaper]], which has greater payload and range.  The Predators would likely be stored at [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]] or be given to other organizations willing to take them.

Dubbed \"Afghan Eyes\", it involved a projected 60-day trial run of Predators over the country. The first experimental flight was held on 7 September 2000. White House security chief [[Richard A. Clarke]] was impressed by the resulting video footage; he hoped that the drones might eventually be used to target Bin Laden with cruise missiles or armed aircraft. Clarke's enthusiasm was matched by that of [[Cofer Black]], head of the CIA's Counterterrorist Center (CTC), and [[Charles E. Allen|Charles Allen]], in charge of the CIA's intelligence-collection operations. The three men backed an immediate trial run of reconnaissance flights. Ten out of the ensuing 15 Predator missions over Afghanistan were rated successful. On at least two flights, a Predator spotted a tall man in white robes at bin Laden's [[Tarnak Farm]] compound outside [[Kandahar]]; the figure was subsequently deemed to be \"probably bin Laden\".<ref name=\"9-11commission189\" /> By October 2000, deteriorating weather conditions made it difficult for the Predator to fly from its base in [[Uzbekistan]], and the flights were suspended.<ref name=\"penguin3\" />\n\n[[File:Predator and Hellfire.jpg|thumb|Predator launching a Hellfire missile]]\n\nOn 16 February 2001 at [[Nellis Air Force Base]], a Predator successfully fired three Hellfire [[AGM-114 Hellfire|AGM-114C]] missiles into a target. The newly armed Predators were given the designation of MQ-1A. In the first week of June 2001, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan [[Tarnak Farms|Tarnak]] residence built at a Nevada testing site. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. On 4 September 2001 (after the Bush cabinet approved a Qaeda/Taliban plan), CIA chief Tenet ordered the agency to resume reconnaissance flights. The Predators were now weapons-capable, but didn't carry missiles because the host country (presumably Uzbekistan) hadn't granted permission.\n\nSubsequent to 9/11, approval was quickly granted to ship the missiles, and the Predator aircraft and missiles reached their overseas location on 16 September 2001. The first mission was flown over [[Kabul]] and [[Kandahar]] on 18 September without carrying weapons. Subsequent host nation approval was granted on 7 October and the first armed mission was flown on the same day.<ref name=\"9-11commission213\" />\n* In February 2002, armed Predators are thought to have been used to destroy a [[sport utility vehicle]] belonging to suspected Taliban leader Mullah [[Mohammed Omar]] and mistakenly killed Afghan scrap metal collectors near [[Zhawar Kili]] because one of them resembled [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref name=\"entrepreneurship\" /><ref name=\"technology\" />\n* On 4 March 2002, a CIA-operated Predator fired a Hellfire missile into a reinforced Taliban machine gun bunker that had pinned down an [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Ranger]] team whose [[CH-47 Chinook]] had crashed on the top of [[Takur Ghar]] Mountain in Afghanistan. Previous attempts by flights of [[F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcon]] aircraft were unable to destroy the bunker. This action took place during what has become known as the \"[[Battle of Takur Ghar|Battle of Roberts Ridge]]\", a part of [[Operation Anaconda]].

This was the first time in history a conventional aircraft and a drone had engaged each other in combat. Predators had been armed with [[AIM-92 Stinger]] air-to-air missiles, and were purportedly being used to \"bait\" Iraqi fighters, then run. However, Predators are 1,800&nbsp;mph slower than MIG-25's and the service ceiling is nearly 60,000&nbsp;ft lower, making the \"run\" segment of any \"bait and run\" mission a difficult task.  In this incident, the Predator did not run (or could not run fast enough), but instead fired one of its Stingers.

Initially conceived in the early 1990s for [[aerial reconnaissance]] and forward observation roles, the Predator carries cameras and other sensors. It was modified and upgraded to carry and fire two [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] [[missile]]s or other munitions. The aircraft entered service in 1995, and saw combat in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]], [[War in North-West Pakistan|Pakistan]], the [[NATO intervention in Bosnia]], [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]], the [[Iraq War]], [[Yemen]], the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[2014 US-Coalition intervention in Syria|2014 intervention in Syria]], and [[Somalia]].\n\nThe USAF describes the Predator as a \"Tier II\" MALE UAS (medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aircraft system). The UAS consists of four aircraft or \"air vehicles\" with sensors, a [[ground control station]] (GCS), and a primary satellite link communication suite.<ref name=\"USAF Tier system scheme\" /> Powered by a [[Rotax]] engine and driven by a propeller, the air vehicle can fly up to {{convert|400|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} to a target, loiter overhead for 14&nbsp;hours, then return to its base.\n\nThe RQ-1 Predator was the primary remotely piloted aircraft used for offensive operations by the USAF and the CIA in Afghanistan and the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|Pakistani tribal areas]] from 2001 until the introduction of the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]]; it has also been deployed elsewhere. Because offensive uses of the Predator are [[Classified information in the United States|classified by the U.S.]], U.S. military officials have reported an appreciation for the intelligence and reconnaissance-gathering abilities of RPAs but declined to publicly discuss their offensive use.<ref name=\"Drone aircraft in a stepped-up war in Afghanistan and Pakistan\" /> The United States Air Force retired the Predator in 2018.<ref name=\"ain13march18\">[https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2018-03-13/us-air-force-ends-predator-operations U.S. Air Force Ends Predator Operations]. ''Aviation International News''. 13 March 2018.</ref>\n\nCivilian applications for drones have included border enforcement and scientific studies, and to monitor wind direction and other characteristics of large forest fires (such as the drone that was used by the [[California Air National Guard]] in the August 2013 [[Rim Fire]]).<ref name=\"msn\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[File:MQ-1 Predator P1230014.jpg|thumb|At [[Paris Air Show]] 2007]]\n[[File:RQ-1 Predator.jpg|thumb|A Predator flies on a simulated Navy aerial reconnaissance flight off the coast of southern California on 5 December 1995.]]\n\nThe [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and [[the Pentagon]] began experimenting with unmanned [[reconnaissance aircraft]] (drones) in the early 1980s. The CIA preferred small, lightweight, unobtrusive drones, in contrast to the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). In the early 1990s, the CIA became interested in the \"[[History of unmanned aerial vehicles#Amber|Amber]]\", a drone developed by Leading Systems, Inc.<ref name=\"spyflight.co.uk\" /> The company's owner, [[Abraham Karem]], was the former chief designer for the [[Israeli Air Force]], and had immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1970s. Karem's company had since gone bankrupt and been bought up by a U.S. defense contractor, from whom the CIA secretly bought five drones (now called the \"[[General Atomics GNAT|GNAT]]\"). Karem agreed to produce a quiet engine for the vehicle, which had until then sounded like \"a lawnmower in the sky\". The new development became known as the \"Predator\".<ref name=\"penguin\" /><ref name=\"indispensable\" />\n\n[[General Atomics Aeronautical Systems]] (GA) was awarded a contract to develop the Predator in January 1994, and the initial Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) phase lasted from January 1994 to June 1996. First flight took place on 3 July 1994 at the [[El Mirage Field|El Mirage airfield]] in the [[Mojave Desert]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whittle|first1=Richard|title=Predator : The Secret Origins of the Drone Revolution|date=2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Co|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8050-9964-5|pages=85, 86|edition=First}}</ref> The aircraft itself was a derivative of the [[General Atomics GNAT|GA Gnat 750]]. During the ACTD phase, three systems were purchased from GA, comprising twelve aircraft and three ground control stations.<ref name=\"FOS\" />\n\nFrom April through May 1995, the Predator ACTD aircraft were flown as a part of the Roving Sands 1995 exercises in the U.S. The exercise operations were successful, and this led to the decision to deploy the system to the Balkans later in the summer of 1995.<ref name=\"FOS\" />\n\nDuring the ACTD, Predators were operated by a combined Army/Navy/Air Force/Marine team managed by the Navy's Joint Program Office for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (JPO-UAV) and first deployed to Gjader, Albania, for operations in the Former Yugoslavia in spring 1995.<ref name=\"FOS\" />\n\nBy the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States Afghan campaign in 2001]], the USAF had acquired 60 Predators, and said it had lost 20 of them in action.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Few if any of the losses were from enemy action, the worst problem apparently being foul weather, particularly icy conditions. Some critics within the Pentagon saw the high loss rate as a sign of poor operational procedures. In response to the losses caused by cold weather conditions, a few of the later USAF Predators were fitted with [[Deicing|de-icing]] systems, along with an uprated turbocharged engine and improved avionics. This improved \"Block 1\" version was referred to as the \"RQ-1B\", or the \"MQ-1B\" if it carried munitions; the corresponding [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|air vehicle designation]] was \"RQ-1L\" or \"MQ-1L\".\n\nThe Predator system was initially designated the '''RQ-1 Predator'''. The \"R\" is the [[United States Department of Defense]] designation for reconnaissance and the \"Q\" refers to an unmanned aircraft system.<ref name=\"A Short Primer on Military Aircraft Designations\" /> The \"1\" describes it as being the first of a series of aircraft systems built for unmanned reconnaissance. Pre-production systems were designated as RQ-1A, while the RQ-1B (not to be confused with the Predator B, which became the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]]) denotes the baseline production configuration. These are designations of the ''system'' as a unit. The actual aircraft themselves were designated RQ-1K for pre-production models, and RQ-1L for production models.<ref name=\"vector\" /> In 2002, the USAF officially changed the designation to MQ-1 (\"M\" for multi-role) to reflect its growing use as an armed aircraft.<ref name=\"FS1\" />\n\n===Command and sensor systems===\nDuring campaign in the former Yugoslavia, a Predator's pilot would sit with several payload specialists in a van near the runway of the drone's operating base. Direct radio signals controlled the drone's takeoff and initial ascent. Then communications shifted to military satellite networks linked to the pilot's van. Pilots experienced a delay of several seconds between moving their [[Joystick|sticks]] and the drone's response. But by 2000, improvements in communications systems made it possible, at least in theory, to fly the drone remotely from great distances. It was no longer necessary to use close-up radio signals during the Predator's takeoff and ascent. The entire flight could be controlled by satellite from any [[command and control]] center with the right equipment. The CIA proposed to attempt over Afghanistan the first fully remote Predator flight operations, piloted from the agency's headquarters at [[Langley, Virginia|Langley]].<ref name=\"penguin1\" />\n\nThe Predator air vehicle and sensors are controlled from the ground station via a [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] data link or a [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] satellite data link for beyond-line-of-sight operations. During flight operations the crew in the ground control station is a pilot and two sensor operators. The aircraft is equipped with the AN/AAS-52 [[Multi-spectral]] Targeting System, a color nose camera (generally used by the pilot for flight control), a variable aperture day-TV camera, and a variable aperture [[thermographic camera]] (for low light/night). Previously, Predators were equipped with a [[synthetic aperture radar]] for looking through smoke, clouds or haze, but lack of use validated its removal to reduce weight and conserve fuel. The cameras produce full motion video and the synthetic aperture radar produced still frame [[radar imaging|radar images]]. There is sufficient bandwidth on the datalink for two video sources to be used at one time, but only one video source from the sensor ball can be used at any time due to design limitations. Either the daylight variable aperture or the infrared electro-optical sensor may be operated simultaneously with the synthetic aperture radar, if equipped.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nAll later Predators are equipped with a [[laser designator]] that allows the pilot to identify targets for other aircraft and even provide the [[laser guidance]] for manned aircraft. This laser is also the designator for the [[AGM-114 Hellfire]] that are carried on the MQ-1.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n===Deployment methodology===\n[[File:MQ-1 Predator controls 2007-08-07.jpg|thumb|Predator operators at Balad Camp Anaconda, Iraq, August 2007]]\n\nEach Predator air vehicle can be disassembled into six main components and loaded into a container nicknamed \"the coffin.\" This enables all system components and support equipment to be rapidly deployed worldwide. The largest component is the ground control station and it is designed to roll into a [[C-130 Hercules]]. The Predator primary satellite link consists of a 6.1-meter (20-ft) satellite dish and associated support equipment. The satellite link provides communications between the ground station and the aircraft when it is beyond line-of-sight and is a link to networks that disseminate secondary intelligence. The RQ-1A system needs 1,500 by 40&nbsp;meters (5,000 by 125&nbsp;ft) of hard surface runway with clear line-of-sight to each end from the ground control station to the air vehicles. Initially, all components needed to be located on the same airfield.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nCurrently, the U.S. Air Force uses a concept called \"Remote-Split Operations\" where the satellite datalink is located in a different location and is connected to the GCS through fiber optic cabling. This allows Predators to be launched and recovered by a small \"Launch and Recovery Element\" and then handed off to a \"Mission Control Element\" for the rest of the flight. This allows a smaller number of troops to be deployed to a forward location, and consolidates control of the different flights in one location.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nThe improvements in the MQ-1B production version include an ARC-210 radio, an APX-100 IFF/SIF with mode 4, a glycol-weeping \"wet wings\" ice mitigation system, upgraded turbo-charged engine, fuel injection, longer wings, dual alternators as well as other improvements.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nOn 18 May 2006, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) issued a certificate of authorization which will allow the M/RQ-1 and [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|M/RQ-9]] aircraft to be used within U.S. civilian airspace to search for survivors of disasters. Requests had been made in 2005 for the aircraft to be used in [[search and rescue]] operations following [[Hurricane Katrina]], but because there was no FAA authorization in place at the time, the assets were not used. The Predator's [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]] with digitally enhanced zoom has the capability of identifying the [[infrared signature]] of a human body from an altitude of 3&nbsp;km (10,000&nbsp;ft), making the aircraft an ideal search and rescue tool.<ref name=\"www2006\" />\n\nThe longest declassified Predator flight to date lasted for 40&nbsp;hours, 5&nbsp;minutes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} The total flight time reached 1 million hours in April 2010, according to General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc.<ref name=\"Predator-series UAVs surpass one million flight hours\" />\n\n===Armed versions===\n[[File:AGM-114 Hellfire hung on a Predator drone.JPEG|thumb|Close-up of the [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] missile [[Hardpoint#Pylon|pylon]], 2004.]]\n\nThe USAF [[Big Safari|BIG SAFARI program office]] managed the Predator program and was given direction on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. This led to it being fitted with reinforced wings and stores [[Hardpoint#Pylon|pylons]] to carry munitions, as well as a [[laser designator]]. The RQ-1 conducted its first firing of a [[AGM-114 Hellfire|Hellfire]] [[anti-tank missile]] on 16 February 2001; over a bombing range near [[Creech Air Force Base|Indian Springs Air Force Station]] north of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], an inert AGM-114C successfully hit a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, the decision was made to move immediately to increment two of the testing phase, which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack; it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.<ref name=\"vector\" /><ref name=\"Predator missile launch test totally successful\" /><ref>[http://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-q-1-predator-became-a-history-changing-deadly-missi-1760408544 The Q-1 Predator Became A History-Changing Deadly Missile Slinger 15 Years Ago Today] \u2013 Foxtrotalpha.Japolnik.com, 21 February 2016</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 2000\u20132001, after seeing the results of Predator reconnaissance in Afghanistan (see below), [[Cofer Black]], head of the CIA's [[Counterterrorist Center]] (CTC), became a \"vocal advocate\" of arming the Predator with missiles to target [[Osama bin Laden]] in the country.
