A white wooden holder is placed at the upper edge of the lower trunk and is tied with 6 ropes to hold upon and its base is placed in the midst of the flag hoisting throne (Kodi medai). A few lakhs of people who gather to witness the ceremony pull the ropes and the Trunk rises slowly. Finally when it reaches the vertical position ropes are tied to make the trunk strong hold. This holding the Holy rope is called as ''Imaadhul Muraad'', and people who holds this holy rope with a wish seeking the help of Shaheedh Badushaha Nayagam, will see it answered in a very short period within the year.\n\n=== Holy flag hoisting (Kodiyetru Vizha) \u2013 Dhul Qaidah 10 ===\n[[File:Erwadiflag.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Erwadiflag.jpg|left|thumb|187x187px|Full view of Erwadi flag.]]\nThis an important ceremony in the Santhanakoodu festival of Ervadi durgah. Around 600,000 people from all parts of Tamil Nadu and Kerala and also various states like [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], Maharashtra, [[Delhi]] and all over India take part. On the 10th evening of Zul Qaidah, the flag procession starts from the Erwadi village and reaches Durgah Shariff before [[maghrib]]. The holy flag is brought in an elephant which traditionally comes from the palace of the [[Ramnad estate|Raja of Ramnad]]. The procession goes round the durga thrice. [[Qasidah|Qasidahs]] are recited and after a grand Dhuaa, the flag is hoisted in the upper trunk with a full voice slogan of '''''Yaa Shaheed!!! Muraad Haasil!!!'''''. The regular moulidh shariff starts at 9.00&nbsp;pm on this day.\n\n=== Santhanakoodu Procession and Shadhiliyya Halara \u2013 Dhul Qada 22 ===\n[[File:Sandhanakkoodu.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sandhanakkoodu.jpg|right|thumb|187x187px|A view of the Sandal carrier of Erwadi dargah]]\nThis procession is conducted just to mark the beginning of the Main santhanakoodu festival. Procession starts from Ervadi Kudi iruppu, the residential area of '''Mujavirs''' ('''Huqdars''' called as '''Levvais''') and reaches the Dargah shariff campus before [[maghrib]] prayers. The [[Shadhili|Shadhuliya]] tariqa [http://www.shazuli.com/ zikr halqa majlis (Hazra)] is held in the Mosque at the durgah campus. A few millions of people start gathering at Erwadi and get scattered at kattupalli and other areas of Ervadi durga. District administration announces local Holiday on this day and the State government along with [[TNSTC]] runs thousands of special buses to Erwadi from various locations of Tamil Nadu. Hundreds of stalls are being put by the Government and by the private vendors. Many food stalls and child entertainment games are being run in this season.\n\n=== Sandal smearing on the holy grave \u2013 Dhul Qadah 23 ===\nThis is the peak celebration and the sole purpose of the one-month-long Santhanakoodu festival in Ervadi Durgah. This day marks the death of Qutbul hamid Gausul Majid Badusha Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed. The 23rd day moulid shariff (Last Moulid for the year) starts exactly at 12.00&nbsp;am on the 23rd night of [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] and ends at 3:30&nbsp;am with a grand Dhuaa begging Shaheed badusha's mercy. [[Sandal]] paste are taken in 3 pots from Ervadi and brought in the very grand procession. It reaches Durgah around 5:00&nbsp;am and the sandal pot is taken to the maqbara, the grave ([[Mazar (mausoleum)|Mazar]]) of Shaheed Badusha. The procession goes round the Dargah thrice. A grand Dhuaa is recited inside the [[Maqam (shrine)|Maqam]] of Shaheed Badusha. The sandal is smeared in the rauza mubarak of Shaheed and different carpets with Valuable Silk, Diamond and other floral carpets are presented. The sandal paste is anointed on the Rauza of Qutb Syed Abootahir Shaheed and the rouza of Seyyida Fathima Al Barqa (Shahid badusha'a mother). Only selected Levvais (Mujavirs \u2013 Huqdars) and a few Guests including the descendants of [[Madurai Maqbara]] are permitted inside the Maqam during the ceremony. More than 1000 policemen and policewomen are deployed for security. The ceremony ends with the fajr prayer and the sandal is distributed to all who gather in the Dargah campus.\n\n=== Dismounting of the Holy Flag (Kodi Irakkam) \u2013 Dhul Qadah 30 ===\nThis is the final event which marks the end of a month long Santhanakoodu festival in Erwadidurgah. Every year on the 30th Morning of Islamic month of [[Dhu al-Qi'dah]] thousands of people gather at the hall of main Dargah after [[fajr]] prayer for the recitation of the [[Quran]]. Qur'an is completely recited more than 7 times and Tabarruk is distributed after the dhuaa with the waseela of Badhusha Nayagam (Holy King). The same day evening, after Asar Qasidas and Byts are recited followed by the grand final Dhuaa and the Holy Flag is dismounted with the Sky blowing slogan of '''''YAA SHAHEED!!! MURAD HAASIL!!!'''''. The holy flag is presented unto the Sacred Rouza of Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed and a Dhuaa is recited. The lower trunk and other components of the Holy flag are displaced before maghrib. Around 1.5&nbsp;million people from all over India and other countries like Sri Lanka, U.K., Saudi Arabia, [[United Arab Emirates|U.A.E]]. and Kuwait take part. The crowd which gathers here for this ceremony is the highest than any other festival in [[Ramanathapuram District]]. After maghrib, the traditional '''Thabarruk''' of '<nowiki/>'''''NEI SORU'''''' ('''Ghee Rice''') is distributed to all the 1.5&nbsp;million pilgrims who witnessed the Santhanakoodu Urus festivals of Erwadi Dargah. The arrangements for the entire festival is made and sponsored by the Dargah Huqdhar Management Committee ('''D.H.M.C.'''). Thus the one-month-long Urus Festival of Ervadi Durgah Shariff comes to an end.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ervadi.com/urus-festival Official website]\n\n[[Category:Festivals in Tamil Nadu]]\n[[Category:Islam in India]]\n[[Category:Islamic festivals in India]]\n", "name_user": "Tetrahedron17", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwadi_Santhanakoodu_Festival"}

Dax is a teenage boy of Bangladeshi descent (on his Mother's side), who lives with his abusive stepmother Gina, and her daughter Alice. On a day that he had been locked outside in the yard by Gina, he becomes accidentally trapped in their garden shed; Because of high temperatures within it, he becomes desperate and opens a lemonade bottle filled with white spirit, which causes him to pass out. When he wakes, he discovers he possesses the power of [[Shapeshifting]]. Dax has brown eyes, dark hair, olive skin and when he is first introduced, he is described as pale and sickly from the abuse he has suffered. Once at Tregarren for a little while, however, he finds himself brighter, happier and with a healthy colour to his skin.\n* '''Clive''' - Before and during the beginning of the series, before Dax relocates to Tregarren, Clive is Dax's best friend who he is faithfully protective of. Clive is a brilliantly intelligent boy who endures consistent bullying from two other boys at school (Matthew Spacey and Toby Rodgers) for how he behaves and looks; Who Dax shapeshifts to protect and take care of after a particularly brutal beating and destruction of a paper clock he had made. After this, the bullies leave Clive alone entirely. He is initially wary of Dax once he accurately deduces he is a shapeshifter, as he at first believes Dax to be a [[Skin-walker|skinwalker]]. However, he does not believe Dax to be malicious, and soon trusts him again despite the fact Dax had to leave for Tregarren. The two often exchanged letters, wherein one of them, Clive attaches a news clipping written by Caronline Fisher, calling Dax the Beast of Barks End, a play on [[Beast of Bodmin Moor|The Beast of Bodmin]]. He's described in the book as being small, speaking with a very posh accent and unintentionally dressing in a posh way also; Wearing fitted V-neck sweaters, ties and a well-pressed shirt and pair of trousers.\n* '''(Agent) Owen Hind''' - Dax's friend, teacher and [[father figure]]. Owen is a government official who helps to find and retrieve new Colas and bring them to Tregarren. When Dax meets Owen, he initially introduces himself as a member of the education department, though it is revealed to Dax soon after that this is not true. Owen captures Dax on the way to school in the back of a truck, then uses a potent vapour on Dax called the Triple-Eight; \"A concoction designed to bring about extreme terror and brief unconsciousness.\" as described by Owen, in order to force Dax to Shapeshift. Soon after, however, Owen apologises to Dax, as he only needed to use it in order to be sure Dax was a COLA - a Child Of Limitless Ability. Once Dax is brought to Tregarren, it is revealed that Owen teaches woodwork and outdoors survival skills. Owen also is the teacher for Dax's one-on-one \"Development\" classes, where he attempts to help Dax to use his Shapeshifting powers at will. Owen tries using [[Hypnotherapy|relaxation hypnosis]] and [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]], in order to help Dax release his emotional [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] due to his abuse and absent father. He is a mysterious, yet kind man who Dax comes to see as a parental figure. Owen is tall, well built, good-looking and his eyes being the most piercing blue Dax had ever seen; As well as having shoulder-length dark hair. His skin is tanned and that of an outdoorsman, and he is described as having a slight West-Country accent. Though he's in a suit when Dax first meets him, it's detailed that it looks unfitting on him; Instead, Owen wears outdoorsman clothes, such as a green thick-weave shirt, khaki jeans and boots.\n*'''Gideon \"Gid\" Reader''' - Dax's best friend when he travels to Tregarren College; A fair-haired, freckled [[telekinesis|telekinetic]]. Gideon enjoys football and is on a team called the Tregarren Tigers, and has a penchant for [[chocolate]] of all kinds, which he buys from the local Chocolate Parlour in Polgammon. Somehow, no matter how much chocolate he eats, Gideon never seems to gain weight. He is a confident, well-meaning yet somewhat insensitive boy proven by the first meeting he and Dax had, where Gideon was floating a football over Dax's head while he was sleeping, and dropped it on him by mistake; As well as giving Dax a Chinese Burn on his arm in order to demonstrate Mia Cooper's healing abilities. His powers first manifested at home in front of his father, where he had levitated cutlery onto the ceiling.\n*'''Lisa Hardman''' - A tough, somewhat spoiled rich girl who hates being at Tregarren and the [[COLAs (The Shapeshifter)|Cola]] Club, so she avoids interaction with the other students. Lisa's hair is long and blonde, layered fashionably which she often ties up into a ponytail; She is pretty, wears fashionable clothes, and Dax describes her as \"Looking like something out of a television advert for washing powder or fizzy drinks, except she wasn't smiling\". Despite Lisa's attitude, she and Dax become friends when Dax discovers her crying in a small cave on the school grounds that they name The Crying Place. Dax tries to reach out to her, though respects her privacy when he is asked to leave her alone, which she in turn respects by warning him to duck to avoid an oncoming football; It is revealed that Lisa possesses extremely strong [[psychic]] powers, such as [[dowsing]], [[Mediumship|spirit communication]], [[Precognition|premonition]] and [[telepathy]] but refuses to accept them or be trained how to use them, causing her to be constantly tormented by visions and various other paranormal communication. In order to escape this for a time, Lisa engages herself with [[cross country running]] and [[equestrian sport]].\n*'''Mia Cooper''' - A gifted healer, who has a strange effect on people who she has just met; When people come into contact with Mia for the first time, they tend to be enraptured by her, however this wears off over time. In the book, Gideon calls this the Mia Effect, much to Mia's chagrin; She is very appreciative when the Mia Effect is joked about, as she finds it very embarrassing. Mia is kind, caring and gentle, with a beautiful smile, as well as being a vegetarian which many of the healers at Tregarren are. Her physical appearance is described as being rather plain, with a pale face and unremarkable brown hair cut into a short bob. Mia has thick eyelashes and violet blue eyes, which hold a patience and knowledge beyond her years, as well as having a low, soft voice that is lovely and calming. Though Mia is potentially the strongest healer at Tregarren, in the first book she often takes on more than she can bear; Unable to release the pain that she had been taking off of others until eventually she collapses and is hospitalised for a time.\n* '''Paulina Satre''' - The primary dowser of all COLAs, Paulina is intelligent, caring, kind, yet somewhat unsettling as Dax finds on his first meeting with her when she has a vision. Paulina is [[French people|French]] and speaks with an accent. She is responsible for finding all the COLAs with her strong psychic and empathetic abilities, which help her to [[Oracle|see]] and predict events as they transpire, or shortly before. Paulina is the French teacher at Tregarren College, and eventually becomes its principal by the end of the book. Ms Satre is described as being a graceful older woman, with grey eyes and spectacles. She has pale auburn hair swept into a low knot at the base of her neck and usually wears grey or black folds of wool, with an amber stone on a chain around her neck.\n* '''Caroline Fisher''' - Caroline is a shrewd news reporter, affiliated with the Messenger. She is described as being small, slim, pretty with a neat blonde bob and wide grey eyes. She wears a short red dress with a white cardigan in order to look innocent and coax information out of people. Caroline shows up outside of Dax's home one afternoon, hiding behind a rhododendron bush and appearing from it before Dax can sense her. She forcibly coerces Dax to let her indoors, where she intently tries to get him to tell her about the attack at Bark's End. Dax is sarcastic to her, although it slips he is packing to move somewhere. Caroline uses this, and does some digging, despite at first thinking that there was nothing to this story, but now, using Dax's reaction, looks into it. She does some digging and finds that in sister papers, there were about reports of powerful children doing bizarre things; Levitating objects, dowsing, talking to the dead and even healing wounds. After interviewing Matthew's family, she then tries to interview Clive who was so protective of Dax he refused to even confirm his age. Not long after this, she interviews Gina Jones, who tells her about Tregarren College and Dax's invitation there. Caroline follows this tip and finds Dax in Polgammon, where she warns Dax that she doesn't trust Tregarren and thinks its sinister to whisk kids away and hide them behind a wall of granite, despite Dax's refusal to accept this. When Dax stubbornly refuses to answer her questions, she threatens to have the world's press show up at Tregarren College's front door if Principal Wood refuses to let her interview him. Although this panics Dax, to his surprise, she is invited emphatically by Wood to come to the grounds and look around. However, when she is there, Lisa felt a tightness around her chest whenever she saw Caroline, and no one realises why until it is too late. Wood tried to murder her in a toxic bog in the forest near Tregarren by thoroughly charming her and making her see a bridge that was not there. Pauline and Owen began to suspect something but were too late, so Dax, Lisa, Mia and Gideon are the only ones who can rescue her. Gideon and Dax use their abilities to free her and rescue her from death. In turn, she is grateful to Dax and does not try to threaten Tregarren again, but instead gives Dax a key to her bolthole, The Owl Box in [[Exmoor]] in case Tregarren truly cannot be trusted.\n*'''Principal Patrick Wood''' - The principal of Tregarren College. Patrick is described as being in his forties, and not a very handsome man, with a thin, rather battered looking face and a very slight cross to his eyes. Despite this, however, he has a strange charisma to him. He is the first book's principle [[antagonist]], although his role as such is only made certain toward the end of the book. Wood possesses the power of glamour; An umbrella term used for visual illusion type abilities such as vanishing, optical illusion and charm, which he uses to manipulate the respect of the students of Cola Club without their knowledge; Dax, however, realises that Shapeshifters like him are resistant to Glamour. It is revealed that Patrick is responsible for the death of the first Shapeshifter, a poor boy who had grown up in orphanages with the ability to shapeshift into a [[Gray wolf|wolf]], who was thus was not afraid to openly say that he could see through Patrick's glamour. For this, Patrick killed the first Shapeshifter in order to hold absolute control over Tregarren and its inhabitants. He almost succeeds in doing the same to Dax by manipulating Owen Hind into betraying Dax and trying to kill him. It almost works, as this betrayal lapses Dax back into his despair, yet it backfires. Dax manages to survive, whereas Patrick Wood falls 150 fathoms down into an abandoned mine shaft. His body was never retrieved.\n\n== Secondary and minor characters ==\n\n* '''Gina Jones''' - An [[Child abuse|abusive]], cruel stepmother to Dax, who routinely slaps him, shuts him outside for hours on end due to his \"attitude\" and treats him and his interests with disdain, even going so far as to give all of his books on wildlife, and his artist's materials away to a [[Jumble sale|jumble sale collector]]. Dax had been four when she had met him, and she had never treated him with any sort of affection until Owen Hind appeared. Gina is not aware of Dax's shapeshifting ability, and believed that he had been taken to Tregarren College as a [[gifted student]]. Gina's attitude quickly changed toward Dax after this, calculating that she might be able to gain something if Dax were to be a genius, as well as being afraid that Dax might tell his father about the abuse she had wreaked on him.\n* '''Alice Jones''' - Gina's daughter and Dax's half sister; Though her age is not canonically stated, it is speculated she is perhaps eight when Dax leaves for Tregarren College. Despite being [[Indoctrination|indoctrinated]] into her mother's abuse and favoured by her, Alice is more ignorant and distanced than she is abusive to Dax. She offhandedly notices when Dax is hurt, is visibly sad when Dax has to leave for Tregarren, and even though the promise was not fulfilled, promises that she will take her dollies out of Dax's old room when he comes back during the school breaks.\n* '''Robert W. Jones''' - Dax's absent father who works on an [[Oil platform|oil rig]] out at sea for months on end. Rarely, if ever, does Dax see his father, who is often preoccupied by Gina and Alice whenever he comes home from the rigs; He had promised to extend Dax's tiny bedroom, however because of his wife and daughter's demands, this promise was never kept. Robert Jones is a quiet, exhausted man who seems to always have bags under his grey eyes. In their attic, Dax had read old comic books belonging to Robert Jones about the [[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|Incredible Hulk]], which he uses the memory of to try and understand his own shapeshifting abilities; This suggests that Robert was a fan of these books. During the book, Dax receives only a short [[Aberdeen]] postcard from his father, who had said he \"Hope(d) to see you before the end of term.\". This promise is also not kept. \n* '''Matthew Spacey''' - A bully at Bark's End Junior school that brutally attacks Clive in the school boiler room and breaks a paper clock he'd made. Dax savagely attacks Matthew and his accomplice Toby for hurting his friend. Matthew's family play up the wounds for the press to try and get compensation for the attack. Matthew does not return to Bark's End after the attack. \n* '''Toby Rodgers''' - Matthew's friend and bullying partner. Toby is a large, strong boy who bullies Clive mercilessly along with Matthew, and breaks the paper clock Clive made. After the attack, Toby is [[Psychological trauma|traumatised]]; He is quiet in class, sometimes sucks his thumb, and never bullies Clive again.\n* '''Barry Blake''' - Barry is the friend and dorm-mate of Dax and Gideon, who is a glamourist with the power to turn [[Invisibility in fiction|invisible]]. Barry tends to disappear in class and when he's spacing out, but is not very good at it as he is clumsy and has issues with his [[adenoid]]s which cause his nose to whistle. Although he is a kind boy, Barry has a mischievous streak where he will take dares to disappear in class, or when playing football.\n* '''Spencer \"Spook\" Williams''' - Spook is a loud, dramatic Glamourist who likes to think of himself as a future world-star illusionist. He can make things visually appear from thin air, such as multicoloured parrots or small fireworks and can create optical illusions that make people see things which are not there, such as moved goalposts in football or the time he made Gideon think his dinner-plate was full of thousands of snails. He plays on the opposing home team, the Tregarren Tigers and often butts heads with Gideon. Dax, however, is resilient to his illusions, and only sees what looks to be like [[heat haze]] emanating from wherever the illusion is thrown, though Spook is not aware of this. Spook is antagonistic and cruel to Dax and Gideon, however has a soft spot for Mia, which has lingered. \n* '''Jessica Moorland''' - Jessica is a powerful Psychic who often gives out the Spirit Communication Notice (SCN) Slips to Gideon about his Aunty Pam, who warns him of dangers from beyond the grave. Jessica tries to give SCN slips to Dax from Wolf, warning him of the danger that is to come, but is thwarted and charmed by Wood.\n* '''Unnamed Shapeshifter \"Wolf\"''' - Wolf is the deceased spirit of the first shapeshifter, who died while in wolf form at the hands of Patrick Wood. He was a tough boy who had grown up in orphanages in Scotland, but had seen through Wood's deception and told Owen about it, that he could \"smell\" it. Wolf was murdered quickly as if a shapeshifter is killed in their animal form before they had time to transform back, they stay as that creature. Throughout the book, he tried to warn Dax about Wood from beyond the grave through SCN notices and through Lisa Hardman. Owen blames himself for the death of the boy.\n* '''Mr Eades''' - Eades is a government-sanctioned witness to Dax's Development classes. He is described as wearing grey suit, with a tired face, wispy grey hair and horn-rimmed spectacles. Dax finds it difficult to shapeshift with his presence in his Development sessions, but Eades is adamant that no session is allowed to commence without at least two official witnesses. Generally, he is unfriendly and detached towards the COLAs.\n* '''Mrs Dann''' - A no-nonsense human teacher at Tregarren College, with an anti-glamour arsenal at her disposal.\n\n== Themes and topics ==\nThe book explores such themes such as familial abuse, emotional repression, government suspicion, found family and absentee parenthood.\n\n==Publication history==\nAs with all of the Shapeshifter books, ''Finding the Fox'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2006.\n\n==Recognition==\n''Finding the Fox'' was nominated for the 2007 [[Bolton Children's Book Award]], the Dutch Kinderboekenweek, and was awarded the number one book in 2002.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Children and Young Adult Literature}}\n* [http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780192754653 ''Finding the Fox'' at OUP]\n* [http://www.oup.com/oxed/children/authors/sparkes/ Ali Sparkes at OUP]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100626110717/http://www.alisparkes.com/shapeshifter.asp Ali Sparkes's official page on the series]\n\n{{The Shapeshifter}}\n\n[[Category:2006 British novels]]\n[[Category:English novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Fiction about shapeshifting]]\n[[Category:The Shapeshifter]]\n", "text_old": "{{One source|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox book | <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject_Novels or Wikipedia:WikiProject_Books -->\n| name = Finding the Fox\n| image = TheShapeshifterFindingTheFox.png\n| author = [[Ali Sparkes]]\n| illustrator = David Wyatt\n| country = England\n| language = English\n| series = ''[[The Shapeshifter]]''\n| genre = [[Fantasy]]/[[Science Fiction]]\n| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n| pub_date = 2006 \n| pages = 328\n| preceded_by = None\n| followed_by = Running the Risk\n}}\n\n'''''Finding the Fox''''' is a [[fantasy novel|fantasy]]/[[science fiction]] novel by [[Ali Sparkes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alisparkes.com/|title=Finding The Fox|last=Ali|first=Sparkes|website=alisparkes.com}}</ref> It is the first book in [[The Shapeshifter]] series, and was first published in 2006 by [[Oxford University Press]].\n\n==Major characters==\n*'''Daxesh \"Dax\" Jones''' - The book's principal [[protagonist]]. Dax is a teenage boy of Bangladeshi descent (on his Mother's side), who lives with his abusive stepmother Gina, and her daughter Alice. On a day that he had been locked outside in the yard by Gina, he becomes accidentally trapped in their garden shed; Because of high temperatures within it, he becomes desperate and opens a lemonade bottle filled with white spirit, which causes him to pass out. When he wakes, he discovers he possesses the power of [[Shapeshifting]]. Dax has brown eyes, dark hair, olive skin and when he is first introduced, he is described as pale and sickly from the abuse he has suffered. Once at Tregarren for a little while, however, he finds himself brighter, happier and with a healthy colour to his skin.\n* '''Clive''' - Before and during the beginning of the series, before Dax relocates to Tregarren, Clive is Dax's best friend who he is faithfully protective of. Clive is a brilliantly intelligent boy who endures consistent bullying from two other boys at school (Matthew Spacey and Toby Rodgers) for how he behaves and looks; Who Dax shapeshifts to protect and take care of after a particularly brutal beating and destruction of a paper clock he had made. After this, the bullies leave Clive alone entirely. He is initially wary of Dax once he accurately deduces he is a shapeshifter, as he at first believes Dax to be a [[Skin-walker|skinwalker]]. However, he does not believe Dax to be malicious, and soon trusts him again despite the fact Dax had to leave for Tregarren. The two often exchanged letters, wherein one of them, Clive attaches a news clipping written by Caronline Fisher, calling Dax the Beast of Barks End, a play on [[Beast of Bodmin Moor|The Beast of Bodmin]]. He's described in the book as being small, speaking with a very posh accent and unintentionally dressing in a posh way also; Wearing fitted V-neck sweaters, ties and a well-pressed shirt and pair of trousers.\n* '''(Agent) Owen Hind''' - Dax's friend, teacher and [[father figure]]. Owen is a government official who helps to find and retrieve new Colas and bring them to Tregarren. When Dax meets Owen, he initially introduces himself as a member of the education department, though it is revealed to Dax soon after that this is not true. Owen captures Dax on the way to school in the back of a truck, then uses a potent vapour on Dax called the Triple-Eight; \"A concoction designed to bring about extreme terror and brief unconsciousness.\" as described by Owen, in order to force Dax to Shapeshift. Soon after, however, Owen apologises to Dax, as he only needed to use it in order to be sure Dax was a COLA - a Child Of Limitless Ability. Once Dax is brought to Tregarren, it is revealed that Owen teaches woodwork and outdoors survival skills. Owen also is the teacher for Dax's one-on-one \"Development\" classes, where he attempts to help Dax to use his Shapeshifting powers at will. Owen tries using [[Hypnotherapy|relaxation hypnosis]] and [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioural therapy]], in order to help Dax release his emotional [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] due to his abuse and absent father. He is a mysterious, yet kind man who Dax comes to see as a parental figure. Owen is tall, well built, good-looking and his eyes being the most piercing blue Dax had ever seen; As well as having shoulder-length dark hair. His skin is tanned and that of an outdoorsman, and he is described as having a slight West-Country accent. Though he's in a suit when Dax first meets him, it's detailed that it looks unfitting on him; Instead, Owen wears outdoorsman clothes, such as a green thick-weave shirt, khaki jeans and boots.\n*'''Gideon \"Gid\" Reader''' - Dax's best friend when he travels to Tregarren College; A fair-haired, freckled [[telekinesis|telekinetic]]. Gideon enjoys football and is on a team called the Tregarren Tigers, and has a penchant for [[chocolate]] of all kinds, which he buys from the local Chocolate Parlour in Polgammon. Somehow, no matter how much chocolate he eats, Gideon never seems to gain weight. He is a confident, well-meaning yet somewhat insensitive boy proven by the first meeting he and Dax had, where Gideon was floating a football over Dax's head while he was sleeping, and dropped it on him by mistake; As well as giving Dax a Chinese Burn on his arm in order to demonstrate Mia Cooper's healing abilities. His powers first manifested at home in front of his father, where he had levitated cutlery onto the ceiling.\n*'''Lisa Hardman''' - A tough, somewhat spoiled rich girl who hates being at Tregarren and the [[COLAs (The Shapeshifter)|Cola]] Club, so she avoids interaction with the other students. Lisa's hair is long and blonde, layered fashionably which she often ties up into a ponytail; She is pretty, wears fashionable clothes, and Dax describes her as \"Looking like something out of a television advert for washing powder or fizzy drinks, except she wasn't smiling\". Despite Lisa's attitude, she and Dax become friends when Dax discovers her crying in a small cave on the school grounds that they name The Crying Place. Dax tries to reach out to her, though respects her privacy when he is asked to leave her alone, which she in turn respects by warning him to duck to avoid an oncoming football; It is revealed that Lisa possesses extremely strong [[psychic]] powers, such as [[dowsing]], [[Mediumship|spirit communication]], [[Precognition|premonition]] and [[telepathy]] but refuses to accept them or be trained how to use them, causing her to be constantly tormented by visions and various other paranormal communication. In order to escape this for a time, Lisa engages herself with [[cross country running]] and [[equestrian sport]].\n*'''Mia Cooper''' - A gifted healer, who has a strange effect on people who she has just met; When people come into contact with Mia for the first time, they tend to be enraptured by her, however this wears off over time. In the book, Gideon calls this the Mia Effect, much to Mia's chagrin; She is very appreciative when the Mia Effect is joked about, as she finds it very embarrassing. Mia is kind, caring and gentle, with a beautiful smile, as well as being a vegetarian which many of the healers at Tregarren are. Her physical appearance is described as being rather plain, with a pale face and unremarkable brown hair cut into a short bob. Mia has thick eyelashes and violet blue eyes, which hold a patience and knowledge beyond her years, as well as having a low, soft voice that is lovely and calming. Though Mia is potentially the strongest healer at Tregarren, in the first book she often takes on more than she can bear; Unable to release the pain that she had been taking off of others until eventually she collapses and is hospitalised for a time.\n* '''Paulina Satre''' - The primary dowser of all COLAs, Paulina is intelligent, caring, kind, yet somewhat unsettling as Dax finds on his first meeting with her when she has a vision. Paulina is [[French people|French]] and speaks with an accent. She is responsible for finding all the COLAs with her strong psychic and empathetic abilities, which help her to [[Oracle|see]] and predict events as they transpire, or shortly before. Paulina is the French teacher at Tregarren College, and eventually becomes its principal by the end of the book. Ms Satre is described as being a graceful older woman, with grey eyes and spectacles. She has pale auburn hair swept into a low knot at the base of her neck and usually wears grey or black folds of wool, with an amber stone on a chain around her neck.\n* '''Caroline Fisher''' - Caroline is a shrewd news reporter, affiliated with the Messenger. She is described as being small, slim, pretty with a neat blonde bob and wide grey eyes. She wears a short red dress with a white cardigan in order to look innocent and coax information out of people.

She forcibly coerces Dax to let her indoors, where she intently tries to get him to tell her about the attack at Bark's End.

{"title_page": "Kinetic theory of gases", "text_new": "[[Image:Translational motion.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[temperature]] of an ideal [[monatomic]] [[gas]] is proportional to the average [[kinetic energy]] of its atoms. The [[Bohr radius|size]] of [[helium]] atoms relative to their spacing is shown to scale under 1950 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] of pressure. The atoms have a certain, average speed, slowed down here two [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] fold from room temperature.]]\n\nThe '''kinetic theory of gases''' is a historically significant, but simple, model of the [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] behavior of [[gas]]es, with which many principal concepts of thermodynamics were established.  The model describes a gas as a large number of identical submicroscopic [[particle]]s ([[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s), all of which are in constant, rapid, [[randomness|random]] [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Their size is assumed to be much smaller than the average distance between the particles. The particles undergo random [[elastic collision]]s between themselves and with the enclosing walls of the container. The basic version of the model describes the [[ideal gas]], and considers no other interactions between the particles and, thus, the nature of kinetic energy transfers during collisions is strictly thermal.\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases explains the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as [[Transport phenomena|transport properties]] such as [[viscosity]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[mass diffusivity]]. The model also accounts for related phenomena, such as [[Brownian motion]].\n\n==History==\nIn approximately 50 [[before common era|BCE]], the Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]] proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=J.

In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as [[heat]] is simply the [[kinetic energy]] of their motion. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because [[conservation of energy]] had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.<ref name=\"PonomarevKurchatov1993\">{{cite book|title=The Quantum Dice|author1=L.I Ponomarev|author2=I.V Kurchatov|date=1 January 1993|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-7503-0251-7}}</ref>{{rp|36\u201337}}\n\nOther pioneers of the kinetic theory (whose work was largely neglected by their contemporaries) were [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] (1747),<ref>Lomonosov 1758</ref> [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (ca. 1780, published 1818),<ref>Le Sage 1780/1818</ref> [[John Herapath]] (1816)<ref>Herapath 1816, 1821</ref> and [[John James Waterston]] (1843),<ref>Waterston 1843</ref> which connected their research with the development of [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]]. In 1856 [[August Kr\u00f6nig]] (probably after reading a paper of Waterston) created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles.<ref>Kr\u00f6nig 1856</ref>\n\nIn 1857 [[Rudolf Clausius]], according to his own words independently of Kr\u00f6nig, developed a similar, but much more sophisticated version of the theory which included translational and contrary to Kr\u00f6nig also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of [[mean free path]] of a particle.\n<ref>Clausius 1857</ref> In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by [[Rudolf Clausius]], Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] formulated the [[Maxwell distribution]] of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range.<ref>See:\n\n* Maxwell, J.C.

Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him.\n\nIn the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)<ref>Einstein 1905</ref> and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)<ref>Smoluchowski 1906</ref>\npapers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe theory for ideal gases dubukku pandi the following assumptions:\n\n* The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[atomic radius|size]].\n* These particles have the same [[mass]].\n* The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied.\n\n* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature.\n* Except during collisions, the [[interaction]]s among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no [[force]]s on one another.) \n:This implies:\n::1. [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.\n::2. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the [[mean inter-particle distance|inter-particle distance]] is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].\n::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.\n\n* The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the [[system]]. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.\n* The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.\n* Because they have mass, gravity will accelerate molecules.  (If this were not the case then there would be no density gradient in a planet's troposphere and it would collapse to the surface.)\n\nMore modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansion]]s.\n\nAn important book on kinetic theory is that by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and [[Thomas Cowling|Cowling]].<ref name=\"C & C\">[[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman, S.]], [[Cowling, T.G.]] (1939/1970).</ref> An important approach to the subject is called [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]].<ref>Kauzmann, W. (1966). ''Kinetic Theory of Gasses'', W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232\u2013235.</ref> There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.<ref>Grad 1949</ref>\nIn the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].\n\n==Equilibrium properties==\n=== {{anchor|Pressure and Kinetic Energy}}Pressure and kinetic energy===<!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] -->\nIn kinetic model of gases, the [[pressure]] is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cube of volume ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup>. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), the change in [[momentum]] is given by:\n\n:<math>\\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the momentum, ''i'' and ''f'' indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), ''x'' indicates that only the ''x'' direction is being considered, and ''v'' is the speed of the [[particle]] (which is the same before and after the collision).\n\nThe particle impacts one specific side wall once every\n\n:<math>\\Delta t = \\frac{2L}{v_x},</math>\n\nwhere ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls.\n\nThe [[force]] due to this particle is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{m v_x^2}{L}.</math>\n\nThe total force on the wall is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v_x^2}}{L},</math>\n\nwhere the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.\n\nSince the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\overline{v_y^2} = \\overline{v_z^2}.</math>\n\nBy [[Pythagorean theorem]] in three dimensions the total squared speed ''v'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = \\overline{v_x^2} + \\overline{v_y^2} + \\overline{v_z^2},</math>\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = 3\\overline{v_x^2}.</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3},</math>\n\nand the force can be written as:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3L}.</math>\n\nThis force is exerted on an area ''L''<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the pressure of the gas is\n\n:<math>P = \\frac{F}{L^2} = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3V},</math>\n\nwhere ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup> is the volume of the box.\n\nIn terms of the kinetic energy of the gas ''K'':\n\n:<math>PV = \\frac{2}{3} \\times{K}.</math>\n\nThis is a first non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a [[macroscopic]] property, to the  (translational) [[kinetic energy]] of the molecules <math>N\\frac{1}{2} m\\overline{v^2}</math>, which is a [[microscopic]] property.\n\n===Temperature and kinetic energy===\n\nRewriting the above result for the pressure as <math>PV = {Nm\\overline{v^2}\\over 3} </math>, \nwe may combine it with the [[ideal gas law]]\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\displaystyle PV = N k_B T ,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nwhere <math>\\displaystyle k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and <math>\\displaystyle T</math> the\n[[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute]] [[temperature]] defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain\n\n:<math>k_B T  =   {m\\overline{v^2}\\over 3} </math>,\n\nwhich leads to simplified expression of the average kinetic energy per molecule,<ref>The average kinetic energy of a fluid is proportional to the [[Root-mean-square speed|root mean-square velocity]], which always exceeds the mean velocity - [http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Gases/Kinetic/Gases08.htm Kinetic Molecular Theory]</ref>\n:<math>   \\displaystyle     \\frac {1} {2} m\\overline{v^2} =  \\frac {3} {2}  k_B T</math>.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the system is N times that of a molecule, namely <math> K= \\frac {1} {2} N m \\overline{v^2} </math>.\nThen the temperature <math>\\displaystyle T</math> takes the form\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>   \\displaystyle    T   =   {m\\overline{v^2}\\over 3 k_B}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nwhich becomes\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>   \\displaystyle    T   =   \\frac   {2}   {3}   \\frac   {K}   {N k_B}.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\nEq.({{EquationNote|3}})\nis one important result of the kinetic\ntheory:\n''The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature''.\nFrom Eq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and\nEq.({{EquationNote|3}}),\nwe have\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n   \\displaystyle \n   PV \n   =\n   \\frac\n   {2}\n   {3}\n   K.\n</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\nThus, the product of pressure and\nvolume per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] is proportional to the average\n(translational) molecular kinetic energy.\n\nEq.({{EquationNote|1}}) and Eq.({{EquationNote|4}})\nare called the \"classical results\",\nwhich could also be derived from [[statistical mechanics]];\nfor more details, see:<ref>\n[http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral (statistical mechanics)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428193950/http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 |date=2012-04-28 }}\n</ref>\n\nSince there are\n<math>\\displaystyle 3N</math>\n[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] in a monatomic-gas system with\n<math>\\displaystyle N</math>\nparticles,\nthe kinetic energy per degree of freedom per molecule is\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\n   \\displaystyle \n   \\frac\n   {K}\n   {3 N}\n   =\n   \\frac\n   {k_B T}\n   {2}\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\nIn the kinetic energy per degree of freedom,\nthe constant of proportionality of temperature\nis 1/2 times [[Boltzmann constant]] or R/2 per mole.

Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a [[Couette flow]] where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component <math>u</math> which increase uniformly with distance <math>y</math> above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution]] of molecular motions.\n\nLet <math> \\sigma </math> be the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among gas particles|cross section]] of one molecule colliding with another. The number density <math> n </math> is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume <math> n = N/V </math>. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is <math> n \\sigma </math>, and it is related to the [[Mean free path#Kinetic theory|mean free path]] <math>l</math> by \n\n<math> \\quad l = \\frac {1} {\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma} </math>\n\nNotice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume <math> n \\sigma </math> is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.\n\nLet <math> u_{0} </math> be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area <math>dA</math> on one side of the gas layer, with speed <math>v</math> at angle <math>\\theta</math> from the normal, in time interval <math>dt</math> is \n\n<math> \\quad nv\\cos{\\theta}dAdt{\\times}\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi k_BT}\\right)^{3/2}\\,  e^{- \\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\sin{\\theta}dv{d\\theta}d\\phi)</math>\n\nThese molecules made their last collision at a distance <math>l\\cos \\theta</math> above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a forward momentum of\n\n<math> \\quad p_{x}^{\\pm} = m \\left( u_{0} \\pm l \\cos \\theta {d u \\over dy} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below.

We note that\n\n<math> \\quad k_{B} \\cdot N_{A} = R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M = m \\cdot N_{A} </math>\n\nand insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for [[Viscosity models for mixtures#Dilute gas limit and scaled variables|shear viscosity for dilute gases]]:\n\n<math> \\quad \\eta_{0} = \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \\sigma } \n= \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{MRT}} { \\sigma \\cdot N_{A} } </math>\n\nand <math> M </math> is the [[molar mass]]. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by\n\n<math> \\quad \\sigma = \\pi \\left( 2 r \\right)^2 = \\pi d^2 </math>\n\nThe radius <math>r</math> is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter <math>d</math> is called collision cross section diameter or [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among particles|cross section]] and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] or [[Morse potential]] which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|The radius for zero  Lennard-Jones potential]] is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.\n\n===Thermal conductivity and heat flux===\n{{See also|Thermal conductivity}}Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for [[thermal conductivity]]<ref name=\"Sears1975\" /> of a dilute gas: \n\nConsider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer.

The model describes a gas as a large number of identical submicroscopic [[particle]]s ([[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s), all of which are in constant, rapid, [[randomness|random]] [[motion (physics)|motion]]. Their size is assumed to be much smaller than the average distance between the particles. The particles undergo random [[elastic collision]]s between themselves and with the enclosing walls of the container. The basic version of the model describes the [[ideal gas]], and considers no other interactions between the particles and, thus, the nature of kinetic energy transfers during collisions is strictly thermal.\n\nThe kinetic theory of gases explains the [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as [[Transport phenomena|transport properties]] such as [[viscosity]], [[thermal conductivity]] and [[mass diffusivity]]. The model also accounts for related phenomena, such as [[Brownian motion]].\n\n==History==\nIn approximately 50 [[before common era|BCE]], the Roman philosopher [[Lucretius]] proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maxwell|first1=J.

Also the [[logarithm]]ic connection between [[entropy]] and [[probability]] was first stated by him.\n\nIn the beginning of the twentieth century, however, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was [[Albert Einstein]]'s (1905)<ref>Einstein 1905</ref> and [[Marian Smoluchowski]]'s (1906)<ref>Smoluchowski 1906</ref>\npapers on [[Brownian motion]], which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe theory for ideal gases makes the following assumptions:\n\n* The gas consists of very small particles known as molecules. This smallness of their size is such that the total [[volume]] of the individual gas molecules added up is negligible compared to the volume of the smallest open ball containing all the molecules. This is equivalent to stating that the average distance separating the gas particles is large compared to their [[atomic radius|size]].\n* These particles have the same [[mass]].\n* The number of molecules is so large that statistical treatment can be applied.\n\n* The rapidly moving particles constantly collide among themselves and with the walls of the container. All these collisions are perfectly elastic. This means the molecules are considered to be perfectly spherical in shape and elastic in nature.\n* Except during collisions, the [[interaction]]s among molecules are negligible. (That is, they exert no [[force]]s on one another.) \n:This implies:\n::1. [[Special relativity|Relativistic]] effects are negligible.\n::2. [[Quantum mechanics|Quantum-mechanical]] effects are negligible. This means that the [[mean inter-particle distance|inter-particle distance]] is much larger than the [[thermal de Broglie wavelength]] and the molecules are treated as [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[physical body|objects]].\n::3. Because of the above two, their dynamics can be treated classically. This means that the equations of motion of the molecules are time-reversible.\n\n* The average kinetic energy of the gas particles depends only on the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]] of the [[system]]. The kinetic theory has its own definition of temperature, not identical with the thermodynamic definition.\n* The elapsed time of a collision between a molecule and the container's wall is negligible when compared to the time between successive collisions.\n* Because they have mass, gravity will accelerate molecules.  (If this were not the case then there would be no density gradient in a planet's troposphere and it would collapse to the surface.)\n\nMore modern developments relax these assumptions and are based on the [[Boltzmann equation]]. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, because they include the volume of the molecules. The necessary assumptions are the absence of quantum effects, [[molecular chaos]] and small gradients in bulk properties. Expansions to higher orders in the density are known as [[virial expansion]]s.\n\nAn important book on kinetic theory is that by [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman]] and [[Thomas Cowling|Cowling]].<ref name=\"C & C\">[[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Chapman, S.]], [[Cowling, T.G.]] (1939/1970).</ref> An important approach to the subject is called [[Chapman\u2013Enskog theory]].<ref>Kauzmann, W. (1966). ''Kinetic Theory of Gasses'', W.A. Benjamin, New York, pp. 232\u2013235.</ref> There have been many modern developments and there is an alternative approach developed by Grad based on moment expansions.<ref>Grad 1949</ref>\nIn the other limit, for extremely rarefied gases, the gradients in bulk properties are not small compared to the mean free paths. This is known as the Knudsen regime and expansions can be performed in the [[Knudsen number]].\n\n==Equilibrium properties==\n=== {{anchor|Pressure and Kinetic Energy}}Pressure and kinetic energy===<!-- This section is linked from [[Pressure]] -->\nIn kinetic model of gases, the [[pressure]] is equal to the force exerted by the atoms hitting and rebounding from a unit area of the gas container surface. Consider a gas of ''N'' molecules, each of mass ''m'', enclosed in a cube of volume ''V'' = ''L''<sup>3</sup>. When a gas molecule collides with the wall of the container perpendicular to the ''x'' axis and bounces off in the opposite direction with the same speed (an [[elastic collision]]), the change in [[momentum]] is given by:\n\n:<math>\\Delta p = p_{i,x} - p_{f,x} = p_{i,x} - (-p_{i,x}) = 2 p_{i,x} = 2 mv_x,</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' is the momentum, ''i'' and ''f'' indicate initial and final momentum (before and after collision), ''x'' indicates that only the ''x'' direction is being considered, and ''v'' is the speed of the [[particle]] (which is the same before and after the collision).\n\nThe particle impacts one specific side wall once every\n\n:<math>\\Delta t = \\frac{2L}{v_x},</math>\n\nwhere ''L'' is the distance between opposite walls.\n\nThe [[force]] due to this particle is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\Delta p}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{m v_x^2}{L}.</math>\n\nThe total force on the wall is\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v_x^2}}{L},</math>\n\nwhere the bar denotes an average over the ''N'' particles.\n\nSince the motion of the particles is random and there is no bias applied in any direction, the average squared speed in each direction is identical:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\overline{v_y^2} = \\overline{v_z^2}.</math>\n\nBy [[Pythagorean theorem]] in three dimensions the total squared speed ''v'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = \\overline{v_x^2} + \\overline{v_y^2} + \\overline{v_z^2},</math>\n\n:<math>\\overline{v^2} = 3\\overline{v_x^2}.</math>\n\nTherefore:\n\n:<math>\\overline{v_x^2} = \\frac{\\overline{v^2}}{3},</math>\n\nand the force can be written as:\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{Nm\\overline{v^2}}{3L}.</math>\n\nThis force is exerted on an area ''L''<sup>2</sup>.

Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a [[Couette flow]] where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component <math>u</math> which increase uniformly with distance <math>y</math> above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a [[Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution]] of molecular motions.\n\nLet <math> \\sigma </math> be the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among gas particles|cross section]] of one molecule colliding with another. The number density <math> n </math> is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume <math> n = N/V </math>. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is <math> n \\sigma </math>, and it is related to the [[Mean free path#Kinetic theory|mean free path]] <math>l</math> by \n\n<math> \\quad l = \\frac {1} {\\sqrt{2} n \\sigma} </math>\n\nNotice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume <math> n \\sigma </math> is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.\n\nLet <math> u_{0} </math> be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area <math>dA</math> on one side of the gas layer, with speed <math>v</math> at angle <math>\\theta</math> from the normal, in time interval <math>dt</math> is \n\n<math> \\quad nv\\cos{\\theta}dAdt{\\times}\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi k_BT}\\right)^{3/2}\\,  e^{- \\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT}} (v^2\\sin{\\theta}dv{d\\theta}d\\phi)</math>\n\nThese molecules made their last collision at a distance <math>l\\cos \\theta</math> above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a forward momentum of\n\n<math> \\quad p_{x}^{\\pm} = m \\left( u_{0} \\pm l \\cos \\theta {d u \\over dy} \\right), </math>\n\nwhere plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below.

We note that\n\n<math> \\quad k_{B} \\cdot N_{A} = R \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M = m \\cdot N_{A} </math>\n\nand insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation for [[Viscosity models for mixtures#Dilute gas limit and scaled variables|shear viscosity for dilute gases]]:\n\n<math> \\quad \\eta_{0} = \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{m k_{B} T}} { \\sigma } \n= \\frac {2} {3 \\sqrt{\\pi} } \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{MRT}} { \\sigma \\cdot N_{A} } </math>\n\nand <math> M </math> is the [[molar mass]]. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by\n\n<math> \\quad \\sigma = \\pi \\left( 2 r \\right)^2 = \\pi d^2 </math>\n\nThe radius <math>r</math> is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter <math>d</math> is called collision cross section diameter or [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision [[Cross section (physics)#Collision among particles|cross section]] and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] or [[Morse potential]] which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. [[Mean free path#Mean free path in kinetic theory|The radius for zero  Lennard-Jones potential]] is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.\n\n===Thermal conductivity and heat flux===\n{{See also|Thermal conductivity}}Following a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for [[thermal conductivity]]<ref name=\"Sears1975\" /> of a dilute gas: \n\nConsider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer.
