It is the culminating point on the north-south orientated chain separating the [[Val d'Anniviers]] to the west and the [[Mattertal]] to the east and enclosing the [[Turtmanntal]] to the north, the tripoint between these valleys being located just north of its main summit. The Weisshorn faces the slightly higher [[Dom (mountain)|Dom]] across the Mattertal, with the village of [[Randa, Switzerland|Randa]] 3100 metres below these two summits. After the Dom, the Weisshorn is the second-highest Alpine summit situated completely out the [[Main chain of the Alps|main chain]] and fully within Switzerland. On both sides of the Weisshorn range, the water end up in the Rhone, through the Navizence (west) and the Vispa (east). The Weisshorn and the Dom are only two of the many 4000-metre peaks surrounding the region of [[Zermatt]], along with the [[Zinalrothorn]], the [[Dent Blanche]], the [[Dent d'H\u00e9rens]], the [[Matterhorn]] and, second highest in the Alps, [[Monte Rosa]].\n\nThe Weisshorn has a pyramidal shape and its faces are separated by three ridges descending steeply from the summit. Two of these are nearly in a straight line, one running approximately north and the other south. The third ridge is nearly at right angles to these two, running almost due east. In the compartment between the northern and eastern spurs lies the Bis Glacier (''Bisgletscher''). It is connected with the summit by long and extremely steep slopes of snow. In the compartment between the eastern and southern spurs lies the Schali Glacier (''Schaligletscher''). Ranges of steep rocks rise round the whole basin of this glacier, except in one or two places where they are interrupted by couloirs of snow. Finally, on the western side the mountain presents one gigantic face of rocky precipice. This face rises above the Weisshorn Glacier (''Glacier du Weisshorn'') and the [[Moming Glacier]]. The northern spur forks out at a considerable distance below the summit into two branches enclosing the [[Turtmann Glacier]]. The eastern branch connects the mountain with the [[Bishorn]] (4,153 m), across the Weisshornjoch.<ref>[[Alpine Club (UK)]], ''The Alpine journale'', volume 1, 1864</ref>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Weisshorn3.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up view from the [[Barrhorn]] with the north face of the [[Bishorn]] in foreground]]\nThe Weisshorn is the culminating point of the [[Dent Blanche nappe]], a [[klippe]] belonging to the [[Austroalpine nappes]]. The mountain is composed of [[gneiss]]es; the west face is also composed of [[sedimentary rocks]] from the [[cretaceous]] period.<ref>''Geologic map of Switzerland'' 1:500 000, Bundesamt f\u00fcr Wasser und Geologie, CH-3003 Bern-Ittigen, {{ISBN|3-906723-39-9}}</ref>\n\n== Climbing history ==\nThe mountain was first climbed on 19 August 1861 by the 29-year-old physicist [[John Tyndall]], with guides J. J. Bennen and Ulrich Wenger. Their itinerary corresponds to the normal route for climbing the mountain today: the east ridge, starting from the [[Weisshorn Hut]].<ref name = Dumler>Helmut Dumler,Willi P. Burkhardt, ''Les 4000 des Alpes'', {{ISBN|2-7003-1305-4}}</ref>\n\n===1860 attempt===\n[[File:Weisshorn East.jpg|thumb|The south-east face (the Schaligrat on the left, the east ridge on the right) rising over the Schali Glacier]]\nIn 1860 an attempt was made by [[C. E. Mathews]] by the southern face. He came to Zermatt with [[Melchior Anderegg]], and engaged Johann Kronig as second guide. They slept at the huts of Schallenbergalp and started at half-past one on the morning of 1 July. Crossing the moraine, they walked until they reached a steep and rugged portion of the glacier, which hid the mountain from their view; and rounding this obstruction with some difficulty, they reached the upper portion of the glacier about five o'clock. They saw that the ridges were thickly coated over with fresh snow, and, except a little patch of rock some 700 or {{convert|800|ft|m}} below the summit, the whole mass was of brilliant and dazzling whiteness. They decided to try the southern side which seemed less steep and more practicable to Melchior but an avalanche stopped them:<ref name = Journal>[[Alpine Club (UK)]], ''The Alpine journal, volume 1'', 1864</ref>\n\n:\"For six mortal hours we toiled up the steep face of the mountain...A great many steps had to be cut, but for the most part we were able to tread out our foot-holds in the snow. About half-past nine the difficulties became much greater - ten or twelve inches of snow rested upon the ice. We could not get safe footing upon it, and my clinometer indicated an angle of 48 or 49 degrees. The necessity of clearing away the snow before the step could be cut in the ice beneath it, made Melchior's work very arduous, and the higher we got the greater the difficulties became. We had to take off veil and spectacles, and use all our eyes, the footholds were so insecure, and this, though the sun was extremely hot and there was not a cloud to be seen. Suddenly the heat of the sun loosened some snow just above us, and down came a little avalanche quite near enough to be exceedingly unpleasant.\"<ref name = Journal/>\n\nThe guide Kronig asked Mathews to give up the expedition. They turned back and reached Zermatt in the evening, after nineteen hours of walking. They experienced other avalanches on the descent and the eyes of Mathews were severely burnt.<ref name = Journal/>\n\n===First ascent===\n[[File:Weisshorn, east ridge.jpg|thumb|Climbers on the east ridge]]\nAccompanied by the guides J.J. Bennen, of Laax, and Ulrich Wenger, of Grindelwald, [[John Tyndall]] started the ascent from Randa at 1.00 p.m. on 18 August 1861. They had a bivouac and resumed the climb at 3.35 a.m. on the next day. Tyndall was optimistic but the ascent became difficult, he wrote:<ref name = Fleming>Fergus Fleming, ''Killing Dragons: The conquest of the Alps'', p. 202, 2002</ref>\n:\"Sometimes it was a fair pull upwards, sometimes an oblique twist round the corner of a rock tower; sometimes it was the grip of the finger ends in a fissure and lateral shifting of the whole body in a line parallel to the crack. Many times I found myself with my feet highest and my head lowest.\"<ref name = Fleming/>\n\nThey reached a dangerous thin ridge of snow, little wider than a hand's breadth, with precipices on either side. The guide Bennen trod the snow down and saw that it was firm enough to cross. Tyndall and Wenger followed Bennen, but yet the summit seemed less attainable and they were all tired. However Tyndall steeled himself with patriotic thoughts:<ref name = Fleming/>\n:\"I thought of Englishmen in battle, of the qualities which had made them famous: it was mainly the quality of not knowing when to yield - of fighting for duty even after they had ceased to be animated by hope. Such thoughts helped to lift me over the rocks.\"<ref name = Fleming/>\n\nAfter four hours of struggle they reached a sharp ridge of snow and finally arrived to the summit. The return was found to be not much less difficult than the ascent; and they regained Randa at 11 p.m., after about 20 hours of almost constant hard work.<ref name = Fleming/>\n\n===Other ascents===\n[[File:Weisshorn from Bishorn.JPG|thumb|The north ridge seen from the [[Bishorn]], with the [[Grand Gendarme]] in the middle]]\nThe second ascent, in 1862, was made by [[Leslie Stephen]]. Starting with Melchior Anderegg and Franz Biener, of Zermatt. It was from a chalet below the Schallenberg Alp, nearly 2 hours lower than Tyndall's bivouac, that Stephen gained the highest point in 9.5 hours, and returned to Randa in 7.5 hours more, reaching Zermatt the same evening.<ref name = Journal/>\n\nIn 1877, another route was opened by W. E. Davidson, J. W. Hartley and H. S. Hoare, with guides P. Rubi, J. Juan and A. Pollinger. After climbing part of the lower south-east face above the Schali Glacier, they reached the Schaligrat (south-west ridge) and continued to the summit. The complete ridge (which was considered too difficult and dangerous in its lower part) was first climbed in 1895 by J. M. Biner, A. Imboden and E. Broome. The south-east face was completely climbed in 1906 by [[Geoffrey Winthrop Young]] and R.G. Mayor with the guide [[Josef Knubel]] of [[St. Niklaus]] in the canton Valais.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\n[[File:Weisshorn, Zinal.jpg|thumb|left|The west face]]\nThe glaciated north-east face was first climbed in 1871 by J. H. Kitson with guides [[Christian Almer]] and his son. Almer wanted to reach the summit by nine o'clock in the morning while Kitson's wife watched them from the [[Gornergrat]]. In fact the difficulties were more serious than expected and they didn't reach the summit before midday. Shortly after, the ascent was repeated by [[W. A. B. Coolidge]] and [[Meta Brevoort]]. Both expeditions climbed the part of the face below the Grand Gendarme and continued near the north ridge. In 1909 G. W. Young and J. Knubel climbed the face by the central spur.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\nThe west face was first climbed in 1879 by G. A. Passingham with guides F. Imseng and L. Zurbr\u00fccken. Other routes on the face were opened in 1883 and 1889. The easiest passage on the east face was found in 1890 by G. W. Young, who climbed the spur under the Grand Gendarme with L. and B. Theytaz by a route known as the ''Younggrat''.\n\nThe summit of the [[Grand Gendarme]] on the unexplored north ridge was first reached in 1898. One month later, on 21 September 1898, H. Biehly and H. Burgener made the first complete traverse on the north ridge to the summit from the Bishorn.\n\n[[File:Bishorn-weisshorn.jpg|thumb|Bishorn and Weisshorn from the [[Turtmanntal]] side]]\nIn 1888 George Winkler was killed in a fall on the west face. He left [[Zinal]] alone on 17 August, without telling others his precise route. The rescue team only found a photo and a hat near an avalanche cone. His body was not found until the summer of 1956, on the Weisshorn Glacier. John Garforth Cockin was also killed making a solo attempt on the south-east face twelve years later.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\nIn 1925 Eleonore Noll-Hasenclever, H. Pfann and H. Trier were caught in an avalanche on the north-east face when they tried to reach the east ridge after interrupting their ascent on the north ridge on account of adverse weather conditions. Pfann and Trier survived, but Hasenclever died from asphyxiation.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\n== 1983 helicopter crash ==\nAn [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] [[helicopter]] from Air Zermatt crashed on a night flight on the Schali Glacier (south of the peak) on 31 July 1983. The helicopter was carrying the pilot, his assistant and a mountain guide who was searching for two missing alpinists. A false alarm made the pilot try to land the helicopter on the glacier at 3,160 m. All the crew were severely injured but the guide and pilot survived. The two missing alpinists were later found dead.<ref>[http://www.bfu.admin.ch/common/pdf/1134.pdf Schlu\u00dfbericht der Eidgen\u00f6ssischen Flugunfall-Untersuchungskommission] admin.ch</ref>\n\n== Climbing routes ==\nAll the routes are difficult. The normal route starts from the [[Weisshorn Hut]] on the east side and goes along the sharp east ridge.\n\nThe Weisshorn can be climbed from the [[Bishorn]] via the north ridge, departing from the [[Cabane de Tracuit]], above [[Zinal]]. The first three hours consist of relatively easy walking across the glacier and lead to the summit of the Bishorn (4153 m). The second part of the ascent is very exposed and takes another five hours, during which the [[Grand Gendarme]] must be climbed.<ref name=Dumler/>\n==See also==\n{{portal|Alps | left =  | break = }}\n*[[List of Alpine four-thousanders]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Weisshorn VS|Weisshorn}}\n* [http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150253/weisshorn.html Weisshorn on Summitpost]\n* [http://www.peakware.com/peaks.html?pk=265 The Weisshorn on PeakWare]\n* [http://www.mountwiki.com/wiki/view/Weisshorn The Weisshorn on MountWiki]\n* [http://www.4000er.de/gipfel.php?vid=53 The Weisshorn on 4000ers]\n\n{{Matter Valley|state=collapsed}}\n{{Mountains of Switzerland|state=collapsed}}\n{{Portal bar|Mountains|Switzerland}}\n\n[[Category:Alpine four-thousanders]]\n[[Category:Mountains of the Alps]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Valais]]\n[[Category:Pennine Alps]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Four-thousanders of Switzerland]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|Weisshorn (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2014}}\n{{Infobox mountain\n| name = Weisshorn\n| photo = Alps.jpg\n| photo_size = 285\n| photo_caption = North-east view of the Weisshorn\n| elevation_m = 4506\n| elevation_ref = \n| prominence = 1235&nbsp;m<span title=\"above the wind-gap\"> \u2193&nbsp;</span>Furggjoch\n| prominence_ref =<ref>[[Swisstopo]] map (the Furggjoch is the key col at 3,271 metres)</ref>\n| isolation = 11.0&nbsp;km<span title=\"to\"> \u2192&nbsp;</span>[[Dom (mountain)|Dom]]\n| isolation_ref = <ref>Retrieved from [[Google Earth]].

In the compartment between the northern and eastern spurs lies the Bis Glacier (''Bisgletscher''). It is connected with the summit by long and extremely steep slopes of snow. In the compartment between the eastern and southern spurs lies the Schali Glacier (''Schaligletscher''). Ranges of steep rocks rise round the whole basin of this glacier, except in one or two places where they are interrupted by couloirs of snow. Finally, on the western side the mountain presents one gigantic face of rocky precipice. This face rises above the Weisshorn Glacier (''Glacier du Weisshorn'') and the [[Moming Glacier]]. The northern spur forks out at a considerable distance below the summit into two branches enclosing the [[Turtmann Glacier]]. The eastern branch connects the mountain with the [[Bishorn]] (4,153 m), across the Weisshornjoch.<ref>[[Alpine Club (UK)]], ''The Alpine journale'', volume 1, 1864</ref>\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Weisshorn3.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up view from the [[Barrhorn]] with the north face of the [[Bishorn]] in foreground]]\nThe Weisshorn is the culminating point of the [[Dent Blanche nappe]], a [[klippe]] belonging to the [[Austroalpine nappes]]. The mountain is composed of [[gneiss]]es; the west face is also composed of [[sedimentary rocks]] from the [[cretaceous]] period.<ref>''Geologic map of Switzerland'' 1:500 000, Bundesamt f\u00fcr Wasser und Geologie, CH-3003 Bern-Ittigen, {{ISBN|3-906723-39-9}}</ref>\n\n== Climbing history ==\nThe mountain was first climbed on 19 August 1861 by the 29-year-old physicist [[John Tyndall]], with guides J. J. Bennen and Ulrich Wenger. Their itinerary corresponds to the normal route for climbing the mountain today: the east ridge, starting from the [[Weisshorn Hut]].<ref name = Dumler>Helmut Dumler,Willi P. Burkhardt, ''Les 4000 des Alpes'', {{ISBN|2-7003-1305-4}}</ref>\n\n===1860 attempt===\n[[File:Weisshorn East.jpg|thumb|The south-east face (the Schaligrat on the left, the east ridge on the right) rising over the Schali Glacier]]\nIn 1860 an attempt was made by C. E. Mathews by the southern face. He came to Zermatt with [[Melchior Anderegg]], and engaged Johann Kronig as second guide. They slept at the huts of Schallenbergalp and started at half-past one on the morning of 1 July. Crossing the moraine, they walked until they reached a steep and rugged portion of the glacier, which hid the mountain from their view; and rounding this obstruction with some difficulty, they reached the upper portion of the glacier about five o'clock. They saw that the ridges were thickly coated over with fresh snow, and, except a little patch of rock some 700 or {{convert|800|ft|m}} below the summit, the whole mass was of brilliant and dazzling whiteness. They decided to try the southern side which seemed less steep and more practicable to Melchior but an avalanche stopped them:<ref name = Journal>[[Alpine Club (UK)]], ''The Alpine journal, volume 1'', 1864</ref>\n\n:\"For six mortal hours we toiled up the steep face of the mountain...A great many steps had to be cut, but for the most part we were able to tread out our foot-holds in the snow. About half-past nine the difficulties became much greater - ten or twelve inches of snow rested upon the ice. We could not get safe footing upon it, and my clinometer indicated an angle of 48 or 49 degrees. The necessity of clearing away the snow before the step could be cut in the ice beneath it, made Melchior's work very arduous, and the higher we got the greater the difficulties became. We had to take off veil and spectacles, and use all our eyes, the footholds were so insecure, and this, though the sun was extremely hot and there was not a cloud to be seen. Suddenly the heat of the sun loosened some snow just above us, and down came a little avalanche quite near enough to be exceedingly unpleasant.\"<ref name = Journal/>\n\nThe guide Kronig asked Mathews to give up the expedition. They turned back and reached Zermatt in the evening, after nineteen hours of walking. They experienced other avalanches on the descent and the eyes of Mathews were severely burnt.<ref name = Journal/>\n\n===First ascent===\n[[File:Weisshorn, east ridge.jpg|thumb|Climbers on the east ridge]]\nAccompanied by the guides J.J. Bennen, of Laax, and Ulrich Wenger, of Grindelwald, [[John Tyndall]] started the ascent from Randa at 1.00 p.m. on 18 August 1861. They had a bivouac and resumed the climb at 3.35 a.m. on the next day. Tyndall was optimistic but the ascent became difficult, he wrote:<ref name = Fleming>Fergus Fleming, ''Killing Dragons: The conquest of the Alps'', p. 202, 2002</ref>\n:\"Sometimes it was a fair pull upwards, sometimes an oblique twist round the corner of a rock tower; sometimes it was the grip of the finger ends in a fissure and lateral shifting of the whole body in a line parallel to the crack. Many times I found myself with my feet highest and my head lowest.\"<ref name = Fleming/>\n\nThey reached a dangerous thin ridge of snow, little wider than a hand's breadth, with precipices on either side. The guide Bennen trod the snow down and saw that it was firm enough to cross. Tyndall and Wenger followed Bennen, but yet the summit seemed less attainable and they were all tired. However Tyndall steeled himself with patriotic thoughts:<ref name = Fleming/>\n:\"I thought of Englishmen in battle, of the qualities which had made them famous: it was mainly the quality of not knowing when to yield - of fighting for duty even after they had ceased to be animated by hope. Such thoughts helped to lift me over the rocks.\"<ref name = Fleming/>\n\nAfter four hours of struggle they reached a sharp ridge of snow and finally arrived to the summit. The return was found to be not much less difficult than the ascent; and they regained Randa at 11 p.m., after about 20 hours of almost constant hard work.<ref name = Fleming/>\n\n===Other ascents===\n[[File:Weisshorn from Bishorn.JPG|thumb|The north ridge seen from the [[Bishorn]], with the [[Grand Gendarme]] in the middle]]\nThe second ascent, in 1862, was made by [[Leslie Stephen]]. Starting with Melchior Anderegg and Franz Biener, of Zermatt. It was from a chalet below the Schallenberg Alp, nearly 2 hours lower than Tyndall's bivouac, that Stephen gained the highest point in 9.5 hours, and returned to Randa in 7.5 hours more, reaching Zermatt the same evening.<ref name = Journal/>\n\nIn 1877, another route was opened by W. E. Davidson, J. W. Hartley and H. S. Hoare, with guides P. Rubi, J. Juan and A. Pollinger. After climbing part of the lower south-east face above the Schali Glacier, they reached the Schaligrat (south-west ridge) and continued to the summit. The complete ridge (which was considered too difficult and dangerous in its lower part) was first climbed in 1895 by J. M. Biner, A. Imboden and E. Broome. The south-east face was completely climbed in 1906 by [[Geoffrey Winthrop Young]] and R.G. Mayor with the guide [[Josef Knubel]] of [[St. Niklaus]] in the canton Valais.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\n[[File:Weisshorn, Zinal.jpg|thumb|left|The west face]]\nThe glaciated north-east face was first climbed in 1871 by J. H. Kitson with guides [[Christian Almer]] and his son. Almer wanted to reach the summit by nine o'clock in the morning while Kitson's wife watched them from the [[Gornergrat]]. In fact the difficulties were more serious than expected and they didn't reach the summit before midday. Shortly after, the ascent was repeated by [[W. A. B. Coolidge]] and [[Meta Brevoort]]. Both expeditions climbed the part of the face below the Grand Gendarme and continued near the north ridge. In 1909 G. W. Young and J. Knubel climbed the face by the central spur.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\nThe west face was first climbed in 1879 by G. A. Passingham with guides F. Imseng and L. Zurbr\u00fccken. Other routes on the face were opened in 1883 and 1889. The easiest passage on the east face was found in 1890 by G. W. Young, who climbed the spur under the Grand Gendarme with L. and B. Theytaz by a route known as the ''Younggrat''.\n\nThe summit of the [[Grand Gendarme]] on the unexplored north ridge was first reached in 1898. One month later, on 21 September 1898, H. Biehly and H. Burgener made the first complete traverse on the north ridge to the summit from the Bishorn.\n\n[[File:Bishorn-weisshorn.jpg|thumb|Bishorn and Weisshorn from the [[Turtmanntal]] side]]\nIn 1888 George Winkler was killed in a fall on the west face. He left [[Zinal]] alone on 17 August, without telling others his precise route. The rescue team only found a photo and a hat near an avalanche cone. His body was not found until the summer of 1956, on the Weisshorn Glacier. John Garforth Cockin was also killed making a solo attempt on the south-east face twelve years later.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\nIn 1925 Eleonore Noll-Hasenclever, H. Pfann and H. Trier were caught in an avalanche on the north-east face when they tried to reach the east ridge after interrupting their ascent on the north ridge on account of adverse weather conditions. Pfann and Trier survived, but Hasenclever died from asphyxiation.<ref name=Dumler/>\n\n== 1983 helicopter crash ==\nAn [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] [[helicopter]] from Air Zermatt crashed on a night flight on the Schali Glacier (south of the peak) on 31 July 1983. The helicopter was carrying the pilot, his assistant and a mountain guide who was searching for two missing alpinists. A false alarm made the pilot try to land the helicopter on the glacier at 3,160 m. All the crew were severely injured but the guide and pilot survived. The two missing alpinists were later found dead.<ref>[http://www.bfu.admin.ch/common/pdf/1134.pdf Schlu\u00dfbericht der Eidgen\u00f6ssischen Flugunfall-Untersuchungskommission] admin.ch</ref>\n\n== Climbing routes ==\nAll the routes are difficult. The normal route starts from the [[Weisshorn Hut]] on the east side and goes along the sharp east ridge.\n\nThe Weisshorn can be climbed from the [[Bishorn]] via the north ridge, departing from the [[Cabane de Tracuit]], above [[Zinal]]. The first three hours consist of relatively easy walking across the glacier and lead to the summit of the Bishorn (4153 m). The second part of the ascent is very exposed and takes another five hours, during which the [[Grand Gendarme]] must be climbed.<ref name=Dumler/>\n==See also==\n{{portal|Alps | left =  | break = }}\n*[[List of Alpine four-thousanders]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Weisshorn VS|Weisshorn}}\n* [http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/150253/weisshorn.html Weisshorn on Summitpost]\n* [http://www.peakware.com/peaks.html?pk=265 The Weisshorn on PeakWare]\n* [http://www.mountwiki.com/wiki/view/Weisshorn The Weisshorn on MountWiki]\n* [http://www.4000er.de/gipfel.php?vid=53 The Weisshorn on 4000ers]\n\n{{Matter Valley|state=collapsed}}\n{{Mountains of Switzerland|state=collapsed}}\n{{Portal bar|Mountains|Switzerland}}\n\n[[Category:Alpine four-thousanders]]\n[[Category:Mountains of the Alps]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Valais]]\n[[Category:Pennine Alps]]\n[[Category:Mountains of Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Four-thousanders of Switzerland]]\n", "name_user": "AtticTapestry", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e1860 attempt:Link toC.

Desmond appeared at Brubeck's San Francisco apartment one day while Dave was in the back yard hanging diapers on a laundry line, and Iola, defying Brubeck's wishes, let Desmond in and took him to Dave.

In 1976 Desmond played 25 shows in 25 nights with Brubeck, touring the United States in several cities by bus.\n\n===Other collaborations===\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=250px|quote=Playing with Desmond and Mulligan was really mind-blowing because they were such heroes for me.|source=Perry Robinson<ref name=\"robinson\"/>}}\nDesmond worked several times during his career with baritone saxophonist and band leader [[Gerry Mulligan]]. The two made two studio albums together (''Gerry Mulligan - Paul Desmond Quartet'' (1957), and ''Two of a Mind'' (1962)). In June 1969 Desmond appeared at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] with Gerry Mulligan, procuring favorable reactions from critics and audience members.<ref name=\"doyle\"/> During Brubeck's ''Two Generations'' tours, Desmond and Mulligan shared the stage together in 1974. Unlike Brubeck, Mulligan personally shared much in common with Desmond. The two shared similar interests and humor, and both men had no shortage of addictions in their lives.<ref name=\"robinson\"/>\n\nDesmond had a celebrated studio partnership with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]]. Hall played on several albums recorded by Desmond between 1959 and 1963 for the Warner Bros. and RCA record labels. After some time spent inactive, Desmond was asked to play the Half Note in New York City in 1971 by Hall. With his special brand of humor, Desmond said that he took the job only because he was nearby and could tumble out of bed to work. The two continued to play at the club to jam-packed audiences. Desmond also joined the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] for a Christmas concert in 1971 at the [[The Town Hall (New York City)|New York Town Hall]].<ref name=\"doyle\"/>\n\nDesmond was a guest artist on five tracks by [[Chet Baker]] recorded between 1975-1977. These were released on the albums ''She Was Too Good to Me'', ''You Can't Go Home Again'', and ''The Best Thing For You''. Baker and Desmond also appeared together on two tracks included on Jim Hall's 1975 ''Concierto'' album.\n\nDesmond met Canadian guitarist [[Ed Bickert]] through a recommendation by Jim Hall, and Desmond performed with Bickert at several clubs in the Toronto area during 1974-1975. Desmond featured Bickert on his 1975 studio album ''Pure Desmond'', and the two played together at the 1976 [[Edmonton]] Jazz Festival. Live recordings of that concert and club dates with Bickert performed during 1974-1975 were released during and after Desmond's lifetime.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn their private lives Dave Brubeck and his family were very close to Paul Desmond, though the two men possessed very different personalities. Darius Brubeck recalls thinking that Desmond was his uncle almost into adolescence. Desmond grew especially close to Dave's son Michael, to whom he left his saxophone upon death. Desmond was also described as a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who was unable to form (and was uninterested in maintaining) steady relationships with women, though he had no shortage of female companions throughout his life.<ref>Gioia, Ted (1998). ''West Coast Jazz'', Ch 4: \"Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco\"; University of California Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0520217292}}</ref>  Desmond is reported to have quipped, upon seeing a former girlfriend on the street, \"There she goes, not with a whim but a banker\" (a semi-[[Spoonerism]] reference to T.S. Eliot's \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper\"). In contrast, Brubeck was deeply religious and a stalwart family man.<ref name=\"lees\"/>{{Quote box|width=250px|quote=I have won several prizes as the world's slowest alto player, as well as a special award in 1961 for quietness. |source=Paul Desmond<ref name=\"isms\">{{cite web|last = |first = |title = Paul Desmond-isms |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=19154#.Uj7KMmTwLyd|accessdate = 2013-09-22}}</ref>}}\nDesmond enjoyed reading works by the thinkers of his generation like [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], also dabbling in some [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] usage. He was known to have several addictions, including [[Dewar's]] [[Scotch whisky]] and [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]] cigarettes. In the 1940s and 1950s, Desmond frequently took [[amphetamine]]s, and in the 1970s, he was known to use cocaine.<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\"/> His chemical-dependency problems would sometimes drain him of his energy on the road. Clarinetist [[Perry Robinson]] recalls in his autobiography that Desmond would sometimes need a [[vitamin B12]] shot just to go on playing during his later career.<ref name=\"robinson\">{{cite book|last = Robinson|first = Perry|authorlink = Perry Robinson|title = Perry Robinson: The Traveler |publisher = iUniverse|year = 2002|pages = 190\u2013191|doi = |isbn = 0-595-21538-6}}</ref>{{Quote box|align=left|width=225px|quote=Pristine, perfect.

Never without his humor, after he was diagnosed with cancer he expressed pleasure at the health of his liver. His last concert was with Brubeck in February 1977, in New York City. His fans did not know that he was already dying.  Desmond specified in his will that all proceeds from \"Take Five\" would go to the [[Red Cross]] following his death.<ref>{{cite book | author-link = Ted Gioia |first=Ted |last=Gioia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KFhpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA419 | title = The Jazz Standards: A Guide to the Repertoire | date = 2012-09-27 | page = 419 | quote = When Paul Desmond passed away in 1977, his will stipulated that royalties form this song and his other compositions go to the American Red Cross.

After this long and expensive process, Desmond willed the piano to Cunningham, a characteristic and final prank.  \nThe Paul Desmond Papers are held at the Holt-Atherton Special Collections in the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] Library.\n\nDesmond was cremated and his ashes were scattered.\n\n==Style==\nDesmond produced a light, melodic tone on the alto saxophone, trying to sound, he said, \"like a dry [[martini (cocktail)|martini]].\" With a style that was similar to that of [[Lee Konitz]], one of his influences, he quickly became one of the best-known saxophonists from the [[West Coast jazz|West Coast]]'s [[cool jazz|cool school of jazz]]. Much of the success of the classic Brubeck quartet was due to the juxtaposition of his airy style over Brubeck's sometimes relatively heavy, [[polytonality|polytonal]] piano work.<ref>{{cite book|last = Owens|first = Thomas|authorlink = |title = Bebop: The Music and Its Players |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|year = 1995|page = 68|doi = |isbn = 0-19-510651-2}}</ref>\n\nHis rare gift for [[improvisation|improvised]] [[counterpoint]] is perhaps most evident on the two albums he recorded with baritone saxophonist [[Gerry Mulligan]] (''Mulligan-Desmond Quartet'' and ''[[Two of a Mind]]'').  Desmond's playing was also notable for his ability to produce extremely high notes, the [[altissimo]] register, on his saxophone.\n\nDesmond played a [[Selmer Paris|Selmer]] ''Super Balanced Action'' model alto saxophone coupled with an M. C. Gregory model 4A-18M hard rubber mouthpiece, both dating from circa 1951, with a moderately stiff Rico 3 \u00bd reed.<ref name=\"ramsey-setup\">{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Doug|title=Take Five:  The Public and Private Lives of Paul Desmond|year=2005|publisher=Parkside Publications|location=Seattle|isbn=0-9617266-7-9|pages=102, 118, 216, 292|ref=ramsey}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===With Dave Brubeck===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n|-\n! style=\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; width:20px;\"|Year\n! valign=\"bottom\" style=\"text-align:center; width:300px;\"|Album\n!  style=\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; width:200px;\"|Leader\n!  style=\"vertical-align:bottom; text-align:center; width:100px;\"|Label\n|-\n|1950\n|''[[Dave Brubeck Octet]]''\n|[[Dave Brubeck]]\n|[[Fantasy Records|Fantasy]] 3239\n|-\n|1951\n|''[[Brubeck/Desmond]]''\n|Dave Brubeck Quartet\n|Fantasy 3229\n|-\n|1952 \t\t\n|''Modern Complex Dialogues'' [live]\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Alto AL-711\n|-\n|1952\n|''[[Jazz at Storyville]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Fantasy 3240\n|-\n|1952\n|''[[Dave Brubeck Quartet (album)|The Dave Brubeck Quartet]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Fantasy 3230\n|-\n|1952\n|''[[Jazz at the Blackhawk]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Fantasy 3210\n|-\n|1953\n|''[[Jazz at Oberlin]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Fantasy 3245\n|-\n|1953\n|''The Jackson-Harris Herd/The Dave Brubeck Quartet: Live at the Blue Note, Chicago, March 1953''\n|Dave Brubeck Quartet, [[Chubby Jackson]]\u2013[[Bill Harris (musician)|Bill Harris]] Herd\n|Jazz Band (UK) EB-2140\n|-\n|1953\n|''[[Brubeck & Desmond at Wilshire-Ebell]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Fantasy 3249\n|-\n|1953\n|''[[Jazz at the College of the Pacific]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Fantasy 3223\n|-\n|1953\n|''[[Jazz at the College of the Pacific, Volume 2]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|OJC 1076\n|-\n|1954\n|''Dave Brubeck at Storyville 1954''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|[[Columbia Records|Columbia]] CL-590\n|-\n|1954\n|''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Columbia CL-566\n|-\n|1954\n|''[[Brubeck Time]]''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Columbia CL-622\n|-\n|1954\n|''[[Jazz: Red Hot and Cool]]'' [live]\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Columbia CL-699\n|-\n|1956, 1957\n|''Dave Brubeck Quartet Live in 1956\u201357 Featuring Paul Desmond''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Jazz Band (UK) EB-2102\n|-\n|1956\n|''Live From Basin Street''\n|Dave Brubeck\n|Jazz Band (UK) EB-402\n|-\n|1956\n|''[[Dave Brubeck and Jay & Kai at Newport]]''\n|Dave Brubeck Quartet, [[J.

He was one of the most popular musicians to come out of the [[cool jazz]] scene.\n\nIn addition to his work with Brubeck, he led several groups and collaborated with [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Chet Baker]], [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]], and [[Ed Bickert]].  After years of chain smoking and poor health, Desmond succumbed to lung cancer in 1977 after a tour with Brubeck.\n\n==Early life==\nDesmond was born Paul Emil Breitenfeld in San Francisco, California, in 1924, the son of Shirley (n\u00e9e King) and Emil Aron Breitenfeld.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCwIAQAAMAAJ&q=father+Emil+Breitenfeld&dq=father+Emil+Breitenfeld&hl=en|title=Take five|work=google.ca}}</ref> His grandfather, Sigmund Breitenfeld was, according to an obituary, born in Austria in 1857. Sigmund Breitenfeld, a medical doctor, emigrated to New York City with his wife Hermine (born Hermine Lewy) at the end of the 19th century, and the Breitenfelds raised their four children (including Desmond's father Emil) with no religion. Interviewed by Desmond biographer Doug Ramsey, Desmond's first cousin Rick Breitenfeld said that no one in the Breitenfeld family could find evidence of Jewish ancestry or Jewish religious observance, but Paul Desmond and members of his father's family \"frequently speculated as to whether or not Sigmund or Hermine Breitenfeld had Jewish backgrounds\".<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\">{{cite book |last=Ramsey|first=Doug|date=2004|title=Take Five: The Public and Private Lives of Paul Desmond|location=Seattle, Wa.|publisher=Parkside Publications|isbn=978-0961726676}}</ref> Biographer Ramsey notes that \"the name Breitenfeld could be Jewish or non-Jewish. There are plenty of Breitenfelds in Germany and Austria to support both sides of the argument.

Breitenfeld accompanied silent films in movie theaters and produced musical arrangements for printed publication and for live theatrical productions. During [[WWI]], while Breitenfeld while was training with the [[17th New York Regiment]] in [[Plattsburgh (town), New York|Plattsburgh, New York]], he composed ''[[The Last Long Mile]]'', one of the most well-known soldiers' songs of that war.<ref> The Singing Program of World War I: The Crusade for a Singing Army Author(s): E.

During high school, he wished to study violin, but his father dissuaded him, saying that violin players were \"a dime a dozen....with the violin, you'll starve.\"<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\"/> Desmond developed a talent for writing during high school as well, becoming co-editor of his high school newspaper. In that capacity, he interviewed comedian [[Bob Hope]] for his school newspaper during one of Hope's visits to San Francisco. As freshman at [[San Francisco State College]], Desmond began playing [[alto saxophone]]. In his first year of college, Desmond was drafted into the [[United States Army]] and joined the Army band while stationed in San Francisco. He spent three years in the military, but his unit was not called to combat.<ref name=\"doyle\">{{cite book|last = Doyle|first = Brian|authorlink = |title = Spirited Men: Story, Soul, and Substance |publisher = [[Cowley Publications]]|year = 2004|pages = 73\u201374|doi = |isbn = 1-56101-258-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, following his military discharge, Desmond legally changed his last named from Breitenfeld to Desmond. He told many stories over the years regarding how he chose the name Desmond, but his biographer Doug Ramsey offers an account from Desmond's friend Hal Strack that the two were listening to the [[Gene Krupa]] band singer [[Johnny Desmond]] in 1942, and Desmond told Strack \"that's such a great name. It's so smooth and yet it's uncommon....If I ever decide I need another name, it's going to be Desmond.\"<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\"/> Desmond was married from 1947 to 1949 to Duane Reeves Lamon. Following his divorce, he remained single for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\"/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter [[World War II]], Desmond started working in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], taking pick-up work as a backing musician as he could find it. He worked occasionally for [[Dave Brubeck]] at the Geary Cellar in San Francisco. For a period of several weeks, he led a small jazz combo at the Band Box in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]] that included [[Dave Brubeck]]. Desmond had a falling out with Brubeck when he resigned from the Band Box and prevented Brubeck from taking over the residency.<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\"/> In 1950 Desmond joined the band of [[Jack Fina]] and toured with Fina for several months, but he returned to California after hearing Brubeck's trio on the radio and deciding that he should repair his relationship with Brubeck and attempt to join Brubeck's increasingly successful band.\n\nAt the time, Brubeck and Brubeck's wife Iola had three small children, and Brubeck had instructed Iola not to let Desmond set foot in the family home. Desmond appeared at Brubeck's San Francisco apartment one day while Dave was in the back yard hanging diapers on a laundry line, and Iola, defying Brubeck's wishes, let Desmond in and took him to Dave. Desmond offered to perform arranging and administrative work for Brubeck's band, and to babysit Brubeck's children, and Brubeck finally relented and agreed to try working with Desmond again.<ref name=\"doyle\"/>\n\n===Dave Brubeck Quartet===\n{{main|The Dave Brubeck Quartet}}\n{{Quote box|width=300px|quote=Some people called him the stork\u2014'Cause he would stand on one leg and leaned on the piano.

Brubeck was trying out for the 253rd Army band which Desmond belonged to. After making the cut he\u2014unlike Desmond\u2014was sent overseas in 1944, to Europe. Desmond once told [[Marian McPartland]] of [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Piano Jazz'' that he was taken aback by the chord changes Brubeck introduced during that 1944 audition. After convincing Brubeck to hire him following his stint with [[Jack Fina]], the two had a contract drafted (of which Brubeck was the sole signatory); the language forbade Brubeck from firing him, ensured Brubeck's status as group leader, and gave Desmond twenty percent of all profits generated from the quartet.<ref name=\"doyle\"/><ref name=\"lees\">{{cite book|last = Lees|first = Gene|authorlink = |title = Cats of Any Color: Jazz Black and White|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2001|pages = [https://archive.org/details/catsofanycolor00gene/page/55 55\u201357]|doi = |isbn = 0-306-80950-8|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/catsofanycolor00gene/page/55}}</ref> That is how the Dave Brubeck Quartet had its start, a group that began in 1951 and ended in December 1967. The quartet became especially popular with college-age audiences, often performing in college settings like on their ground-breaking 1953 album ''[[Jazz at Oberlin]]'' at [[Oberlin College]], or on their recordings on the campuses of [[Ohio University]] and the [[University of Michigan]], among others. The success of the quartet led to a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine piece on them in 1954, with the famous cover featuring Brubeck's face.<ref>{{cite book|last = Martin|first = Henry|authorlink = |title = Essential Jazz: The First 100 Years |publisher = [[Thomson Wadsworth]]|year = 2004|page = 314|doi = |isbn = 0-534-63810-4}}</ref> The group played until 1967, when Brubeck switched his musical focus from performance to composition and broke the unit up. During the 1970s Desmond joined Brubeck for several reunion tours, including \"Two Generations of Brubeck\". Accompanying them were Brubeck's sons [[Chris Brubeck]], Dan Brubeck and [[Darius Brubeck]]. In 1976 Desmond played 25 shows in 25 nights with Brubeck, touring the United States in several cities by bus.\n\n===Other collaborations===\n{{Quote box|align=left|width=250px|quote=Playing with Desmond and Mulligan was really mind-blowing because they were such heroes for me.|source=Perry Robinson<ref name=\"robinson\"/>}}\nDesmond worked several times during his career with baritone saxophonist and band leader [[Gerry Mulligan]]. The two made two studio albums together (''Gerry Mulligan - Paul Desmond Quartet'' (1957), and ''Two of a Mind'' (1962)). In June 1969 Desmond appeared at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] with Gerry Mulligan, procuring favorable reactions from critics and audience members.<ref name=\"doyle\"/> During Brubeck's ''Two Generations'' tours, Desmond and Mulligan shared the stage together in 1974. Unlike Brubeck, Mulligan personally shared much in common with Desmond. The two shared similar interests and humor, and both men had no shortage of addictions in their lives.<ref name=\"robinson\"/>\n\nDesmond had a celebrated studio partnership with guitarist [[Jim Hall (musician)|Jim Hall]]. Hall played on several albums recorded by Desmond between 1959 and 1963 for the Warner Bros. and RCA record labels. After some time spent inactive, Desmond was asked to play the Half Note in New York City in 1971 by Hall. With his special brand of humor, Desmond said that he took the job only because he was nearby and could tumble out of bed to work. The two continued to play at the club to jam-packed audiences. Desmond also joined the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] for a Christmas concert in 1971 at the [[The Town Hall (New York City)|New York Town Hall]].<ref name=\"doyle\"/>\n\nDesmond was a guest artist on five tracks by [[Chet Baker]] recorded between 1975-1977. These were released on the albums ''She Was Too Good to Me'', ''You Can't Go Home Again'', and ''The Best Thing For You''. Baker and Desmond also appeared together on two tracks included on Jim Hall's 1975 ''Concierto'' album.\n\nDesmond met Canadian guitarist [[Ed Bickert]] through a recommendation by Jim Hall, and Desmond performed with Bickert at several clubs in the Toronto area during 1974-1975. Desmond featured Bickert on his 1975 studio album ''Pure Desmond'', and the two played together at the 1976 [[Edmonton]] Jazz Festival. Live recordings of that concert and club dates with Bickert performed during 1974-1975 were released during and after Desmond's lifetime.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn their private lives Dave Brubeck and his family were very close to Paul Desmond, though the two men possessed very different personalities. Darius Brubeck recalls thinking that Desmond was his uncle almost into adolescence. Desmond grew especially close to Dave's son Michael, to whom he left his saxophone upon death. Desmond was also described as a [[Promiscuity#Male promiscuity|womanizer]] who was unable to form (and was uninterested in maintaining) steady relationships with women, though he had no shortage of female companions throughout his life.<ref>Gioia, Ted (1998). ''West Coast Jazz'', Ch 4: \"Dave Brubeck and Modern Jazz in San Francisco\"; University of California Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0520217292}}</ref>  Desmond is reported to have quipped, upon seeing a former girlfriend on the street, \"There she goes, not with a whim but a banker\" (a semi-[[Spoonerism]] reference to T.S. Eliot's \"This is the way the world ends / Not with a bang but a whimper\"). In contrast, Brubeck was deeply religious and a stalwart family man.<ref name=\"lees\"/>{{Quote box|width=250px|quote=I have won several prizes as the world's slowest alto player, as well as a special award in 1961 for quietness. |source=Paul Desmond<ref name=\"isms\">{{cite web|last = |first = |title = Paul Desmond-isms |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=19154#.Uj7KMmTwLyd|accessdate = 2013-09-22}}</ref>}}\nDesmond enjoyed reading works by the thinkers of his generation like [[Timothy Leary]] and [[Jack Kerouac]], also dabbling in some [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] usage. He was known to have several addictions, including [[Dewar's]] [[Scotch whisky]] and [[Pall Mall (cigarette)|Pall Mall]] cigarettes. In the 1940s and 1950s, Desmond frequently took [[amphetamine]]s, and in the 1970s, he was known to use cocaine.<ref name=\"Ramsey no page\"/> His chemical-dependency problems would sometimes drain him of his energy on the road.

Never without his humor, after he was diagnosed with cancer he expressed pleasure at the health of his liver. His last concert was with Brubeck in February 1977, in New York City. His fans did not know that he was already dying.  Desmond specified in his will that all proceeds from \"Take Five\" would go to the [[Red Cross]] following his death.<ref>{{cite book | author-link = Ted Gioia |first=Ted |last=Gioia | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KFhpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA419 | title = The Jazz Standards: A Guide to the Repertoire | date = 2012-09-27 | page = 419 | quote = When Paul Desmond passed away in 1977, his will stipulated that royalties form this song and his other compositions go to the American Red Cross.

After this long and expensive process, Desmond willed the piano to Cunningham, a characteristic and final prank.  \nThe Paul Desmond Papers are held at the Holt-Atherton Special Collections in the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] Library.\n\nDesmond was cremated and his ashes were scattered.\n\n==Style==\nDesmond produced a light, melodic tone on the alto saxophone, trying to sound, he said, \"like a dry [[martini (cocktail)|martini]].\" With a style that was similar to that of [[Lee Konitz]], one of his influences, he quickly became one of the best-known saxophonists from the [[West Coast jazz|West Coast]]'s [[cool jazz|cool school of jazz]]. Much of the success of the classic Brubeck quartet was due to the juxtaposition of his airy style over Brubeck's sometimes relatively heavy, [[polytonality|polytonal]] piano work.<ref>{{cite book|last = Owens|first = Thomas|authorlink = |title = Bebop: The Music and Its Players |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|year = 1995|page = 68|doi = |isbn = 0-19-510651-2}}</ref>\n\nHis rare gift for [[improvisation|improvised]] [[counterpoint]] is perhaps most evident on the two albums he recorded with baritone saxophonist [[Gerry Mulligan]] (''Mulligan-Desmond Quartet'' and ''[[Two of a Mind]]'').  Desmond's playing was also notable for his ability to produce extremely high notes, the [[altissimo]] register, on his saxophone.\n\nDesmond played a [[Selmer Paris|Selmer]] ''Super Balanced Action'' model alto saxophone coupled with an M.

It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by the combined armies of the [[Deccan sultanates]].

Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.\n\nThe empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at [[Hampi]]. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting [[Hinduism]] as a unifying factor.\n\n==Alternative name==\n''Karnata Rajya'' (Karnata Empire) was another name for the Vijayanagara Empire, used in some inscriptions<ref name=\"karnata\">{{cite web|title=Telugu Inscriptions from Vijayanagar Dynasty, vol16, Introduction|url=http://inscriptions.whatisindia.com/|author=K.V.Ramesh|publisher=What Is India Publishers (P) Ltd., Saturday, December 30, 2006 |work=Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=2006-12-31}}</ref><ref name=\"reviver1\">{{harvnb|Nilakanta Sastri|1955|p=268}}</ref> and literary works of the Vijayanagara times including the Sanskrit work ''Jambavati Kalyanam'' by King [[Krishnadevaraya]] and Telugu work ''Vasu Charitamu''.<ref name=\"jambavati\">{{harvnb|Fritz|Michell|2001|p=14}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Origin of Vijayanagara Empire|Ancient City of Vijayanagara|Battle of Raichur|Battle of Talikota}}\nDiffering theories have been proposed regarding the origins of the Vijayanagara empire.

Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth.\n\nThe empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at [[Hampi]]. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the [[Vijayanagara Architecture]] style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in [[Hindu temples]]' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and [[Sanskrit]], while [[Carnatic music]] evolved into its current form.

While the empire's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India, nothing surpasses the vast open-air theatre of monuments at its capital at [[Vijayanagara]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=\"Stones\">\"So intimate are the rocks and the monuments they were used for make, it was sometimes impossible to say where nature ended and art began\" (Art critic Percy Brown, quoted in ''Hampi, A Travel Guide'', p64)</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the kings continued to build [[vesara]] or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style [[gopura]]s to meet their ritualistic needs.

When he goes to war, he leaves his pregnant wife, Lise, at Bald Hills in the countryside with his father and sister.\n\nAndrei is wounded at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. He has an epiphany while lying on the battlefield gazing up at the vastness of the blue sky, realising that he has the potential to be happy. Shortly afterwards, Andrei is rescued from the battlefield by [[Napoleon]], who takes a liking to him. However, Prince Andrei is not listed among the dead or the officers taken prisoner, leading his father and sister to assume the worst. Neither inform Lise that he is unaccounted-for, fearing to cause her any anxiety in the final stages of her pregnancy. Andrei arrives, fully recovered, while his wife is in labour and sees her briefly before she dies in childbirth. The child, a boy, survives. Andrei, who, despite everything, had cared deeply for his wife (as he confides later to Pierre), is guilt-stricken and depressed. Completely disillusioned with his former wartime ambitions, Andrei spends the following few years at home, raising his son and serving under his father.\n\nIn 1809, Andrei is recalled to [[St Petersburg|Petersburg]], where he is formally introduced to Countess [[Natasha Rostova]] for the first time. Andrei wishes to marry Natasha, but his father expresses concern: he does not wish to see his son rush into a marriage with a woman half his age, and socially below him. Old Prince Bolkonsky demands that they wait a year before marrying. Andrei proposes marriage to Natasha, who happily accepts, though she is upset by the one-year wait. In the meantime Andrei decides to tour Europe.\n\nIn Andrei's absence however, Natasha develops an infatuation with the libertine Prince Anatole Kuragin. She breaks off the engagement with Andrei and plans to elope with Kuragin. Natasha is stopped by her cousin Sonya and Marya Dmitrievna, who suspect Anatole's intentions. They later find out from Pierre Bezukhov that Anatole is already secretly married to a Polish woman.\n\nAndrei wants to take revenge on Kuragin, who flees after Pierre warns him. Not having found Kuragin and in the light of Napoleon's [[1812 invasion of Russia|1812 invasion]], he decides to join the army again. When [[Kutuzov]] is appointed commander-in-chief, he offers Andrei a position in his personal staff. Andrei declines as he is a well-liked regimental commander, considering his role there to be more important than what he could possibly accomplish as a staff officer.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Borodino]] he is hit by an exploding [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] and seriously wounded in the stomach.  While in agony, he sees Anatole, whose leg is amputated due to war wounds, and realizes that he has the capability to forgive both Anatole and Natasha, and that he still loves her.  He is driven back to [[Moscow]], where Sonya (Natasha's cousin) notices him when the Rostovs are helping transport wounded soldiers. Eventually, Natasha discovers him, and they are reunited. She tries to nurse him back to his health. Although Prince Andrei's wounds begin to heal and health slowly returns, he eventually loses the will to live and dies in Natasha's care.\n\n==Character development==\nPrince Andrei is one of the most elaborated personages in the novel, together with Count [[Pierre Bezukhov]], to whom he serves as a philosophical opposite. He is introduced as a slightly cynical character, disillusioned in his marriage by what he sees as the simple-mindedness of his wife. He's depicted as an atheist, sceptical of his sister Marya's strong religious beliefs.\n\nAndrei enlists in the army and desperately tries to reach a high rank because he believes history is made at the top of command. He often dreams of being in command of the army and wishes he could make his imaginative plans become a reality. Andrei is shown to have great respect for Napoleon, as his view on historic events being the will of a few important people is embodied best by Napoleon. While lying wounded on the Austerlitz battlefield, Andrei meets Napoleon and realizes the nature of his hero, who is excited by the carnage on the battlefield. He loses his belief in the importance of single personages compared to the whole world.\n\nAfter his return home and the death of his wife, Andrei becomes more cynical, losing his interest in war and politics. The Battle of Austerlitz made him see the chaos in war, and the inability of even the great figures of history to change the course of events. Focusing completely on the education of his son, he only enters public service under his father because the latter wished so. A visit by Pierre Bezukhov, who recently joined the [[Freemasons]] and attempts to explain his philosophies to the pessimistic and disillusioned Andrei, makes Andrei realise that his life is not over yet. Although Pierre's philosophies fail to convince him, he finds joy in his life again.\n\nAndrei regains the will to live and becomes more optimistic. During this period he is also shown to be fairly humanist, he frees his serfs and tries to improve their living conditions under influence of the thoughts Pierre expressed to him. Reflecting on his experiences at Austerlitz, he now becomes convinced that in order to prevent the chaos on the battlefield he experienced, the military code needs to be changed.\n\nAfter meeting Natasha Rostova, he becomes enchanted with her liveliness, which contrasts with his life after the death of his wife. He proposes to her but his father disapproves, and suggests that Andre should wait a year and receive treatment abroad for his wound. While Andre is away, Natasha disgraces herself by attempting to elope with Anatole Kuragin. Andre is too proud to  forgive her.\n\nWhen back in the army, Andrei realises that his previous visions on historic events were false, that the course of historic events is not decided by the actions of a few, as he thought before Austerlitz, nor by the laws (he tried to change) by which they operate, but by the decisions and actions of every single individual. He adopts the same [[Determinism|deterministic]] view of history that Tolstoy himself expresses in the narrative chapters. For this reason he declines to join Kutuzov's staff to remain in command of his regiment, where he feels his actions are just as important, if not more important, than trying to change the course of events from a distance.\n\nIn the hospital at the Borodino, Andrei meets Kuragin, on whom he wanted to take revenge.  However, seeing the horribly wounded Kuragin's suffering makes him realise the meaning of forgiveness and absolute love.

He is the son of famed Russian general Nikolai Bolkonsky, who raises Andrei and his sister [[Maria Bolkonskaya]] on a remote estate. Andrei is best friends with [[Pierre Bezukhov]]. \n==Possible prototype==\nHe is based on Tolstoy's cousin Prince [[Sergey Volkonsky]], who was a hero of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and later a [[Decembrist revolt|Decembrist]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The real-life aristocrats Tolstoy's characters were based on were even more debauched - and heroic|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3411689/The-real-life-aristocrats-inspired-characters-Tolstoy-s-epic-War-Peace.html|publisher=Daily Mail|date=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Laura Jepsen explains that unlike \"many of the other characters for whom the author found living prototypes, Prince Andrei is entirely fictitious\".<ref>Laura Jepsen, \"Prince Andrey as Epic Hero in Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'',\" ''South Atlantic Bulletin'' 34.4 (Nov., 1969): [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3196957?&Search=yes&term=%22Andrey+Bolkonsky%22&list=hide&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3D%2522Andrey%2BBolkonsky%2522%26wc%3Don&item=2&ttl=12&returnArticleService=showArticle 5].</ref>\n\n==Life and death==\nAt the beginning of the novel, the handsome and intellectual Andrei, disillusioned with married life and finding his wife preoccupied with trivialities, becomes an officer in the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] against his idol, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon Bonaparte]]. When he goes to war, he leaves his pregnant wife, Lise, at Bald Hills in the countryside with his father and sister.\n\nAndrei is wounded at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]]. He has an epiphany while lying on the battlefield gazing up at the vastness of the blue sky, realising that he has the potential to be happy. Shortly afterwards, Andrei is rescued from the battlefield by [[Napoleon]], who takes a liking to him. However, Prince Andrei is not listed among the dead or the officers taken prisoner, leading his father and sister to assume the worst. Neither inform Lise that he is unaccounted-for, fearing to cause her any anxiety in the final stages of her pregnancy. Andrei arrives, fully recovered, while his wife is in labour and sees her briefly before she dies in childbirth. The child, a boy, survives. Andrei, who, despite everything, had cared deeply for his wife (as he confides later to Pierre), is guilt-stricken and depressed. Completely disillusioned with his former wartime ambitions, Andrei spends the following few years at home, raising his son and serving under his father.\n\nIn 1809, Andrei is recalled to [[St Petersburg|Petersburg]], where he is formally introduced to Countess [[Natasha Rostova]] for the first time. Andrei wishes to marry Natasha, but his father expresses concern: he does not wish to see his son rush into a marriage with a woman half his age, and socially below him. Old Prince Bolkonsky demands that they wait a year before marrying. Andrei proposes marriage to Natasha, who happily accepts, though she is upset by the one-year wait. In the meantime Andrei decides to tour Europe.\n\nIn Andrei's absence however, Natasha develops an infatuation with the libertine Prince Anatole Kuragin. She breaks off the engagement with Andrei and plans to elope with Kuragin. Natasha is stopped by her cousin Sonya and Marya Dmitrievna, who suspect Anatole's intentions. They later find out from Pierre Bezukhov that Anatole is already secretly married to a Polish woman.\n\nAndrei wants to take revenge on Kuragin, who flees after Pierre warns him. Not having found Kuragin and in the light of Napoleon's [[1812 invasion of Russia|1812 invasion]], he decides to join the army again. When [[Kutuzov]] is appointed commander-in-chief, he offers Andrei a position in his personal staff. Andrei declines as he is a well-liked regimental commander, considering his role there to be more important than what he could possibly accomplish as a staff officer.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Borodino]] he is hit by an exploding [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] and seriously wounded in the stomach.  While in agony, he sees Anatole, whose leg is amputated due to war wounds, and realizes that he has the capability to forgive both Anatole and Natasha, and that he still loves her.  He is driven back to [[Moscow]], where Sonya (Natasha's cousin) notices him when the Rostovs are helping transport wounded soldiers. Eventually, Natasha discovers, and they are reunited. She tries to nurse him back to his health. Although Prince Andrei's wounds begin to heal and health slowly returns, he eventually loses the will to live and dies in Natasha's care.\n\n==Character development==\nPrince Andrei is one of the most elaborated personages in the novel, together with Count [[Pierre Bezukhov]], to whom he serves as a philosophical opposite. He is introduced as a slightly cynical character, disillusioned in his marriage by what he sees as the simple-mindedness of his wife. He's depicted as an atheist, sceptical of his sister Marya's strong religious beliefs.\n\nAndrei enlists in the army and desperately tries to reach a high rank because he believes history is made at the top of command. He often dreams of being in command of the army and wishes he could make his imaginative plans become a reality. Andrei is shown to have great respect for Napoleon, as his view on historic events being the will of a few important people is embodied best by Napoleon. While lying wounded on the Austerlitz battlefield, Andrei meets Napoleon and realizes the nature of his hero, who is excited by the carnage on the battlefield. He loses his belief in the importance of single personages compared to the whole world.\n\nAfter his return home and the death of his wife, Andrei becomes more cynical, losing his interest in war and politics. The Battle of Austerlitz made him see the chaos in war, and the inability of even the great figures of history to change the course of events. Focusing completely on the education of his son, he only enters public service under his father because the latter wished so. A visit by Pierre Bezukhov, who recently joined the [[Freemasons]] and attempts to explain his philosophies to the pessimistic and disillusioned Andrei, makes Andrei realise that his life is not over yet. Although Pierre's philosophies fail to convince him, he finds joy in his life again.\n\nAndrei regains the will to live and becomes more optimistic. During this period he is also shown to be fairly humanist, he frees his serfs and tries to improve their living conditions under influence of the thoughts Pierre expressed to him. Reflecting on his experiences at Austerlitz, he now becomes convinced that in order to prevent the chaos on the battlefield he experienced, the military code needs to be changed.\n\nAfter meeting Natasha Rostova, he becomes enchanted with her liveliness, which contrasts with his life after the death of his wife. He proposes to her but his father disapproves, and suggests that Andre should wait a year and receive treatment abroad for his wound. While Andre is away, Natasha disgraces herself by attempting to elope with Anatole Kuragin. Andre is too proud to  forgive her.\n\nWhen back in the army, Andrei realises that his previous visions on historic events were false, that the course of historic events is not decided by the actions of a few, as he thought before Austerlitz, nor by the laws (he tried to change) by which they operate, but by the decisions and actions of every single individual. He adopts the same [[Determinism|deterministic]] view of history that Tolstoy himself expresses in the narrative chapters. For this reason he declines to join Kutuzov's staff to remain in command of his regiment, where he feels his actions are just as important, if not more important, than trying to change the course of events from a distance.\n\nIn the hospital at the Borodino, Andrei meets Kuragin, on whom he wanted to take revenge.  However, seeing the horribly wounded Kuragin's suffering makes him realise the meaning of forgiveness and absolute love. Recovering from his wound, he starts believing that the love he felt for his former enemy Kuragin, is the same love expressed in the [[Gospels]]. Following this change, he starts to recover and meets Natasha again, whom he forgives stating he loves her now more than ever. After having a dream that parallels dying with awakening in a new reality, he loses his will to live and dies.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*\"[https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0045160/ Andrei Bolkonsky (Character) from ''Voyna i mir'' (1967)],\" ''The Internet Movie Database''\n\n{{War and Peace}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bolkonsky, Andrei}}\n[[Category:Fictional soldiers]]\n[[Category:Characters in War and Peace]]\n[[Category:Fictional Russian people in literature]]\n[[Category:Male characters in literature]]\n[[Category:Literary characters introduced in 1869]]\n", "name_user": "CGauthier (WMF)", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLife and death:Added missing word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Nikolayevich_Bolkonsky"}
