After Rivera's death, [[Michael Bronski]] recalled her anger when she felt that she was being marginalized within the community:\n\n<blockquote>After Gay Liberation Front folded and the more reformist Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) became New York's primary gay rights group, Sylvia Rivera worked hard within their ranks in 1971 to promote a citywide gay rights, anti-discrimination ordinance. But for all of her work, when it came time to make deals, GAA dropped the portions in the civil rights bill that dealt with transvestitism and drag \u2014 it just wasn't possible to pass it with such \"extreme\" elements included. As it turned out, it wasn't possible to pass the bill anyway until 1986. But not only was the language of the bill changed, GAA \u2014 which was becoming increasingly more conservative, several of its founders and officers had plans to run for public office \u2014 even changed its political agenda to exclude issues of transvestitism and drag. It was also not unusual for Sylvia to be urged to \"front\" possibly dangerous demonstrations, but when the press showed up, she would be pushed aside by the more middle-class, \"straight-appearing\" leadership.

University of Massachusetts Press 978-1558496217</ref> Rivera's conflicts with these newer LGBT groups were emblematic of the mainstream LGBT movement's strained relationship to the radical politics of many earlier gay liberation activists. After Rivera's death, [[Michael Bronski]] recalled her anger when she felt that she was being marginalized within the community:\n\n<blockquote>After Gay Liberation Front folded and the more reformist Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) became New York's primary gay rights group, Sylvia Rivera worked hard within their ranks in 1971 to promote a citywide gay rights, anti-discrimination ordinance. But for all of her work, when it came time to make deals, GAA dropped the portions in the civil rights bill that dealt with transvestitism and drag \u2014 it just wasn't possible to pass it with such \"extreme\" elements included. As it turned out, it wasn't possible to pass the bill anyway until 1986. But not only was the language of the bill changed, GAA \u2014 which was becoming increasingly more conservative, several of its founders and officers had plans to run for public office \u2014 even changed its political agenda to exclude issues of transvestitism and drag. It was also not unusual for Sylvia to be urged to \"front\" possibly dangerous demonstrations, but when the press showed up, she would be pushed aside by the more middle-class, \"straight-appearing\" leadership. In 1995, Rivera was still hurt: \"When things started getting more mainstream, it was like, 'We don't need you no more'\". But, she added, \"Hell hath no fury like a drag queen scorned\".<ref name=Bronski>Bronski, Michael (April 2002).

{"title_page": "Socialism in New Zealand", "text_new": "{{Socialism sidebar |History by country}} \n{{Politics of New Zealand|expanded=Ideology}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2019}}\nThe extent to which [[socialism]] plays a part in modern [[Politics of New Zealand|New Zealand politics]] depends on which definitions of socialist are used, but few mainstream politicians would describe themselves using the word \"socialist\". The term \"[[social democracy|social-democrat]]\" is more common, but the more general \"[[left-wing politics|left-wing]]\" or \"[[centre-left politics|centre-left]]\" are used far more frequently. New Zealand has a complicated assortment of socialist causes and organisations. Some of these play a considerable role in public [[activism]]\u2014some commentators claim that New Zealand socialists are more prominent in causes such as the [[anti-war movement]] than in promoting socialism itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Other groups are strongly committed to radical socialist revolution.\n\nSeveral prominent [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties in New Zealand]], such as the [[New Zealand Labour Party]], have historical links to socialism but are not generally considered socialist today due to their acceptance of a [[market economy]]. More likely to receive this label are the small [[Marxism|Marxist]] organisations that exist outside the mainstream political world, such as [[Organise Aotearoa]], the [[International Socialist Organisation (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organisation]] and [[Socialist Aotearoa]].{{sfn|Wayne and Hope|2015|pp=548-551}}\n\n==History of New Zealand socialism==\nAcademic [[Josephine F. Milburn]] argues that socialist theories were introduced by immigrant workers with experience in the British labour movement. Their ideas were not widely accepted, however. The Liberal government that was dominant 1891-1912 rejected socialism but it supported unions and the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand]] set up the country's welfare state in the 1890s and fought the large land holders. She argues that governmental activism cannot be attributed to the influence of the small socialist movement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Milburn |first1=Josephine |title=Socialism and Social Reform in Nineteenth-Century New Zealand |journal=Political Science |date=1960 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=62\u201370}}</ref>\n\n===Non-ideological socialism===\n{{Weasel|date=March 2009}}\nThe growth of socialism as an ideology in New Zealand only began to occur around the beginning of the 20th century. Some historians, however, claim that a sort of \"non-ideological\" socialism was born shortly after the establishment of self-government, and flourished in the late 19th century. This, they say, was mostly in the form of a \"[[paternalism|paternalistic]]\" government which believed in the need to speed the country's economic growth, rather than in the form of an ideologically leftist government. These historians argue that because of New Zealand's small size and its focus on agriculture, the newly established government was forced to assume responsibility for many things that would otherwise be undertaken by private enterprise - railways, banking, insurance, and many other things that New Zealand's small business sector could not yet afford. Premier [[Julius Vogel]] was a notable advocate of government projects of this nature. Later, the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] was accused by its opponents of being \"socialist\", although most within the party rejected this. One commentator has claimed that until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], New Zealand was the most socialist country in the world, although many believe that this is overstating the case.\n\n===Unions and workers' parties===\n[[File:Harry Holland (1925).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Harry Holland]], a socialist who was a founder and leader of the modern [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]]]\nIdeological socialism, when it arrived, mostly stemmed from Britain or other British colonies. Much of socialism's early growth was found in the labour movement, and often coincided with the growth of [[labor union|trade unions]]. During the 1870s, James McPherson and his Canterbury Working Men's Mutual Protection Society had written to [[Karl Marx]], requesting affiliation with the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}} The [[New Zealand Federation of Labor]] (also known as the \"Red Federation\") was influenced by socialist theories, as were many other labour organizations. The Red Federation was formed in 1909 when a federation of the mining unions invited other unions to join a New Zealand Federation of Labour. The Red Federation's official organ was the ''[[Maoriland Worker]]'', which advocated militant unionism and socialism. Key Red Federation leaders included the [[Australia]]n&ndash;born Hickey and [[Paddy Webb]], and fellow Australian [[Bob Semple]]. In opposition to the Red Federation, mainstream trade and labour councils formed a rival [[New Zealand Federation of Labour (1909)|Federation of Labour]].{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=55-56}}\n\nThe arrival of 200 British socialists called the \"Clarion Settlers\" led to the formation of the [[New Zealand Socialist Party]] in 1901, which promoted the works of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}} Strongly influenced by the British [[Independent Labour Party]], the Socialist Party advocated promoting socialism through education and agitation rather than elections. The group met with little tangible success, but it nevertheless had considerable impact on the development of New Zealand socialism, forging close ties with the \"Red Federation.\"{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=48-49, 55-56}} In particular, [[Edward Hunter (Billy Banjo)|Edward Hunter]] (sometimes known under the pen name \"[[Billy Banjo]]\", and a member of both the Socialist Party and the Red Federation), was a major figure in the spread of socialist ideas to the unions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richadrson |first1=Lee |title=Hunter, Edward |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3h45/hunter-edward |website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=16 September 2019 |date=1996}}</ref>{{sfn|Len Richardson|2002|pp=73-86}}\n\nIn the years leading up to the [[First World War]], several New Zealand and Australian socialists including [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Peter Fraser]], [[Harry Scott Bennett]], [[Tom Barker (trade unionist)|Tom Barker]], [[Tom Bloodworth]], and [[Bob Semple]] advocated the creation of a \"Cooperative Commonwealth\" in which all land and means of wealth production, distribution, and management would be owned and managed collectively by the people. Besides Marx and Engels, these antipodean socialists were influenced by various radical European and American writers including [[Henry George]], [[Edward Bellamy]], [[Georges Sorel]], [[August Bebel]], [[Eugene Debs]], [[Bill Haywood]], and [[Irving Fisher]]. In 1912, a Petone Marxian Club was formed and met every Monday. This was one of the forerunners to the [[New Zealand Marxian Association]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}}\n\nThe growth of unionism eventually led to the establishment of a number of socialist-influenced parties. Originally, the working class vote was concentrated mainly with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], where a number of prominent left-wing politicians (such as [[Frederick Pirani]]) emerged.

This conference aimed to merge the various left-wing parties in New Zealand, including both the moderate Labour Party and the hardline Socialist Party. The Socialist Party, however, refused to attend the conference, and the new [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] consisted only of the Labour Party and a number of independent campaigners.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=62-64}}\n\nPremier [[William Massey]]'s \"heavy-handed\" suppression of the [[Waihi miners' strike]] prompted another attempt at unity in 1913. This time, the Socialists were willing to attend. A new group, the [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]], was formed, merging the United Labour Party and the Socialist Party. A faction of the United Labour Party refused to accept the decision, however, and continued on under the same name. Later, a decision by the Social Democrats to support a strike of dockworkers and coal miners resulted in a number of Social Democratic leaders being arrested, leaving the party in disarray in the [[1914 New Zealand general election|1914 election]], the remnants of the United Labour Party actually won more seats than the \"united\" Social Democrats.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=61-68}}\n\nFinally, in 1916, it was agreed that the Social Democrats and the United Labour Party remnants would all be amalgamated into a single group, the [[New Zealand Labour Party]].

Only two years after Labour's foundation, the [[New Zealand Marxian Association]] was established. The Marxian Association was inspired by the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (SPGB) and focused on political action. It would later clash acrimoniously with Holland. The Marxian Association itself would fall prey to internal division in 1921. That year, a number of members who supported the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] departed to form the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] (CPNZ). They were joined by two other revolutionary strands within the New Zealand Socialist Party: the [[De Leonism|De Lonites]] who espoused revolutionary politics and industrial unionism; and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW)-[[syndicalism|syndicalist]] tradition who advocated direct action and spurned political activity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Kerry |title='Our Motto, No Compromise': The Ideological Origins and Foundation of the Communist Party of New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of History |date=1994 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=160\u2013177 |url=http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=712&action=null |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Bennett|2004|pp=74-75}}\n\nIn 1930, however, former members of the Marxian Association (backed by members of the [[Socialist Party of Australia (WSM)]]) established the [[Socialist Party of New Zealand]] (distinct from the earlier [[New Zealand Socialist Party]]). This group denied that the Labour Party (or even any of the parties before it, except for the Marxian Association) represented genuine socialism. The new Socialist Party still exists today, although has slightly modified its name (becoming the [[World Socialist Party of New Zealand]]).<ref name=\"Standard2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2004/no-1203-november-2004/marxian-socialism-new-zealand|title=Marxian Socialism in New Zealand|author=Peter E.

The party faithfully followed the official position of the Soviet Union, modelling its aims, beliefs, manifesto and organisational structure and processes on those of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). The Soviets also sought to guide international Communist parties through the [[Communist International|Third International]] or Comintern.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=20-21}} In addition, the CPNZ also maintained close ties with the [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA) and supported [[M\u0101ori people|Maori right]]s and the [[Mau movement]] in [[Samoa|Western Samoa]].{{sfn|Bennett|2004|pp=75-77}}{{sfn|Taloy|2002|pp=103-115}}\n\nDuring the 1920s, the CPNZ and the Communist front organisation NZ-USSR Society attempted to influence the New Zealand trade union movement, workers, intellectuals and the New Zealand Labour Party to promote support for the Soviet Union and socialist policies. These attempts were largely unsuccessful and the Labour Party adopted a policy excluding all members of the CPNZ and Communist front organisations. This set the stage for enmity and rivalry between communists and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties over control of the trade unions and unemployed workers' movements during the [[Great Depression]].

Eschewing the hierarchical structures of the \"[[Old Left]]\" political parties, the New Left developed informal groups that were non-sectarian, anti-bureaucratic, and decentralised. While the \"Old Left\" viewed the working class as the agent of revolutionary change, the New Left also saw revolutionary potential in [[Third World]] peasants, students, ethnic minorities and other marginalised groups. As with their New Left counterparts in Europe and North America, the New Left in New Zealand was largely young, white, male, middle-class, student-dominated, and incorporated a wide range of beliefs including [[radical liberalism]]{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2019}}, the [[counter-culture]] movement, [[Christian pacifism]], [[anarchism]], neo-[[Leninism]], and libertarian forms of [[Marxism]]. According to Boraman, the New Zealand New Left combined both the socialist orientation of the European New Left and the liberal orientation of its American counterpart.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|pp=118-119}}\n\nNew Left groups championed several causes included opposition to [[racism]], the [[nuclear arms race]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Key New Left organisations in New Zealand were the anti-[[Apartheid]] [[Halt All Racist Tours]] (HART), the Progressive Youth Movement (PYM), Socialist Forum, and the Resistance bookshops; which were organised locally. Unlike the Australian and American New Left groups, the Socialist Forum, PYM groups, and the Resistance bookshops were not university-based organisations but largely drew their support from working-class youth. The Wellington PYM consisted of a mixture of working-class youth and university students. Like the American New Left, the various PYM groups opposed the Vietnam War, racism, and Apartheid. While the New Zealand [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ)|Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) was not a New Left organisation, several New Leftists including Graham Butterworth, Jim Delahunty, and Helmut Eionhorn of Wellington Socialist Forum also participated in the CND.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|pp=120-122}}\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the New Left reached its heyday. HART, the PYM, and Resistance bookshops were joined by other groups including the [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]] Society for the Active Prevention of Cruelty to Politically Apathetic Humans (AUSAPOCHPAH), the Auckland-based Friends of Brutus, the New Left Club at [[Massey University]], the [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] Socialist Club, the Anarchist Congress in Wellington, the Radical Student's Alliance at the [[University of Canterbury]], the [[Christchurch]]-based Anarchist Commune, the [[University of Otago]]'s Progressive Left Club, and the [[Dunedin]] Anarchist Army.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=123}} The activist, scholar, and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] Member of Parliament [[Sue Bradford]] was involved in the Auckland PYM and the Auckland Resistance bookshop.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=125}}{{sfn|Hope and Scott|205|p=552}}\n\nFollowing the election of the [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour Government]] in 1972, the new government delivered many of the New Left's demands including withdrawing New Zealand troops from Vietnam in 1972; ending [[Compulsory military training in New Zealand|compulsory military training]] that same year; and terminating sporting contact with South Africa. As a result, the New Left lost much of its prominence due to the winding down of the protest movement. While New Leftists were still active in radical politics such as the Resistance bookshops, the more liberal wing of the protest movement had largely been appeased by the Third Labour Government's policies.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=129}}\n\nDuring the early to mid 1970s, some New Left elements like the Christchurch PYM became influenced by the [[Maoism|Maoist]] Communist Party. One New Left group that emerged in 1974 was Murray Horton and [[Owen Wilkes]]' [[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]], which campaigned against foreign military bases and economic activity in New Zealand. According to Boraman, several New Leftists including former PYM members were also instrumental in founding several \"new social movements\" during the 1960s and 1970s including [[Tama Poata]]'s M\u0101ori Organisation on Human Rights (MOOHR), the [[Black Panthers]]&ndash;inspired [[Polynesian Panthers]], Therese O'Connell's Wellington Women's Liberation Front, the Auckland Women's Liberation Front, and the Auckland&ndash;based Women for Equality. Boraman has characterized opposition to [[American imperialism]] and uncritical praise for Communist states and figures like [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Che Guevara]] as two key defining features of the later New Left activists and groups.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|pp=129-131}}\n\n===Left-wing alternative media===\n[[File:Trotter, Chris (Alliance).jpg|left|175px|thumb|Chris Trotter, editor of the ''New Zealand Political Review''.]]\nDuring the early 20th century, the emergence of working-class consciousness led to the formation of several left-wing newspapers including ''The Maoriland  Worker'' (1910&ndash;1924), ''The Weekly Herald'', ''The Transport Worker'', and ''The New Zealand Watersider''. During the 1930s, they were joined by activist theatre companies, politically-engaged literary magazines, the Left Book Club, the Co-Operative Book Movement, and the Progressive Publishing Company. During the Great Depression, liberal-left perspectives penetrated mainstream New Zealand society through churches, women's groups, populist radio programmes, and the Labour Party.{{sfn|Hope and Scott|2015|p=546}}{{sfn|Boraman|2016|p=41}}\n\nThe ''Maoriland Worker'' later revamped itself as the ''New Zealand Worker'' (1924&ndash;1935) and as the Labour Party's affiliated newspaper ''The Standard'' (1935&ndash;1959). While it was sympathetic to the Labour Party, the ''Maoriland Worker'' was a largely radical socialist publication that was independent of the Labour Party.{{sfn|Boraman|2016|p=41}}  The various Communist parties also published their own newspapers. The CPNZ's official organ was the ''People's Voice'' (1939&ndash;1991), which reached a peak of 14,000 copies in 1945.

It is associated with the International Bolshevik Tendency.\n*'''[[Socialist Aotearoa]]''' - an [[Auckland]]-based group formed in May 2008 which split from [[Socialist Worker (Aotearoa)]] over disagreement with the organization's participation in the [[Residents Action Movement]] electoral coalition. The group has an eclectic mix of Trotskyists, anarchists, ecosocialists and various other ideologies in its ranks. Members are active in Unite Union, with one member, Joe Carolan, a senior organiser in that union.\n* '''[[Socialist Voice (New Zealand)|Socialist Voice]]''' - a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] group established in 2002. It is associated with the [[Committee for a Workers' International (1974)|Committee for a Workers' International]], and is therefore linked to the [[Socialist Party (England and Wales)|Socialist Party of England and Wales]].\n*'''[[Socialist Party of Aotearoa]]''' - a Marxist-Leninist group.

It should not be confused with the Socialist Party of New Zealand, a completely separate organization which is now known as the [[World Socialist Party of New Zealand]].\n* '''[[Communist Party of New Zealand]]''' (1921-1994) - an old communist group that initially gained a modest measure of success, but which later declined. The party became attached to [[Stalinism]], and when the [[Sino-Soviet split]] occurred, the party adopted [[Maoism]]. Later, after [[Mao Zedong|Mao]]'s death, it followed [[Enver Hoxha]], leader of [[Albania]] (which they considered to be the last bastion of true communism). After the fall of Albania, the party renounced all these ideologies and adopted [[Trotskyism]]. The party then attempted a merger with the [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]], creating the [[Socialist Workers Organization (New Zealand)|Socialist Workers Organization]]. Most of the International Socialists eventually withdrew from this coalition, leaving the new Socialist Workers Organization dominated by the former Communist Party.\n* '''[[World Socialist Party of New Zealand]]''' (1930-??) - a group based primarily around opposition to [[Leninism]]. It was originally established in 1930 simply as the \"Socialist Party of New Zealand\", but later added \"world\" to its name. It is affiliated with the [[World Socialist Movement]].\n*'''[[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]]''' (1966-1990) - a pro-Soviet party established by expelled members of the Communist Party.

Formerly known as the Socialist Workers Organisation, the final conference of SW voted to dissolve itself at its conference in January 2012.\n* '''[[Workers Party of New Zealand]]''' (2002-2013) - The party was founded in 2002. It was originally formed by an electoral alliance of the original Workers' Party (pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist) and the pro-Trotsky Revolution group. it is the first, and so far only, registered [[hard left]] political party under [[Mixed-member proportional representation|mixed-member proportional]] (MMP) representation.\n* Black Cat '''[[Anarchism in New Zealand#cite note-2|BlackCat Anarchist Collective]]''' - an [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] group based in the city of [[Auckland]].\n* '''[[Communist Party of Aotearoa]]''' - a [[Maoism|Maoist]] group that split from the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] in 1993, condemning that organization's abandonment of Maoism and adoption of [[Trotskyism]].\n* '''Revolutionary Communist League of New Zealand''' founded in 1984 by students and lecturers at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. It was a revolutionary Marxist group affiliated with the [[United Secretariat of the Fourth International]]. After a few conferences, intending to rally opposition to [[Rogernomics]], RCLNZ organized a larger nationwide grouping called '''Socialist Alliance''' which stood a candidate in the 1987 general election. The RCLNZ was transformed into the '''Socialist Workers' Project''' in 1990, based in the ChCh Centre for Socialist Education.\n*'''[[New Zealand Marxian Association]]''' - a group established in 1918.

It was established by the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] and the [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]], although the majority of the latter group eventually withdrew from the merger. It was linked to the [[International Socialist Tendency]]. It evolved into the present day [[Socialist Worker (Aotearoa)]] group.\n*'''[[Workers' Party of New Zealand (pro-Mao, Marxist-Leninist)]]''' - A pro-[[Mao Zedong|Mao]], [[Marxist-Leninist]] party founded by Ray Nunes, formerly a prominent member of the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]].

The term \"[[social democracy|social-democrat]]\" is more common, but the more general \"[[left-wing politics|left-wing]]\" or \"[[centre-left politics|centre-left]]\" are used far more frequently. New Zealand has a complicated assortment of socialist causes and organisations. Some of these play a considerable role in public [[activism]]\u2014some commentators claim that New Zealand socialists are more prominent in causes such as the [[anti-war movement]] than in promoting socialism itself.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Other groups are strongly committed to radical socialist revolution.\n\nSeveral prominent [[List of political parties in New Zealand|political parties in New Zealand]], such as the [[New Zealand Labour Party]], have historical links to socialism but are not generally considered socialist today due to their acceptance of a [[market economy]].

Milburn]] argues that socialist theories were introduced by immigrant workers with experience in the British labour movement. Their ideas were not widely accepted, however. The Liberal government that was dominant 1891-1912 rejected socialism but it supported unions and the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand]] set up the country's welfare state in the 1890s and fought the large land holders. She argues that governmental activism cannot be attributed to the influence of the small socialist movement.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Milburn |first1=Josephine |title=Socialism and Social Reform in Nineteenth-Century New Zealand |journal=Political Science |date=1960 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=62\u201370}}</ref>\n\n===Non-ideological socialism===\n{{Weasel|date=March 2009}}\nThe growth of socialism as an ideology in New Zealand only began to occur around the beginning of the 20th century. Some historians, however, claim that a sort of \"non-ideological\" socialism was born shortly after the establishment of self-government, and flourished in the late 19th century. This, they say, was mostly in the form of a \"[[paternalism|paternalistic]]\" government which believed in the need to speed the country's economic growth, rather than in the form of an ideologically leftist government. These historians argue that because of New Zealand's small size and its focus on agriculture, the newly established government was forced to assume responsibility for many things that would otherwise be undertaken by private enterprise - railways, banking, insurance, and many other things that New Zealand's small business sector could not yet afford. Premier [[Julius Vogel]] was a notable advocate of government projects of this nature. Later, the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] was accused by its opponents of being \"socialist\", although most within the party rejected this. One commentator has claimed that until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], New Zealand was the most socialist country in the world, although many believe that this is overstating the case.\n\n===Unions and workers' parties===\n[[File:Harry Holland (1925).jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Harry Holland]], a socialist who was a founder and leader of the modern [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]]]\nIdeological socialism, when it arrived, mostly stemmed from Britain or other British colonies. Much of socialism's early growth was found in the labour movement, and often coincided with the growth of [[labor union|trade unions]]. During the 1870s, James McPherson and his Canterbury Working Men's Mutual Protection Society had written to [[Karl Marx]], requesting affiliation with the [[International Workingmen's Association|First International]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}} The [[New Zealand Federation of Labor]] (also known as the \"Red Federation\") was influenced by socialist theories, as were many other labour organizations. The Red Federation was formed in 1909 when a federation of the mining unions invited other unions to join a New Zealand Federation of Labour. The Red Federation's official organ was the ''[[Maoriland Worker]]'', which advocated militant unionism and socialism. Key Red Federation leaders included the [[Australia]]n&ndash;born Hickey and [[Paddy Webb]], and fellow Australian [[Bob Semple]]. In opposition to the Red Federation, mainstream trade and labour councils formed a rival [[New Zealand Federation of Labour (1909)|Federation of Labour]].{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=55-56}}\n\nThe arrival of 200 British socialists called the \"Clarion Settlers\" led to the formation of the [[New Zealand Socialist Party]] in 1901, which promoted the works of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}} Strongly influenced by the British [[Independent Labour Party]], the Socialist Party advocated promoting socialism through education and agitation rather than elections. The group met with little tangible success, but it nevertheless had considerable impact on the development of New Zealand socialism, forging close ties with the \"Red Federation.\"{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=48-49, 55-56}} In particular, [[Edward Hunter (Billy Banjo)|Edward Hunter]] (sometimes known under the pen name \"[[Billy Banjo]]\", and a member of both the Socialist Party and the Red Federation), was a major figure in the spread of socialist ideas to the unions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richadrson |first1=Lee |title=Hunter, Edward |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3h45/hunter-edward |website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=16 September 2019 |date=1996}}</ref>{{sfn|Len Richardson|2002|pp=73-86}}\n\nIn the years leading up to the [[First World War]], several New Zealand and Australian socialists including [[Harry Holland]], [[Michael Joseph Savage]], [[Peter Fraser]], [[Harry Scott Bennett]], [[Tom Barker (trade unionist)|Tom Barker]], [[Tom Bloodworth]], and [[Bob Semple]] advocated the creation of a \"Cooperative Commonwealth\" in which all land and means of wealth production, distribution, and management would be owned and managed collectively by the people. Besides Marx and Engels, these antipodean socialists were influenced by various radical European and American writers including [[Henry George]], [[Edward Bellamy]], [[Georges Sorel]], [[August Bebel]], [[Eugene Debs]], [[Bill Haywood]], and [[Irving Fisher]]. In 1912, a Petone Marxian Club was formed and met every Monday. This was one of the forerunners to the [[New Zealand Marxian Association]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}}\n\nThe growth of unionism eventually led to the establishment of a number of socialist-influenced parties. Originally, the working class vote was concentrated mainly with the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], where a number of prominent left-wing politicians (such as [[Frederick Pirani]]) emerged. Later, however, there were increasing calls for an independent workers' party, particularly as the Liberals began to lose their reformist drive.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=47-49}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Steven |first1=Oliver |title=Pirani, Frederick |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2p19/pirani-frederick |website=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |accessdate=16 September 2019 |date=January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe second organised party to gain a seat in Parliament (after the Liberal Party) was the small [[Independent Political Labour League]], which won an urban electorate in [[Wellington]] in the [[1908 New Zealand general election|1908 election]]. Later, in 1910, the IPLL was reformed as the [[New Zealand Labour Party (original)|Labour Party]] (not to be confused with the modern party).{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=51-57}}\n\n===Emergence of the Labour Party===\n[[File:Michael Joseph Savage Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Michael Joseph Savage]] was the first Labour [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]].]]\n{{Formation of New Zealand Labour Party}}\nThe growing drive for unity among left-wing groups resulted in a \"Unity Conference\" being called in 1912. This conference aimed to merge the various left-wing parties in New Zealand, including both the moderate Labour Party and the hardline Socialist Party. The Socialist Party, however, refused to attend the conference, and the new [[United Labour Party (New Zealand)|United Labour Party]] consisted only of the Labour Party and a number of independent campaigners.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=62-64}}\n\nPremier [[William Massey]]'s \"heavy-handed\" suppression of the [[Waihi miners' strike]] prompted another attempt at unity in 1913. This time, the Socialists were willing to attend. A new group, the [[Social Democratic Party (New Zealand)|Social Democratic Party]], was formed, merging the United Labour Party and the Socialist Party. A faction of the United Labour Party refused to accept the decision, however, and continued on under the same name. Later, a decision by the Social Democrats to support a strike of dockworkers and coal miners resulted in a number of Social Democratic leaders being arrested, leaving the party in disarray in the [[1914 New Zealand general election|1914 election]], the remnants of the United Labour Party actually won more seats than the \"united\" Social Democrats.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=61-68}}\n\nFinally, in 1916, it was agreed that the Social Democrats and the United Labour Party remnants would all be amalgamated into a single group, the [[New Zealand Labour Party]]. The new Labour Party was explicitly socialist, and was based around goals of redistribution of wealth, nationalization of industry, and elimination of conscription.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=69-71}}<ref name=\"Te Ara Origins\">{{cite web |last1=Aimer |first1=Peter |title=Page 1.

While the Labour Party gained some electoral success, it continued to trail the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] and the [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]] until the replacement of Holland with [[Michael Joseph Savage]]. Savage, although also involved in the earlier Socialist Party, was more moderate than Holland, and Labour gained considerable support.

The [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] led by Savage and Peter Fraser implemented a range of socialist policies such as nationalising industry, broadcasting, transportation, and a [[Keynesianism|Keynesian]] welfare state. However, the party did not seek to abolish capitalism, instead opting for a [[mixed economy]]. Labour's welfare state and mixed economy were not challenged until the 1980s.{{sfn|Franks and McAloon|2016|pp=87-105}}<ref>{{cite web |last1=Aimer |first1=Peter |title=Page 2.

This is sometimes seen as the end of any real claim to full socialism by the Labour Party. However, the shift away from socialism had not come about without dispute. Labour Party politician [[John A. Lee]] was harshly critical of the changes, and had eventually left to establish the [[Democratic Labour Party (New Zealand)|Democratic Labour Party]] in 1940. The party was considerably more socialist than Labour, but performed poorly.

Only two years after Labour's foundation, the [[New Zealand Marxian Association]] was established. The Marxian Association was inspired by the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] (SPGB) and focused on political action. It would later clash acrimoniously with Holland. The Marxian Association itself would fall prey to internal division in 1921. That year, a number of members who supported the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] departed to form the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] (CPNZ). They were joined by two other revolutionary strands within the New Zealand Socialist Party: the [[De Leonism|De Lonites]] who espoused revolutionary politics and industrial unionism; and the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW)-[[syndicalism|syndicalist]] tradition who advocated direct action and spurned political activity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Kerry |title='Our Motto, No Compromise': The Ideological Origins and Foundation of the Communist Party of New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of History |date=1994 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=160\u2013177 |url=http://www.nzjh.auckland.ac.nz/document.php?wid=712&action=null |accessdate=17 September 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Bennett|2004|pp=74-75}}\n\nIn 1930, however, former members of the Marxian Association (backed by members of the [[Socialist Party of Australia (WSM)]]) established the [[Socialist Party of New Zealand]] (distinct from the earlier [[New Zealand Socialist Party]]). This group denied that the Labour Party (or even any of the parties before it, except for the Marxian Association) represented genuine socialism. The new Socialist Party still exists today, although has slightly modified its name (becoming the [[World Socialist Party of New Zealand]]).<ref name=\"Standard2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/2000s/2004/no-1203-november-2004/marxian-socialism-new-zealand|title=Marxian Socialism in New Zealand|author=Peter E.

The party faithfully followed the official position of the Soviet Union, modelling its aims, beliefs, manifesto and organisational structure and processes on those of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU). The Soviets also sought to guide international Communist parties through the [[Communist International|Third International]] or Comintern.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=20-21}} In addition, the CPNZ also maintained close ties with the [[Communist Party of Australia]] (CPA) and supported [[M\u0101ori people|Maori right]]s and the [[Mau movement]] in [[Samoa|Western Samoa]].{{sfn|Bennett|2004|pp=75-77}}{{sfn|Taloy|2002|pp=103-115}}\n\nDuring the 1920s, the CPNZ and the Communist front organisation NZ-USSR Society attempted to influence the New Zealand trade union movement, workers, intellectuals and the New Zealand Labour Party to promote support for the Soviet Union and socialist policies. These attempts were largely unsuccessful and the Labour Party adopted a policy excluding all members of the CPNZ and Communist front organisations. This set the stage for enmity and rivalry between communists and [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties over control of the trade unions and unemployed workers' movements during the [[Great Depression]]. Both communists and social democrats however did work together during the 1930s to combat [[fascism]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=20-21}}\n\n===Communist offshoots===\n[[File:Vic Wilcox.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Vic Wilcox]], pro-[[Maoism|Maoist]] leader of the Communist Party.]]\n[[File:Ken Douglas (cropped).jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Ken Douglas]], leader of the rival Socialist Unity Party.]]\nWhen the [[Sino-Soviet split]] occurred in the 1960s, the CPNZ was sharply divided between supporters of the Soviet Union (led by the \"revisionist\" [[Nikita Khrushchev]]) and supporters of China (led by the radical [[Mao Zedong]]). Eventually, the [[Maoists]]  led by [[Vic Wilcox]] triumphed, and supporters of Khrushchev were expelled. Under Wilcox's leadership, the CPNZ was the only Western Communist party to side with China against the Soviets. The CPNZ's official mouthpiece was the ''People's Voice''.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}\n\nThe expelled members led by [[Ken Douglas]] and [[Bill Andersen|George Harold (Bill) Andersen]] eventually established the [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP).

In return, Moscow funded frequent trips by SUP members to Russia, and Soviet ideologues and advisers regularly visited their SUP counterparts in New Zealand. The SUP's newspaper was called ''NZ Tribune''.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}} The Socialist Unity party eventually suffered its own split, with some members departing to found the modern [[Socialist Party of Aotearoa]].<ref>Pacey, quoted in Locke, C.

Instead, they followed [[Albania]], which was led by [[Enver Hoxha]]'s [[Party of Labour of Albania]]. The leadership of the party believed that Hoxha was the only communist leader to keep \"real\" communism, but the group's determination to follow the narrowest path available alienated many of its supporters. The party gradually declined. Those CPNZ members who remained loyal to Beijing formed the [[Workers' Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers' Communist League]], whose newspaper was called ''Unity''.{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}\n\nDuring the [[Cold War]], the CPNZ, SUP, Workers Commnist League and the Socialist Action League tried to influence the Labour Party, trade unions, and a range of popular issues like the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|anti-Springbok tour protests]], the [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori biculturalism]], and the [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|anti-nuclear movement]].{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|pp=29-30}} During the [[ANZUS]] diplomatic crisis 1984-85 which resulted from NZ's nuclear ship ban, the SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand's foreign policy away from its traditional ally the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loudon |first1=Trevor |last2=Moran |first2=Bernard |date=March 22, 2007 |title=The untold story behind New Zealand's ANZUS breakdown |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046 |url-status=dead|publisher=[[National Observer (Australia)|National Observer]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204091431/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046|archivedate=2013-02-04|accessdate=26 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the collapse of Albanian communism, the CPNZ adopted the [[Trotskyism]] it had once harshly condemned, and merged with a newer group known as the [[International Socialist Organization (New Zealand)|International Socialist Organization]]. The resultant party was called the [[Socialist Workers Organization (New Zealand)|Socialist Workers Organization]].{{sfn|Boraman|2016|p=63}} Later, however, many supporters of the International Socialist Organization withdrew from the new party, reestablishing their old group. As such, some see the Socialist Workers Organization (SWO) as a continuation of the old Communist Party. The SWO, known then as Socialist Worker, voted to dissolve itself in January 2012.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nOther groups continue to promote socialism as well. In the [[2002 New Zealand general election|2002 election]], four candidates were put forward an umbrella group (known as the [[Anti-Capitalist Alliance (New Zealand)|Anti-Capitalist Alliance]]) consisting of the [[Workers Party of New Zealand]], the [[Revolution (New Zealand political party)|Revolution]] group, and other left-wing activists. The International Socialist Organization is also active at some universities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===New Left variations===\n[[File:Sue Bradford.jpg|right|thumb|Former Green Member of Parliament [[Sue Bradford]], was also involved in the Auckland PYM and the Auckland Resistance bookshop during her youth.]]\nThe [[New Left]] in New Zealand emerged during the 1950s and 1960s in response to the perceived \"authoritarian, bureaucratic, and repressive norms\" of New Zealand society and the so-called conservatism of the Communist Party, Labour, and [[New Zealand National Party|National]] parties. Eschewing the hierarchical structures of the \"[[Old Left]]\" political parties, the New Left developed informal groups that were non-sectarian, anti-bureaucratic, and decentralised. While the \"Old Left\" viewed the working class as the agent of revolutionary change, the New Left also saw revolutionary potential in [[Third World]] peasants, students, ethnic minorities and other marginalised groups. As with their New Left counterparts in Europe and North America, the New Left in New Zealand was largely young, white, male, middle-class, student-dominated, and incorporated a wide range of beliefs including [[radical liberalism]]{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2019}}, the [[counter-culture]] movement, [[Christian pacifism]], [[anarchism]], neo-[[Leninism]], and libertarian forms of [[Marxism]]. According to Boraman, the New Zealand New Left combined both the socialist orientation of the European New Left and the liberal orientation of its American counterpart.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|pp=118-119}}\n\nNew Left groups championed several causes included opposition to [[racism]], the [[nuclear arms race]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Key New Left organisations in New Zealand were the anti-[[Apartheid]] [[Halt All Racist Tours]] (HART), the Progressive Youth Movement (PYM), Socialist Forum, and the Resistance bookshops; which were organised locally. Unlike the Australian and American New Left groups, the Socialist Forum, PYM groups, and the Resistance bookshops were not university-based organisations but largely drew their support from working-class youth. The Wellington PYM consisted of a mixture of working-class youth and university students. Like the American New Left, the various PYM groups opposed the Vietnam War, racism, and Apartheid. While the New Zealand [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (NZ)|Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) was not a New Left organisation, several New Leftists including Graham Butterworth, Jim Delahunty, and Helmut Eionhorn of Wellington Socialist Forum also participated in the CND.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|pp=120-122}}\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, the New Left reached its heyday. HART, the PYM, and Resistance bookshops were joined by other groups including the [[University of Auckland|Auckland University]] Society for the Active Prevention of Cruelty to Politically Apathetic Humans (AUSAPOCHPAH), the Auckland-based Friends of Brutus, the New Left Club at [[Massey University]], the [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] Socialist Club, the Anarchist Congress in Wellington, the Radical Student's Alliance at the [[University of Canterbury]], the [[Christchurch]]-based Anarchist Commune, the [[University of Otago]]'s Progressive Left Club, and the [[Dunedin]] Anarchist Army.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=123}} The activist, scholar, and [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]] Member of Parliament [[Sue Bradford]] was involved in the Auckland PYM and the Auckland Resistance bookshop.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=125}}{{sfn|Hope and Scott|205|p=552}}\n\nFollowing the election of the [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour Government]] in 1972, the new government delivered many of the New Left's demands including withdrawing New Zealand troops from Vietnam in 1972; ending [[Compulsory military training in New Zealand|compulsory military training]] that same year; and terminating sporting contact with South Africa. As a result, the New Left lost much of its prominence due to the winding down of the protest movement. While New Leftists were still active in radical politics such as the Resistance bookshops, the more liberal wing of the protest movement had largely been appeased by the Third Labour Government's policies.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=129}}\n\nDuring the early to mid 1970s, some New Left elements like the Christchurch PYM became influenced by the [[Maoism|Maoist]] Communist Party. One New Left group that emerged in 1974 was Murray Horton and [[Owen Wilkes]]' [[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]], which campaigned against foreign military bases and economic activity in New Zealand. According to Boraman, several New Leftists including former PYM members were also instrumental in founding several \"new social movements\" during the 1960s and 1970s including [[Tama Poata]]'s M\u0101ori Organisation on Human Rights (MOOHR), the [[Black Panthers]]&ndash;inspired [[Polynesian Panthers]], Therese O'Connell's Wellington Women's Liberation Front, the Auckland Women's Liberation Front, and the Auckland&ndash;based Women for Equality. Boraman has characterized opposition to [[American imperialism]] and uncritical praise for Communist states and figures like [[Mao Zedong]], [[Ho Chi Minh]], and [[Che Guevara]] as two key defining features of the later New Left activists and groups.{{sfn|Boraman|2002|pp=129-131}}\n\n===Left-wing alternative media===\n[[File:Trotter, Chris (Alliance).jpg|left|175px|thumb|Chris Trotter, editor of the ''New Zealand Political Review''.]]\nDuring the early 20th century, the emergence of working-class consciousness led to the formation of several left-wing newspapers including ''The Maoriland  Worker'' (1910&ndash;1924), ''The Weekly Herald'', ''The Transport Worker'', and ''The New Zealand Watersider''. During the 1930s, they were joined by activist theatre companies, politically-engaged literary magazines, the Left Book Club, the Co-Operative Book Movement, and the Progressive Publishing Company. During the Great Depression, liberal-left perspectives penetrated mainstream New Zealand society through churches, women's groups, populist radio programmes, and the Labour Party.{{sfn|Hope and Scott|2015|p=546}}{{sfn|Boraman|2016|p=41}}\n\nThe ''Maoriland Worker'' later revamped itself as the ''New Zealand Worker'' (1924&ndash;1935) and as the Labour Party's affiliated newspaper ''The Standard'' (1935&ndash;1959). While it was sympathetic to the Labour Party, the ''Maoriland Worker'' was a largely radical socialist publication that was independent of the Labour Party.{{sfn|Boraman|2016|p=41}}  The various Communist parties also published their own newspapers. The CPNZ's official organ was the ''People's Voice'' (1939&ndash;1991), which reached a peak of 14,000 copies in 1945. The Socialist Unity Party's newspapers were the ''Tribune'' (1966&ndash;1995), ''Socialist Worker'' (1994&ndash;2005), ''The Spark'' (1991&ndash;2013), and ''Socialist Review'' (1997&ndash;present), and ''The Spark''{{'s}} successor ''Fightback'' (2013&ndash;present). The Socialist Action League's newspaper was ''Socialist Action'' (1969&ndash;1998), which reached a peak of 8,400 copies during the [[New Zealand general election, 1978|1978 general election]]. The Workers' Communist League's newspaper was called ''Unity'' (1978&ndash;1990).{{sfn|Gustafson|2004|p=29}}{{sfn|Boraman|2016|pp=37, 45}}\n\nSeveral notable independent socialist magazines and newspapers in New Zealand have included the ''New Zealand Monthly Review'' (''NZMR'', 1960&ndash;1996), ''The Republican'' (1974&ndash;1996), ''Race Gender Class'' (1985&ndash;1992), left-wing journalist [[Chris Trotter]]'s social democratic ''New Zealand Political Review'' (''NZPR'', 1992&ndash;2005),{{sfn|Boraman|2016|pp=64-65}} the feminist ''Broadsheet'' (1972&ndash;1997), the Peace Movement Aotearoa's ''Peacelink'', the queer feminist ''Bitches, Witches and Dykes'', the anti-apartheid ''HART News'', ''CARP Newsletter'', ''Foreign Control Watchdog'', and ''Peace Researcher''.

Notable left-wing New Zealand blogs have included the independent Marxist collective \"Redline\", \"Against the Current\", [[Martyn \"Bomber\" Bradbury]]'s current affairs&ndash;oriented ''The Daily Blog'' (2012&ndash;present), and ''The Standard''. Besides blogs, left wing alternative media have also utilised email newsletters, publishing software, and major social media platforms like [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]].{{sfn|Boraman|2016|p=67}}{{sfn|Hope and Scott|20175pp=551-553}}<ref>{{cite web |title=About |url=https://thestandard.org.nz/about/ |website=The Standard |accessdate=24 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Prominent figures in New Zealand socialism==\n*[[Martyn \"Bomber\" Bradbury]]{{sfn|Hope and Scott|20175pp=551-553}}\n*[[Sue Bradford]]{{sfn|Boraman|2002|p=125}}\n*[[Peter Fraser]]{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}}\n*[[Harry Holland]]{{sfn|Gustafson|2003|p=20}}\n*[[Edward Hunter (Billy Banjo)|Edward Hunter]] (aka \"Billy Banjo\"){{sfn|Len Richardson|2002|pp=73-86}}\n*[[John A.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1                = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]]\n| leader_name1                = [[Ilham Aliyev]]\n| leader_title2                = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]]\n| leader_name2                = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]\n| leader_title3                = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name3                = [[Ali Asadov]]\n| legislature                = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type                = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]]\n| established_event1                = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]]\n| established_date1                = 28 May 1918\n| established_event2                = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n| established_date2                = 28 April 1920\n| established_event3                = Independence from [[Soviet Union]]\n| established_date3                = {{plainlist|\n* 30 August 1991 (declared)\n* 18 October 1991 (independence)\n* 25 December 1991 (completed)}}\n| established_event4                = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]]\n| established_date4                = 21 December 1991\n| established_event5                = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]]\n| established_date5                = 2 March 1992\n| established_event6                = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}}\n| established_date6                = 12 November 1995\n| area_km2                = 86600\n| area_rank                = 112th\n| area_sq_mi                = 33436 <!-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -->\n| percent_water                = 1.6\n| population_estimate                = 10,027,874<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 -

The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the President and the National Assembly.<ref name=\"LaPorte2016\" /> The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The president nominates the judges in these courts.

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely a continuation of Executive Power. The legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan is determined by the Provision on Local Executive Authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.\n\nAlthough Azerbaijan has held several elections since regaining its independence and it has many of the formal institutions of democracy, it remains classified as \"not free\" (on border with \"partly free\") by [[Freedom House]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan \u2013 Freedom House | publisher = FreedomHouse.org | url =http://www.freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan| accessdate = 4 August 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"frh\">{{cite web| title = Combined Average Ratings: Independent Countries 2009| publisher = FreedomHouse.org| year = 2009| url = http://old.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=475&year=2009| accessdate = 10 July 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In recent years, large numbers of Azerbaijani journalists, bloggers, lawyers, and human rights activists have been rounded up and jailed for their criticism of President Aliyev and government authorities.<ref>\"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/jailed-without-trial-in-azerbaijan/2015/03/01/34a1d342-bea1-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html Jailed without trial in Azerbaijan],\" ''[[The Washington Post]]''. 1 March 2015.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>}}\n| leader_title1                = [[President of Azerbaijan|President]]\n| leader_name1                = [[Ilham Aliyev]]\n| leader_title2                = [[Vice President of Azerbaijan|Vice President]]\n| leader_name2                = [[Mehriban Aliyeva]]\n| leader_title3                = [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name3                = [[Ali Asadov]]\n| legislature                = [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]]\n| sovereignty_type                = [[History of Azerbaijan|Formation]]\n| established_event1                = [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic]]\n| established_date1                = 28 May 1918\n| established_event2                = [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]]\n| established_date2                = 28 April 1920\n| established_event3                = Independence from [[Soviet Union]]\n| established_date3                = {{plainlist|\n* 30 August 1991 (declared)\n* 18 October 1991 (independence)\n* 25 December 1991 (completed)}}\n| established_event4                = [[Alma-Ata Protocol|Full membership into the CIS]]\n| established_date4                = 21 December 1991\n| established_event5                = [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 742|Admitted to the]] [[United Nations]]\n| established_date5                = 2 March 1992\n| established_event6                = {{nowrap|[[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] adopted}}\n| established_date6                = 12 November 1995\n| area_km2                = 86600\n| area_rank                = 112th\n| area_sq_mi                = 33436 <!-- Do not remove [[WP:MOSNUM]] -->\n| percent_water                = 1.6\n| population_estimate                = 10,027,874<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2020-02-09|title=Az\u0259rbaycanda \u0259hali say\u0131 da art\u0131b, bo\u015fanmalar da\u2026 -

The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials.

In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''B\u0259l\u0259diy\u0259'') and members of municipalities are elected by a general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently, there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development, and the local environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] banned the immigration of nearly all Japanese.  The earlier [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] restricted naturalized United States citizenship to \"free white persons\", which excluded the Issei from citizenship. As a result, the Issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws.  Due to these restrictions, Japanese immigration to the United States between 1931-1950 only totaled 3,503 which is strikingly low compared to the totals of 46,250 people in 1951\u20131960, 39,988 in 1961-70, 49,775 in 1971-80, 47,085 in 1981-90, and 67,942 in 1991-2000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=2001 Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service|last=|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2003|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBecause no new immigrants were permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were\u2014by definition\u2014born in the US. This generation, the [[Nisei]], became a distinct cohort from the Issei generation in terms of age, citizenship, and English-language ability, in addition to the usual generational differences. Institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the Nisei to marry other Nisei, resulting in a third distinct generation of Japanese Americans, the [[Sansei]]. Significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries.\n\nIn recent years, immigration from Japan has been more like that from Western Europe. The numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year, and is similar to the amount of immigration to the US from Germany. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where family reunification is the primary impetus for immigration.\n\n===Internment and redress===\n{{Main|Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese American redress and court cases}}\n[[File:Los Angeles, California.

The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei'', and ''Sansei'', which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (\u56db\u4e16), and the fifth is called ''Gosei'' (\u4e94\u4e16). The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (\u65e5\u7cfb) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable \"\n!Generation!!

In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese characters are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the [[Japanese in Hawaii|local (Hawaii-born) Japanese]] population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the US, many ''nisei'' and ''sansei'' intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.{{citation needed|date=October 2013|reason=No source given for claims concerning reasons for studying Japanese}}\n\n===Education===\nJapanese American culture places great value on education and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education.

For example, one of the most popular community festivals is the annual [[Obon Festival]], which occurs in the summer, and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young. These kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of Japanese Americans, such as [[Southern California]] and [[Hawaii]]. A reasonable number of Japanese people both in and out of Japan are secular, as Shinto and Buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals, and not through faithful worship, as defines religion for many Americans.\n\nMany Japanese Americans also practice Christianity.

The Y chromosome is directly correlated to Asian populations, especially in Japanese Americans. The chromosome addition of Y Alu polymorphic element is only displayed in Japanese American men. People of Japanese descent show the highest frequency of the haplogroup O3a5. [[Haplogroup]]s are groups of genetic populations that share a common ancestor, paternally or maternally. The frequency of this haplogroup is about 5% higher than its frequency in other Asian groups such as Koreans, Manchus, and other Northeast Asians. The Japanese DNA sequence consists of 24.2% Korean, 16.1% Okinawa, 4.8% Uniquely Japanese, 25.8% Chinese, 8.1% Ainu, and 21% Unidentified. The Ainu people were the key to the Japanese genetic origins because researchers found an exact DNA match with the Ainu and the J\u014dmon Japanese to conclude the Ainu rooted all the way back to the J\u014dmon.<ref>{{Citation|last=sdfsdflgggdl|title=Looking for the Genetic Roots of the Japanese(2/5)|date=2009-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U7w3vokwq8|accessdate=2016-12-05}}</ref> From mainland Japanese people, the MtDNA haplogroup frequencies are most occurring in the D4 haplogroup, with about 33%, with the second largest frequency in the B4 haplogroup, containing about 9%, and the third largest frequency in the M7a haplogroup, occurring at about 8%. The rest of the other haplogroup frequencies are much smaller than D4, with frequencies ranging from about 3-5%, consisting of mostly N9a, M8, and M9 haplogroups. Between the different Japanese populations, the Yayoi population has the highest haplogroup frequencies of the D4 haplogroup. The J\u014dmon Japanese group has the highest frequency of the N9b haplogroup. In modern Japanese Americans, the highest haplogroup frequency is in the D4 haplogroup, the same as the Yayoi Japanese population. In Okinawa Japanese populations, the highest frequency of haplogroups is the D haplogroup, with the M7a haplogroup frequency directly behind. Of the Ainu Japanese population, the highest haplogroup frequency occurs in the Y haplogroup, followed closely by an even distribution of frequency in the D, M7a, and G haplogroups. Lastly, for mainland Japanese populations, the D haplogroup presents the highest frequency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://heritageofjapan.wordpress.com/yayoi-era-yields-up-rice/who-were-the-yayoi-people/making-sense-of-dna-data-and-origins-of-the-japanese/|title=Making sense of DNA data and the origins of the Japanese|date=2009-02-27|newspaper=Heritage of Japan|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jspsusa.org/FORUM2012/presentation/3-2_Shinoda.pdf|title=Genetic structure of the Japanese and the formation of the Ainu population|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> In Japanese Americans, the biggest components are Chinese, Korean, and Okinawan. People of Japanese descent show two pre-Yayoi ancestral Y chromosome lineages descended from Paleolithic people who had been isolated on the mainland of Japan. Studies of the mitochondrial component of Japanese American genes of haplogroup M12 shows a direct correlation of Japanese haplotypes with Tibetans. Other haplotypes that early descents of Japanese people were thought to be carried into include C-M8, which is another Y-chromosome haplotype. Also going back to the J\u014dmon, that gene is displayed in high frequencies in people of Japanese descent. The estimated percentage of this type of gene in Japanese Americans is about 34.7%. The highest frequencies occur in Okinawans and Hokkaidos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~annj/courses/notes/jomon_genes.html|title=Jomon Genes Using DNA, researchers probe the genetic origins of modern Japanese|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Overall, the genetic makeup of Japanese Americans show very mixed origins of genes, all due to the result of migrations of the Japanese ancestors in the past.\n\n===Risk for inherited diseases===\nStudies have looked into the risk factors that are more prone to Japanese Americans, specifically in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (''The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent)'' second-generation pro-bands (''A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry).'' The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals of the study was to create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00005374|title=Genetics of the Metabolic Syndrome in Japanese Americans - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref> Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer's disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based off a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60&nbsp;mg/dl.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhong|first=S|last2=Sharp|first2=D S|last3=Grove|first3=J S|last4=Bruce|first4=C|last5=Yano|first5=K|last6=Curb|first6=J D|last7=Tall|first7=A R|date=1996-06-15|title=Increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene despite increased HDL levels.|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=97|issue=12|pages=2917\u20132923|doi=10.1172/JCI118751|issn=0021-9738|pmc=507389|pmid=8675707}}</ref> With research and investigations, the possibility of finding \"bad genes\" denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Melissa A.|date=2002-04-01|title=Ethical issues in human genome epidemiology: a case study based on the Japanese American Family Study in Seattle, Washington|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=155|issue=7|pages=585\u2013592|issn=0002-9262|pmid=11914185|doi=10.1093/aje/155.7.585|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Japanese Americans by state==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n\n===California===\n{{See also|History of the Japanese in Los Angeles|History of the Japanese in San Francisco}}\nIn the early 1900s, Japanese Americans established fishing communities on [[Terminal Island]] and in [[San Diego]].<ref name=\"FelandoMedina2012\">{{cite journal |last=Felando |first=August |last2=Medina |first2=Harold |date=Winter 2012 |title=The Origins of California' High-Seas Tuna Fleet |url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v58-1/v58-1felando.pdf |journal=Journal of San Diego History |publisher=San Diego History Center |volume=58 |issue=1 |access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref> By 1923, there were two thousand Japanese fishermen sailing out of [[San Pedro Bay (California)|Los Angeles Harbor]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Western Canner and Packer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S0dAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA10-PA36|year=1922|publisher=Miller Freeman Publications of California|page=36}}</ref> By the 1930s, legislation was passed that attempted to limit Japanese fishermen.

These early [[Issei]] immigrants came primarily from small towns and rural areas in the southern Japanese prefectures of [[Hiroshima Prefecture|Hiroshima]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture|Yamaguchi]], [[Kumamoto Prefecture|Kumamoto]], and [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]]<ref name=glenn>{{Cite book| last = Glenn| first = Evelyn | author-link = Evelyn Nakano Glenn|title = Issei, Nisei, War Bride: Three Generations of Japanese American Women in Domestic Service | publisher = Temple University Press | year = 2010 | page = 27 | isbn = 0-87722-412-9}}</ref> and most of them settled in either [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] or the [[West Coast of the United States| American West Coast]]. The Japanese population in the United States grew from 148 in 1880 (mostly students) to 2,039 in 1890 and 24,326 by 1900.<ref name=neiwert15>{{Cite book| last = Neiwert | first = David | title = Strawberry Days | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2005 | page = 15 | isbn = 978-1403967923}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, the \"[[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]]\" between the governments of Japan and the US ended immigration of Japanese unskilled workers, but permitted the immigration of businessmen, students and spouses of Japanese immigrants already in the US. The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] banned the immigration of nearly all Japanese.  The earlier [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] restricted naturalized United States citizenship to \"free white persons\", which excluded the Issei from citizenship. As a result, the Issei were unable to vote and faced additional restrictions such as the inability to own land under many state laws.  Due to these restrictions, Japanese immigration to the United States between 1931-1950 only totaled 3,503 which is strikingly low compared to the totals of 46,250 people in 1951\u20131960, 39,988 in 1961-70, 49,775 in 1971-80, 47,085 in 1981-90, and 67,942 in 1991-2000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=2001 Statistical Yearbook of the Immigration and Naturalization Service|last=|first=|publisher=Government Printing Office|year=2003|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=17\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBecause no new immigrants were permitted, all Japanese Americans born after 1924 were\u2014by definition\u2014born in the US. This generation, the [[Nisei]], became a distinct cohort from the Issei generation in terms of age, citizenship, and English-language ability, in addition to the usual generational differences. Institutional and interpersonal racism led many of the Nisei to marry other Nisei, resulting in a third distinct generation of Japanese Americans, the [[Sansei]]. Significant Japanese immigration did not occur again until the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] ended 40 years of bans against immigration from Japan and other countries.\n\nIn recent years, immigration from Japan has been more like that from Western Europe. The numbers involve on average 5 to 10 thousand per year, and is similar to the amount of immigration to the US from Germany. This is in stark contrast to the rest of Asia, where family reunification is the primary impetus for immigration.\n\n===Internment and redress===\n{{Main|Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese American redress and court cases}}\n[[File:Los Angeles, California.

The internments were based on the race or ancestry rather than activities of the interned. Families, including children, were interned together.

The Japanese American communities have themselves distinguished their members with terms like ''Issei'', ''Nisei'', and ''Sansei'', which describe the first, second, and third generations of immigrants. The fourth generation is called ''Yonsei'' (\u56db\u4e16), and the fifth is called ''Gosei'' (\u4e94\u4e16). The term ''[[Japanese diaspora|Nikkei]]'' (\u65e5\u7cfb) encompasses Japanese immigrants in all countries and of all generations.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable \"\n!Generation!!

In general, later generations of Japanese Americans speak English as their first language, though some do learn Japanese later as a second language. In Hawaii however, where Nikkei are about one-fifth of the whole population, Japanese is a major language, spoken and studied by many of the state's residents across ethnicities.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} It is taught in private Japanese language schools as early as the second grade. As a courtesy to the large number of Japanese tourists (from Japan), Japanese characters are provided on place signs, public transportation, and civic facilities. The Hawaii media market has a few locally produced Japanese language newspapers and magazines, although these are on the verge of dying out, due to a lack of interest on the part of the [[Japanese in Hawaii|local (Hawaii-born) Japanese]] population. Stores that cater to the tourist industry often have Japanese-speaking personnel. To show their allegiance to the US, many ''nisei'' and ''sansei'' intentionally avoided learning Japanese. But as many of the later generations find their identities in both Japan and America or American society broadens its definition of cultural identity, studying Japanese is becoming more popular than it once was.{{citation needed|date=October 2013|reason=No source given for claims concerning reasons for studying Japanese}}\n\n===Education===\nJapanese American culture places great value on education and culture. Across generations, children are often instilled with a strong desire to enter the rigors of higher education. Math and reading scores on the [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]] may often exceed the national averages. Japanese Americans have the largest showing of any ethnic group in nationwide [[Advanced Placement]] testing each year.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nA large majority of Japanese Americans obtain post-secondary degrees. Japanese Americans often face the \"[[model minority]]\" stereotype that they are dominant in math- and science-related fields in colleges and universities across the United States. In reality, however, there is an equal distribution of Japanese Americans between the arts and humanities and the sciences.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although their numbers have declined slightly in recent years, Japanese Americans are still a prominent presence in Ivy League schools, the top [[University of California]] campuses including [[UC Berkeley]] and [[UCLA]], and other elite universities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The 2000 census reported that 40.8% of Japanese Americans held a college degree.<ref name=\"Asian Nation\">{{cite web|last=Le|first=Cuong|title=Socioeconomic Statistics & Semographics|url=http://www.asian-nation.org/demographics.shtml|accessdate=2012-04-17}}</ref>\n\n====Schools for Japanese Americans and Japanese nationals====\n[[File:Seattle - Nihon Go Gakko 01.jpg|thumb|[[Nihon Go Gakko (Seattle)|Nihon Go Gakko]] in Seattle]]\n[[File:20140314 SAINTS.png|thumb|[[Seigakuin Atlanta International School]] on March 23, 2014]]\n{{Location map+|United States|width=350|float=right|caption=Locations of Japanese day schools ([[nihonjin gakk\u014d]] and [[shiritsu zaigai kyoiku shisetsu]]) in the contiguous United States approved by the Japanese [[MEXT]] (gray dots represent closed schools)|places=\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=42.121423|long=-87.981362|marksize=5|link=Chicago Futabakai Japanese School|label=<small>[[Chicago Futabakai Japanese School|Chicago]]</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=41.02841|long=-74.22650|marksize=5|link=The New Jersey Japanese School|label=<small>[[The New Jersey Japanese School|Oakland, NJ]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=41.037|long=-73.639|marksize=5|link=Japanese School of New York|label=<small>[[Japanese School of New York|Greenwich, CT]]</small>|position=top}}\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=41.031139|long=-73.719028|marksize=5|link=Keio Academy of New York|label=<small>[[Keio Academy of New York|Keio Academy]]</small>|position=left}}\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=33.8049679|long=-118.32712549999997|marksize=5|link=Nishiyamato Academy of California|label=<small>[[Nishiyamato Academy of California|Nishiyamato Academy]]</small>|position=right}}\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=33.95775|long=-84.272167|marksize=5|link=Seigakuin Atlanta International School|label=<small>[[Seigakuin Atlanta International School|Seigakuin Atlanta]]</small>|position=bottom}}\n{{Location map~|United States|lat=35.613041|long=-84.46571289999997|mark = Black pog.svg|marksize=5|link=Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School|label=<small>[[Tennessee Meiji Gakuin High School|Meiji Gakuin]]</small>|position=top}}\n}}\nA Japanese school opened in Hawaii in 1893 and other Japanese schools for temporary settlers in North America followed.<ref name=Endop279>Endo, R.

In many ways, due to the longstanding nature of Buddhist and Shinto practices in Japanese society, many of the cultural values and traditions commonly associated with Japanese tradition have been strongly influenced by these religious forms.\n\n[[File:USA-San Jose-Betsuin Buddhist Church-1.jpg|thumb|left|San Jose Betsuin Buddhist Temple]]\nA large number of the Japanese American community continue to practice [[Buddhism]] in some form, and a number of community traditions and festivals continue to center around Buddhist institutions. For example, one of the most popular community festivals is the annual [[Obon Festival]], which occurs in the summer, and provides an opportunity to reconnect with their customs and traditions and to pass these traditions and customs to the young. These kinds of festivals are mostly popular in communities with large populations of Japanese Americans, such as [[Southern California]] and [[Hawaii]]. A reasonable number of Japanese people both in and out of Japan are secular, as Shinto and Buddhism are most often practiced by rituals such as marriages or funerals, and not through faithful worship, as defines religion for many Americans.\n\nMany Japanese Americans also practice Christianity. Among mainline denominations the Presbyterians have long been active.

The Y chromosome is directly correlated to Asian populations, especially in Japanese Americans. The chromosome addition of Y Alu polymorphic element is only displayed in Japanese American men. People of Japanese descent show the highest frequency of the haplogroup O3a5. [[Haplogroup]]s are groups of genetic populations that share a common ancestor, paternally or maternally. The frequency of this haplogroup is about 5% higher than its frequency in other Asian groups such as Koreans, Manchus, and other Northeast Asians. The Japanese DNA sequence consists of 24.2% Korean, 16.1% Okinawa, 4.8% Uniquely Japanese, 25.8% Chinese, 8.1% Ainu, and 21% Unidentified. The Ainu people were the key to the Japanese genetic origins because researchers found an exact DNA match with the Ainu and the J\u014dmon Japanese to conclude the Ainu rooted all the way back to the J\u014dmon.<ref>{{Citation|last=sdfsdflgggdl|title=Looking for the Genetic Roots of the Japanese(2/5)|date=2009-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-U7w3vokwq8|accessdate=2016-12-05}}</ref> From mainland Japanese people, the MtDNA haplogroup frequencies are most occurring in the D4 haplogroup, with about 33%, with the second largest frequency in the B4 haplogroup, containing about 9%, and the third largest frequency in the M7a haplogroup, occurring at about 8%. The rest of the other haplogroup frequencies are much smaller than D4, with frequencies ranging from about 3-5%, consisting of mostly N9a, M8, and M9 haplogroups. Between the different Japanese populations, the Yayoi population has the highest haplogroup frequencies of the D4 haplogroup. The J\u014dmon Japanese group has the highest frequency of the N9b haplogroup. In modern Japanese Americans, the highest haplogroup frequency is in the D4 haplogroup, the same as the Yayoi Japanese population. In Okinawa Japanese populations, the highest frequency of haplogroups is the D haplogroup, with the M7a haplogroup frequency directly behind. Of the Ainu Japanese population, the highest haplogroup frequency occurs in the Y haplogroup, followed closely by an even distribution of frequency in the D, M7a, and G haplogroups. Lastly, for mainland Japanese populations, the D haplogroup presents the highest frequency.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://heritageofjapan.wordpress.com/yayoi-era-yields-up-rice/who-were-the-yayoi-people/making-sense-of-dna-data-and-origins-of-the-japanese/|title=Making sense of DNA data and the origins of the Japanese|date=2009-02-27|newspaper=Heritage of Japan|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jspsusa.org/FORUM2012/presentation/3-2_Shinoda.pdf|title=Genetic structure of the Japanese and the formation of the Ainu population|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> In Japanese Americans, the biggest components are Chinese, Korean, and Okinawan. People of Japanese descent show two pre-Yayoi ancestral Y chromosome lineages descended from Paleolithic people who had been isolated on the mainland of Japan. Studies of the mitochondrial component of Japanese American genes of haplogroup M12 shows a direct correlation of Japanese haplotypes with Tibetans. Other haplotypes that early descents of Japanese people were thought to be carried into include C-M8, which is another Y-chromosome haplotype. Also going back to the J\u014dmon, that gene is displayed in high frequencies in people of Japanese descent. The estimated percentage of this type of gene in Japanese Americans is about 34.7%. The highest frequencies occur in Okinawans and Hokkaidos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~annj/courses/notes/jomon_genes.html|title=Jomon Genes Using DNA, researchers probe the genetic origins of modern Japanese|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Overall, the genetic makeup of Japanese Americans show very mixed origins of genes, all due to the result of migrations of the Japanese ancestors in the past.\n\n===Risk for inherited diseases===\nStudies have looked into the risk factors that are more prone to Japanese Americans, specifically in hundreds of family generations of Nisei (''The generation of people born in North America, Latin America, Hawaii, or any country outside Japan either to at least one Issei or one non-immigrant Japanese parent)'' second-generation pro-bands (''A person serving as the starting point for the genetic study of a family, used in medicine and psychiatry).'' The risk factors for genetic diseases in Japanese Americans include coronary heart disease and diabetes. One study, called the Japanese American Community Diabetes Study that started in 1994 and went through 2003, involved the pro-bands taking part to test whether the increased risk of diabetes among Japanese Americans is due to the effects of Japanese Americans having a more westernized lifestyle due to the many differences between the United States of America and Japan. One of the main goals of the study was to create an archive of DNA samples which could be used to identify which diseases are more susceptible in Japanese Americans. Concerns with these studies of the risks of inherited diseases in Japanese Americans is that information pertaining to the genetic relationship may not be consistent with the reported biological family information given of Nisei second generation pro-bands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00005374|title=Genetics of the Metabolic Syndrome in Japanese Americans - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov|website=clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}</ref> Also, research has been put on concerning apolipoprotein E genotypes; this polymorphism has three alleles (*e2, *e3, and *e4)and was determined from research because of its known association with increased cholesterol levels and risk of coronary heart disease in Japanese Americans. Specifically too, the apolipoprotein *e4 allele is linked to Alzheimer's disease as well. Also, there is increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with a mutation in the cholesterol ester transfer protein gene despite having increased levels of HDL. By definition, HDL are plasma high density lipoproteins that show a genetic relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD). The cholesterol ester transfer protein(CETP) helps the transfer of cholesterol esters from lipoproteins to other lipoproteins in the human body. It plays a fundamental role in the reverse transport of cholesterol to the liver, which is why a mutation in this can lead to coronary heart disease. Studies have shown that the CETP is linked to increased HDL levels. There is a very common pattern of two different cholesterol ester transfer protein gene mutations (D442G, 5.1%; intron 14G:A, 0.5%) found in about 3,469 Japanese American men. This was based off a program called the Honolulu Heart Program. The mutations correlated with decreased CETP levels (-35%) and increased HDL cholesterol levels (+10% for D442G). The relative risk of CHD was 1.43 in men with mutations (P<0.05), and after research found for CHD risk factors, the relative risk went up to 1.55 (P=0.02); after further adjustments for HDL levels, the relative risk went up again to 1.68 (P=0.008). Genetic CETP deficiency is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is due mainly to increased CHD risks in Japanese American men with the D442G mutation and lipoprotein cholesterol levels between 41 and 60&nbsp;mg/dl.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhong|first=S|last2=Sharp|first2=D S|last3=Grove|first3=J S|last4=Bruce|first4=C|last5=Yano|first5=K|last6=Curb|first6=J D|last7=Tall|first7=A R|date=1996-06-15|title=Increased coronary heart disease in Japanese-American men with mutation in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein gene despite increased HDL levels.|journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=97|issue=12|pages=2917\u20132923|doi=10.1172/JCI118751|issn=0021-9738|pmc=507389|pmid=8675707}}</ref> With research and investigations, the possibility of finding \"bad genes\" denounces the Japanese Americans and will be associated only with Japanese American ancestry, leading to other issues the Japanese Americans had to deal with in the past such as discrimination and prejudice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Melissa A.|date=2002-04-01|title=Ethical issues in human genome epidemiology: a case study based on the Japanese American Family Study in Seattle, Washington|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|volume=155|issue=7|pages=585\u2013592|issn=0002-9262|pmid=11914185|doi=10.1093/aje/155.7.585|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Japanese Americans by state==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2013}}\n\n===California===\n{{See also|History of the Japanese in Los Angeles|History of the Japanese in San Francisco}}\nIn the early 1900s, Japanese Americans established fishing communities on [[Terminal Island]] and in [[San Diego]].<ref name=\"FelandoMedina2012\">{{cite journal |last=Felando |first=August |last2=Medina |first2=Harold |date=Winter 2012 |title=The Origins of California' High-Seas Tuna Fleet |url=https://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v58-1/v58-1felando.pdf |journal=Journal of San Diego History |publisher=San Diego History Center |volume=58 |issue=1 |access-date=6 April 2015}}</ref> By 1923, there were two thousand Japanese fishermen sailing out of [[San Pedro Bay (California)|Los Angeles Harbor]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Western Canner and Packer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2S0dAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA10-PA36|year=1922|publisher=Miller Freeman Publications of California|page=36}}</ref> By the 1930s, legislation was passed that attempted to limit Japanese fishermen.
