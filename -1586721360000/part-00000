On May 25, 1979, the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10]] operating this flight was taking off from runway 32R when it crashed into the ground. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, along with two people on the ground. With 273 fatalities, it is the deadliest aviation accident to have occurred in the United States. It was also the third deadliest aviation disaster at the time, behind [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] in 1974 and the [[Tenerife airport disaster]] in 1977.\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) found that as the aircraft was beginning its takeoff [[rotation (aviation)|rotation]], engine number one (the left engine) separated from the left wing, flipping over the top of the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed [[hydraulic fluid]] lines that lock the wing's [[leading-edge slats]] in place and damaged a {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the aircraft began to climb, the damaged left wing \u2013 with no engine \u2013 produced far less lift ([[stall (fluid mechanics)|stalled]]) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine providing full takeoff thrust. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the [[hardpoint|pylon]] structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, American Airlines  JP5931060.jpg|thumb|N110AA, the aircraft involved in the accident, photographed five years prior]]\nThe aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 registered ''N110AA''. It had been delivered on February 25, 1972, and at the time of the crash, it had logged just under 20,000 hours of flying time over seven years. The jet was powered by three [[General Electric]] [[General Electric CF6|CF6-6D]] engines. A review of the aircraft's flight logs and maintenance records showed that no mechanical discrepancies were noted for May 11, 1979. On the day of the accident, in violation of standard procedure, the records were not removed from the aircraft, and were destroyed in the accident.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\" />{{rp|76}}\n\n===Flight crew===\nCaptain Walter Lux, 53, had been flying the DC-10 since its introduction eight years earlier. He had logged around 22,000 flying hours, of which about 3,000 were in a DC-10. He was also qualified to pilot 17 other aircraft, including the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]], the [[Douglas DC-7|DC-7]], and the [[Boeing 727]].<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\" />{{rp|75}} First Officer James Dillard, 49, and Flight Engineer Alfred Udovich, 56, were also highly experienced: 9,275 hours and 15,000 hours, respectively; between them, they had 1,830 hours' flying experience in the DC-10.<ref name=\"AirDisaster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/investigations/aacrash.shtml|title=Investigation: American Airlines 191|publisher=AirDisaster.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813234633/http://www.airdisaster.com/investigations/aacrash.shtml|archivedate=August 13, 2006|accessdate=July 26, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Accident==\n[[File:AA191-crash-site.png|thumb|Crash site of American Airlines Flight 191]]\n\nOn the accident flight, just as the aircraft reached [[V speeds|takeoff speed]], the No. 1 engine and its [[aircraft pylon|pylon]] assembly separated from the left wing, ripping away a {{convert|3|ft|m|0|adj=on}} section of the [[leading edge]] with it. The combined unit flipped over the top of the wing and landed on the runway.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|2}} Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated, \"As the aircraft got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up over the top of the wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he was going to come back to the airport.\"<ref name=vatz>{{cite thesis |title=Knowing When to Stop: The Investigation of Flight 191 |first=Mara E. |last=Vatz |page=9 |degree=Masters|location=Cambridge, MA|oclc=59008054|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Dept. of Humanities, Program in Writing and Humanistic Studies |year=2004 |hdl = 1721.1/39430}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known what was said in the cockpit in the 50 seconds leading up to the final impact, as the cockpit voice recorder lost power when the engine detached. The only crash-related audio collected by the recorder is a thumping noise (likely the sound of the engine separating), followed by the first officer exclaiming \"Damn!\", at which point the recording ends. This may also explain why Air Traffic Control was unsuccessful in their attempts to radio the crew and inform them that they had lost an engine. This loss of power did, however, prove useful in the investigation, serving as a marker of exactly what circuit in the DC-10's extensive electrical system had failed.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|57}}\n\nIn addition to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, also failed but continued to operate through motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator was attached to the number one engine, failed as well, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his [[stick shaker]], and the [[leading-edge slat|slat]] disagreement sensors. A switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, but it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist\u2014not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. In order to reach that backup power switch, the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft did not get any higher than 350 feet (110 m) above the ground and was only in the air for 50 seconds between the time the engine separated and the moment it crashed, there was not sufficient time to perform such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nThe aircraft climbed to about {{convert|325|ft}} above ground level while spewing a white mist trail of fuel and hydraulic fluid from the left wing. The first officer had followed the flight director and raised the nose to 14&nbsp;degrees, which reduced the airspeed from {{convert|165|kn|mph km/h}} to the takeoff safety airspeed (V<sub>2</sub>) of {{convert|153|kn|mph km/h}}, the speed at which the aircraft could safely climb after sustaining an engine failure.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|53\u201354}}\n\nHowever, the engine separation had severed the hydraulic fluid lines that controlled the leading edge slats on the left wing and locked them in place, causing the outboard slats (immediately left of the No. 1 engine) to retract under air load. The retraction of the slats raised the stall speed of the left wing to approximately {{convert|159|kn|mph km/h}}, 6 knots higher than the prescribed takeoff safety airspeed (V<sub>2</sub>) of 153 knots. As a result, the left wing entered a full [[stall (flight)|aerodynamic stall]].\n\nWith the left wing stalled, the aircraft began banking to the left, rolling over onto its side until it was partially inverted at a 112-degree bank angle (as seen in the [[:File:Aa191_ohare.jpg|Laughlin photograph]]) with its right wing over its left wing. As the cockpit had been equipped with a [[closed-circuit television camera]] positioned behind the captain's shoulder and connected to view screens in the passenger cabin, it is possible that the passengers were able to witness these events from the viewpoint of the cockpit as the aircraft dove towards the ground.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Special to the New York Times|title=Dive May Have Been Televised|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/dive-may-have-been-televised.html|accessdate=March 21, 2018|work=The New York Times|volume=128|issue=44230|publisher=NYTimes Co.|date=May 27, 1979}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=David|title=...191, do you want to come back?|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1979/06/03/page/16/article/191-do-you-want-to-come-back|accessdate=May 27, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|issue=Issue: 132nd Year, No. 154|date=June 3, 1979|page=16, Section 1}}</ref> Whether the camera's view was interrupted by the power loss from the number one electrical bus is not known.

The DC-10 had also crashed into an old aircraft hangar located at the edge of the airport at the former site of Ravenswood International Airport, which was used for storage. The aircraft was completely destroyed by the impact force and ignition of a nearly full load of 21k gallons of fuel and no sizable components other than the engines and tail section remained.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macarthur|first1=Job|oclc=464170955|title=Air Disaster|date=1996|publisher=Airlife|location=Shrewsbury|isbn=9781875671199|page=49|edition=2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Aa191 ohare2.jpg|thumb|Flight 191 hitting the ground]]\nIn addition to the 271 people on board the aircraft, two employees at a nearby repair garage were killed and two more were severely burned.

The impact on the public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published on the front page of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on the Sunday two days after the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/aa191/photo.shtml |publisher=AirDisaster.Com |title=Accident Photo: American 191 |accessdate=April 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113057/http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/aa191/photo.shtml |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}</ref> There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently was the result of the discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut,<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |journal=[[Jet (magazine)|JET]] |volume=56 |issue=13 |page=5 |title=Tuskegee Airman Heads Chicago Air Crash Probe |date=June 14, 1979 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BMADAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=elwood+driver+DC-10 |accessdate=April 16, 2011 }}</ref> implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former [[general aviation]] Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Illinois, Northern Chicago area|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/IL/Airfields_IL_Chicago_N.htm|work=[[Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields]]|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Engine separation===\n[[File:DC-10 engine-pylon.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|An [[FAA]] diagram of the DC-10 engine and [[Aircraft pylon|pylon]] assembly indicating the failed aft pylon attach fitting]]\n\nWitnesses to the crash were in universal agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found along with the separated engine, other than its supporting [[aircraft pylon|pylon]], leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free from the [[airframe]] and struck the engine. Hence, the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure. The cockpit instrument panels were too badly damaged to provide any useful information.<ref name=vatz />\n\nDuring the investigation, an examination on the pylon attachment points revealed some damage done to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Therefore, investigators now could conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash actually occurred, rather than being caused by it.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nThe NTSB determined that the damage to the left wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at the American Airlines aircraft maintenance facility in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], between March 29 and 30, 1979.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|68}} On those dates, the aircraft had undergone routine service, during which the engine and pylon had been removed from the wing for inspection and maintenance. The removal procedure recommended by McDonnell-Douglas called for the engine to be detached from the pylon before detaching the pylon itself from the wing. However, American Airlines, as well as [[Continental Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]], had developed a different procedure that saved approximately 200-man-hours per aircraft and \"more importantly from a safety standpoint, it would reduce the number of disconnects (of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines, electrical cables, and wiring) from 79 to 27.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|26}} This new procedure involved the removal of the engine and pylon assembly as a single unit, rather than as individual components. United Airlines' implementation involved the use of an [[hoist (device)|overhead crane]] to support the engine/pylon assembly during removal and installation. The method chosen by American and Continental relied on supporting the engine/pylon assembly with a large [[forklift]].\n\nIt was learned that if the forklift was incorrectly positioned, the engine/pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled, causing it to rock like a [[see-saw]] and jam the pylon against the wing's attachment points. Forklift operators were guided only by hand and voice signals as they could not directly see the juncture between pylon and wing. Positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result. Compounding the problem, maintenance work on N110AA did not go smoothly. The mechanics started to disconnect the engine and pylon as a single unit, but there was a shift change halfway through the job. During this interval, although the forklift remained stationary, the forks supporting the entire weight of the engine and pylon moved downward slightly due to a normal loss of hydraulic pressure associated with its engine being turned off; this caused a misalignment between the engine/pylon and wing. When work was resumed, the pylon was jammed on the wing and the forklift had to be re-positioned. It is unclear whether damage to the mount was caused by the initial downward movement of the engine/pylon structure or by the realignment attempt.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|29\u201330}} Regardless of how it happened, the resulting damage, although insufficient to cause an immediate failure, eventually developed into [[fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]], worsening with each takeoff and landing cycle during the eight weeks that followed. When the attachment finally failed, the engine and its pylon broke away from the wing. The structure surrounding the forward pylon mount also failed from the resulting stresses.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nInspection of the DC-10 fleets of the three airlines revealed that while United Airlines' hoist approach seemed to be harmless, there were several DC-10s at both American and Continental that already had [[fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]] damage to their pylon mounts caused by similar maintenance procedures.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|18}} The field service representative from McDonnell-Douglas stated the company would \"not encourage this procedure due to the element of risk\" and had so advised American Airlines. McDonnell-Douglas, however, \"does not have the authority to either approve or disapprove the maintenance procedures of its customers.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|26}}\n\n===Inadequate speed===\nThe NTSB determined that the loss of one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines.<ref name=aeat/><ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|54}} The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading-edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|53,57}} The NTSB determined that the engine tore through hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|53}} In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.<ref name=\"AD80-03-03\">FAA [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgAD.nsf/0/0664E2B3BEE25C0E862569F200697162?OpenDocument Airworthiness Directive 80-03-03]</ref>\n\nThe wreckage was too severely fragmented to determine the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in [[Palo Alto, California]], for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which made it possible to distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.<ref name=vatz />{{rp|20\u201321}}\n\nWind tunnel and flight simulator tests were conducted to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that the damage to the wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from {{Convert|124|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=}} to {{Convert|159|kn|mph km/h|abbr=}}.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|23}} The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the [[stick shaker]] on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|54,55,67}} The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.<ref name=\"ad80-03-10\">FAA [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgAD.nsf/0/83D4FF29A77B501C862569F200686555?OpenDocument Airworthiness Directive 80-03-10]</ref>\n\nAs the aircraft had reached V1, the crew were committed to takeoff and thus followed standard procedures for an engine out situation. This procedure is to climb at the takeoff safety airspeed ([[V speeds|V<sub>2</sub>]]) and attitude (angle), as directed by the [[flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]]. The partial electrical power failure (produced by the separation of the left No. 1 engine) meant that neither the stall warning nor the slat retraction indicator was operative. The crew, therefore, did not know that the slats on the left wing were retracting. This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing. Thus flying at the takeoff safety airspeed caused the left wing to stall while the right wing was still producing lift, so the aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to the left. In simulator recreations held after the accident it was determined that \"had the pilot maintained excess airspeed the accident may not have occurred.\" Of a dozen pilots who attempted simulator recreations of AA 191 with the same information that was available to the crew, none of them managed to prevent a crash. The crew could not see the wings from the cockpit and probably did not know that the #1 engine had fallen off, only that they had an engine out. Aborting takeoff would have likely resulted in a runway overrun and crash. Furthermore, even if they increased engine speed enough to get airborne, the damage to the left wing, which included leaking fuel and broken electrical wires, would have created an extremely dangerous situation, possibly an explosion and fire similar to what happened to [[Air Canada Flight 621]] nine years earlier, and quite probably there was nothing that could have been done to save AA 191 from the moment the #1 engine separated.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|54}}\n\n===Probable cause===\nThe findings of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board were released on December 21, 1979:\n{{quote|The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems resulting from maintenance-induced damage leading to the separation of the No. 1 engine and pylon assembly at a critical point during takeoff. The separation resulted from damage by improper maintenance procedures which led to failure of the pylon structure.\n\nContributing to the cause of the accident were the vulnerability of the design of the pylon attach points to maintenance damage; the vulnerability of the design of the leading edge slat system to the damage which produced asymmetry; deficiencies in Federal Aviation Administration surveillance and reporting systems which failed to detect and prevent the use of improper maintenance procedures; deficiencies in the practices and communications among the operators, the manufacturer, and the FAA which failed to determine and disseminate the particulars regarding previous maintenance damage incidents; and the intolerance of prescribed operational procedures to this unique emergency. Unlike the rival [[Boeing 747]] and [[Lockheed L-1011]], the DC-10 also lacked hydraulic cutoff valves in the event of a system rupture, therefore an accident such as occurred on AA 191 may have been recoverable on those aircraft.<ref name=aeat>{{cite journal|title=Chicago DC\u201010 Accident Findings|journal=Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology|date=1 March 1980|volume=52|issue=3|pages=19\u201320|doi=10.1108/eb035612|issn=0002-2667}}</ref><ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|69}}}}\n\n==Legacy of the DC-10==\nThe crash of Flight 191 brought strong criticism from the media regarding the DC-10's safety and design.<ref name=perception>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Arnold|last2=Lofaso|first2=Anthony J.|title=After the Crash: The Passenger Response to the DC-10 Disaster|journal=Management Science|date=November 1, 1983|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1225\u20131236|doi=10.1287/mnsc.29.11.1225|issn=0025-1909}}</ref> The DC-10 had been involved in two accidents related to the design of its cargo doors, [[American Airlines Flight 96]] (1972) and [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] (1974).

On May 25, 1979, the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10|McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10]] operating this flight was taking off from runway 32R when it crashed into the ground. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, along with two people on the ground. With 273 fatalities, it is the deadliest aviation accident to have occurred in the United States.\n\nThe [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB) found that as the aircraft was beginning its takeoff [[rotation (aviation)|rotation]], engine number one (the left engine) separated from the left wing, flipping over the top of the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed [[hydraulic fluid]] lines that lock the wing's [[leading-edge slats]] in place and damaged a {{convert|3|ft|m|0}} section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the aircraft began to climb, the damaged left wing \u2013 with no engine \u2013 produced far less lift ([[stall (fluid mechanics)|stalled]]) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine providing full takeoff thrust. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the [[hardpoint|pylon]] structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10, American Airlines  JP5931060.jpg|thumb|N110AA, the aircraft involved in the accident, photographed five years prior]]\nThe aircraft involved was a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 registered ''N110AA''. It had been delivered on February 25, 1972, and at the time of the crash, it had logged just under 20,000 hours of flying time over seven years. The jet was powered by three [[General Electric]] [[General Electric CF6|CF6-6D]] engines.

It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail.

The only crash-related audio collected by the recorder is a thumping noise (likely the sound of the engine separating), followed by the first officer exclaiming \"Damn!\", at which point the recording ends. This may also explain why Air Traffic Control was unsuccessful in their attempts to radio the crew and inform them that they had lost an engine. This loss of power did, however, prove useful in the investigation, serving as a marker of exactly what circuit in the DC-10's extensive electrical system had failed.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|57}}\n\nIn addition to the engine's failure, several related systems failed. The number one hydraulic system, powered by the number one engine, also failed but continued to operate through motor pumps that mechanically connected it to hydraulic system three. Hydraulic system three was also damaged and began leaking fluid but maintained pressure and operation up until impact. Hydraulic system two was undamaged. The number one electrical bus, whose generator was attached to the number one engine, failed as well, causing several electrical systems to go offline, most notably the captain's instruments, his [[stick shaker]], and the [[leading-edge slat|slat]] disagreement sensors. A switch in the overhead panel would have allowed the captain to restore power to his instruments, but it was not used. It might have been possible for the flight engineer to reach the backup power switch (as part of an abnormal situation checklist\u2014not as part of their take-off emergency procedure) in an effort to restore electrical power to the number one electrical bus. That would have worked only if electrical faults were no longer present in the number one electrical system. In order to reach that backup power switch, the flight engineer would have had to rotate his seat, release his safety belt, and stand up. Since the aircraft did not get any higher than 350 feet (110 m) above the ground and was only in the air for 50 seconds between the time the engine separated and the moment it crashed, there was not sufficient time to perform such an action. In any event, the first officer was flying the airplane and his instruments continued to function normally.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|52}}\n\nThe aircraft climbed to about {{convert|325|ft}} above ground level while spewing a white mist trail of fuel and hydraulic fluid from the left wing. The first officer had followed the flight director and raised the nose to 14&nbsp;degrees, which reduced the airspeed from {{convert|165|kn|mph km/h}} to the takeoff safety airspeed (V<sub>2</sub>) of {{convert|153|kn|mph km/h}}, the speed at which the aircraft could safely climb after sustaining an engine failure.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|53\u201354}}\n\nHowever, the engine separation had severed the hydraulic fluid lines that controlled the leading edge slats on the left wing and locked them in place, causing the outboard slats (immediately left of the No. 1 engine) to retract under air load. The retraction of the slats raised the stall speed of the left wing to approximately {{convert|159|kn|mph km/h}}, 6 knots higher than the prescribed takeoff safety airspeed (V<sub>2</sub>) of 153 knots. As a result, the left wing entered a full [[stall (flight)|aerodynamic stall]].\n\nWith the left wing stalled, the aircraft began banking to the left, rolling over onto its side until it was partially inverted at a 112-degree bank angle (as seen in the [[:File:Aa191_ohare.jpg|Laughlin photograph]]) with its right wing over its left wing. As the cockpit had been equipped with a [[closed-circuit television camera]] positioned behind the captain's shoulder and connected to view screens in the passenger cabin, it is possible that the passengers were able to witness these events from the viewpoint of the cockpit as the aircraft dove towards the ground.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Special to the New York Times|title=Dive May Have Been Televised|agency=Associated Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/27/archives/dive-may-have-been-televised.html|accessdate=March 21, 2018|work=The New York Times|volume=128|issue=44230|publisher=NYTimes Co.|date=May 27, 1979}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=David|title=...191, do you want to come back?|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1979/06/03/page/16/article/191-do-you-want-to-come-back|accessdate=May 27, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|issue=Issue: 132nd Year, No. 154|date=June 3, 1979|page=16, Section 1}}</ref> Whether the camera's view was interrupted by the power loss from the number one electrical bus is not known.

The impact on the public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published on the front page of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on the Sunday two days after the crash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/aa191/photo.shtml |publisher=AirDisaster.Com |title=Accident Photo: American 191 |accessdate=April 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113057/http://www.airdisaster.com/photos/aa191/photo.shtml |archivedate=June 7, 2011 }}</ref> There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash.

The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former [[general aviation]] Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields: Illinois, Northern Chicago area|url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/IL/Airfields_IL_Chicago_N.htm|work=[[Abandoned & Little-Known Airfields]]|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Engine separation===\n[[File:DC-10 engine-pylon.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|An [[FAA]] diagram of the DC-10 engine and [[Aircraft pylon|pylon]] assembly indicating the failed aft pylon attach fitting]]\n\nWitnesses to the crash were in universal agreement that the aircraft had not struck any foreign objects on the runway. Also, no pieces of the wing or other aircraft components were found along with the separated engine, other than its supporting [[aircraft pylon|pylon]], leading investigators to conclude that nothing else had broken free from the [[airframe]] and struck the engine. Hence, the engine/pylon assembly separation could only have resulted from a structural failure. The cockpit instrument panels were too badly damaged to provide any useful information.<ref name=vatz />\n\nDuring the investigation, an examination on the pylon attachment points revealed some damage done to the wing's pylon mounting bracket that matched the shape of the pylon's rear attachment fitting. This meant that the pylon attachment fitting had struck the mounting bracket at some point. This was important evidence, as the only way the pylon fitting could strike the wing's mounting bracket in the observed manner was if the bolts that held the pylon to the wing had been removed and the engine/pylon assembly was being supported by something other than the aircraft itself. Therefore, investigators now could conclude that the observed damage to the rear pylon mount had been present before the crash actually occurred, rather than being caused by it.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nThe NTSB determined that the damage to the left wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at the American Airlines aircraft maintenance facility in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], between March 29 and 30, 1979.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|68}} On those dates, the aircraft had undergone routine service, during which the engine and pylon had been removed from the wing for inspection and maintenance. The removal procedure recommended by McDonnell-Douglas called for the engine to be detached from the pylon before detaching the pylon itself from the wing. However, American Airlines, as well as [[Continental Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]], had developed a different procedure that saved approximately 200-man-hours per aircraft and \"more importantly from a safety standpoint, it would reduce the number of disconnects (of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines, electrical cables, and wiring) from 79 to 27.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|26}} This new procedure involved the removal of the engine and pylon assembly as a single unit, rather than as individual components. United Airlines' implementation involved the use of an [[hoist (device)|overhead crane]] to support the engine/pylon assembly during removal and installation. The method chosen by American and Continental relied on supporting the engine/pylon assembly with a large [[forklift]].\n\nIt was learned that if the forklift was incorrectly positioned, the engine/pylon assembly would not be stable as it was being handled, causing it to rock like a [[see-saw]] and jam the pylon against the wing's attachment points. Forklift operators were guided only by hand and voice signals as they could not directly see the juncture between pylon and wing. Positioning had to be extremely accurate or structural damage could result. Compounding the problem, maintenance work on N110AA did not go smoothly. The mechanics started to disconnect the engine and pylon as a single unit, but there was a shift change halfway through the job. During this interval, although the forklift remained stationary, the forks supporting the entire weight of the engine and pylon moved downward slightly due to a normal loss of hydraulic pressure associated with its engine being turned off; this caused a misalignment between the engine/pylon and wing. When work was resumed, the pylon was jammed on the wing and the forklift had to be re-positioned. It is unclear whether damage to the mount was caused by the initial downward movement of the engine/pylon structure or by the realignment attempt.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|29\u201330}} Regardless of how it happened, the resulting damage, although insufficient to cause an immediate failure, eventually developed into [[fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]], worsening with each takeoff and landing cycle during the eight weeks that followed. When the attachment finally failed, the engine and its pylon broke away from the wing. The structure surrounding the forward pylon mount also failed from the resulting stresses.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nInspection of the DC-10 fleets of the three airlines revealed that while United Airlines' hoist approach seemed to be harmless, there were several DC-10s at both American and Continental that already had [[fatigue (material)|fatigue cracking]] damage to their pylon mounts caused by similar maintenance procedures.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|18}} The field service representative from McDonnell-Douglas stated the company would \"not encourage this procedure due to the element of risk\" and had so advised American Airlines. McDonnell-Douglas, however, \"does not have the authority to either approve or disapprove the maintenance procedures of its customers.\"<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|26}}\n\n===Inadequate speed===\nThe NTSB determined that the loss of one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines.<ref name=aeat/><ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|54}} The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, hydraulic, electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading-edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the hydraulic pressure within the system.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|53,57}} The NTSB determined that the engine tore through hydraulic lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of hydraulic pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|53}} In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of hydraulic line damage.<ref name=\"AD80-03-03\">FAA [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgAD.nsf/0/0664E2B3BEE25C0E862569F200697162?OpenDocument Airworthiness Directive 80-03-03]</ref>\n\nThe wreckage was too severely fragmented to determine the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed only that the right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in [[Palo Alto, California]], for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which made it possible to distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.<ref name=vatz />{{rp|20\u201321}}\n\nWind tunnel and flight simulator tests were conducted to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that the damage to the wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from {{Convert|124|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=}} to {{Convert|159|kn|mph km/h|abbr=}}.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|23}} The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the [[stick shaker]] on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|54,55,67}} The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.<ref name=\"ad80-03-10\">FAA [http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgAD.nsf/0/83D4FF29A77B501C862569F200686555?OpenDocument Airworthiness Directive 80-03-10]</ref>\n\nAs the aircraft had reached V1, the crew were committed to takeoff and thus followed standard procedures for an engine out situation. This procedure is to climb at the takeoff safety airspeed ([[V speeds|V<sub>2</sub>]]) and attitude (angle), as directed by the [[flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]]. The partial electrical power failure (produced by the separation of the left No. 1 engine) meant that neither the stall warning nor the slat retraction indicator was operative. The crew, therefore, did not know that the slats on the left wing were retracting. This retraction significantly raised the stall speed of the left wing. Thus flying at the takeoff safety airspeed caused the left wing to stall while the right wing was still producing lift, so the aircraft banked sharply and uncontrollably to the left. In simulator recreations held after the accident it was determined that \"had the pilot maintained excess airspeed the accident may not have occurred.\" Of a dozen pilots who attempted simulator recreations of AA 191 with the same information that was available to the crew, none of them managed to prevent a crash. The crew could not see the wings from the cockpit and probably did not know that the #1 engine had fallen off, only that they had an engine out. Aborting takeoff would have likely resulted in a runway overrun and crash. Furthermore, even if they increased engine speed enough to get airborne, the damage to the left wing, which included leaking fuel and broken electrical wires, would have created an extremely dangerous situation, possibly an explosion and fire similar to what happened to [[Air Canada Flight 621]] nine years earlier, and quite probably there was nothing that could have been done to save AA 191 from the moment the #1 engine separated.<ref name=\"NTSB AAR-79-17 Final Report\"/>{{rp|54}}\n\n===Probable cause===\nThe findings of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board were released on December 21, 1979:\n{{quote|The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the asymmetrical stall and the ensuing roll of the aircraft because of the uncommanded retraction of the left wing outboard leading edge slats and the loss of stall warning and slat disagreement indication systems resulting from maintenance-induced damage leading to the separation of the No. 1 engine and pylon assembly at a critical point during takeoff. The separation resulted from damage by improper maintenance procedures which led to failure of the pylon structure.\n\nContributing to the cause of the accident were the vulnerability of the design of the pylon attach points to maintenance damage; the vulnerability of the design of the leading edge slat system to the damage which produced asymmetry; deficiencies in Federal Aviation Administration surveillance and reporting systems which failed to detect and prevent the use of improper maintenance procedures; deficiencies in the practices and communications among the operators, the manufacturer, and the FAA which failed to determine and disseminate the particulars regarding previous maintenance damage incidents; and the intolerance of prescribed operational procedures to this unique emergency.

Throughout the novel, Seward conducts ambitious interviews with one of his patients, [[Renfield|R. M. Renfield]], in order to understand better the nature of life-consuming [[psychosis]]. As a psychiatrist, Seward enjoys using the most up-to-date equipment, including using a recording [[phonograph]] to record his interviews with his patients and his own notes. Several chapters of the novel consist of transcriptions of Seward's phonograph recordings. One of the main contributions made by Dr. Seward is his recordings of the events depicted from his personal perspective as a doctor; allowing the reader to gain a scientific understanding of the behaviour of vampirism through his behavioural analysis of Renfield.\n\nHe is best friends with [[Quincey Morris]] and [[Arthur Holmwood]]. All three propose to [[Lucy Westenra]] on the same day. Although Lucy turns down Seward's marriage proposal, his love for her remains, and he dedicates himself to her care when she is suddenly taken ill.\n\nHe calls in his mentor, [[Abraham Van Helsing]], to help him with her illness, and he helps Seward to realise that Lucy has been bitten by a vampire and is doomed to become one herself. After she is officially destroyed and her soul can go to heaven, Seward is determined to destroy Dracula. The novel's epilogue mentions that Seward is now happily married.\n\n== In adaptations ==\n=== On screen===\n\nSeward often appears in different screen adaptations of ''Dracula'' but in a wide variety of different roles. He is often referred to as \"Jack\" Seward. The most common change is to portray him not as Lucy's suitor, but as [[Mina Harker]]'s father (or sometimes Lucy's father). This was almost certainly based on the decision made in writing the [[Hamilton Deane]] [[Dracula (1924 play)|stage adaptation]]. Sometimes he is portrayed as just elderly doctor with no familial connections to other characters. Such portrayals include:\n\n* [[Gustav Botz]] (as Dr. Sievers) in ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922)\n* [[Herbert Bunston]] in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931 film) - here he is father of Mina.\n* Jos\u00e9 Soriano Viosca in ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'' (Spanish version, 1931) - here he is father of Eva (Mina in this version).\n* [[Charles Lloyd-Pack]] in ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958)\n* [[Paul Muller (actor)|Paul Muller]] in ''[[Count Dracula (1970 film)|Count Dracula]]'' (1970)\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] in ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'' (1979) - here he is father of Lucy.\n* [[Harvey Korman]] in ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' (1995) - here he is father of Mina.\n\nIn recent years, the trend has been to return Seward to his role in the novel, as a suitor for Lucy's hand in marriage, in:\n\n* [[James Maxwell (actor)|James Maxwell]] in ''[[Dracula (Mystery and Imagination)|Dracula]]'' (1968) - here he is Lucy\u2019s fianc\u00e9. He and Van Helsing team up and jointly defeat Dracula.\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] in ''[[Count Dracula (1977)|Count Dracula]]'' (1977) - he is portrayed faithfully to his counterpart in the novel.\n* [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992) - he is portrayed faithfully to his counterpart in the novel.\n* Matthew Johnson in ''[[Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary]]'' (2002)\n* [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] in ''[[Dracula (2006)|Dracula]]'' (2006)\n* [[Matthew Beard (English actor)|Matthew Beard]] in ''[[Dracula (2020 TV series)|Dracula]]'' (2020) - he is re-imagined as modern-day medical student, who has unrequired crush on Lucy.\n\n===On stage===\n* John Seward appears in [[Dracula, the Musical|''Dracula, the musical'']] by [[Frank Wildhorn]].

Throughout the novel, Seward conducts ambitious interviews with one of his patients, [[Renfield|R. M. Renfield]], in order to understand better the nature of life-consuming [[psychosis]]. As a psychiatrist, Seward enjoys using the most up-to-date equipment, including using a recording [[phonograph]] to record his interviews with his patients and his own notes. Several chapters of the novel consist of transcriptions of Seward's phonograph recordings. One of the main contributions made by Dr. Seward is his recordings of the events depicted from his personal perspective as a doctor; allowing the reader to gain a scientific understanding of the behaviour of vampirism through his behavioural analysis of Renfield.\n\nHe is best friends with [[Quincey Morris]] and [[Arthur Holmwood]]. All three propose to [[Lucy Westenra]] on the same day. Although Lucy turns down Seward's marriage proposal, his love for her remains, and he dedicates himself to her care when she is suddenly taken ill.\n\nHe calls in his mentor, [[Abraham Van Helsing]], to help him with her illness, and he helps Seward to realise that Lucy has been bitten by a vampire and is doomed to become one herself. After she is officially destroyed and her soul can go to heaven, Seward is determined to destroy Dracula. The novel's epilogue mentions that Seward is now happily married.\n\n== In adaptations ==\n=== On screen===\n\nSeward often appears in different screen adaptations of ''Dracula'' but in a wide variety of different roles. He is often referred to as \"Jack\" Seward. The most common change is to portray him not as Lucy's suitor, but as [[Mina Harker]]'s father (or sometimes Lucy's father). This was almost certainly based on the decision made in writing the [[Hamilton Deane]] [[Dracula (1924 play)|stage adaptation]]. Sometimes he is portrayed as just elderly doctor with no familial connections to other characters. Such portrayals include:\n\n* [[Gustav Botz]] (as Dr. Sievers) in ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922)\n* [[Herbert Bunston]] in ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931 film) - here he is father of Mina.\n* Jos\u00e9 Soriano Viosca in ''[[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'' (Spanish version, 1931) - here he is father of Eva (Mina in this version).\n* [[Charles Lloyd-Pack]] in ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' (1958)\n* [[Paul Muller (actor)|Paul Muller]] in ''[[Count Dracula (1970 film)|Count Dracula]]'' (1970)\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] in ''[[Dracula (1979 film)|Dracula]]'' (1979) - here he is father of Lucy.\n* [[Harvey Korman]] in ''[[Dracula: Dead and Loving It]]'' (1995) - here he is father of Mina.\n\nIn recent years, the trend has been to return Seward to his role in the novel, as a suitor for Lucy's hand in marriage, in:\n\n* [[James Maxwell (actor)|James Maxwell]] in ''[[Dracula (Mystery and Imagination)|Dracula]]'' (1968) - here he is Lucy\u2019s fianc\u00e9. He and Van Helsing team up and jointly defeat Dracula.\n* [[Mark Burns (actor)|Mark Burns]] in ''[[Count Dracula (1977)|Count Dracula]]'' (1977) - he is portrayed faithfully to his counterpart in the novel.\n* [[Richard E. Grant]] in ''[[Dracula (1992 film)|Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' (1992) - he is portrayed faithfully to his counterpart in the novel.\n* Matthew Johnson in ''[[Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary]]'' (2002)\n* [[Tom Burke (actor)|Tom Burke]] in ''[[Dracula (2006)|Dracula]]'' (2006)\n* [[Matthew Beard (English actor)|Matthew Beard]] in ''[[Dracula (2020 TV series)|Dracula]]'' (2020) - he is re-imagined as modern-day medical student, who has unrequired crush on Lucy.\n\n===On stage===\n* John Seward appears in [[Dracula, the Musical|''Dracula, the musical'']] by [[Frank Wildhorn]].

It has previously been treated as a separate family, '''Agavaceae'''.<ref name=\"Chase2009\"/> The group includes many well-known [[desert]] and dry-zone types, such as the [[agave|agaves]] and [[Yucca|yuccas]] (including the [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]]). About 640 [[species]] are placed in around 23 [[genus|genera]];<ref name=\"apw110525\"/> they are widespread in the tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions of the world.\n\n==Description and uses==\nSpecies may be [[Succulent plant|succulent]] or not. In general, Agavoideae leaves occur as rosettes at the end of a woody stem, which may range from extremely short to tree-like heights, as in the [[Joshua tree]].  The leaves are parallel-veined, and usually appear long and pointed, often with a hardened spine on the end, and sometimes with additional spines along the margins.\n\n''Agave'' species are used to make ''[[tequila]], [[pulque]],'' and ''[[mezcal]]'', while others are valued for their fibers.  They are quite popular for [[xeriscaping]], as many have showy flowers.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nThe taxonomy of the group has varied widely. In the [[APG III system]] of 2009, adopted here, the Agavoideae are defined very broadly to include the former family Agavaceae along with other formerly separate families such as Anemarrhenaceae, Chlorogalaceae, Hostaceae, Yuccaceae, Anthericaceae, Hesperocallidaceae, and Chlorogalaceae, based on data from [[molecular systematics]].<ref name=\"apgiii\"/> Stevens comments that \"The broad concept of Agavoideae [...] may not seem very satisfactory\" but that none of the alternatives is better.<ref name=\"apw110525\"/> Sources prior to 2009 will still have Agavaceae (in varying circumscriptions) as a separate family and may contain varying numbers of other families included in the Agavoideae in the APG III system.\n\nSome genera formerly placed in this group (under whatever name) have been separated off; e.g. ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'', which superficially resembles some species of ''[[Agave]]'', is currently placed in the subfamily [[Nolinoideae]].<ref name=\"Chase2009\"/>\n\n==Genera==\nA partial list of the genera included in the Agavoideae is given below. The reference is to the source that places the genus in this subfamily. As noted above, the genera currently included here have varied widely in their limits and assignment to families and subfamilies; some former family placements other than Agavaceae are found in the literature are given below.<ref name=\"apw110525\"/><ref name=\"vpfg\"/>\n\n{| border=0\n|'''Genus'''||'''Former family placement(s) outside Agavaceae/Agavoideae'''\n<!--*** If you change this list, please change the list at the Asparagaceae article so they remain consistent ***-->\n|-\n|''[[Agave]]'' <small>L.</small> <ref name=Chase2009/>||\n|-\n|''[[Anemarrhena]]'' <small>Bunge</small> <ref name=Chase2009/>||Anemarrhenaceae\n|-\n|''[[Anthericum]]'' <small>L.</small> <ref name=Chase2009/>||Anthericaceae\n|-\n|''[[Behnia]]'' <small>Didr.</small> <ref name=Chase2009/>||Behniaceae, Philesiaceae\n|-\n|''[[Beschorneria]]'' <small>Kunth</small> <ref name=Chase2009/>||\n|-\n|''[[Camassia]]'' <small>Lindl.</small> <ref name=Chase2009/>||Chlorogalaceae, Hyacinthaceae\n|-\n|''[[Chlorogalum]]'' <small>(Lindl.)

It has previously been treated as a separate family, '''Agavaceae'''.<ref name=\"Chase2009\"/> The group includes many well-known [[desert]] and dry-zone types, such as the [[agave|agaves]] and [[Yucca|yuccas]] (including the [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]]). About 640 [[species]] are placed in around 23 [[genus|genera]];<ref name=\"apw110525\"/> they are widespread in the tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate regions of the world.\n\n==Description and uses==\nSpecies may be [[Succulent plant|succulent]] or not. In general, Agavoideae leaves occur as rosettes at the end of a woody stem, which may range from extremely short to tree-like heights, as in the Joshua tree.  The leaves are parallel-veined, and usually appear long and pointed, often with a hardened spine on the end, and sometimes with additional spines along the margins.\n\n''Agave'' species are used to make ''[[tequila]], [[pulque]],'' and ''[[mezcal]]'', while others are valued for their fibers.  They are quite popular for [[xeriscaping]], as many have showy flowers.\n\n==Systematics==\n\nThe taxonomy of the group has varied widely. In the [[APG III system]] of 2009, adopted here, the Agavoideae are defined very broadly to include the former family Agavaceae along with other formerly separate families such as Anemarrhenaceae, Chlorogalaceae, Hostaceae, Yuccaceae, Anthericaceae, Hesperocallidaceae, and Chlorogalaceae, based on data from [[molecular systematics]].<ref name=\"apgiii\"/> Stevens comments that \"The broad concept of Agavoideae [...] may not seem very satisfactory\" but that none of the alternatives is better.<ref name=\"apw110525\"/> Sources prior to 2009 will still have Agavaceae (in varying circumscriptions) as a separate family and may contain varying numbers of other families included in the Agavoideae in the APG III system.\n\nSome genera formerly placed in this group (under whatever name) have been separated off; e.g. ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'', which superficially resembles some species of ''[[Agave]]'', is currently placed in the subfamily [[Nolinoideae]].<ref name=\"Chase2009\"/>\n\n==Genera==\nA partial list of the genera included in the Agavoideae is given below.
