The fictional series focuses on the lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns,]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and [[attending physician|attending doctor]]s, as they develop into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is an allusion to ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by [[Henry Gray]]. [[Shonda Rhimes]] developed the pilot and continues to write for the series; she is also one of the executive producers, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the series is set in [[Seattle]] (at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, later renamed), it is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThe series is designed to be racially diverse and uses [[color-blind casting]]. It revolves around the title character, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]], played by [[Ellen Pompeo]], first featured as an intern. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes through the series' run, with many members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|others]]. At the start of [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|sixteenth season]], the show had a large ensemble of fourteen actors, including four characters from the original cast (Meredith Grey, Alex Karev, Miranda Bailey, and Richard Webber), with Justin Chambers leaving the show during the season.\n\n''Grey's Anatomy'' was renewed for a [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|sixteenth season]] which premiered on September 26, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/greys-anatomy-season-16-release-date-trailer-episodes/|title='Grey's Anatomy' season 16 premiere date, trailer, episode guide and more|date=2019-10-11|website=Hypable|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> The series' success catapulted such long-running cast members as Pompeo, Dempsey and Oh to worldwide recognition; they were among the top five highest-earning television actors in 2013.<ref name=\"bustle2013\">{{cite web|title=How Much Does The 'Grey's Anatomy' Cast Make?

Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. ''Grey's Anatomy'' then concluded its 10th season and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. The eleventh season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pearce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Altman returns to Seattle at the beginning of the 14th season while Robbins and Kepner depart at the season's end to pursue other career opportunities.

The fictional series focuses on the lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns,]] [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and [[attending physician|attending doctor]]s, as they develop into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is an allusion to ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by [[Henry Gray]]. [[Shonda Rhimes]] developed the pilot and continues to write for the series; she's also one of the executive producers, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the series is set in [[Seattle]] (at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, later renamed), it is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThe series is designed to be racially diverse and uses [[color-blind casting]]. It revolves around the title character, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]], played by [[Ellen Pompeo]], first featured as an intern. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes through the series' run, with many members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|others]].

Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. ''Grey's Anatomy'' then concluded its 10th season and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. The eleventh season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pearce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Altman returns to Seattle at the beginning of the 14th season while Robbins and Kepner depart at the season's end to pursue other career opportunities.

{"title_page": "Ziggy's", "text_new": "{{third-party|date=November 2015}}\n{{advert|date=August 2011}}\n'''Ziggy's''' was a live [[music venue]] and bar in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]]. The Baity Street venue closed after Thanksgiving in 2007. On August 5, 2011, Ziggy's reopened in Winston-Salem, in a 14,000 sq foot space on the corner of 8th and Trade St. in the Downtown Arts District. That venue closed down on February 21, 2016.\n\nA former residence, Ziggy's became one of the premier club venues in the [[Southern United States|South]]. A wide variety of bands were hosted, with styles including [[reggae]], [[rock (music)|rock]], [[blues]], [[hip-hop]], and [[Country music|country]].  Artists who have performed at Ziggy's include [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], [[Phish]], [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Keller Williams]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]], [[Andrew W.K.]], [[Perpetual Groove]], [[Steel Pulse]], [[Rusted Root]], [[Jump Little Children]], [[Ben Folds Five]], [[Vertical Horizon]], [[Hawthorne Heights]], [[Emery (band)|Emery]], [[Anberlin]], [[Mutemath]], [[Insane Clown Posse]], [[Twiztid]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Axe Murder Boyz]], [[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]], [[Mat Kearney]], [[Turbonegro]] and [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]]. In February, 2003, [[Great White (band)|Great White]] played with their full pyrotechnic stage show mere days before the same effects would ignite the deadly fire that killed over 100 people at [[The Station nightclub fire|The Station]] nightclub in [[West Warwick, Rhode Island|West Warwick]], [[Rhode Island]]. In December 2004, [[Athenaeum (band)|Athenaeum]] played their final show on Ziggy's stage. Many great Misfit shows, Megadeath, Drain STH, and Danzig performed in the early years at the older location.\n\n== History ==\nZiggy's was rumored to have been founded by [[Ziggy Marley]], though it was actually named after [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] alumnus John 'Ziggy' Ziglinski after a stint as The White Horse Tavern in the early 1970s.<ref>Triad Business News 8/16/06</ref> To augment the rumor, there has been an urban legend that [[Ziggy Marley]] helped to keep the venue open with a generous monetary donation in the early 90s.  Mr. Marley has regularly performed at the venue, openly praising and identifying with the \"Roots - Rock - Reggae\" philosophy displayed on the seven-foot square Ziggy's logo at the rear of the main stage.

Mr. Marley has regularly performed at the venue, openly praising and identifying with the \"Roots - Rock - Reggae\" philosophy displayed on the seven-foot square Ziggy's logo at the rear of the main stage.  Most of the staff maintained a tongue-in-cheek belief that the large tabby that called the venue home was the club's namesake, rather than the other way around.
