Sellier, Jr.]], and starring Robert Brian Wilson, [[Lilyan Chauvin]], [[Gilmer McCormick]], Toni Nero, [[Linnea Quigley]], [[Britt Leach]], and Leo Geter. The story concerns a young man named Billy, who suffers from posttraumatic stress over witnessing his parents' murder on [[Christmas Eve]] and his subsequent upbringing in an abusive [[Catholic]] orphanage. In adulthood, the Christmas holiday leads him into a psychological breakdown, and he emerges as a spree killer donning a [[Santa suit]].\n\nThe film was released by [[TriStar Pictures]] on November 9, 1984, where it received substantial controversy over its promotional material and content, which featured a killer Santa Claus. In addition to receiving negative reviews, it was pulled out of theaters a week after its release. While successful during its opening week, the film ultimately grossed $2.5 million. Since its release, it has developed a [[cult following]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/493459/so-bad-its-good-its-christmas-time-and-garbage-day-in-silent-night-deadly-night-part-2|title=Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2: So Bad It's Good |publisher=Flavorwire|accessdate=December 18, 2015}}</ref> and spawned a [[Silent Night, Deadly Night (franchise)|series]], consisting of four sequels, with the fourth and fifth installments having no connection to the original film, as well as a [[Silent Night (2012 film)|loose remake]] in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2019}}\nIn 1971, five-year-old [[Billy Chapman (Silent Night, Deadly Night)|Billy Chapman]] and his family go to visit a nursing home where his catatonic grandfather stays; when Billy remains alone with him for a few minutes, his grandfather suddenly awakens and tells Billy to fear [[Santa Claus]], as he gives presents only to the children who have been good all year, and punishes the ones who have been naughty, no matter how briefly. While driving back, a man dressed in a Santa outfit seemingly has car trouble and gets Billy's family's attention to pull over and help. As they pull over, the Santa-clad criminal shoots the father with a [[pistol]] and forcibly removes the mother and slashes her throat with a switchblade in front of Billy and his baby brother Ricky. Billy runs off to hide, leaving Ricky in the car.\n\nThree years later in 1974, Billy and Ricky are celebrating [[Christmas]] in an [[orphanage]] run by [[Abbess|Mother Superior]], a strict [[disciplinarian]] who persistently strikes children who misbehave and considers punishment to be a necessary and good thing. Sister Margaret, the only one who sympathizes with the children, tries to help Billy play with the other children, but Billy is constantly subject to Mother Superior's scrutinizing eyes and regularly punished. On Christmas morning, the orphanage invites a man in a Santa Claus suit to visit the children; Billy gets dragged by Mother Superior and he punches the man before fleeing to his room in horror.\n\n10 years later, in the spring of 1984, a now-adult Billy leaves the orphanage to find a normal life, and obtains a job as a stock boy at a local [[toy store]], thanks to Sister Margaret. At the store, he develops a crush on his co-worker Pamela; he has sexual thoughts regarding her which are often interrupted by morbid visions of his parents' murders. On [[Christmas Eve]], the employee who plays the store's Santa Claus has been injured the night before and as a result Billy's boss Mr. Sims makes him take his place. After the store closes, the staff has a Christmas Eve party. Billy (still dressed in a Santa Claus suit) tries to have a good time at the party, but he keeps having memories of his parents' murders, causing him to feel depressed. At one point, he sees his co-worker Andy making out with Pamela and they both walk into the back room. Billy walks after them and sees Andy trying to rape Pamela. This finally, psychologically, triggers his insanity; he hangs Andy with a string of Christmas lights and stabs Pamela with a utility knife, uttering darkly that punishment is good. \n\nA highly intoxicated Mr. Sims goes into the back room to check on the noises he heard. Just when he is about to leave, Billy murders him with a hammer. Billy turns off the store's lights, causing his manager, Mrs. Randall, to go check out the back room. She screams at the sight of Mr. Sims' corpse and tries to call police, but Billy cuts the phone line using a double-bit axe, causing her to run and hide. Billy walks around the store trying to find her and, at one point, Mrs. Randall jumps out and trips Billy, stealing his axe. Before she can escape, Billy shoots and kills her with a bow and arrow.\n\nAs Sister Margaret discovers the carnage and returns to the orphanage to seek help via telephone, Billy breaks into a nearby house where a young couple named Denise and Tommy are having sex and a little girl named Cindy is sleeping; Billy then impales Denise on a set of deer antlers and throws Tommy through a window. When this awakens Cindy, Billy then confronts her and asks her if she has been nice or naughty; she says she has been nice, and he gives her the utility knife he had used earlier. After this, he witnesses bullies picking on two sledding teenage boys and decapitates one of the bullies with his axe as the other screams in horror.\n\nThe next morning, the orphanage is secured with Officer Barnes and Captain Richards aided by Sister Margaret, who knows that Billy has committed the murders. The deaf pastor, Father O'Brien, who was dressed in a Santa outfit, is mistakenly shot by Barnes upon coming forward, mistaking him to be Billy. Barnes is then axed by Billy while distracted. Due to his Santa outfit, Billy gains access into the orphanage and confronts Mother Superior, now in a wheelchair. She taunts Billy due to her disbelief in Santa Claus and just as he prepares to kill her with his axe, Richards appears and shoots him in the back, much to Sister Margaret's shock. As the dying Billy lays on the ground, he utters to the nearby children \"You're safe now, Santa Claus is gone.\" before succumbing to his wounds. As the children gather around, Ricky, coldly staring at Mother Superior, utters \"Naughty\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Robert Brian Wilson as [[Billy Chapman (Silent Night, Deadly Night)|Billy Chapman]] (age 18)\n** Danny Wagner as eight-year-old Billy\n** Jonathan Best as five-year-old Billy\n*Alex Burton as Ricky Chapman at 14\n**Max Broadhead as four-year-old Ricky\n**Melissa Best as infant Ricky\n* [[Lilyan Chauvin]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Gilmer McCormick]] as Sister Margaret\n* Toni Nero as Pamela\n* [[Britt Leach]] as Mr. Sims\n* [[Nancy Borgenicht]] as Mrs. Randall\n* H.E.D.

As they pull over, the Santa-clad criminal shoots the father with a [[pistol]] and forcibly removes the mother and slashes her throat with a switchblade in front of Billy and his baby brother Ricky. Billy runs off to hide, leaving Ricky in the car.\n\nThree years later in 1974, Billy and Ricky are celebrating [[Christmas]] in an [[orphanage]] run by [[Abbess|Mother Superior]], a strict [[disciplinarian]] who persistently strikes children who misbehave and considers punishment to be a necessary and good thing. Sister Margaret, the only one who sympathizes with the children, tries to help Billy play with the other children, but Billy is constantly subject to Mother Superior's scrutinizing eyes and regularly punished. On Christmas morning, the orphanage invites a man in a Santa Claus suit to visit the children; Billy gets dragged by Mother Superior and he punches the man before fleeing to his room in horror.\n\n10 years later, in the spring of 1984, a now-adult Billy leaves the orphanage to find a normal life, and obtains a job as a stock boy at a local [[toy store]], thanks to Sister Margaret. At the store, he develops a crush on his co-worker Pamela; he has sexual thoughts regarding her which are often interrupted by morbid visions of his parents' murders. On [[Christmas Eve]], the employee who plays the store's Santa Claus has been injured the night before and as a result Billy's boss Mr. Sims makes him take his place. After the store closes, the staff has a Christmas Eve party. Billy (still dressed in a Santa Claus suit) tries to have a good time at the party, but he keeps having memories of his parents' murders, causing him to feel depressed. At one point, he sees his co-worker Andy making out with Pamela and they both walk into the back room. Billy walks after them and sees Andy trying to rape Pamela. This finally, psychologically, triggers his insanity; he hangs Andy with a string of Christmas lights and stabs Pamela with a utility knife, uttering darkly that punishment is good. \n\nA highly intoxicated Mr. Sims goes into the back room to check on the noises he heard. Just when he is about to leave, Billy murders him with a hammer. Billy turns off the store's lights, causing his manager, Mrs. Randall, to go check out the back room. She screams at the sight of Mr. Sims' corpse and tries to call police, but Billy cuts the phone line using a double-bit axe, causing her to run and hide. Billy walks around the store trying to find her and, at one point, Mrs. Randall jumps out and trips Billy, stealing his axe. Before she can escape, Billy shoots and kills her with a bow and arrow.\n\nAs Sister Margaret discovers the carnage and returns to the orphanage to seek help via telephone, Billy breaks into a nearby house where a young couple named Denise and Tommy are having sex and a little girl named Cindy is sleeping; Billy then impales Denise on a set of deer antlers and throws Tommy through a window. When this awakens Cindy, Billy then confronts her and asks her if she has been nice or naughty; she says she has been nice, and he gives her the utility knife he had used earlier. After this, he witnesses bullies picking on two sledding teenage boys and decapitates one of the bullies with his axe as the other screams in horror.\n\nThe next morning, the orphanage is secured with Officer Barnes and Captain Richards aided by Sister Margaret, who knows that Billy has committed the murders. The deaf pastor, Father O'Brien, who was dressed in a Santa outfit, is mistakenly shot by Barnes upon coming forward, mistaking him to be Billy. Barnes is then axed by Billy while distracted. Due to his Santa outfit, Billy gains access into the orphanage and confronts Mother Superior, now in a wheelchair. She taunts Billy due to her disbelief in Santa Claus and just as he prepares to kill her with his axe, Richards appears and shoots him in the back, much to Sister Margaret's shock. As the dying Billy lays on the ground, he utters to the nearby children \"You're safe now, Santa Claus is gone.\" before succumbing to his wounds. As the children gather around, Ricky, coldly staring at Mother Superior, utters \"Naughty\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Robert Brian Wilson as [[Billy Chapman (Silent Night, Deadly Night)|Billy Chapman]] (age 18)\n** Danny Wagner as eight-year-old Billy\n** Jonathan Best as five-year-old Billy\n*Alex Burton as Ricky Chapman at 14\n**Max Broadhead as four-year-old Ricky\n**Melissa Best as infant Ricky\n* [[Lilyan Chauvin]] as Mother Superior\n* [[Gilmer McCormick]] as Sister Margaret\n* Toni Nero as Pamela\n* [[Britt Leach]] as Mr. Sims\n* [[Nancy Borgenicht]] as Mrs. Randall\n* H.E.D.

Plantains are most often used, but other starchy roots native to the island used by Ta\u00ednos can also be used.

Spanish ingredients such as pork, garlic, broth, and olive oil are commonly used together in [[Puerto Rican cuisine]] and are found in staple dishes such as [[arroz con gandules]], [[alcapurria]], [[pasteles]], habichuelas, [[reca\u00edto]], [[arroz junto]], among others. The method of frying comes from the African side and is heavily used more than anyplace in the Caribbean. Broth is often made with chicken and [[sofrito]]. Sofrito is made with Spanish and Ta\u00edno fruits, vegetables, and herbs.\n\n==Method==\n[[Image:Pilon para mofongo 2011.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A pil\u00f3n to make mofongo]]\nPlantains and/or starchy roots are cut about half an inch thick and deep-fried.

Broth, olive oil, garlic, and pork cracklings are added and mashed as well. The consistency of mofongo is much more stiff than fufu. In Africa, fufu is accompanied by a bowl of soup. In Puerto Rico, traditionally mofongo is accompanied by chicken broth soup, but braised meat has become more popular.\n\n==Variations==\nIt is also common in Puerto Rico to make mofongo with [[cassava]] (''mofongo de yuca''), [[taro]] and [[eddoe]] (''mofongo de malanga y yaut\u00eda''), [[bread fruit]] (''mofongo de pana''), or a combination of cassava, ripe and green plantains (''trifongo''), ripe and unripe plantains (''Bifongo or mofongo de amarillo'').\n\n[[Thanksgiving]] is an American holiday that has been adopted by Puerto Rico. [[Turkey_(bird)|Turkey]] is the main focus on every thanksgiving table and is traditional stuffed with bread. The traditional bread stuffing is replaced with ''mofongo'', ''mofongo de yuca'' or ''mofongo de batata''  (plantain and sweet potato mofongo) in Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans homes outside the [[commonwealth]].  Turkey stuffed with Mofongo can be prepared with seasonings that are traditionally used for pork (garlic, black pepper, oregano, citrus, vinegar and annatto seeds), in which case it can be called \"Pavochon.\"\n\n[[Frito-Lay]] produces ''MoFongo Snax'', a combined plantain chips, cassava chips and pork rinds into one bag.\n\n''Mofongo relleno'' is a stuffed variation of mofongo, which, according to Yvonne Ortiz, was first made in \"Tino's Restaurant on the west coast of Puerto Rico\" when seafood, abundant in the region, was placed inside the plantain ball with [[braised]] meat or more seafood poured over it.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZopjAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT115|title=A Taste of Puerto Rico: Traditional and New Dishes from the Puerto Rican Community|last=Ortiz|first=Yvonne|publisher=Plume|year=1997|isbn=0452275482|location=|pages=}}</ref> Nowadays, ''mofongo relleno'' is commonly stuffed with either seafood, poultry, or another meat.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Moon San Juan, Vieques & Culebra| last = Van Atten| first = Suzanne| publisher = Avalon Travel| year = 2015| isbn = 978-1631212284| location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-gsrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT340}}</ref>\n\nMofongo stuffed with shrimp (camar\u00f3n in Spanish) is called ''camarofongo''.\n\n==Mofongo outside of Puerto Rico==\n[[File:Puerto Rico, U.S.A. plantains.jpg|thumb|left|300px|\"Puerto Rican matzoh ball\"? From a US booklet promoting tourism, ''Puerto Rico, U.S.A.'']]\n\nDuring the 1960s many Dominicans who feared the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]] fled to Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo caught on quickly with Dominicans living in Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo has become a flagship food for many Dominican restaurants. \n\n[[Bol\u00f3n de verde]] is a similar dish in [[Ecuador]]. The dish appears much later in Ecuadorian cuisine. Plantains are boiled, mashed with chicarr\u00f3n and cheese ([[queso blanco]]) formed into balls and fried. \n\nMofongo is popular in [[New Jersey]], [[Chicago]], [[Florida]], and anywhere large numbers of Puerto Ricans or Dominicans reside.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Debate==\nAround early 2000s Dominicans have been claiming mofongo as theirs and not an import from Puerto Rico.\n\nClara Gonzalez, also known as Aunt Clara, is a Dominican chef and author. In her cookbook (Tradition Dominican cookery) claims that mofongo has a special place in the Dominicans' hearts and stomachs but can be traced back to Puerto Rico. Ramona Hernandez, director of the Dominican Studies Institute of the City University of New York, has been interviewed for many magazines on Dominican food and culture, she also says \"mofongo is a dish borrowed from Puerto Rico that has much success with Dominicans\".\n\nBoth countries, along with Cuba, share much in food, language, music and traditions. Cuban singer [[Celia Cruz]] sang a [[Merengue music|merengue]] titled \"Pun pun catalu\" about the similarly among the three islands. She mentions how mashed plantains with chicarr\u00f3n is fuf\u00fa in her native Cuba, mang\u00fa in [[Quisqueya, Dominican Republic|Quisqueya]] (Dominican Republic) and mofongo in [[Boriken]] (Puerto Rico).\n\n[[Mun2]] television network aired a show titled \"Where does mofongo come from? Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic?\" The two hosts went around the streets of New York City asking Latin communities \"where does mofongo come from?\" They found that the dish has its roots in African cooking but originated in Puerto Rico.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n[[Food Network]] chef and host [[Guy Fieri]] featured mofongo from Benny's Seafood (in [[Miami, Florida]]) and from El Bohio (in [[San Antonio, Texas]]) on two separate episodes of his show ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]''. He liked the dish so much that he called it the \"best fried thing I ever ate\" on an episode of the show ''[[The Best Thing I Ever Ate]]''.<ref>[http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/guy-fieri-on-mofongo-video/40527.html Video: Guy Fieri on Mofongo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125232914/http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/guy-fieri-on-mofongo-video/40527.html |date=2011-11-25 }} on [[Food Network]]</ref>\n\n[[Anne Burrell]] is featured in a Season 2 episode of ''Chef Wanted'' with mofongo as the opening dish challenge.\n\nMofongo is also featured in Episode 7, Season 6 of the [[Food Network]] show, [http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/beat-bobby-flay.html Beat Bobby Flay], where Bobby Flay's mofongo dish prevails over a mofongo dish prepared by Puerto Rican chef [[Giovanna Huyke]].\n\nAn episode of the [[Travel Channel]]'s ''[[Man v. Food Nation]]'', set in [[Harlem]], showed the host [[Adam Richman (actor)|Adam Richman]] visiting a [[Spanish Harlem]] restaurant called La Fonda Boricua, where they make a giant 12-plantain mofongo called the ''Mofongaso''.\n\nPerhaps the oldest song mentioning mofongo is called ''Puertorrique\u00f1o'' by [[Joe Valle]] and [[C\u00e9sar Concepci\u00f3n]].\n\nSinger [[Ismael Rivera]] with conductor [[Rafael Cortijo]] sang a [[plena]] song called \"Mofongo Pelao\" about mofongo.\n\n''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]]'' featured mofongo in Season 2, Episode 2: Puerto Rico where Bourdain and his friend Andy Diaz dine on mofongo at the beach. \"That is just a tower of goodness,\" Bourdain says.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Puerto Rico]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.recetaspuertorico.com/?p=3012 Mofongo with Pork Rind & Bacon] [Spanish]\n* [http://www.dominicancooking.com/246-mofongo-garlic-flavored-mashed-plantains.html Mofongo recipe 2]\n* [http://www.elboricua.com/mofongo.html Mofongo recipe]\n* [http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/puerto-rican-prawns-with-lobster-yucca-mofongo-and-sofrito-broth-recipe.html Mofongo de Yuca]\n* [http://www.ricanrecipes.com/recipes/detail.php?category_id=15&id=169 Mofongo de Pana (Breadfruit)]\n\n[[Category:Puerto Rican cuisine]]\n[[Category:Caribbean cuisine]]\n[[Category:Latin American cuisine]]\n[[Category:Plantain dishes]]\n[[Category:Puerto Rican fusion cuisine]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Caribbean islands  traditional dish}}\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Mofongo\n| image            = [[File:Mofongo.jpg|277px|Mofongo]]\n| caption          = Mofongo\n| country          = [[Puerto Rico]] \n| creator\n| course           = Main course\n| served           = Hot\n| main_ingredient  = [[cooking plantain|Plantains]], [[chicharr\u00f3n]], olive oil, and garlic\n| variations       = [[Fufu]], [[Tacacho]], [[Cayeye]], [[Mang\u00fa]]\n| other            = Popular throughout:<br />[[Puerto Rico]]<br />[[Dominican Republic]]<br/>[[Cuba]]<br />[[Florida]]<br />[[New York City]]<br/>[[Boston]]\n}}\n'''Mofongo''' ({{IPA-es|mo\u02c8fo\u014b\u0261o}}) is a [[Puerto Rican]] dish with [[frying|fried]] [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]] as its main ingredient.<ref name=\"Torres 2006 p. \">{{cite book | last=Torres | first=A. | title=Latinos in New England | publisher=Temple University Press | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-59213-418-2 | url=https://archive.org/details/latinosinnewengl00andr | url-access=registration | language=es | access-date=12 November 2019 | page=[https://archive.org/details/latinosinnewengl00andr/page/106 106]}}</ref> Plantains are picked green and fried, then mashed with salt, garlic, broth, and olive oil in a wooden pil\u00f3n ([[mortar and pestle]]).<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-01-19/lifestyle/0501190076_1_plantains-puerto-rico-mixture| title = Gusto! ; Plantains Carry Deep Roots of Tradition in Mofongo| last = Carballo| first = Viviana| date = January 19, 2005| work = Special to the Sentinel| access-date = December 16, 2015| via = | publisher = Orlando Sentinel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = Plantain Hybrids: Fresh Market and Processing Characteristics| last = Cordero Malav\u00e9|first = Deborah|publisher = University of Puerto Rico , Mayaguez Campus|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Mayaguez, PR|pages = 9, 41|url = https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_q6VhhkczIYS2x2U2lUV0tMWUU}}</ref>  The goal is to produce a tight ball of mashed plantains that will absorb the attending condiments and have either [[Pork rind|pork cracklings]] (''[[chicharr\u00f3n]]'') or bits of [[bacon]] inside.

Turkey stuffed with Mofongo can be prepared with seasonings that are traditionally used for pork (garlic, black pepper, oregano, citrus, vinegar and annatto seeds), in which case it can be called \"Pavochon.\"\n\n[[Frito-Lay]] produces ''MoFongo Snax'', a combined plantain chips, cassava chips and pork rinds into one bag.\n\n''Mofongo relleno'' is a stuffed variation of mofongo, which, according to Yvonne Ortiz, was first made in \"Tino's Restaurant on the west coast of Puerto Rico\" when seafood, abundant in the region, was placed inside the plantain ball with [[braised]] meat or more seafood poured over it.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZopjAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT115|title=A Taste of Puerto Rico: Traditional and New Dishes from the Puerto Rican Community|last=Ortiz|first=Yvonne|publisher=Plume|year=1997|isbn=0452275482|location=|pages=}}</ref> Nowadays, ''mofongo relleno'' is commonly stuffed with either seafood, poultry, or another meat.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Moon San Juan, Vieques & Culebra| last = Van Atten| first = Suzanne| publisher = Avalon Travel| year = 2015| isbn = 978-1631212284| location = | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-gsrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT340}}</ref>\n\nMofongo stuffed with shrimp (camar\u00f3n in Spanish) is called ''camarofongo''.\n\n==Mofongo outside of Puerto Rico==\n[[File:Puerto Rico, U.S.A. plantains.jpg|thumb|left|300px|\"Puerto Rican matzoh ball\"? From a US booklet promoting tourism, ''Puerto Rico, U.S.A.'']]\n\nDuring the 1960s many Dominicans who feared the dictatorship of [[Rafael Trujillo]] fled to Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo caught on quickly with Dominicans living in Puerto Rico and New York City. Mofongo has become a flagship food for many Dominican restaurants. \n\n[[Bol\u00f3n de verde]] is a similar dish in [[Ecuador]]. The dish appears much later in Ecuadorian cuisine. Plantains are boiled, mashed with chicarr\u00f3n and cheese ([[queso blanco]]) formed into balls and fried. \n\nMofongo is popular in [[New Jersey]], [[Chicago]], [[Florida]], and anywhere large numbers of Puerto Ricans or Dominicans reside.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Debate==\nAround early 2000s Dominicans have been claiming mofongo as theirs and not an import from Puerto Rico.\n\nClara Gonzalez, also known as Aunt Clara, is a Dominican chef and author. In her cookbook (Tradition Dominican cookery) claims that mofongo has a special place in the Dominicans' hearts and stomachs but can be traced back to Puerto Rico. Ramona Hernandez, director of the Dominican Studies Institute of the City University of New York, has been interviewed for many magazines on Dominican food and culture, she also says \"mofongo is a dish borrowed from Puerto Rico that has much success with Dominicans\".\n\nBoth countries, along with Cuba, share much in food, language, music and traditions. Cuban singer [[Celia Cruz]] sang a [[Merengue music|merengue]] titled \"Pun pun catalu\" about the similarly among the three islands. She mentions how mashed plantains with chicarr\u00f3n is fuf\u00fa in her native Cuba, mang\u00fa in [[Quisqueya, Dominican Republic|Quisqueya]] (Dominican Republic) and mofongo in [[Boriken]] (Puerto Rico).\n\n[[Mun2]] television network aired a show titled \"Where does mofongo come from? Puerto Rico or Dominican Republic?\" The two hosts went around the streets of New York City asking Latin communities \"where does mofongo come from?\" They found that the dish has its roots in African cooking but originated in Puerto Rico.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n[[Food Network]] chef and host [[Guy Fieri]] featured mofongo from Benny's Seafood (in [[Miami, Florida]]) and from El Bohio (in [[San Antonio, Texas]]) on two separate episodes of his show ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]''. He liked the dish so much that he called it the \"best fried thing I ever ate\" on an episode of the show ''[[The Best Thing I Ever Ate]]''.<ref>[http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/guy-fieri-on-mofongo-video/40527.html Video: Guy Fieri on Mofongo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125232914/http://www.foodnetwork.com/videos/guy-fieri-on-mofongo-video/40527.html |date=2011-11-25 }} on [[Food Network]]</ref>\n\n[[Anne Burrell]] is featured in a Season 2 episode of ''Chef Wanted'' with mofongo as the opening dish challenge.\n\nMofongo is also featured in Episode 7, Season 6 of the [[Food Network]] show, [http://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/beat-bobby-flay.html Beat Bobby Flay], where Bobby Flay's mofongo dish prevails over a mofongo dish prepared by Puerto Rican chef [[Giovanna Huyke]].\n\nAn episode of the [[Travel Channel]]'s ''[[Man v.

{"title_page": "Scoring (cricket)", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:This is scoring.OGG|right|thumb|300px|How runs are scored and teams win a match]]\n'''Scoring''' in [[cricket]] matches involves two elements \u2013 the number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored and the number of [[wicket (cricket)|wickets]] lost by each team. The '''scorer''' is someone appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s bowled. In professional games, in compliance with the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', two scorers are appointed, most often one provided by each team.\n\nThe scorers have no say in whether runs or extras are scored, wickets taken or overs bowled.  This is the job of the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]]s on the field of play, who signal to the scorers in cases of ambiguity such as when runs are to be given as extras rather than credited to the batsmen, or when the batsman is to be awarded a boundary 4 or 6. So that the umpire knows that they have seen each signal, the scorers are required to immediately acknowledge it.\n\nWhile it is possible to keep score using a pencil and plain paper, scorers often use pre-printed scoring books, and these are commercially available in many different styles.  Simple score books allow the recording of each [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman's]] runs, their scores and mode of dismissal, the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowlers']] analyses, the team score and the score at the fall of each wicket.  More sophisticated score books allow for the recording of more detail, and other statistics such as the number of balls faced by each batsman.  Scorers also sometimes produce their own scoring sheets to suit their techniques, and some use coloured pens to highlight events such as wickets, or differentiate the actions of different batsmen or bowlers.  It is often possible to tell from a modern scorecard the time at which everything occurred, who bowled each delivery, which batsman faced it, whether the batsman left the ball or played and missed, or which direction the batsman hit the ball and whether runs were scored.  Sometimes details of occurrences between deliveries, or incidental details like the weather, are recorded.\n\nIn early times runs scored were sometimes simply recorded by carving notches on a stick{{snd}}this root of the use of the slang term \"notches\" for \"runs\".  In contrast, scoring in the modern game has become a specialism, particularly for international and national cricket competitions.  While the scorers' role is clearly defined under the ''Laws of Cricket'' to be merely the recording of runs, wickets and overs, and the constant checking of the accuracy of their records with each other and with the umpires, in practice a modern scorer's role is complicated by other requirements. For instance, cricket authorities often require information about matters such as the rate at which teams bowled their overs. The media also ask to be notified of records, statistics and averages. For many important matches, unofficial scorers keep tally for the broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists allowing the official scorers to concentrate undisturbed.  In the English county game, the scorers also keep score on a computer that updates a central server, to meet the demands of the online press that scores should be as up-to-date as possible.\n\nThe official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these may be corrected after the event.\n\nSome cricket statisticians who keep score unofficially for the printed and broadcast media have become quite famous, for instance [[Bill Frindall]], who scored for the [[BBC]] radio commentary team from 1966 to 2008, and [[Jo King]].\n\nThe [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]'s [[Association of Cricket Officials]] provides training for scorers.<ref>[https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/78963 ECB ACO] Education \u2013 scorer courses (\"Scorers Count\")</ref>\n\n==Methods of scoring==\n[[Image:Cricketscoredcard1b.png|right|300px|thumb|An example of a scorecard]]\nThere are predominantly two methods that scorers use to record a game: manually and computerised.\n\nThe manual method uses a scorecard and a pen. The scorecard is colloquially known as The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track the number of balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At the end of each over, the scorer may fill in an over analysis with the score at the end of the over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.\n\nMost software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events. Additional functions include being able to draw a line denoting where the ball went from the batting crease and where the ball pitched. This gives additional charts tracking bowling placement and shot selection which can then be used at the coaching level. This additional information, however, does not form part of the critical role of a scorer, which is to keep track of the score of the game. It has been known for scorers to use both methods in conjunction with one another, in case the computer goes down or runs out of battery.\n\nIn addition to PC software, mobile apps are being used. Most of the amateur tournaments use mobile apps on their smartphones because they are more convenient and free, which makes it perfect fit for amateur cricketers since they cannot afford to spend money on standalone and custom software. There are several cricket scoring apps<ref>[https://medium.com/cricheroes/6-live-scoring-apps-for-your-local-cricket-match-799df9d7b83f  Cricket Scoring Apps For Your Local Cricket Match]</ref> such as Total Cricket Scorer (TCS), a  comprehensive program favoured many scorers in the County Championship{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}} in England, CricHQ, CricHeroes, CricScores, CricksLab, CricClubs, Chauka etc.. TCS was bought out by CricHQ in late 2015.  Mobile apps allow amateur cricketers to keep their scores online, and also provide them with personalised statistics and graphs on their own mobile devices.\n\nThe ECB make free software available for cricket scoring both on PC and mobile devices from the PlayCricket website.\n\n==Referring to scores==\n[[File:Adelaide Scoreboard1206.jpg|thumb|right|The [[scoreboard]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]].]]\nThe score of a [[cricket]] team whose [[innings]] is in progress is given as the number of [[run (cricket)|run]]s they have scored \"''for''\" the number of [[wicket]]s their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of \"''one hundred for three''\", written 100\u20133 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100\u20133 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3\u2013100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of \"''three hundred all out''\", rather than \"''three hundred for ten''\"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team [[Declaration and forfeiture|declare]] their innings closed (in a [[First-class cricket|First-class]] match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275\u20137. A declaration is noted by appending a \"d\" or \"dec\" to the score (for example 300\u20138d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word \"declared\" appended (example: \"''300 for 8, declared''\").\n\nIn a two-innings match, the scores of each team for their two innings are always given separately rather than being totalled, and the current score is stated in terms of how many runs the batting team lead or trail by. An example of a score for a two-innings match in progress would be: Team A 240 & 300\u20137d, Team B 225 & 130\u20134. This indicates that Team A in their first innings scored 240 runs, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed, and Team B are currently 130 for 4 \u2013 in this scenario, Team B currently trail by 185 runs (and are said to be facing a ''target'' or ''run chase'' of 316, the score with which they would win the match). If a team has [[follow-on|followed on]] in its second innings, this is indicated by appending \"(f/o)\" to their score, e.g. Team A 513, Team B 145 & 254\u20137 (f/o).\n\nWhen a game is completed, there are standard ways of referring to the difference in scores between the two teams. For instance, if Team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136, then Team B, batting second, only scored 185, whether or not they go all out, it would be said that \"''Team A won by 69 runs''\" because they either bowled out the opposition or caused them to exhaust their overs (in a limited-overs match) when they were trailing by 69 runs. On the other hand, if team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136 but team B, batting second, scored 255\u20138, it would be said that \"''team B won by 2 wickets''\" because they reached their target with 2 wickets remaining. In a two-innings match, a team can win having only batted once (while the other team, batting twice, has not equalled the other team's score). For instance, team A score 160 all out, team B score 530 and declare, then team A score 230 all out. In this case it would be said that \"''team B won by an innings and 140 runs''\".\n\n==Winning scores==\nIn [[Limited overs cricket|limited over matches]] (one innings matches), the team that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs with the loss of 1 wicket (250\u20131), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251\u20139), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar situation if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.\n\nIn limited overs matches shortened by bad weather, the winning team is the one whose scoring is best according to the targets set by a rain rule, usually the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]]. The method used to set targets takes into account both the number of overs and the number of wickets lost.\n\nIn [[First-class cricket]] (two innings match), the team that scores more runs, having dismissed its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because there was not much time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316\u20139, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.\n\nThe terms ''draw'' and ''tie'', which are synonymous in many sports, have distinct meanings in cricket. A tie refers to a match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with exactly the same score. A draw refers to a two-innings match that does not reach a conclusion, usually through a lack of time and/or rain. A limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion due to rain is not considered a draw, but rather is said to have ''no result''.\nHowever, in the case of a tournament final, the match may be decided by an extra over, or awarded to the team with the most boundaries scored, or least wickets lost, or another method indicated by the rules of the tournament. This was the case in the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, awarded to England on most boundaries scored after a tie and an extra over (super over), after scores remained level.\n\n==Detailed scoring==\n{{see also|Scoring runs in cricket}}\nCricket scorers keep track of many other facts of the game. As a minimum a scorer would note:\n*For each ball, who bowled it and how many runs were scored from it, whether by the batsman with his bat ('off the bat') or [[byes]].\n*For each batsman, every scoring run made.\n*For each [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]], the kind of dismissal (e.g. [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] or [[run out]]), the bowler (in the case of a bowling, LBW, catch, wicket hit, or stumping), any other player involved (in the case of a catch, run out, or stumping), as well as the total the batting team reached at that point in the game ('the fall of wicket'). Example notations as seen on cricket scorecards:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latestcricketscore.com/|title=Latest Cricket Score |work=Latest Cricket Score| date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n:*''c ''fielder'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Caught]]\n:*''c & b ''bowler \u2013 Caught & bowled (the bowler was also the catching fielder)\n:*''b ''bowler \u2013 [[Bowled]]\n:*''lbw b ''bowler \u2013 [[Leg before wicket]]\n:*''st ''wicket-keeper'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Stumped]]\n:*''hit wicket'' ''b'' bowler - [[Hit wicket]]\n*For each bowler (his 'figures'), the number of overs bowled, the number of wickets taken, the number of runs conceded, and the number of [[maiden over]]s bowled.\n\nTraditionally, the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman, but not necessarily which batsman faced which ball.  Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by [[John Atkinson Pendlington]], [[Bill Ferguson (cricket scorer)|Bill Ferguson]] and [[Bill Frindall]], to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler.  Another early method of recording the number of balls faced and runs scored by each batsman off each bowler was devised by Australian scorer [[Johann Gottlieb Jackschon|J.G. Jackschon]] in the 1890s, using a separate memorandum alongside the main scoresheet.\n\nFrequently more detail is recorded, for instance, for a batsman, the number of balls faced and the number of minutes batted. Sometimes charts (known as '''wagon wheels''') are prepared showing to which part of the field each scoring shot by a batsman was made (revealing the batman's favourite places to hit the ball)<ref>[http://eye-cam.tumblr.com/post/125358292001/cricket-batting-wagon-wheels-various-sources Wagonwheel]</ref>\n\nTechnology such as [[Hawk-Eye]] allows for more detailed analysis of a bowler's performance. For instance the '''beehive''' chart shows where a bowler's balls arrived at a batsman (high, low, wide, on the off stump etc.), while the '''pitch map''' shows where the balls pitched (trending toward short, good, or full lengths). Both charts can also show the results of these balls (dots, runs, boundaries, or wickets)<ref>[http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/?page_id=1012 Hawk-eye innovations: beehive and pitch map]</ref>\n\n==Scoring notation==\n\nA cricket scorer will typically mark the score sheet with a dot for a legal delivery with no wicket taken or runs scored (hence the term \"a dot ball\") where conventional runs are taken the score sheet is marked with the number of runs taken on that delivery.\n\nSpecial notation is used in the case of extras.\n\n===Wides===\n\n\n[[File:Wides E.jpg|thumb|Cricket Scorers' wides notation]]\n\nThe conventional scoring notation for a wide is an equal cross (likened to the umpire standing with arms outstretched signalling a wide).\n\nIf the batsmen run byes on a wide ball or the ball runs to the boundary for 4, a dot is added in each corner for each bye that is run, typically top left, then top right, then bottom left and finally all 4 corners.\n\nIf the batsman hits the stumps with his bat, or the wicket-keeper stumps him, the batsman would be out and a \u2018W\u2019 is added to the WIDE \u2018cross\u2019 symbol. \n\nIf a batsman is run out while taking byes on a wide delivery then the number of completed runs are shown as dots and an 'R' is added in the corner for the incomplete run.\n\n===No-balls===\n\n[[File:No Balls.jpg|No-Balls]]\n\nThe conventional notation for a no-ball is a circle. If the batsman hits the ball and takes runs, then the runs are marked inside the circle. In practice it is easier to write down the number then encircle it. \n \nIf a no-ball delivery eludes the wicket keeper and the batsmen run byes or the ball runs to the boundary for 4 byes, each bye taken is marked with a dot inside the circle. Again it is easier to encircle the dots.\n\n===Byes===\n\nThe conventional notation for a single bye is a triangle with a horizontal edge at the base and a point at the top. If more than one bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n===Leg byes===\n\nThe conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted bye symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n==Scores and points==\nIn most one day competitions based on leagues, 2 points are awarded for a win and 0 for a loss, regardless of the margin of victory.\n\nIn [[County Championship]] matches league points are awarded to teams not only for winning (scoring more runs overall) or drawing a game, but also for the number of runs scored or wickets taken in the first innings of the match. These extra batting and bowling points can make a difference to who becomes the champions at the end of the season.\n\nIn a series of [[Test cricket|Test matches]], the winner is the team that wins the most matches. Test series can be drawn, with both sides having the same number of wins (since match draws are a distinct possibility with Test cricket; a series need not have all games on record coming to a decision). However, in [[the Ashes]] (the series played between England and Australia), the Ashes only change hands if the holder clearly loses; the Ashes remain with the current holder if the series is drawn.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n* [[Cricket statistics]]\n* [[Laws of cricket]]\n* [[Glossary of cricket terms]]\n* [[Association of Cricket Officials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* For a comprehensive guide to the laws and their interpretation, and for guidance to scorers: ''Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'' ([[Marylebone Cricket Club]]). {{ISBN|978-0-297-86641-1}}\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cricket umpiring]]\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n[[Category:Scoring (cricket)|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=July 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n[[File:This is scoring.OGG|right|thumb|300px|How runs are scored and teams win a match]]\n'''Scoring''' in [[cricket]] matches involves two elements \u2013 the number of [[run (cricket)|runs]] scored and the number of [[wicket (cricket)|wickets]] lost by each team. The '''scorer''' is someone appointed to record all runs scored, all wickets taken and, where appropriate, the number of [[over (cricket)|over]]s bowled. In professional games, in compliance with the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'', two scorers are appointed, most often one provided by each team.\n\nThe scorers have no say in whether runs or extras are scored, wickets taken or overs bowled.  This is the job of the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpire]]s on the field of play, who signal to the scorers in cases of ambiguity such as when runs are to be given as extras rather than credited to the batsmen, or when the batsman is to be awarded a boundary 4 or 6. So that the umpire knows that they have seen each signal, the scorers are required to immediately acknowledge it.\n\nWhile it is possible to keep score using a pencil and plain paper, scorers often use pre-printed scoring books, and these are commercially available in many different styles.  Simple score books allow the recording of each [[Batsman (cricket)|batsman's]] runs, their scores and mode of dismissal, the [[Bowler (cricket)|bowlers']] analyses, the team score and the score at the fall of each wicket.  More sophisticated score books allow for the recording of more detail, and other statistics such as the number of balls faced by each batsman.  Scorers also sometimes produce their own scoring sheets to suit their techniques, and some use coloured pens to highlight events such as wickets, or differentiate the actions of different batsmen or bowlers.  It is often possible to tell from a modern scorecard the time at which everything occurred, who bowled each delivery, which batsman faced it, whether the batsman left the ball or played and missed, or which direction the batsman hit the ball and whether runs were scored.  Sometimes details of occurrences between deliveries, or incidental details like the weather, are recorded.\n\nIn early times runs scored were sometimes simply recorded by carving notches on a stick{{snd}}this root of the use of the slang term \"notches\" for \"runs\".  In contrast, scoring in the modern game has become a specialism, particularly for international and national cricket competitions.  While the scorers' role is clearly defined under the ''Laws of Cricket'' to be merely the recording of runs, wickets and overs, and the constant checking of the accuracy of their records with each other and with the umpires, in practice a modern scorer's role is complicated by other requirements. For instance, cricket authorities often require information about matters such as the rate at which teams bowled their overs. The media also ask to be notified of records, statistics and averages. For many important matches, unofficial scorers keep tally for the broadcast commentators and newspaper journalists allowing the official scorers to concentrate undisturbed.  In the English county game, the scorers also keep score on a computer that updates a central server, to meet the demands of the online press that scores should be as up-to-date as possible.\n\nThe official scorers occasionally make mistakes, but unlike umpires' mistakes these may be corrected after the event.\n\nSome cricket statisticians who keep score unofficially for the printed and broadcast media have become quite famous, for instance [[Bill Frindall]], who scored for the [[BBC]] radio commentary team from 1966 to 2008, and [[Jo King]].\n\nThe [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]'s [[Association of Cricket Officials]] provides training for scorers.<ref>[https://www.ecb.co.uk/news/78963 ECB ACO] Education \u2013 scorer courses (\"Scorers Count\")</ref>\n\n==Methods of scoring==\n[[Image:Cricketscoredcard1b.png|right|300px|thumb|An example of a scorecard]]\nThere are predominantly two methods that scorers use to record a game: manually and computerised.\n\nThe manual method uses a scorecard and a pen. The scorecard is colloquially known as The Book. Using the book, the scorer fills out two main sections per ball, the bowling analysis and the batting analysis. Each section helps track the number of balls bowled in an over, any extras (such as Wide Balls and No Balls) and also any wickets (or dismissals). At the end of each over, the scorer may fill in an over analysis with the score at the end of the over, the number of wickets that have fallen, any penalties incurred and the number of the bowler in the analysis.\n\nMost software used for cricket scoring uses a form at the front end with buttons for the scorer to press to record ball by ball events. Additional functions include being able to draw a line denoting where the ball went from the batting crease and where the ball pitched. This gives additional charts tracking bowling placement and shot selection which can then be used at the coaching level. This additional information, however, does not form part of the critical role of a scorer, which is to keep track of the score of the game. It has been known for scorers to use both methods in conjunction with one another, in case the computer goes down or runs out of battery.\n\nIn addition to PC software, mobile apps are being used. Most of the amateur tournaments use mobile apps on their smartphones because they are more convenient and free, which makes it perfect fit for amateur cricketers since they cannot afford to spend money on standalone and custom software. There are several cricket scoring apps<ref>[https://medium.com/cricheroes/6-live-scoring-apps-for-your-local-cricket-match-799df9d7b83f  Cricket Scoring Apps For Your Local Cricket Match]</ref> such as Total Cricket Scorer (TCS), a  comprehensive program favoured many scorers in the County Championship{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}} in England, CricHQ, CricHeroes, CricScores, CricksLab, CricClubs, Chauka etc.. TCS was bought out by CricHQ in late 2015.  Mobile apps allow amateur cricketers to keep their scores online, and also provide them with personalised statistics and graphs on their own mobile devices.\n\nThe ECB make free software available for cricket scoring both on PC and mobile devices from the PlayCricket website.\n\n==Referring to scores==\n[[File:Adelaide Scoreboard1206.jpg|thumb|right|The [[scoreboard]] at the [[Adelaide Oval]].]]\nThe score of a [[cricket]] team whose [[innings]] is in progress is given as the number of [[run (cricket)|run]]s they have scored \"''for''\" the number of [[wicket]]s their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of \"''one hundred for three''\", written 100\u20133 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100\u20133 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3\u2013100 (or 3/100) in Australia. A team that is dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of \"''three hundred all out''\", rather than \"''three hundred for ten''\"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team [[Declaration and forfeiture|declare]] their innings closed (in a [[First-class cricket|First-class]] match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275\u20137. A declaration is noted by appending a \"d\" or \"dec\" to the score (for example 300\u20138d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word \"declared\" appended (example: \"''300 for 8, declared''\").\n\nIn a two-innings match, the scores of each team for their two innings are always given separately rather than being totalled, and the current score is stated in terms of how many runs the batting team lead or trail by. An example of a score for a two-innings match in progress would be: Team A 240 & 300\u20137d, Team B 225 & 130\u20134. This indicates that Team A in their first innings scored 240 runs, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed, and Team B are currently 130 for 4 \u2013 in this scenario, Team B currently trail by 185 runs (and are said to be facing a ''target'' or ''run chase'' of 316, the score with which they would win the match). If a team has [[follow-on|followed on]] in its second innings, this is indicated by appending \"(f/o)\" to their score, e.g. Team A 513, Team B 145 & 254\u20137 (f/o).\n\nWhen a game is completed, there are standard ways of referring to the difference in scores between the two teams. For instance, if Team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136, then Team B, batting second, only scored 185, whether or not they go all out, it would be said that \"''Team A won by 69 runs''\" because they either bowled out the opposition or caused them to exhaust their overs (in a limited-overs match) when they were trailing by 69 runs. On the other hand, if team A, batting first, scored 254\u20136 but team B, batting second, scored 255\u20138, it would be said that \"''team B won by 2 wickets''\" because they reached their target with 2 wickets remaining. In a two-innings match, a team can win having only batted once (while the other team, batting twice, has not equalled the other team's score). For instance, team A score 160 all out, team B score 530 and declare, then team A score 230 all out. In this case it would be said that \"''team B won by an innings and 140 runs''\".\n\n==Winning scores==\nIn [[Limited overs cricket|limited over matches]] (one innings matches), the team that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs with the loss of 1 wicket (250\u20131), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251\u20139), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar situation if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it is important to know, in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.\n\nIn limited overs matches shortened by bad weather, the winning team is the one whose scoring is best according to the targets set by a rain rule, usually the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]]. The method used to set targets takes into account both the number of overs and the number of wickets lost.\n\nIn [[First-class cricket]] (two innings match), the team that scores more runs, having dismissed its opponents twice, is the winner. An example would be: Team A scored 240 in their first innings, and Team B made 225 in reply. Team A then made 300 for 7 in their second innings, declaring it closed (they might do this because there was not much time left in the match and wanted to have time to dismiss team B and win rather than draw the game). Team A would be setting team B a target of 316 to win. If, in the second innings, team B only scored 250 (indeed anything less than 315) then team A would be the winner. If, on the other hand, team B scored 316\u20139, team B would be the winner. If time or the weather prevents the opposing side's being dismissed twice, the game is a draw, even if one side has scored more than the other. There is no equivalent of Duckworth-Lewis Method in these matches.\n\nThe terms ''draw'' and ''tie'', which are synonymous in many sports, have distinct meanings in cricket. A tie refers to a match in which the game is completed and the two teams finish with exactly the same score. A draw refers to a two-innings match that does not reach a conclusion, usually through a lack of time and/or rain. A limited overs match which does not reach a conclusion due to rain is not considered a draw, but rather is said to have ''no result''.\nHowever, in the case of a tournament final, the match may be decided by an extra over, or awarded to the team with the most boundaries scored, or least wickets lost, or another method indicated by the rules of the tournament. This was the case in the 2019 Cricket World Cup Final, awarded to England on most boundaries scored after a tie and an extra over (super over), after scores remained level.\n\n==Detailed scoring==\n{{see also|Scoring runs in cricket}}\nCricket scorers keep track of many other facts of the game. As a minimum a scorer would note:\n*For each ball, who bowled it and how many runs were scored from it, whether by the batsman with his bat ('off the bat') or [[byes]].\n*For each batsman, every scoring run made.\n*For each [[Dismissal (cricket)|dismissal]], the kind of dismissal (e.g. [[Leg before wicket|LBW]] or [[run out]]), the bowler (in the case of a bowling, LBW, catch, wicket hit, or stumping), any other player involved (in the case of a catch, run out, or stumping), as well as the total the batting team reached at that point in the game ('the fall of wicket'). Example notations as seen on cricket scorecards:\n:*''c ''fielder'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Caught]]\n:*''c & b ''bowler \u2013 Caught & bowled (the bowler was also the catching fielder)\n:*''b ''bowler \u2013 [[Bowled]]\n:*''lbw b ''bowler \u2013 [[Leg before wicket]]\n:*''st ''wicket-keeper'' b ''bowler \u2013 [[Stumped]]\n:*''hit wicket'' ''b'' bowler - [[Hit wicket]]\n*For each bowler (his 'figures'), the number of overs bowled, the number of wickets taken, the number of runs conceded, and the number of [[maiden over]]s bowled.\n\nTraditionally, the score book might record each ball bowled by a bowler and each ball faced by a batsman, but not necessarily which batsman faced which ball.  Linear scoring systems were developed from the late 19th century and early 20th century by [[John Atkinson Pendlington]], [[Bill Ferguson (cricket scorer)|Bill Ferguson]] and [[Bill Frindall]], to keep track of the balls faced by a batsman off each bowler.

For instance the '''beehive''' chart shows where a bowler's balls arrived at a batsman (high, low, wide, on the off stump etc.), while the '''pitch map''' shows where the balls pitched (trending toward short, good, or full lengths).

If more than one bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n===Leg byes===\n\nThe conventional notation for a single leg bye is a triangle with a point at the base and horizontal edge at the top (an inverted bye symbol). If more than one leg bye is taken the number scored is written within the triangle - in practice it is easier to write the number down and then draw the triangle around it.\n\n==Scores and points==\nIn most one day competitions based on leagues, 2 points are awarded for a win and 0 for a loss, regardless of the margin of victory.\n\nIn [[County Championship]] matches league points are awarded to teams not only for winning (scoring more runs overall) or drawing a game, but also for the number of runs scored or wickets taken in the first innings of the match. These extra batting and bowling points can make a difference to who becomes the champions at the end of the season.\n\nIn a series of [[Test cricket|Test matches]], the winner is the team that wins the most matches. Test series can be drawn, with both sides having the same number of wins (since match draws are a distinct possibility with Test cricket; a series need not have all games on record coming to a decision). However, in [[the Ashes]] (the series played between England and Australia), the Ashes only change hands if the holder clearly loses; the Ashes remain with the current holder if the series is drawn.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cricket}}\n* [[Cricket statistics]]\n* [[Laws of cricket]]\n* [[Glossary of cricket terms]]\n* [[Association of Cricket Officials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* For a comprehensive guide to the laws and their interpretation, and for guidance to scorers: ''Tom Smith's Cricket Umpiring and Scoring'' ([[Marylebone Cricket Club]]). {{ISBN|978-0-297-86641-1}}\n\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cricket umpiring]]\n[[Category:Cricket terminology]]\n[[Category:Scoring (cricket)|*]]\n", "name_user": "Latestbhojpuriya", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_(cricket)"}
