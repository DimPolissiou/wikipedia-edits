The Bears continued their hot streak, claiming victory in their first two games of the MVC tournament, a streak halted only by a loss in the tourney final.<ref name=\"MSU\" />\n\nAfter amassing a 22-10 record, including 10 wins in their previous 11 games, and ranking with an [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI]] in the middle 30s, Hinson and his squad were disappointed to be omitted from the (then) 64-team [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] field. However, the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) came calling, and SMS drew a first-round matchup at home with [[Southern Methodist University|Southern Methodist]], whom they defeated handily.

Before SIU he was the Director of Men's Basketball Operations at the [[University of Kansas]], head coach of [[Missouri State University]] and head coach of [[Oral Roberts University]]. On March 28, 2012, Hinson was announced the head coach of Southern Illinois University's men's basketball team.\n\nOn March 8, 2019, Hinson announced his resignation at head coach of Southern Illinois University's men's basketball team following a loss in the quarterfinals of the Missouri Valley Conference basketball tournament in St. Louis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wsiltv.com/story/40096583/hinson-to-step-down-as-siu-head-basketball-coach |title=Hinson to step down as SIU head basketball coach | accessdate=March 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n=== Oral Roberts University ===\n\n====1997\u20131999====\n\nHinson led the Golden Eagles to win-loss records of 19-12 and 17-11 in his two seasons at [[Oral Roberts Golden Eagles men's basketball]].  His first year, which was also ORU's first season as part of the [[The Summit League|Mid-Continent Conference]], Hinson's squad ended the season just one win shy of regular season champion [[Valparaiso University|Valparaiso]]. The same two schools tied for the conference's best record the following season, each logging a 10-4 mark. Hinson's young men fell to Valparaiso in the MCC tournament final.<ref name=\"MSU\" />\n\nShortly after the season, on April 21, 1999, Hinson accepted the head coaching job at Missouri State (known then as Southwest Missouri State, or SMS), becoming the Bears' 15th head coach.<ref name=\"MSU\" />\n\n===Missouri State===\n\n====1999\u201300====\n\nHinson inherited a Bears program that had been to the NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 the previous season and featured five seniors, out of seven returnees overall, who were part of that successful squadron.  After an 11-4 start out of the gate, the Bears stumbled, losing five of their next six games. However, beginning midway through February 2000, Hinson's team won their final eight regular season contests and fell just short of forcing a tie for the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] regular season title. The Bears continued their hot streak, claiming victory in their first two games of the MVC tournament, a streak halted only by a loss in the tourney final.<ref name=\"MSU\" />\n\nAfter amassing a 22-10 record, including 10 wins in their previous 11 games, and ranking with an [[Ratings Percentage Index|RPI]] in the middle 30s, Hinson and his squad were disappointed to be omitted from the (then) 64-team [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] field. However, the [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) came calling, and SMS drew a first-round matchup at home with [[Southern Methodist University|Southern Methodist]], whom they defeated handily. On the road at [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]] in the second round, Hinson and his Bears did not fare as well, getting [[Blowout (sports)|blown out]] to the Rebels.<ref name=\"MSU\" />\n\nBy garnering 23 wins (against 11 losses), Hinson stands as only the fourth MSU head coach to win at least 20 games in his inaugural season.

The Salukis finished tied for fourth in the Missouri Valley regular season before looking overmatched and losing to Northern Iowa in the conference tournament. They ended 22-10 overall and 11-7 in MVC play, marking the first winning season for the Salukis since 2007-08 and the first twenty win season since 2006-07.  However, a weak non-conference schedule and a below average year for its conference meant no NCAA or NIT bid for the team.\n\nOn November 28, Hinson picked up his 250th career victory when the Salukis defeated the [[University of Portland]] at the Corpus Christi Classic 80-79 when Portland's potential game winning shot got wedged between the rim and backboard as time expired.\n\nOn January 20 Hinson picked up his 226th victory while coaching in the Missouri Valley when the Salukis defeated [[Indiana State University]] 79-66 at the SIU Arena.

The game is a crossover between [[Koei Tecmo]]'s ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' and [[Atlus]]'s ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' franchises, and is set six months after the events of ''[[Persona 5]]''. It follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] and the rest of the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]] as they investigate a series of mysterious events involving people across Japan. It was released in Japan on February 20, 2020.\n\n=\nk,jhjbgvcf  vb\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe game is set six months after the events of ''[[Persona 5]]'', [[Joker (Persona)|The protagonist]] and Morgana return to Tokyo for a reunion with the other [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]] to spend their summer vacation together on a camping trip. To determine the camping preparations, they use a popular application called EMMA. While going to Shibuya to buy the necessary tools, they pass by a rising idol, Alice Hiiragi, who gave the protagonist a card requesting them to input \"Wonderland\" into the EMMA app for her special event. Upon entering the keyword, however, he, Morgana and Ryuji are transported into a mysterious alternative version of [[Tokyo]] called a Jail, where they encounter the ruler called King who is Alice's Shadow self, and a sentient A.I. named Sophia who is able to fight Shadows who joins their party. They learn that EMMA, similar to the Metaverse Navigator, enables them to enter Jails. Hearing rumors that people have been attacked by Shadows in Jails that leaves them behaving strangely in the real world, Joker and his friends once again establish the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.\n\nAfter changing Alice's heart, they are approached by a police officer, Zenkichi Hasegawa, who is investigating the sudden bizarre changes of behavior in people around Japan with the Phantom Thieves as the prime suspect. Zenkichi forces them to make a deal with him: He will provide them with information necessary for their heists in exchange the Phantom Thieves help his investigation, which they reluctantly agree to. Accompanied by Zenkichi, the Phantom Thieves travel to [[Sendai]] and [[Sapporo]], changing the corrupted hearts of the Jail's Kings. During their trip, they make a deal with a professor specializing in artificial intelligence, Kuon Ichinose, after eavesdropping and finding out that the protagonist and his friends are the Phantom Thieves. Later on, the Phantom Thieves learn that the head of the global IT Company called Madicce who developed EMMA, Akira Konoe, is misusing the app to manipulate people's hearts. He is supported by Jun Owada, a corrupt politician who once supported Masayoshi Shido, cooperating with Konoe to dispose the King of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]'s Jail and Zenkichi's wife. He uses his position to pin the blame on the Phantom Thieves and order for their arrest, deeming them terrorists for hacking into EMMA.\n\nZenkichi's daughter, Akane Hasegawa, is made a King of [[Kyoto]]'s Jail when asking the app to help her after Zenkichi's been arrested for treason. Entering Kyoto's Jail upon learning of Akane's situation, the Phantom Thieves, except Futaba, are captured by Shadow Akane. Futaba requests Zenkichi's help after he is freed from custody and confronts Shadow Akane, awakening his Persona, Valjean, in the process and officially joins the Phantom Thieves. They successfully save Akane, and then requests help from Kuon Ichinose to gain more information about EMMA and Madicce, eventually allowing them to enter Konoe's Jail in [[Osaka]]. Successfully changing Konoe's heart, the EMMA app is shut down and Madicce is disbanded following Konoe's arrest.\n\nHowever, the EMMA app suddenly restarts on its own, causing a massive blackout throughout Tokyo and emergence of a new Jail. Entering the Jail, they encounter Ichinose who reveals herself to be the true creator of EMMA: she sold it to Konoe so she can determine humanity's true desire. She also reveals that she created Sophia as a prototype of EMMA, but deemed her a failure and discarded her. She then commanded Sophia to attack the Phantom Thieves, but due to spending a lot of time with the Phantom Thieves and forming a bond with them, Sophia defied her creator's commands and proceeded to awaken her Persona, Pandora, to everyone's surprise. After convincing Ichinose to abandon EMMA, they learn that the application's true identity is the False God Demiurge, who believes that humanity's biggest wish is for a world free from crime and wrongdoing. It uses the EMMA app to manipulate people's hearts to take them to the Promised Land. With Ichinose's assistance, Futaba hacks into EMMA central server to send the calling card to reach Demiurge, allowing the Phantom Thieves to confront the false god and defeat it.\n\nWith Demiurge's defeat, the EMMA app is finally shut down for good, erasing Jails from existence. In the aftermath, Owada is arrested thanks to Konoe's testimony, Zenkichi returns to Kyoto, and Sophia decides to go on a journey together with Ichinose.

The game is a crossover between [[Koei Tecmo]]'s ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' and [[Atlus]]'s ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' franchises, and is set six months after the events of ''[[Persona 5]]''. It follows [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] and the rest of the [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]] as they investigate a series of mysterious events involving people across Japan. It was released in Japan on February 20, 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Persona 5 Scramble'' is a gameplay crossover between [[Koei Tecmo]]'s [[hack and slash]] ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' series, and [[Atlus]]'s [[role-playing game]] ''[[Persona (series)|Persona]]'' series. It features elements from both franchises, such as the real-time action combat of the former with the [[turn-based]] [[Persona (series)#Personas|Persona]]-battling aspect of the latter.<ref name=\"P5SGameplay\">{{cite web |last1=Romano |first1=Sal |title=Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers first gameplay, new details |url=https://gematsu.com/2019/11/persona-5-scramble-the-phantom-strikers-first-gameplay-new-details |website=Gematsu |accessdate=November 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to previous ''Persona'' series, [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]], the protagonist, able to wield multiple Personas, which are gained through random drops or by defeating named mini-bosses in dungeons. These Personas can then be brought to the Velvet Room, where they can be fused to create new Personas. The Confidant system from Persona 5 is absent. In its place are Requests, a form of side-quests and the B.A.N.D. system, where increasing its level can grant players bonuses such as stat increases. The B.A.N.D. levels can be increased through interacting with party members, winning battles and hitting milestones throughout the game.\n\nPlayers can form an active party of maximum four members, with Joker being the only character not removable as an active party member. Outside of battle, active party members can be swapped with the standby party members. Players can only control Joker in the real world but is able to control any party member freely when exploring the story dungeons. Exploring dungeons is similar to ''[[Persona 5]]'', where players can use stealth to avoid enemies or may occasionally face the need to solve puzzles to progress. The 'Third Eye' also makes a return from ''Persona 5'', where it highlights enemies strength and interactive objects. Should the alert meter of the dungeon reach 100%, the party is forced to leave the dungeon. The Alert level can be lowered by winning battles that are initiated with surprise attacks or by leaving the dungeon. Unlike previous entries of the ''Persona'' series, leaving the dungeon does not progress time and there are generally no demerits in leaving the story dungeons. \n\nBattles are mostly initiated when the player character comes into contact with the enemy, where they can launch a surprise attack to gain a combat advantage if the enemy has not spotted them. Battles are also now in the form of a real-time combat system. However, players will use a command-based skills menu when using Persona skills. During the time in this menu, the battle will pause to allow tactical positioning of the Persona skills. If the party deals a critical damage or deals damage that the enemy is weak to, the enemy may be knocked down for an 'All-Out Attack' which deals a large amount of damage. All party members can obtain new moves, known as Master Arts, by controlling the characters manually and defeating enemies. If all active party members are knocked out in battle, the game ends.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe game is set six months after the events of ''[[Persona 5]]'', [[Joker (Persona)|The protagonist]] and Morgana return to Tokyo for a reunion with the other [[Phantom Thieves of Hearts]] to spend their summer vacation together on a camping trip. To determine the camping preparations, they use a popular application called EMMA. While going to Shibuya to buy the necessary tools, they pass by a rising idol, Alice Hiiragi, who gave the protagonist a card requesting them to input \"Wonderland\" into the EMMA app for her special event. Upon entering the keyword, however, he, Morgana and Ryuji are transported into a mysterious alternative version of [[Tokyo]] called a Jail, where they encounter the ruler called King who is Alice's Shadow self, and a sentient A.I. named Sophia who is able to fight Shadows who joins their party. They learn that EMMA, similar to the Metaverse Navigator, enables them to enter Jails. Hearing rumors that people have been attacked by Shadows in Jails that leaves them behaving strangely in the real world, Joker and his friends once again establish the Phantom Thieves of Hearts.\n\nAfter changing Alice's heart, they are approached by a police officer, Zenkichi Hasegawa, who is investigating the sudden bizarre changes of behavior in people around Japan with the Phantom Thieves as the prime suspect. Zenkichi forces them to make a deal with him: He will provide them with information necessary for their heists in exchange the Phantom Thieves help his investigation, which they reluctantly agree to. Accompanied by Zenkichi, the Phantom Thieves travel to [[Sendai]] and [[Sapporo]], changing the corrupted hearts of the Jail's Kings. During their trip, they make a deal with a professor specializing in artificial intelligence, Kuon Ichinose, after eavesdropping and finding out that the protagonist and his friends are the Phantom Thieves. Later on, the Phantom Thieves learn that the head of the global IT Company called Madicce who developed EMMA, Akira Konoe, is misusing the app to manipulate people's hearts. He is supported by Jun Owada, a corrupt politician who once supported Masayoshi Shido, cooperating with Konoe to dispose the King of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]]'s Jail and Zenkichi's wife. He uses his position to pin the blame on the Phantom Thieves and order for their arrest, deeming them terrorists for hacking into EMMA.\n\nZenkichi's daughter, Akane Hasegawa, is made a King of [[Kyoto]]'s Jail when asking the app to help her after Zenkichi's been arrested for treason. Entering Kyoto's Jail upon learning of Akane's situation, the Phantom Thieves, except Futaba, are captured by Shadow Akane. Futaba requests Zenkichi's help after he is freed from custody and confronts Shadow Akane, awakening his Persona, Valjean, in the process and officially joins the Phantom Thieves. They successfully save Akane, and then requests help from Kuon Ichinose to gain more information about EMMA and Madicce, eventually allowing them to enter Konoe's Jail in [[Osaka]]. Successfully changing Konoe's heart, the EMMA app is shut down and Madicce is disbanded following Konoe's arrest.\n\nHowever, the EMMA app suddenly restarts on its own, causing a massive blackout throughout Tokyo and emergence of a new Jail. Entering the Jail, they encounter Ichinose who reveals herself to be the true creator of EMMA: she sold it to Konoe so she can determine humanity's true desire. She also reveals that she created Sophia as a prototype of EMMA, but deemed her a failure and discarded her. She then commanded Sophia to attack the Phantom Thieves, but due to spending a lot of time with the Phantom Thieves and forming a bond with them, Sophia defied her creator's commands and proceeded to awaken her Persona, Pandora, to everyone's surprise. After convincing Ichinose to abandon EMMA, they learn that the application's true identity is the False God Demiurge, who believes that humanity's biggest wish is for a world free from crime and wrongdoing. It uses the EMMA app to manipulate people's hearts to take them to the Promised Land. With Ichinose's assistance, Futaba hacks into EMMA central server to send the calling card to reach Demiurge, allowing the Phantom Thieves to confront the false god and defeat it.\n\nWith Demiurge's defeat, the EMMA app is finally shut down for good, erasing Jails from existence. In the aftermath, Owada is arrested thanks to Konoe's testimony, Zenkichi returns to Kyoto, and Sophia decides to go on a journey together with Ichinose. As their mission has ended, the Phantom Thieves once again go their separate ways, but promise that they'll meet again sooner or later.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Persona 5 Scramble'' began development around the time of the Japanese release of ''Persona 5'' in September 2016, where it was known as ''Persona Warriors''.<ref>{{cite web |author1=SATO |title=Persona 5 Scramble Was Originally Planned as \u2018Persona Warriors\u2019 |url=https://www.siliconera.com/persona-5-scramble-was-originally-planned-as-persona-warriors/ |website=Siliconera |accessdate=January 27, 2020}}</ref> It was first teased as ''Persona 5 S'' in December 2018, with it being fully revealed in April 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wales |first1=Matt |title=Atlus' mysterious Persona 5 S is a Warriors-style action game for PS4 and Switch |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-25-atlus-mysterious-persona-5-s-is-a-warriors-style-action-game-for-ps4-and-switch |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=November 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426124808/https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-04-25-atlus-mysterious-persona-5-s-is-a-warriors-style-action-game-for-ps4-and-switch |archive-date=April 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/persona_5_scramble_the_phantom_strikers_officially_confirmed_for_switch | title = Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers Officially Confirmed For Switch | first = Ryan | last = Craddock | date = April 25, 2019 | accessdate = April 25, 2019 | work = [[Nintendo Life]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190425134350/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/04/persona_5_scramble_the_phantom_strikers_officially_confirmed_for_switch | archive-date = April 25, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> It is being co-developed by [[Koei Tecmo]]'s [[Omega Force]] studio and [[Atlus]]'s [[P-Studio]], and released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] in Japan on February 20, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vitale |first1=Adam |last2=Stenbuck |first2=Kite |title=Persona 5 Scramble: The Phantom Strikers launches in Japan on February 20, 2020; New Gameplay Trailer |url=https://www.rpgsite.net/news/9118-persona-5-scramble-the-phantom-strikers-launches-in-japan-on-february-20-2020-new-gameplay-trailer |website=RPG Site |accessdate=October 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191024043408/https://www.rpgsite.net/news/9118-persona-5-scramble-the-phantom-strikers-launches-in-japan-on-february-20-2020-new-gameplay-trailer |archive-date=October 24, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was produced by Daisuke Kaneda and Kenichi Ogasawara, with music composed by Atlus's Atsushi Kitajoh and Koei Tecmo's Gota Masuoka and Ayana Hira.

John quickly discovered he had a knack for the game and played his first professional tournament in [[Ventura, California|Ventura]], [[California]] the weekend after graduation in 1975.\n\n==Darts success==\nJohn enjoyed much success during his playing days from 1975 through 1987, including his first North American Open singles title, where he defeated world #3 ranked player, [[Jocky Wilson]] in the semi-final and the #1 player in the world at that time, [[Eric Bristow]] in the final. In 1982 he competed in the [[1982 BDO World Darts Championship|1982 World Darts Championship]] but was defeated by the [[England|English]] darts player [[Tony Brown (darts player)|Tony Brown]] in the first round. His national ranking in 1985 earned him a spot on the US World Cup team to compete in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]]. The US won the team gold medal at World Cup V, which saw them defeat the English team 9-0, before going on to defeat the Australian team to win the gold medal. The US team also brought home the Silver medal for their 2nd-place finish overall. 1985 brought John to the US#1 ranking and his first Bulls-Eye News magazine cover.\n1987 was when he first retired from the game due to personal reasons and John enjoyed his spare time playing tournament and league softball.\n1999 saw a resurgence of John\u2019s darting career after a 12-year absence, where he enjoyed many successes, including a second North American Open singles title (defeating US player Roger Carter), being part of the rare accomplishment of winning both Open Doubles events at the Las Vegas Open (with Chris White) in 2001, and a second Bulls-Eye News magazine cover.\n2002 brought on a second retirement from darts and his venture into tournament paintball.\n2006 has brought on another resurgence into darts.  Enjoying more success at events such as the Wild West Shootout and the San Francisco Open with Open Cricket singles titles for both.\n2007 added some semi-final and finals, but the quest for the perfect dart showed in the finishes.\n2008 saw an Open Singles Champion for the San Diego Memorial Open.\n\n2009 was a quiet year and 2010 brought on some very severe health issues, which left 2011 for John to pretty much learn how to throw a dart all over again. With lots more ability to travel to compete at tournaments in 2012, John has seen big improvements in his game.\n\nJohn has  moved to the east coast of the US and is now able to compete more often at the tournament level. John finished 2012 ranked in the top 30 in the US according to the national rankings for the American Darts Organization, and as of March 2013, is ranked at #6 in the national rankings.\n\nJohn began 2013 with a new sponsor, the Puma Darts Company out of New Zealand as a Shot! Ambassador.\n\nIn 2017, John has been living in Cary, North Carolina for two years and competing locally in leagues and different events. He is not currently sponsored and not traveling to tournaments at this time. He continues to be one of the top leaders in the leagues of the area in winning percentages and averages.\n\nUpdate: late 2019-John is no longer competing on any level due to some arthritis issues. The darts have been set aside and he now has taken up shooting again as his hobby. Thanks to all the darting world for all of your support of John's career over the years.\n\n==World Championship Results==\n\n===BDO===\n* 1982: Last 32: (lost to [[Tony Brown (darts player)|Tony Brown]] 0\u20132) (sets)\n\n==Tournament Results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 1980-2006 \n!
