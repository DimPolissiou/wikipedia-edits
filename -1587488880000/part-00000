The word ''plasma'' signals that\u00a0free color charges are allowed. Since the temperature is above the [[Hagedorn temperature]]\u2014and thus above the scale of light u,d-quark mass\u2014the pressure exhibits the relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann format governed by fourth power of temperature and many practically mass free quark and gluon constituents. We can say that QGP emerges to be the new phase of strongly interacting matter which manifests its physical properties in terms of nearly free dynamics of practically massless gluons and quarks. Both quarks and gluons, must be present in conditions near chemical (yield) equilibrium with their colour charge ''open'' for a new state of matter to be referred to as QGP.\n\nQuark-gluon plasma filled the entire [[Universe]] before matter was created. Theories predicting the existence of quark-gluon plasma were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Satz|first=H.|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=OY8uAAAAIAAJ|title=Statistical Mechanics of Quarks and Hadrons: Proceedings of an International Symposium Held at the University of Bielefeld, F.R.G., August 24-31, 1980|date=1981|publisher=North-Holland|isbn=978-0-444-86227-3|language=en}}</ref> Discussions around heavy ion experimentation followed suite<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Report of the workshop on GeV/nucleon collisions of heavy ions: how and why, November 29--December 1, 1974, Bear Mountain, New York|title=Developments at CERN|last=Cocconi|first=G.|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/4061527|language=English|pages=78}}</ref><ref>{{Cite report|last=Webb|first=C.|year=1979|title=First workshop on ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions, LBL, May 21-24, 1979|url=https://www.osti.gov/biblio/5187301|series=LBL-8957|language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Nakai|first=K\u014dji|url=https://books.google.ch/books?id=fPMWAQAAMAAJ|title=High-energy nuclear interactions and properties of dense nuclear matter: proceedings of the Hakone Seminar (Japan-U.S. Joint Seminar) held at Hakone, from July 7 to 11, 1980|last2=Goldhaber|first2=A.

In classical QCD quarks are the [[fermion]]ic components of [[hadron]]s ([[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s) while the [[gluon]]s are considered the [[boson]]ic components of such particles.  The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts.\n\nWe study quark-gluon plasma to recreate and understand the high energy density conditions prevailing in the Universe when matter formed from elementary degrees of freedom (quarks, gluons) at about 20\u03bcs after the [[Big Bang]]. Experimental groups are probing over a \u2018large\u2019 distance the (de)confining quantum vacuum structure, the present day relativistic \u00e6ther, which determines prevailing form of matter and laws of nature. The experiments give insight to the origin of matter and mass: the matter and antimatter is created when the quark-gluon plasma \u2018hadronizes\u2019 and the mass of matter originates in the confining vacuum structure.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== How the quark-gluon plasma fits into the general scheme of physics ==\n\n[[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is one part of the modern theory of [[particle physics]] called the [[Standard Model]]. Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanabashi|first=M.|last2=Hagiwara|first2=K.|last3=Hikasa|first3=K.|last4=Nakamura|first4=K.|last5=Sumino|first5=Y.|last6=Takahashi|first6=F.|last7=Tanaka|first7=J.|last8=Agashe|first8=K.|last9=Aielli|first9=G.|last10=Amsler|first10=C.|last11=Antonelli|first11=M.|date=|year=2018|title=Review of Particle Physics|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-qcd.pdf|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=98|issue=3|page=|pages=030001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.98.030001|issn=2470-0010|via=}}</ref> Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.\n\nThe study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).\n\n=== Reasons for studying the formation of quark-gluon plasma ===\nThe generally accepted model of the formation of the [[Universe]] states that it happened as the result of the [[Big Bang]]. In this model, in the time interval of 10<sup>\u201310</sup>\u201310<sup>\u20136</sup> s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark-gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe.\n\n=== Relation to normal plasma ===\n\nA [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is matter in which [[Charge (physics)|charges]] are [[Debye length|screened]] due to the presence of other mobile charges.  For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  <math>Q \\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\alpha}</math>, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length \u03b1. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.\n\nBecause of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).\n\n=== Theory ===\n[[File:WHYrhic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Five reasons to study quark-gluon plasma.

As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is [[lattice gauge theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karsch|first=F.|year=1995|title=The phase transition to the quark gluon plasma: Recent results from lattice calculations|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/037594749500248Y|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=590|issue=1-2|pages=367\u2013381|doi=10.1016/0375-9474(95)00248-Y|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Quark-Gluon Plasma |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=862\u2013863 |issue=12 |pages=4\u201312 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.05.014|year=2011 |arxiv=1101.3937 |last1=Satz |first1=Helmut |bibcode = 2011NuPhA.862....4S }}</ref> The transition temperature (approximately {{val|175|ul=MeV}}) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.\n\n=== Production ===\n\nProduction of QGP in the laboratory is achieved by colliding heavy atomic nuclei (called heavy ions as in an accelerator atoms are ionized) at relativistic energy in which matter is heated well above the [[Hagedorn temperature]] ''T''<sub>H</sub>= 150 MeV per particle, which amounts to a temperature exceeding 1.66\u00d710<sup>12</sup> [[Kelvin|K]]. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively. The nuclei are accelerated to [[Ultrarelativistic limit|ultrarelativistic speeds]] ([[Length contraction|contracting their length]]) and directed towards each other, creating a \"fireball\", in the rare event of a collision. Hydrodynamic simulation predicts this fireball will expand under its own [[pressure]], and cool while expanding. By carefully studying the spherical and [[elliptic flow]], experimentalists put the theory to test.\n\n=== Diagnostic tools ===\nThere is an overwhelming evidence for production of quark-gluon plasma in relativistic heavy ion collisions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busza|first=Wit|last2=Rajagopal|first2=Krishna|last3=van der Schee|first3=Wilke|year=2018|title=Heavy ion collisions: The big picture and the big questions|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|journal=Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=339\u2013376|doi=10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852|issn=0163-8998|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=ALICE Collaboration|first=|year=2017|title=Enhanced production of multi-strange hadrons in high-multiplicity proton\u2013proton collisions|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4111|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=535\u2013539|doi=10.1038/nphys4111|issn=1745-2473|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koch|first=Peter|last2=M\u00fcller|first2=Berndt|last3=Rafelski|first3=Johann|year=2017|title=From strangeness enhancement to quark\u2013gluon plasma discovery|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X17300241|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|language=en|volume=32|issue=31|pages=1730024|doi=10.1142/S0217751X17300241|issn=0217-751X|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=The WA97 Collaboration|first=|last2=|first2=|year=2000|title=Transverse mass spectra of strange and multi\u2013strange particles in Pb\u2013Pb collisions at 158 A GeV/c|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s100520000386|journal=The European Physical Journal C|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=633\u2013641|doi=10.1007/s100520000386|issn=1434-6044|via=}}</ref> \n\nThe important classes of experimental observations are\n\n*[[Strangeness production]]\n*[[Elliptic flow]]\n*[[Jet quenching]]\n*[[J/\u03c8#J/\u03c8 melting|J/\u03c8 melting]]\n*[[Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein correlations]]\n*[[single particle spectrum|Single particle spectra]] ([[photons]] and [[dilepton]]s)\n\n== Expected properties ==\n\n=== Thermodynamics ===\nThe cross-over temperature from the normal hadronic to the QGP phase is about {{val|175|u=MeV}}. This \"crossover\" may actually ''not'' be only a qualitative feature, but instead one may have to do with a true (second order) phase transition, e.g. of the universality class of the [[Ising model#Three and four dimensions|three-dimensional Ising model]]. The phenomena involved correspond to an energy density of a little less than {{val|1|u=[[Electronvolt|GeV]]/fm<sup>3</sup>}}. For [[Relativistic particle|relativistic]] matter, pressure and temperature are not independent variables, so the [[equation of state]] is a relation between the energy density and the pressure. This has been found through [[lattice gauge theory|lattice computations]], and compared to both [[perturbation theory]] and [[string theory]]. This is still a matter of active research. Response functions such as the [[Specific heat capacity|specific heat]] and various quark number susceptibilities are currently being computed.\n\n=== Flow ===\nThe discovery of the perfect liquid was a turning point in physics.

RHIC experiments have shown that this is the most perfect liquid ever observed in any laboratory experiment at any scale. The new phase of matter, consisting of dissolved hadrons, exhibits less resistance to flow than any other known substance. The experiments at RHIC have, already in 2005, shown that the Universe at its beginning was uniformly filled with this type of material\u2014a super-liquid\u2014which once the Universe cooled below ''T''<sub>H</sub> evaporated into a gas of hadrons. Detailed measurements show that this liquid is a quark-gluon plasma where quarks, antiquarks and gluons flow independently.<ref>Letter from Berndt M\u00fcller to Johann Rafelski, reproduced in \"Discovery of Quark-Gluon Plasma: Strangeness Diaries\".

Furthermore, once formed, a ball of quark\u2013gluon plasma, like any hot object, transfers heat internally by radiation. However, unlike in everyday objects, there is enough energy available so that [[gluon]]s (particles mediating the [[strong force]]) collide and produce an excess of the heavy (i.e. [[Mass-energy equivalence|high-energy]]) [[strange quarks]]. Whereas, if the QGP didn't exist and there was a pure collision, the same energy would be converted into a non-equilibrium mixture containing even heavier quarks such as [[charm quark]]s or [[bottom quark]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ollitrault|first=Jean-Yves|year=1992|title=Anisotropy as a signature of transverse collective flow|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.46.229|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=46|issue=1|pages=229\u2013245|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.46.229|issn=0556-2821|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borghini|first=Nicolas|last2=Dinh|first2=Phuong Mai|last3=Ollitrault|first3=Jean-Yves|year=2001|title=Flow analysis from multiparticle azimuthal correlations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.64.054901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=64|issue=5|pages=054901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.64.054901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe equation of state is an important input into the flow equations.

Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless [[Hadron|hadrons]]. Under the conditions of a quark-gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 \u03bcs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark-gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark-gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schukraft|first=J\u00fcrgen|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/114939/contributions/62599/attachments/48842/70225/CERN_HI_Dec_2010.pdf|title=ALICE\u2014'Little Bang' : The first 3 weeks ...|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nIn November 2010 CERN announced the first direct observation of jet quenching, based on experiments with heavy-ion collisions.<ref>{{cite press release |title=LHC experiments bring new insight into primordial universe |url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2010/11/lhc-experiments-bring-new-insight-primordial-universe|publisher=[[CERN]] |date=November 26, 2010 |accessdate=December 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Aad | first=G. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=ATLAS Collaboration | title=Observation of a Centrality-Dependent Dijet Asymmetry in Lead-Lead Collisions at {{sqrt|s<sub>NN</sub>}} = 2.76 TeV with the ATLAS Detector at the LHC | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=105 | issue=25 | date=13 December 2010 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.105.252303 |doi-access=free | page=252303 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Chatrchyan | first=S. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=CMS Collaboration | title=Observation and studies of jet quenching in Pb-Pb collisions at {{sqrt|s<sub>NN</sub>}} = 2.76 TeV | journal=Physical Review C | volume=84 | issue=2 | date=12 August 2011 | doi=10.1103/physrevc.84.024906 |doi-access=free | page=024906 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma|title=Heavy ions and quark-gluon plasma|author=CERN|date=18 July 2012}}</ref> \n\n=== Direct photons and dileptons ===\nDirect photons and dileptons are arguably most penetrating tools to study relativistic heavy ion collisions.

Theoretical and experimental works show that the formation of a quark-gluon plasma occurs at the temperature of T \u2248 150\u2013160 MeV, the [[Hagedorn temperature]], and an energy density of \u2248 0.4\u20131 GeV / fm<sup>3</sup>.

The word ''plasma'' signals that\u00a0free color charges are allowed. Since the temperature is above the [[Hagedorn temperature]]\u2014and thus above the scale of light u,d-quark mass\u2014the pressure exhibits the relativistic Stefan-Boltzmann format governed by fourth power of temperature and many practically mass free quark and gluon constituents. We can say that QGP emerges to be the new phase of strongly interacting matter which manifests its physical properties in terms of nearly free dynamics of practically massless gluons and quarks. Both quarks and gluons, must be present in conditions near chemical (yield) equilibrium with their colour charge ''open'' for a new state of matter to be referred to as QGP.\n\nQuark-gluon plasma filled the entire [[Universe]] before matter was created.

In classical QCD quarks are the [[fermion]]ic components of [[hadron]]s ([[meson]]s and [[baryon]]s) while the [[gluon]]s are considered the [[boson]]ic components of such particles.  The gluons are the force carriers, or bosons, of the QCD color force, while the quarks by themselves are their fermionic matter counterparts.\n\nWe study quark-gluon plasma to recreate and understand the high energy density conditions prevailing in the Universe when matter formed from elementary degrees of freedom (quarks, gluons) at about 20\u03bcs after the [[Big Bang]]. Experimental groups are probing over a \u2018large\u2019 distance the (de)confining quantum vacuum structure, the present day relativistic \u00e6ther, which determines prevailing form of matter and laws of nature. The experiments give insight to the origin of matter and mass: the matter and antimatter is created when the quark-gluon plasma \u2018hadronizes\u2019 and the mass of matter originates in the confining vacuum structure.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== How the quark-gluon plasma fits into the general scheme of physics ==\n\n[[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] is one part of the modern theory of [[particle physics]] called the [[Standard Model]]. Other parts of this theory deal with [[electroweak interaction]]s and [[neutrino]]s. The [[quantum electrodynamics|theory of electrodynamics]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a billion. The [[electroweak interaction|theory of weak interactions]] has been tested and found correct to a few parts in a thousand. Perturbative forms of QCD have been tested to a few percent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tanabashi|first=M.|last2=Hagiwara|first2=K.|last3=Hikasa|first3=K.|last4=Nakamura|first4=K.|last5=Sumino|first5=Y.|last6=Takahashi|first6=F.|last7=Tanaka|first7=J.|last8=Agashe|first8=K.|last9=Aielli|first9=G.|last10=Amsler|first10=C.|last11=Antonelli|first11=M.|date=|year=2018|title=Review of Particle Physics|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2019/reviews/rpp2019-rev-qcd.pdf|journal=Physical Review D|language=en|volume=98|issue=3|page=|pages=030001|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.98.030001|issn=2470-0010|via=}}</ref> Perturbative models assume relatively small changes from the ground state, i.e. relatively low temperatures and densities, which simplifies calculations at the cost of generality. In contrast, non-perturbative forms of QCD have barely been tested. The study of the QGP, which has both a high temperature and density, is part of this effort to consolidate the grand theory of particle physics.\n\nThe study of the QGP is also a testing ground for [[Thermal quantum field theory|finite temperature field theory]], a branch of theoretical physics which seeks to understand particle physics under conditions of high temperature. Such studies are important to understand the early evolution of our universe: [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|the first hundred microseconds]] or so. It is crucial to the physics goals of a new generation of observations of the universe ([[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and its successors). It is also of relevance to [[grand unification theory|Grand Unification Theories]] which seek to unify the three fundamental forces of nature (excluding gravity).\n\n=== Reasons for studying the formation of quark-gluon plasma ===\nThe generally accepted model of the formation of the [[Universe]] states that it happened as the result of the [[Big Bang]]. In this model, in the time interval of 10<sup>\u201310</sup>\u201310<sup>\u20136</sup> s after the Big Bang, matter existed in the form of a quark-gluon plasma. It is possible to reproduce the density and temperature of matter existing of that time in laboratory conditions to study the characteristics of the very Universe. So far, the only possibility is the collision of two heavy [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] accelerated to energies of more than a hundred GeV. Using the result of a head-on collision in the volume approximately equal to the volume of the atomic nucleus, it is possible to model the density and temperature that existed in the first instants of the life of the Universe.\n\n=== Relation to normal plasma ===\n\nA [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] is matter in which [[Charge (physics)|charges]] are [[Debye length|screened]] due to the presence of other mobile charges.  For example: [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb's Law]] is suppressed by the screening to yield a distance-dependent charge,  <math>Q \\rightarrow Q e^{-r/\\alpha}</math>, i.e., the charge Q is reduced exponentially with the distance divided by a screening length \u03b1. In a QGP, the [[color charge]] of the [[quark]]s and [[gluon]]s is screened. The QGP has other analogies with a normal plasma. There are also dissimilarities because the color charge is [[non-abelian group|non-abelian]], whereas the [[electric charge]] is abelian. Outside a finite volume of QGP the color-electric field is not screened, so that a volume of QGP must still be color-neutral. It will therefore, like a nucleus, have integer electric charge.\n\nBecause of the extremely high energies involved, quark-antiquark pairs are produced by [[pair production]] and thus QGP is a roughly equal mixture of quarks and antiquarks of various flavors, with only a slight excess of quarks. This property is not a general feature of conventional plasmas, which may be too cool for pair production (see however [[pair instability supernova]]).\n\n=== Theory ===\n[[File:WHYrhic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Five reasons to study quark-gluon plasma.

As a result, the main theoretical tools to explore the theory of the QGP is [[lattice gauge theory]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karsch|first=F.|year=1995|title=The phase transition to the quark gluon plasma: Recent results from lattice calculations|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/037594749500248Y|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=590|issue=1-2|pages=367\u2013381|doi=10.1016/0375-9474(95)00248-Y|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Quark-Gluon Plasma |journal=Nuclear Physics A |volume=862\u2013863 |issue=12 |pages=4\u201312 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2011.05.014|year=2011 |arxiv=1101.3937 |last1=Satz |first1=Helmut |bibcode = 2011NuPhA.862....4S }}</ref> The transition temperature (approximately {{val|175|ul=MeV}}) was first predicted by lattice gauge theory. Since then lattice gauge theory has been used to predict many other properties of this kind of matter. The [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] conjecture may provide insights in QGP, moreover the ultimate goal of the fluid/gravity correspondence is to understand QGP. The QGP is believed to be a phase of QCD which is completely locally thermalized and thus suitable for an effective fluid dynamic description.\n\n=== Production ===\n\nProduction of QGP in the laboratory is achieved by colliding heavy atomic nuclei (called heavy ions as in an accelerator atoms are ionized) at relativistic energy in which matter is heated well above the [[Hagedorn temperature]] ''T''<sub>H</sub>= 150 MeV per particle, which amounts to a temperature exceeding 1.66\u00d710<sup>12</sup> [[Kelvin|K]]. This can be accomplished by colliding two large nuclei at high energy (note that {{val|175|u=MeV}} is not the energy of the colliding beam). [[Lead]] and [[gold]] [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] have been used for such collisions at [[CERN]] [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] and [[Brookhaven National Laboratory|BNL]] [[Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider|RHIC]], respectively.

When heated the nuclear fluid evaporates and turns into a dilute gas of nucleons and, upon further heating, a gas of baryons and mesons (hadrons). At the critical temperature, ''T''<sub>H</sub>, the hadrons melt and the gas turns back into a liquid.  RHIC experiments have shown that this is the most perfect liquid ever observed in any laboratory experiment at any scale. The new phase of matter, consisting of dissolved hadrons, exhibits less resistance to flow than any other known substance. The experiments at RHIC have, already in 2005, shown that the Universe at its beginning was uniformly filled with this type of material\u2014a super-liquid\u2014which once the Universe cooled below ''T''<sub>H</sub> evaporated into a gas of hadrons. Detailed measurements show that this liquid is a quark-gluon plasma where quarks, antiquarks and gluons flow independently.<ref>Letter from Berndt M\u00fcller to Johann Rafelski, reproduced in \"Discovery of Quark-Gluon Plasma: Strangeness Diaries\".

Passing through a highly heated compressed plasma, partons lose energy. The magnitude of the energy loss by the parton depends on the properties of the quark-gluon plasma (temperature, density). In addition, it is also necessary to take into account the fact that colored quarks and gluons are the elementary objects of the plasma, which differs from the energy loss by a parton in a medium consisting of colorless [[Hadron|hadrons]]. Under the conditions of a quark-gluon plasma, the energy losses resulting from the RHIC energies by partons are estimated as dE / dx = 1 GeV / fm. This conclusion is confirmed by comparing the relative yield of hadrons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon and nucleus-nucleus collisions at the same collision energy. The energy loss by partons with a large transverse impulse in nucleon-nucleon collisions is much smaller than in nucleus-nucleus collisions, which leads to a decrease in the yield of high-energy hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions. This result suggests that nuclear collisions cannot be regarded as a simple superposition of nucleon-nucleon collisions. For a short time, ~ 1 \u03bcs and in the final volume, quarks and gluons form some ideal liquid. The collective properties of this fluid are manifested during its movement as a whole. Therefore, when moving partons in this medium, it is necessary to take into account some collective properties of this quark-gluon liquid. Energy losses depend on the properties of the quark-gluon medium, on the parton density in the resulting fireball, and on the dynamics of its expansion. Losses of energy by light and heavy quarks during the passage of a fireball turn out to be approximately the same.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schukraft|first=J\u00fcrgen|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/114939/contributions/62599/attachments/48842/70225/CERN_HI_Dec_2010.pdf|title=ALICE\u2014'Little Bang' : The first 3 weeks ...|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nIn November 2010 CERN announced the first direct observation of jet quenching, based on experiments with heavy-ion collisions.<ref>{{cite press release |title=LHC experiments bring new insight into primordial universe |url=http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2010/11/lhc-experiments-bring-new-insight-primordial-universe|publisher=[[CERN]] |date=November 26, 2010 |accessdate=December 2, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Aad | first=G. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=ATLAS Collaboration | title=Observation of a Centrality-Dependent Dijet Asymmetry in Lead-Lead Collisions at {{sqrt|s<sub>NN</sub>}} = 2.76 TeV with the ATLAS Detector at the LHC | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=105 | issue=25 | date=13 December 2010 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.105.252303 |doi-access=free | page=252303 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Chatrchyan | first=S. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=CMS Collaboration | title=Observation and studies of jet quenching in Pb-Pb collisions at {{sqrt|s<sub>NN</sub>}} = 2.76 TeV | journal=Physical Review C | volume=84 | issue=2 | date=12 August 2011 | doi=10.1103/physrevc.84.024906 |doi-access=free | page=024906 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma|title=Heavy ions and quark-gluon plasma|author=CERN|date=18 July 2012}}</ref> \n\n=== Direct photons and dileptons ===\nDirect photons and dileptons are arguably most penetrating tools to study relativistic heavy ion collisions.

Despite comparisons, Stadia is not similar to [[Netflix]], in that Stadia requires users to purchase games to stream via Stadia rather than pay for access to a library of games. While the base service is free, a [[premium business model|Pro tier]] monthly subscription allows users to stream at higher rates of upto [[4K resolution]], surround sound, and offers 1-3 free games a month that the user has access to while they are subscribed to Pro with or without gaps.\n\nKnown in development as '''Project Stream''', the service was debuted through a [[Software release life cycle#Open and closed beta|closed beta]] running ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' in October 2018. Stadia was publicly released on November 19, 2019 in selected countries and received a mixed reception from reviewers. The service competes with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Now]] service, [[Nvidia]]'s [[GeForce Now]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[XCloud|Project xCloud]]. On 8 April, 2020 Google started rolling out Stadia free base service, along with giving new users two months of Pro subscription.\n\n== Features ==\nStadia is a cloud gaming service,<ref name=\"HighlyTechno\" /> and does not require additional computer hardware, only requiring the device to have an Internet connection and support for [[Google Chrome]]. Stadia works atop [[YouTube]]'s functionality in streaming media to the user, as game streaming is seen as an extension of watching [[Video game live streaming|video game live streams]], according to Google's [[Phil Harrison]]; the name \"Stadia\", the Latin plural of \"stadium\", is meant to reflect that it is a collection of entertainment, which the viewer can choose to sit back and watch, or take an active part in.<ref name=\"eu interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-google-stadia-phil-harrison-majd-bakar-interview |title = The big interview: Phil Harrison and Majd Bakar on Google Stadia | first = Richard | last= Leadbetter | date = March 19, 2019 | access-date = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As Google had built out a large number of data centers across the globe, the company believes that Stadia is in a better position for cloud gaming compared to past endeavours like [[OnLive]], [[PlayStation Now]], and [[Gaikai]], as most players would be geographically close to a data center. Stadia supports the streaming of games in [[High-dynamic-range video|HDR]] at 60 frames per second with [[4K resolution]], and anticipates eventually reaching 120 frames per second at [[8K resolution]].<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Players can start games without having to download new content to their personal device. Players can opt to record or stream their sessions onto YouTube through Stadia. Viewers of such streams can launch the games directly from the stream with the same save state that they were just watching.<ref name=\"eu interview\" />\n\nThe streaming technology enables new features on Stadia. Stream Connect allows Stadia players, cooperatively playing the same game with friends, to have [[picture-in-picture]] inserts on their display of their friends' point-of-view in the game. This feature was first launched with the release of ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/12/17/stadia-ghost-recon-breakpoint-first-stream-connect-game/ | title = Stadia\u2019s first Stream Connect game, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, arrives tomorrow | first = Sherif | last = Saed | date = December 17, 2019 | accessdate = December 17, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> The streaming technology allows for larger number of concurrent players on a game server; for example, servers for ''[[Grid (2019 video game)|Grid]]'' are normally limited to 16 players, while the Stadia version will allow up to 40.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/grid-for-stadia-has-a-40-car-mode-that-isnt-possible-with-other-hardware/ | title = Grid for Stadia has a 40 car mode that 'isn't possible with other hardware' | first= Shaun  |last = Prescott | date=  November 23, 2019 | accessdate = December 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nWhile Stadia can use any [[USB human interface device class|HID-class]] [[USB]] controller, Google developed its own controller which connects via Wi-Fi directly to the Google data center in which the game is running, to reduce input latency.<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Google is also exploring further ways to reduce latency, using an idea called \"negative latency\" which involves prediction of user input through various means so that any apparent network lag between controller and game response is minimized.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/10/google-stadia-negative-latency/ | title = Google wants to reduce Stadia lag with 'negative latency' | first=  Marc | last= DeAngelis | date = October 10, 2019 | accessdate = October 10, 2019  |work = [[Engadget]]}}</ref> During its GDC 2019 keynote reveal, Google confirmed that the controller would also feature [[Google Assistant]], which will automatically search YouTube for relevant, helpful videos related to the game they are currently playing at the touch of a key.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/1hak5/stadias-wi-fi-controller-looks-familiar-but-features-google-assistant|title=Stadia's Wi-Fi Controller Looks Familiar, But Features Google Assistant|first=Quintlyn|last=Bowers|work=GameSkinny|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=March 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStadia offers two tiers of service, a free Base level and a monthly subscription Pro level.

service operated by [[Google]]. It is advertised to be capable of streaming video games up to [[4K resolution]] at 60 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] with support for [[High-dynamic-range video|high-dynamic-range]], to players via the company's numerous data centers across the globe, provided they are using a sufficiently high-speed Internet connection. It is accessible through the [[Google Chrome]] web browser on desktop computers, [[Pixel (smartphone)|Pixel smartphones]], supported smartphones from Samsung, Razer and Asus<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://community.stadia.com/t5/Stadia-Community-Blog/This-Week-on-Stadia-Play-games-on-tens-of-millions-of-new-phones/ba-p/15326|title=This Week on Stadia: Play games on tens of millions of new phones|date=2020-02-18|website=community.stadia.com|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>, as well as [[Chrome OS]] tablets and [[Chromecast]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://support.google.com/stadia/answer/9338946?hl=en |title=Stadia FAQ |website=Stadia Help |publisher=Google |date=June 20, 2019 |access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe service is planned to be integrated with [[YouTube]], and its \"state share\" feature will allow viewers of a Stadia stream to launch a game on the service on the same [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] as the streamer. This has been used as a [[Unique selling proposition|selling point]] for the service. It is compatible with [[USB human interface device class|HID class USB]] controllers, though a proprietary controller manufactured by Google with a direct Wi-Fi link to data centers is available alongside the service. Despite comparisons, Stadia is not similar to [[Netflix]], in that Stadia requires users to purchase games to stream via Stadia rather than pay for access to a library of games. While the base service is free, a [[premium business model|Pro tier]] monthly subscription allows users to stream at higher rates of upto [[4K resolutions]], surround sound, and offers 1-3 free games a month that the user has access to while they are subscribed to Pro with or without gaps.\n\nKnown in development as '''Project Stream''', the service was debuted through a [[Software release life cycle#Open and closed beta|closed beta]] running ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'' in October 2018. Stadia was publicly released on November 19, 2019 in selected countries and received a mixed reception from reviewers. The service competes with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Now]] service, [[Nvidia]]'s [[GeForce Now]], and [[Microsoft]]'s [[XCloud|Project xCloud]]. On 8 April, 2020 Google started rolling out Stadia free base service, along with giving new users two months of Pro subscription.\n\n== Features ==\nStadia is a cloud gaming service,<ref name=\"HighlyTechno\" /> and does not require additional computer hardware, only requiring the device to have an Internet connection and support for [[Google Chrome]]. Stadia works atop [[YouTube]]'s functionality in streaming media to the user, as game streaming is seen as an extension of watching [[Video game live streaming|video game live streams]], according to Google's [[Phil Harrison]]; the name \"Stadia\", the Latin plural of \"stadium\", is meant to reflect that it is a collection of entertainment, which the viewer can choose to sit back and watch, or take an active part in.<ref name=\"eu interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-google-stadia-phil-harrison-majd-bakar-interview |title = The big interview: Phil Harrison and Majd Bakar on Google Stadia | first = Richard | last= Leadbetter | date = March 19, 2019 | access-date = March 19, 2019 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref> As Google had built out a large number of data centers across the globe, the company believes that Stadia is in a better position for cloud gaming compared to past endeavours like [[OnLive]], [[PlayStation Now]], and [[Gaikai]], as most players would be geographically close to a data center. Stadia supports the streaming of games in [[High-dynamic-range video|HDR]] at 60 frames per second with [[4K resolution]], and anticipates eventually reaching 120 frames per second at [[8K resolution]].<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Players can start games without having to download new content to their personal device. Players can opt to record or stream their sessions onto YouTube through Stadia. Viewers of such streams can launch the games directly from the stream with the same save state that they were just watching.<ref name=\"eu interview\" />\n\nThe streaming technology enables new features on Stadia. Stream Connect allows Stadia players, cooperatively playing the same game with friends, to have [[picture-in-picture]] inserts on their display of their friends' point-of-view in the game. This feature was first launched with the release of ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2019/12/17/stadia-ghost-recon-breakpoint-first-stream-connect-game/ | title = Stadia\u2019s first Stream Connect game, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, arrives tomorrow | first = Sherif | last = Saed | date = December 17, 2019 | accessdate = December 17, 2019 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> The streaming technology allows for larger number of concurrent players on a game server; for example, servers for ''[[Grid (2019 video game)|Grid]]'' are normally limited to 16 players, while the Stadia version will allow up to 40.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/grid-for-stadia-has-a-40-car-mode-that-isnt-possible-with-other-hardware/ | title = Grid for Stadia has a 40 car mode that 'isn't possible with other hardware' | first= Shaun  |last = Prescott | date=  November 23, 2019 | accessdate = December 17, 2019 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}</ref>\n\nWhile Stadia can use any [[USB human interface device class|HID-class]] [[USB]] controller, Google developed its own controller which connects via Wi-Fi directly to the Google data center in which the game is running, to reduce input latency.<ref name=\"eu interview\" /> Google is also exploring further ways to reduce latency, using an idea called \"negative latency\" which involves prediction of user input through various means so that any apparent network lag between controller and game response is minimized.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/10/google-stadia-negative-latency/ | title = Google wants to reduce Stadia lag with 'negative latency' | first=  Marc | last= DeAngelis | date = October 10, 2019 | accessdate = October 10, 2019  |work = [[Engadget]]}}</ref> During its GDC 2019 keynote reveal, Google confirmed that the controller would also feature [[Google Assistant]], which will automatically search YouTube for relevant, helpful videos related to the game they are currently playing at the touch of a key.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/1hak5/stadias-wi-fi-controller-looks-familiar-but-features-google-assistant|title=Stadia's Wi-Fi Controller Looks Familiar, But Features Google Assistant|first=Quintlyn|last=Bowers|work=GameSkinny|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=March 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStadia offers two tiers of service, a free Base level and a monthly subscription Pro level. The Pro tier costs approximately {{USD|10}} per month, but allows users to access higher streaming rates, access a library of free games over time, and get discounts on other games offered for Stadia.<ref name=\"verge\" /> Harrison stated they are also looking into offering publisher subscriptions and other models in the future;<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/09/google-stadia-publisher-subscriptions/ | title= Google Stadia's getting publisher subscriptions on top of Stadia Pro | first=  Katherine | last =Castle | date = June 9, 2019 | access-date = June 9, 2019 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}</ref> for example, [[Ubisoft]] announced its Uplay Plus subscription service will be available to Stadia users.\n\nThe internet speed requirements for the different types of picture quality from Stadia's service is as follows:<ref>{{cite web |title=Stadia Founder's Edition |url=https://store.google.com/product/stadia_founders_edition |website=Google Store |accessdate=26 June 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626230111/https://store.google.com/product/stadia_founders_edition |archivedate=26 June 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Speedtest |url=https://projectstream.google.com/speedtest |website=Google Store |accessdate=26 June 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626214359/https://projectstream.google.com/speedtest |archivedate=26 June 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Bandwidth required\n!Video quality\n!Audio quality\n|-\n|10 MBit/s\n|[[720p]], 60{{nbsp}}[[Frame rate|FPS]]\n|[[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]]\n|-\n|20 MBit/s\n|[[1080p]] [[High-dynamic-range video|HDR Video]], 60{{nbsp}}FPS\n|[[5.1 surround sound|5.1 Surround]]\n|-\n|35 MBit/s\n|[[4K resolution|4K]] HDR Video, 60{{nbsp}}FPS\n|5.1 Surround\n|}\n\n== Hardware ==\nUpon launch, Stadia's cloud hardware initially uses a custom [[Intel]]<ref name=\"extremetech-1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.extremetech.com/gaming/288237-google-stadia-is-powered-by-intel-cpus-not-amd|title=Google Stadia is powered by Intel, not AMD|first=Joel|last=Hruska|date=March 25, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019|work=[[ExtremeTech]]}}</ref> [[x86]] processor clocked at 2.7&nbsp;GHz, with [[Advanced Vector Extensions|AVX2]] and 9.5 megabytes of L2+L3 cache.<ref name=\"pcgamer-1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/google-stadias-specs-and-latency-revealed/|title=Google Stadia's specs and latency revealed|first=Paul|last=Lilly|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=March 26, 2019|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref> It also uses a custom [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[graphics processing unit|GPU]] based on the [[Radeon RX Vega series|Vega]] architecture with [[High Bandwidth Memory|HBM2]] memory, 56 compute units, and 10.7 [[FLOPS|teraFLOPS]].<ref name=\"pcgamer-1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Stadia-uses-a-custom-AMD-Vega-56-GCN-1-5-GPU.421131.0.html|title=Google Stadia uses a custom AMD Vega 56 GCN 1.5 GPU|last=Subramaniam|first=Vaidyanathan|website=Notebookcheck|language=en|access-date=2019-10-30}}</ref> The service also has [[solid-state drive]] storage, and 16&nbsp;GB of [[random-access memory|RAM]] (supporting up to 484&nbsp;GB/s bandwidth) shared between the GPU and the [[Central processing unit|CPU]].<ref name=\"pcgamer-1\" />\n\nGoogle developed the controller for Stadia.

Behenna made efforts to develop ties with local Iraqis as part of his counter-insurgency mission and, already fluent in Spanish, began to teach himself Arabic. He was known to host cookouts with his platoon for local interpreters, engage with civilians on the street and encouraged his soldiers to learn about Iraqi culture and to eat their food. This desire to interact with locals caused some friction within his platoon, with one soldier commenting: \n<blockquote>\nHe would talk to random civilians, anyone. He was the type of guy that liked Iraqis. That was the only annoying thing about him. He was always about saving the country.<ref name=latimes1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Behenna's platoon was returning to their base with two detainees when their convoy was hit by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. One of the platoon's [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAPs]] was destroyed and two soldiers, [[Specialist (rank)|Specialists]] Adam Kohlhaas and Steven Christofferson, were killed and several others grievously wounded. The loss of his men weighed heavily on Behenna who at one point broke down in tears over the incident during a group therapy session.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nOn May 5, Behenna received information on a man suspected by military intelligence to be working for [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], which they believed was responsible for the April 21 attack. Acting on this intelligence, Behenna's platoon raided a house in Butoma where they found the man identified by military intelligence, Ali Mansur Mohamed, along with a cache of ammunition, an [[RPK]] light machine gun and a passport with Syrian visas. After securing Mansur and collecting the arms cache, Behenna's platoon returned to base with Mansur and turned him over to military intelligence agents for questioning.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nLess than two weeks later, Mansur was ordered released due to military intelligence having insufficient evidence to hold him any longer. Behenna's platoon was tasked with the return of Mansur to town as soon as possible.

Behenna made efforts to develop ties with local Iraqis as part of his counter-insurgency mission and, already fluent in Spanish, began to teach himself Arabic. He was known to host cookouts with his platoon for local interpreters, engage with civilians on the street and encouraged his soldiers to learn about Iraqi culture and to eat their food. This desire to interact with locals caused some friction within his platoon, with one soldier commenting: \n<blockquote>\nHe would talk to random civilians, anyone. He was the type of guy that liked Iraqis. That was the only annoying thing about him. He was always about saving the country.<ref name=latimes1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nOn April 21, 2008, Behenna's platoon was returning to their base with two detainees when their convoy was hit by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]]. One of the platoon's [[MRAP (armored vehicle)|MRAPs]] was destroyed and two soldiers, [[Specialist (rank)|Specialists]] Adam Kohlhaas and Steven Christofferson, were killed and several others grievously wounded. The loss of his men weighed heavily on Behenna who at one point broke down in tears over the incident during a group therapy session.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nOn May 5, Behenna received information on a man suspected by military intelligence to be working for [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], which they believed was responsible for the April 21 attack. Acting on this intelligence, Behenna's platoon raided a house in Butoma where they found the man identified by military intelligence, Ali Mansur Mohamed, along with a cache of ammunition, an [[RPK]] light machine gun and a passport with Syrian visas. After securing Mansur and collecting the arms cache, Behenna's platoon returned to base with Mansur and turned him over to military intelligence agents for questioning.<ref name=latimes2/>\n\nLess than two weeks later, Mansur was ordered released due to military intelligence having insufficient evidence to hold him any longer. Behenna's platoon was tasked with the return of Mansur to town as soon as possible.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo.

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary.

All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were Peninsular War veterans.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=484}} In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nMany of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.{{efn|Captain [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer]] [[Royal Horse Artillery|RHA]], thought the Brunswickers \"...perfect children.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse.

At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=191\u2013192}} Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the Anglo-allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.\n\n[[File:General D H Chass\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|General D H Chass\u00e9|General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9]]]]\n\nIt was at this critical moment that the Dutch General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9|Chass\u00e9]] engaged the advancing French forces.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=196\u2013199}} Chass\u00e9's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain [[Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin|Krahmer de Bichin]].

The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them.

As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank, Wellington was able to shift to the offensive\".{{sfn|Steele|2014|p=178}}\n\n==Battlefield today==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:0 Braine-l'Alleud 051012 (1).JPG|thumb|The [[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo]]\n\nSome portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\".{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|p=345}} In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument. The [[Lion's Mound]], a giant artificial hill, was constructed here using {{convert|300000|m3|cuyd}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.\n\n{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on 18&nbsp;June 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10218931/Rescuing-the-farm-where-Wellington-won-the-battle-of-Waterloo.html|title=Rescuing the farm where Wellington won the battle of Waterloo|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2013-08-02|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a two-[[euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2{{sfrac|1|2}} euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==Recent discovery at Mont St. Jean==\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium]], found evidence of a shooting clash that happened there between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 [[musket ball]]s and 3 amputated human leg bones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/human-remains-and-cannon-ball-unearthed-at-battle-of-waterloo-hospital-site/ |title=Human remains and cannon ball unearthed at Battle of Waterloo hospital site |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |work=[[ITV News]] |publisher=[[ITV plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/17/veterans-unearth-amputated-leg-bones-musket-balls-waterloo-field/ |title=Soldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital site |first=James |last=Crisp |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |page=16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10218931/Rescuing-the-farm-where-Wellington-won-the-battle-of-Waterloo.html|title=Rescuing the farm where Wellington won the battle of Waterloo|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2013-08-02|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a two-[[euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2{{sfrac|1|2}} euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==Recent discovery at Mont St. Jean==\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium]], found evidence of a shooting clash that happened there between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 [[musket ball]]s and 3 amputated human leg bones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/human-remains-and-cannon-ball-unearthed-at-battle-of-waterloo-hospital-site/ |title=Human remains and cannon ball unearthed at Battle of Waterloo hospital site |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |work=[[ITV News]] |publisher=[[ITV plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/17/veterans-unearth-amputated-leg-bones-musket-balls-waterloo-field/ |title=Soldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital site |first=James |last=Crisp |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |page=16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

This was the first Quebec provincial election in which women were allowed to vote, having been granted suffrage at the provincial level in 1940 and at the federal level in 1919.\n\nThis election marked Duplessis's comeback after having defeated Godbout in the [[1936 Quebec general election|1936 election]] and having lost to him in the [[1939 Quebec general election|1939 election]]. Unlike in the 1939 election, when the alcoholic Duplessis was clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies, ''le chef'' had benefited from the time he had spent in an American sanatorium in 1942-43, where he had sobered up, and in the 1944 election, Duplessis refrained from drinking.\n\nThe biggest issue during this election was provincial autonomy. In order to appeal to nationalist voters, Duplessis attacked the incumbent premier, claiming that he was not taking a strong enough stand against Ottawa. He mainly criticized Godbout for agreeing to transfer unemployment insurance from the province to the federal government. He also criticized the [[Rowell-Sirois Commission]] for its stance on [[unemployment insurance]] and [[equalization payments]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sarra-Bournet |first1=Michel |title=Biography - DUPLESSIS, MAURICE LE NOBLET |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/duplessis_maurice_le_noblet_18E.html |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography}}</ref>\n\nAnother reason Duplessis won the election was by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec by making the false claim in a violently anti-Semitic speech that the Dominion government together with the Godbout government had made a secret deal with the \"International Zionist Brotherhood\" to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for Jewish campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties.<ref>Knowles, Valerie ''Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006'', Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149.</ref> By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and if he were elected Premier, he would stop this plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. To further push on the message, the ''Union Nationale'' handed out campaign pamphlets warning about the alleged plan to bring 100,000 Jewish refugees to Quebec, which featured a cartoon of the standard stereotype of an evil-looking, hook-nosed Jew handing bags of money to Godbout while in the background a vast horde of dirty, disreputable-looking, hook-nosed Jewish refugees were ready to descend on ''la belle province''.<ref>Abella, Irving & Troper, Harold ''None is too many: Canada and the Jews of Europe, 1933-1948'', Toronto: L & O Denny, 1986 page 162.</ref> Through Duplessis's story about the plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely false, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election.<ref>Knowles, Valerie ''Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540-2006'', Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149.</ref> Duplessis's biographer [[Conrad Black]] argued that Duplessis was in no way personally anti-Semitic, but because the majority of Quebecois were at the time, Duplessis had merely used antisemitism to win the 1944 election.<ref>Black, Conrad ''Duplesisis'', Toronto: McClelland and Stewart, 1977 page 719</ref> Duplessis won another three elections in a row, for a total of five terms of office (four consecutive), before dying in office in 1959.\n\nIn this [[World War II|wartime]] election, Godbout's support for Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] in the [[Conscription Crisis of 1944]] may have contributed to his defeat.\n\nThe ''[[Bloc populaire canadien|Bloc Populaire]]'' won four seats on an anti-conscription platform. The [[Parti social d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (predecessor of the [[New Democratic Party of Quebec|New Democratic Party]]) won one seat.

Party member [[David C\u00f4t\u00e9]] was elected to the legislature, but in July 1945, he decided to sit as an independent.\n\n==Results==\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\"\n|- bgcolor=\"darkgray\"\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader\n!rowspan=\"2\"|# of<br />candidates\n!colspan=\"3\"|Seats\n!colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote\n|- bgcolor=\"darkgray\"\n|align=\"center\"|[[1939 Quebec general election|1939]]\n|align=\"center\"|'''Elected'''\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n|align=\"center\"|#\n|align=\"center\"|%\n|align=\"center\"|% Change\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN|row-name}}\n| [[Maurice Duplessis]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|90  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|15  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|48    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|+220%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 38.02%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|-1.1%   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|Liberal|row-name}} \n| [[Ad\u00e9lard Godbout]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|91  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|70  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|37    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|-47.1%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| '''39.35'''%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|-14.7%   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|Bloc populaire|row-name}}\n| [[Andr\u00e9 Laurendeau]] <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|80  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|*  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|4    <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|*  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 14.40%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|*   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian party colour|QC|CCF|row}}\n|[[Parti social d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec|Co-operative Commonwealth]] \n| Romuald-Joseph Lamoureux <ref>[http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-0-17-271-1381-11/index_souvenirs/politique_economie/maurice_duplessis_ministre Maurice Duplessis reprend le pouvoir, Les Archives de Radio-Canada, August 8, 1944]</ref> <!--leader-->\n|align=\"right\"|25  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|0  <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|1   <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|*  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 2.56%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|*   <!--%ch.votes-->\n{{Canadian_politics/party_colours/Independents/row}}\n|colspan=2|Other\n|align=\"right\"|47  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|1   <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|1 <!--elected-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;  <!--%ch.seats-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;      <!--vote-->\n|align=\"right\"| 5.67%    <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|+3.3%   <!--%ch.votes-->\n|- \n|colspan=\"3\"|'''Total'''\n!align=\"right\"|&nbsp;  <!--cand-->\n|align=\"right\"|86   <!--prev-->\n!align=\"right\"|91  <!--elected-->\n!align=\"right\"|+5.8%  <!--%ch.seats-->\n!align=\"right\"|&nbsp;   <!--vote-->\n!align=\"right\"|100%   <!--%vote-->\n|align=\"right\"|&nbsp;  <!--%ch.votes-->\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Note:'''\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Information on party's actions in previous election not available.{{bar box|title=Popular vote|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{bar percent|PLQ|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Liberal}}|39.35}}\n{{bar percent|UN|{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN}}|38.02}}\n{{bar percent|BP|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Bloc populaire}}|14.40}}\n{{bar percent|CCF|{{Canadian party colour|QC|CCF}}|2.56}}\n{{bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Independent}}|5.67}}}}{{bar box|title=Seats summary|titlebar=#ddd|width=600px|barwidth=410px|bars={{bar percent|UN|{{Canadian party colour|QC|UN}}|52.75}}\n{{bar percent|PLQ|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Liberal}}|40.66}}\n{{bar percent|BP|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Bloc populaire}}|4.40}}\n{{bar percent|CCF|{{Canadian party colour|QC|CCF}}|1.10}}\n{{bar percent|Others|{{Canadian party colour|QC|Independent}}|1.10}}}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Quebec premiers]]\n* [[Politics of Quebec]]\n* [[Timeline of Quebec history]]\n* [[List of political parties in Canada#Quebec|List of Quebec political parties]]\n* [[22nd Legislative Assembly of Quebec]]\n\n{{Quebec elections}}\n\n[[Category:1944 elections in Canada]]\n[[Category:Elections in Quebec]]\n[[Category:1944 in Quebec]]\n[[Category:August 1944 events]]\n", "name_user": "Kawnhr", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_Quebec_general_election"}
