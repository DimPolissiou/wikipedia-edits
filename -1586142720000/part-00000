Other meridians are curves (or possibly straight from pole to equator), regularly spaced along parallels.\n; Conic: In standard presentation, conic (or conical) projections map meridians as straight lines, and parallels as arcs of circles.\n; Pseudoconical: In standard presentation, pseudoconical projections represent the central meridian as a straight line, other meridians as complex curves, and parallels as circular arcs.\n; Azimuthal: In standard presentation, azimuthal projections map meridians as straight lines and parallels as complete, concentric circles. They are radially symmetrical. In any presentation (or aspect), they preserve directions from the center point. This means great circles through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map.\n; Pseudoazimuthal: In standard presentation, pseudoazimuthal projections map the equator and central meridian to perpendicular, intersecting straight lines. They map parallels to complex curves bowing away from the equator, and meridians to complex curves bowing in toward the central meridian. Listed here after pseudocylindrical as generally similar to them in shape and purpose.\n; Other: Typically calculated from formula, and not based on a particular projection\n; Polyhedral maps: Polyhedral maps can be folded up into a polyhedral approximation to the sphere, using particular projection to map each face with low distortion.\n\n===Properties===\n; Conformal: Preserves angles locally, implying that local shapes are not distorted and that local scale is constant in all directions from any chosen point.\n; Equal-area: Area measure is conserved everywhere.\n; Compromise: Neither conformal nor equal-area, but a balance intended to reduce overall distortion.\n; Equidistant: All distances from one (or two) points are correct. Other equidistant properties are mentioned in the notes.\n; Gnomonic: All great circles are straight lines.\n; Retroazimuthal: Direction to a fixed location B (by the shortest route) corresponds to the direction on the map from A to B.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |last=Snyder |first=John P. |author-link=John P.

(A separate theory, [[general relativity]], is used for gravity.) In this model, the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in nature arise from properties of our universe called [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge invariance]] and [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. The forces are [[force carrier|transmitted by particles]] known as [[gauge boson]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=603\u2013604}}</ref>\n\nIn the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a [[boson]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] zero, no [[electric charge]] and no [[color charge|colour charge]]. It is also very unstable, [[particle decay|decaying]] into other particles almost immediately. The Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[field (physics)|field]], with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] symmetry. The Higgs field has a \"[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat-shaped]]\" potential. In its [[vacuum state|ground state]], this causes the field to have a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and as a result, below a very high energy it breaks the [[weak isospin]] symmetry of the [[electroweak interaction]]. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]'s Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms.) When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the SU(2) and U(1) [[gauge boson]]s (the \"[[Higgs mechanism]]\") to become the longitudinal components of the [[mass generation|now-massive]] [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak force]]. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs particle, or may couple separately to other particles known as [[fermion]]s (via [[Yukawa coupling]]s), causing these to [[mass generation|acquire mass]] as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqNg819PiZY Demystifying the Higgs Boson with Leonard Susskind], [[Leonard Susskind]] presents an explanation of what the Higgs mechanism is, and what it means to \"give mass to particles.\" He also explains what's at stake for the future of physics and cosmology. 2012-07-30.</ref>\n\n=== The problem of gauge boson mass ===\nField theories had been used with great success in understanding the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[strong force]], but by around 1960 all attempts to create a ''gauge invariant'' theory for the [[weak force]] (and its combination with [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]] [[electromagnetism]], the [[electroweak interaction]]) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The problem was that the symmetry requirements in [[gauge theory]] predicted that both electromagnetism's gauge boson (the [[photon]]) and the weak force's gauge bosons ([[W and Z bosons|W and Z]]) should have zero mass. Although the photon is indeed massless, experiments show that the weak force's bosons have mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=372\u2013373}}</ref> This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else{{snd}} unknown{{snd}} was giving these particles their mass, but all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical issues.\n\nBy the late 1950s, physicists had not resolved these issues, which were significant obstacles to developing a full-fledged theory for particle physics.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking ====\nBy the early 1960s, physicists had realised that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|a given symmetry law might not always be followed]] under certain conditions, at least in some areas of physics.<ref group=lower-alpha>It is quite common for a law of physics to hold true only if certain assumptions held true or only under certain conditions. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] apply only at speeds where [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] are negligible; and laws related to conductivity, gases, and classical physics (as opposed to quantum mechanics) may apply only within certain ranges of size, temperature, pressure, or other conditions.</ref> This is called [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]] and was recognised in the late 1950s by [[Yoichiro Nambu]]. Symmetry breaking can lead to surprising and unexpected results. In 1962 physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]]{{snd}} an expert in [[superconductivity]]{{snd}} wrote a paper that considered symmetry breaking in particle physics, and suggested that perhaps symmetry breaking might be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance in particle physics. If electroweak symmetry was somehow being broken, it might explain why electromagnetism's boson is massless, yet the weak force bosons have mass, and solve the problems. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, this was shown to be theoretically possible, at least for some limited ([[special relativity|non-relativistic]]) cases.\n\n=== Higgs mechanism ===\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}\nFollowing the 1962 and 1963 papers, three groups of researchers independently published the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] with similar conclusions and for all cases, not just some limited cases. They showed that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be \"broken\" if an unusual type of [[field (physics)|field]] existed throughout the universe, and indeed, some fundamental particles would [[mass generation|acquire mass]]. The field required for this to happen (which was purely hypothetical at the time) became known as the ''Higgs field'' (after [[Peter Higgs]], one of the researchers) and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking, known as the ''[[Higgs mechanism]]''. A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take ''less'' energy for the field to have a non-zero value than a zero value, unlike all other known fields, therefore, the Higgs field has a non-zero value (or ''vacuum expectation'') ''everywhere''. It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry, within a gauge invariant theory.\n\nAlthough these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving [[renormalization|\"sensible\" results]] that accurately described particles known at the time, and which, with exceptional accuracy, [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predicted several other particles discovered during the following years]].<ref name=\"predictions\" group=lower-alpha>The success of the Higgs-based electroweak theory and Standard Model is illustrated by their [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predictions]] of the mass of two particles later detected: the W boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|80.390 \u00b1 0.018 GeV}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|80.387 \u00b1 0.019 GeV}}), and the Z boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|91.1874 \u00b1 0.0021}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|91.1876 \u00b1 0.0021 GeV}}). Other accurate predictions included the [[weak neutral current]], the [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s, all later proven to exist as the theory said.</ref> During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. There was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed, but even without proof of the field, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s the question of whether or not the Higgs field existed, and therefore whether or not the entire Standard Model was correct, had come to be regarded as one of the most important [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered questions in particle physics]].\n\n==== Higgs field ====\nAccording to the Standard Model, a [[field (physics)|field]] of the necessary kind (the ''Higgs field'') exists throughout space and breaks certain symmetry laws of the [[electroweak interaction]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field in its lowest energy state, called its ''[[ground state]]''. At high energy levels this does not happen, and the gauge bosons of the weak force would be expected to become massless above those energy levels.</ref> Via the Higgs mechanism, this field causes the gauge bosons of the weak force to be massive at all temperatures below an extreme high value. When the weak force bosons acquire mass, this affects their range, which  becomes very small.{{#tag:ref |The range of a force is inversely proportional to the mass of the particles transmitting it.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Shu |first=F.

The movement and interactions of these particles with each other are limited by the energy\u2013time [[uncertainty principle]]. As a result, the more massive a single virtual particle is, the greater its energy, and therefore the shorter the distance it can travel. A particle's mass therefore, determines the maximum distance at which it can interact with other particles and on any force it mediates. By the same token, the reverse is also true: massless and near-massless particles can carry long distance forces. ''(See also: [[Compton wavelength]] and [[static forces and virtual-particle exchange]])'' Since experiments have shown that the weak force acts over only a very short range, this implies that massive gauge bosons must exist, and indeed, their masses have since been confirmed by measurement.|group=lower-alpha |name=\"massvsrange\"}} Furthermore, it was later realised that the same field would also explain, in a different way, why other fundamental constituents of matter (including [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) have mass.\n\nFor many decades, scientists had no way to determine whether or not the Higgs field existed, because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect.<ref group=lower-alpha>By the 1960s, many had already started to see gauge theories as failing to explain particle physics, because theorists had been unable to solve the mass problem or even explain how gauge theory could provide a solution. So the idea that the Standard Model{{snd}} which relied on a Higgs field, not yet proved to exist{{snd}} could be fundamentally incorrect, was not unreasonable. Against this, once the model was developed around 1972, no better theory existed, and its predictions and solutions were so accurate, that it became the preferred theory anyway. It then became crucial to science, to know whether or not it was ''correct''.</ref> Only proving the existence of the Higgs boson, and therefore the Higgs field, solved the problem.\n\nUnlike other known fields such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the Higgs field is [[scalar field|scalar]] and has a non-zero constant value in [[Vacuum state|vacuum]].

As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.\n\nRelated to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be \"new\" [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs discovery, as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC, provide physicists a sensitive tool to parse data for where the Standard Model fails, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction ====\nBelow an extremely high temperature, [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] causes the [[electroweak interaction]] to manifest in part as the short-ranged [[weak force]], which is carried by massive [[gauge boson]]s. In the history of the universe, electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to have happened shortly after the hot big bang, when the universe was at a temperature 159.5\u00b11.5&nbsp;[[GeV]] <ref>{{Cite journal\n      |author         = D'Onofrio, Michela and Rummukainen, Kari\n      |title          = Standard model cross-over on the lattice\n      |journal        = Phys.

Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson [[#Decay|decays]] very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the ''decay signature'') and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a ''decay channel'') of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.\n\nBecause Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{#tag:ref|The example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7 TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10 [[picobarn]],<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /> while the total cross-section for a proton\u2013proton collision is 110 [[millibarn]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm\n|title=Collisions\n|website=LHC Machine Outreach\n|publisher=CERN\n|accessdate=26 July 2012\n}}</ref>|name=\"production_rate\"|group=lower-alpha}} and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must \"show the same picture\" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, [[particle physicist]]s require that the [[statistical analysis]] of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events{{snd}} i.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 [[standard deviation]]s (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.\n\nTo find the Higgs boson, a powerful [[particle accelerator]] was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 [[petabyte]]s per year as of 2012) produced by the collisions.<ref name=\"msnbc-discovery\" /> For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] was constructed at [[CERN]] with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 [[TeV]]{{snd}} over seven times any previous collider{{snd}} and over 300 trillion (3\u00d710<sup>14</sup>) LHC proton\u2013proton collisions were analysed by the [[LHC Computing Grid]], the world's largest [[computing grid]] (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a [[distributed computing|worldwide network]] across 36 countries.<ref name=\"msnbc-discovery\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/ |title=Welcome to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=WLCG{{snd}} Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |access-date=14 November 2012 |quote=[A] global collaboration of more than 170 computing centres in 36 countries \u2026 to store, distribute and analyse the ~25 Petabytes (25 million Gigabytes) of data annually generated by the Large Hadron Collider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://home.cern/about/computing/worldwide-lhc-computing-grid |title=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |date=November 2017 |quote=It now links thousands of computers and storage systems in over 170 centres across 41 countries. \u2026 The WLCG is the world's largest computing grid}}</ref>\n\n==== Search before 4 July 2012 ====\nThe first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the [[Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider]] (LEP) at CERN in the 1990s.

There was no guarantee that the Tevatron would be able to find the Higgs, but it was the only supercollider that was operational since the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) was still under construction and the planned [[Superconducting Super Collider]] had been cancelled in 1993 and never completed. The Tevatron was only able to exclude further ranges for the Higgs mass, and was shut down on 30 September 2011 because it no longer could keep up with the LHC. The final analysis of the data excluded the possibility of a Higgs boson with a mass between {{val|147|u=GeV/c2}} and {{val|180|u=GeV/c2}}.

However, before [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon L. Glashow]] extended the [[electroweak unification]] models in 1961, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the [[weak nuclear force]] or a possible unified [[electroweak interaction]]. [[Fermion]]s with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Dirac Lagrangian]] for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] as required for mass, so they must be massless.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion <math>\\psi</math> is <math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi</math>. This is ''not'' invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing <math>\\psi</math> in terms of left and right handed components:\n\n:<math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\;=\\;-m(\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_R+\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_L)</math>\ni.e., contributions from <math>\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_L</math> and <math>\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_R</math> terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle [[chirality]]. Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same [[SU(2)]] and [[SU(3)]] representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.</ref>) [[W and Z bosons]] are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge, and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that ''none'' of the standard model fermions ''or'' bosons could \"begin\" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not \"break\" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, ''and'' had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of [[Goldstone's theorem]]) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.\n\nA solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem,<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"GoldstoneNote\">[[Goldstone's theorem]] only applies to gauges having [[Lorentz covariance|manifest Lorentz covariance]], a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]]<!--BRITISH ENGLISH SPELLING--> requires a [[gauge fixing|gauge to be fixed]] and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to {{harvp|Bernstein |1974|p=8}}:\n: \"the \"radiation gauge\" condition {{nowrap|1=\u2207\u22c5A(''x'') = 0}} is clearly noncovariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all [[Lorentz frame]]s, the [[photon field]] A<sub>\u03bc</sub>(''x'') cannot transform like a [[four-vector]]. This is no catastrophe, since the photon ''field'' is not an [[observable]], and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which ''are'' observable have covariant structures .... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone ''et al.'' proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear.\" [Emphasis in original]\n{{harvp|Bernstein |1974}} contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see [[#external links|external links]]</ref> that under certain conditions it ''might'' theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken ''without'' disrupting gauge invariance and ''without'' any new massless particles or forces, and having \"sensible\" ([[renormalization|renormalisable]]) results mathematically.

It can have this effect because of its unusual \"Mexican hat\" shaped potential whose lowest \"point\" is not at its \"centre\". In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires ''less'' energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value ''everywhere''. Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because [[scalar field]] components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], and couple to the fermions via [[Yukawa coupling]], thereby producing the expected mass terms. When symmetry breaks under these conditions, the [[Goldstone boson]]s that arise ''interact'' with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles. The intractable problems of both underlying theories \"neutralise\" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field.

Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi constant]] and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about {{val|161|u=GeV/c2}} at 95% [[confidence level]] (this upper limit would increase to {{val|185|u=GeV/c2}} if the lower bound of {{val|114.4|u=GeV/c2}} from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for<ref name=\"EWWG\">{{cite web |url=http://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/ |title=LEP Electroweak Working Group}}</ref>).

If the collided particles are [[hadron]]s such as the [[proton]] or [[antiproton]]{{snd}} as is the case in the LHC and Tevatron{{snd}} then it is most likely that two of the [[gluon]]s binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of [[virtual particle|virtual]] quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual [[top quark|top]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n* ''Higgs Strahlung''. If an elementary [[fermion]] collides with an anti-fermion{{snd}} e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an [[electron]] with a [[positron]]{{snd}} the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as ''associated production''.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n* ''Weak boson fusion''. Another possibility when two (anti-)fermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson. The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type. So, for example, an [[up quark]] may exchange a Z boson with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n* ''Top fusion''. The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely (by two orders of magnitude). This process involves two colliding gluons, which each decay into a heavy quark\u2013antiquark pair. A quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine to form a Higgs particle.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n\n=== Decay ===\n[[File:Higgsdecaywidth.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the [[decay width]] of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass.]]\nQuantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/jun/22/higgs-boson-particlephysics |title=Why does the Higgs decay? |first=Lily |last=Asquith |work=Life and Physics |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the difference in mass, the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself.

Each of these possible processes has its own probability, expressed as the ''branching ratio''; the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process. The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass (see plot).\n\nOne way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermion\u2013antifermion pair. As general rule, the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\">{{cite web\n|title=Higgs bosons: theory and searches\n|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/reviews/rpp2012-rev-higgs-boson.pdf\n|website=PDGLive\n|publisher=Particle Data Group\n|date=12 July 2012\n|accessdate=15 August 2012\n}}</ref> By this logic the most common decay should be into a [[top quark|top]]\u2013antitop quark pair. However, such a decay would only be possible if the Higgs were heavier than ~{{val|346|u=GeV/c2}}, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a [[bottom quark|bottom]]\u2013antibottom quark pair, which happens 57.7% of the time.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a [[tau particle|tau]]\u2013antitau pair, which happens only about 6.3% of the time.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" />\n\nAnother possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons. The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 21.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. The decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.6% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}),<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons ([[electron]]s or [[muon]]s).\n\nDecay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., [[gluon]]s or [[photon]]s) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" /> The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.6% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" />\n\n=== Alternative models ===\n{{Main|Alternatives to the Standard Model Higgs}}\n\nThe Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the [[Two-Higgs-Doublet Model|two-Higgs-doublet models]] (2HDM), which predict the existence of a [[quintet]] of scalar particles: two [[CP violation|CP-even]] neutral Higgs bosons h<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>0</sup>, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A<sup>0</sup>, and two charged Higgs particles H<sup>\u00b1</sup>. [[Supersymmetry]] (\"SUSY\") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} neutral Higgs boson.\n\nThe key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions (\"coupling\") and exact decay processes (\"branching ratios\"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions (\"gauge-[[phobia|phobic]]\") or just gauge bosons (\"fermiophobic\"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Branco\n | first = G.

(A separate theory, [[general relativity]], is used for gravity.) In this model, the [[fundamental interaction|fundamental forces]] in nature arise from properties of our universe called [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge invariance]] and [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. The forces are [[force carrier|transmitted by particles]] known as [[gauge boson]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=49\u201352}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tipler|Llewellyn|2003|pp=603\u2013604}}</ref>\n\nIn the Standard Model, the Higgs particle is a [[boson]] with [[spin (physics)|spin]] zero, no [[electric charge]] and no [[color charge|colour charge]]. It is also very unstable, [[particle decay|decaying]] into other particles almost immediately. The Higgs field is a [[scalar field|scalar]] [[field (physics)|field]], with two neutral and two electrically charged components that form a complex [[doublet (physics)|doublet]] of the [[weak isospin]] [[SU(2)]] symmetry. The Higgs field has a \"[[Spontaneous symmetry breaking#Mexican hat potential|Mexican hat-shaped]]\" potential. In its [[vacuum state|ground state]], this causes the field to have a nonzero value everywhere (including otherwise empty space), and as a result, below a very high energy it breaks the [[weak isospin]] symmetry of the [[electroweak interaction]]. (Technically the non-zero expectation value converts the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]'s Yukawa coupling terms into mass terms.) When this happens, three components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the SU(2) and U(1) [[gauge boson]]s (the \"[[Higgs mechanism]]\") to become the longitudinal components of the [[mass generation|now-massive]] [[W and Z bosons]] of the [[weak force]]. The remaining electrically neutral component either manifests as a Higgs particle, or may couple separately to other particles known as [[fermion]]s (via [[Yukawa coupling]]s), causing these to [[mass generation|acquire mass]] as well.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqNg819PiZY Demystifying the Higgs Boson with Leonard Susskind], [[Leonard Susskind]] presents an explanation of what the Higgs mechanism is, and what it means to \"give mass to particles.\" He also explains what's at stake for the future of physics and cosmology. 2012-07-30.</ref>\n\n=== The problem of gauge boson mass ===\nField theories had been used with great success in understanding the [[electromagnetic field]] and the [[strong force]], but by around 1960 all attempts to create a ''gauge invariant'' theory for the [[weak force]] (and its combination with [[fundamental interaction|fundamental force]] [[electromagnetism]], the [[electroweak interaction]]) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The problem was that the symmetry requirements in [[gauge theory]] predicted that both electromagnetism's gauge boson (the [[photon]]) and the weak force's gauge bosons ([[W and Z bosons|W and Z]]) should have zero mass. Although the photon is indeed massless, experiments show that the weak force's bosons have mass.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|2008|pp=372\u2013373}}</ref> This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else{{snd}} unknown{{snd}} was giving these particles their mass, but all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical issues.\n\nBy the late 1950s, physicists had not resolved these issues, which were significant obstacles to developing a full-fledged theory for particle physics.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking ====\nBy the early 1960s, physicists had realised that [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|a given symmetry law might not always be followed]] under certain conditions, at least in some areas of physics.<ref group=lower-alpha>It is quite common for a law of physics to hold true only if certain assumptions held true or only under certain conditions. For example, [[Newton's laws of motion]] apply only at speeds where [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] are negligible; and laws related to conductivity, gases, and classical physics (as opposed to quantum mechanics) may apply only within certain ranges of size, temperature, pressure, or other conditions.</ref> This is called [[spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry breaking]] and was recognised in the late 1950s by [[Yoichiro Nambu]]. Symmetry breaking can lead to surprising and unexpected results. In 1962 physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip Anderson]]{{snd}} an expert in [[superconductivity]]{{snd}} wrote a paper that considered symmetry breaking in particle physics, and suggested that perhaps symmetry breaking might be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance in particle physics. If electroweak symmetry was somehow being broken, it might explain why electromagnetism's boson is massless, yet the weak force bosons have mass, and solve the problems. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, this was shown to be theoretically possible, at least for some limited ([[special relativity|non-relativistic]]) cases.\n\n=== Higgs mechanism ===\n{{Main|Higgs mechanism}}\nFollowing the 1962 and 1963 papers, three groups of researchers independently published the [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers]] with similar conclusions and for all cases, not just some limited cases. They showed that the conditions for electroweak symmetry would be \"broken\" if an unusual type of [[field (physics)|field]] existed throughout the universe, and indeed, some fundamental particles would [[mass generation|acquire mass]]. The field required for this to happen (which was purely hypothetical at the time) became known as the ''Higgs field'' (after [[Peter Higgs]], one of the researchers) and the mechanism by which it led to symmetry breaking, known as the ''[[Higgs mechanism]]''. A key feature of the necessary field is that it would take ''less'' energy for the field to have a non-zero value than a zero value, unlike all other known fields, therefore, the Higgs field has a non-zero value (or ''vacuum expectation'') ''everywhere''. It was the first proposal capable of showing how the weak force gauge bosons could have mass despite their governing symmetry, within a gauge invariant theory.\n\nAlthough these ideas did not gain much initial support or attention, by 1972 they had been developed into a comprehensive theory and proved capable of giving [[renormalization|\"sensible\" results]] that accurately described particles known at the time, and which, with exceptional accuracy, [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predicted several other particles discovered during the following years]].<ref name=\"predictions\" group=lower-alpha>The success of the Higgs-based electroweak theory and Standard Model is illustrated by their [[Standard Model#Tests and predictions|predictions]] of the mass of two particles later detected: the W boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|80.390 \u00b1 0.018 GeV}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|80.387 \u00b1 0.019 GeV}}), and the Z boson (predicted mass: {{nowrap|91.1874 \u00b1 0.0021}}, experimental measurement: {{nowrap|91.1876 \u00b1 0.0021 GeV}}). Other accurate predictions included the [[weak neutral current]], the [[gluon]], and the [[top quark|top]] and [[charm quark]]s, all later proven to exist as the theory said.</ref> During the 1970s these theories rapidly became the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics. There was not yet any direct evidence that the Higgs field existed, but even without proof of the field, the accuracy of its predictions led scientists to believe the theory might be true. By the 1980s the question of whether or not the Higgs field existed, and therefore whether or not the entire Standard Model was correct, had come to be regarded as one of the most important [[Unanswered questions in physics|unanswered questions in particle physics]].\n\n==== Higgs field ====\nAccording to the Standard Model, a [[field (physics)|field]] of the necessary kind (the ''Higgs field'') exists throughout space and breaks certain symmetry laws of the [[electroweak interaction]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Electroweak symmetry is broken by the Higgs field in its lowest energy state, called its ''[[ground state]]''.

The movement and interactions of these particles with each other are limited by the energy\u2013time [[uncertainty principle]]. As a result, the more massive a single virtual particle is, the greater its energy, and therefore the shorter the distance it can travel. A particle's mass therefore, determines the maximum distance at which it can interact with other particles and on any force it mediates. By the same token, the reverse is also true: massless and near-massless particles can carry long distance forces. ''(See also: [[Compton wavelength]] and [[static forces and virtual-particle exchange]])'' Since experiments have shown that the weak force acts over only a very short range, this implies that massive gauge bosons must exist, and indeed, their masses have since been confirmed by measurement.|group=lower-alpha |name=\"massvsrange\"}} Furthermore, it was later realised that the same field would also explain, in a different way, why other fundamental constituents of matter (including [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s) have mass.\n\nFor many decades, scientists had no way to determine whether or not the Higgs field existed, because the technology needed for its detection did not exist at that time. If the Higgs field did exist, then it would be unlike any other known fundamental field, but it also was possible that these key ideas, or even the entire Standard Model, were somehow incorrect.<ref group=lower-alpha>By the 1960s, many had already started to see gauge theories as failing to explain particle physics, because theorists had been unable to solve the mass problem or even explain how gauge theory could provide a solution. So the idea that the Standard Model{{snd}} which relied on a Higgs field, not yet proved to exist{{snd}} could be fundamentally incorrect, was not unreasonable. Against this, once the model was developed around 1972, no better theory existed, and its predictions and solutions were so accurate, that it became the preferred theory anyway. It then became crucial to science, to know whether or not it was ''correct''.</ref> Only proving the existence of the Higgs boson, and therefore the Higgs field, solved the problem.\n\nUnlike other known fields such as the [[electromagnetic field]], the Higgs field is [[scalar field|scalar]] and has a non-zero constant value in [[Vacuum state|vacuum]]. The existence of the Higgs field became the last unverified part of the Standard Model of particle physics, and for several decades was considered \"the central problem in particle physics\".<ref name=\"Proceedings_1986\" /><ref name=\"Higgs_Hunters_Guide\" />\n\nThe presence of the field, now confirmed by experimental investigation, explains [[mass generation|why some fundamental particles have mass]], despite the [[symmetry (physics)|symmetries]] controlling their interactions implying that they should be massless. It also resolves several other long-standing puzzles, such as the reason for the extremely short range of the [[weak interaction|weak force]].\n\nAlthough the Higgs field is non-zero everywhere and its effects are ubiquitous, proving its existence was far from easy. In principle, it can be proved to exist by detecting its [[excited state|excitations]], which manifest as Higgs particles (the ''Higgs boson''), but these are extremely difficult to produce and detect.

As more precise measurements of its properties are made, more advanced extensions may be suggested or excluded. As experimental means to measure the field's behaviours and interactions are developed, this fundamental field may be better understood. If the Higgs field had not been discovered, the Standard Model would have needed to be modified or superseded.\n\nRelated to this, a belief generally exists among physicists that there is likely to be \"new\" [[physics beyond the Standard Model]], and the Standard Model will at some point be extended or superseded. The Higgs discovery, as well as the many measured collisions occurring at the LHC, provide physicists a sensitive tool to parse data for where the Standard Model fails, and could provide considerable evidence guiding researchers into future theoretical developments.\n\n==== Symmetry breaking of the electroweak interaction ====\nBelow an extremely high temperature, [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] causes the [[electroweak interaction]] to manifest in part as the short-ranged [[weak force]], which is carried by massive [[gauge boson]]s. In the history of the universe, electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to have happened shortly after the hot big bang, when the universe was at a temperature 159.5\u00b11.5&nbsp;[[GeV]] <ref>{{Cite journal\n      |author         = D'Onofrio, Michela and Rummukainen, Kari\n      |title          = Standard model cross-over on the lattice\n      |journal        = Phys.

Occasionally, although rarely, a Higgs boson will be created fleetingly as part of the collision byproducts. Because the Higgs boson [[#Decay|decays]] very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the ''decay signature'') and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a ''decay channel'') of a Higgs boson, this indicates that a Higgs boson may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a Higgs boson than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the Higgs boson exists.\n\nBecause Higgs boson production in a particle collision is likely to be very rare (1 in 10 billion at the LHC),{{#tag:ref|The example is based on the production rate at the LHC operating at 7 TeV. The total cross-section for producing a Higgs boson at the LHC is about 10 [[picobarn]],<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /> while the total cross-section for a proton\u2013proton collision is 110 [[millibarn]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://lhc-machine-outreach.web.cern.ch/lhc-machine-outreach/collisions.htm\n|title=Collisions\n|website=LHC Machine Outreach\n|publisher=CERN\n|accessdate=26 July 2012\n}}</ref>|name=\"production_rate\"|group=lower-alpha}} and many other possible collision events can have similar decay signatures, the data of hundreds of trillions of collisions needs to be analysed and must \"show the same picture\" before a conclusion about the existence of the Higgs boson can be reached. To conclude that a new particle has been found, [[particle physicist]]s require that the [[statistical analysis]] of two independent particle detectors each indicate that there is lesser than a one-in-a-million chance that the observed decay signatures are due to just background random Standard Model events{{snd}} i.e., that the observed number of events is more than 5 [[standard deviation]]s (sigma) different from that expected if there was no new particle. More collision data allows better confirmation of the physical properties of any new particle observed, and allows physicists to decide whether it is indeed a Higgs boson as described by the Standard Model or some other hypothetical new particle.\n\nTo find the Higgs boson, a powerful [[particle accelerator]] was needed, because Higgs bosons might not be seen in lower-energy experiments. The collider needed to have a high [[Luminosity (scattering theory)|luminosity]] in order to ensure enough collisions were seen for conclusions to be drawn. Finally, advanced computing facilities were needed to process the vast amount of data (25 [[petabyte]]s per year as of 2012) produced by the collisions.<ref name=\"msnbc-discovery\" /> For the announcement of 4 July 2012, a new collider known as the [[Large Hadron Collider]] was constructed at [[CERN]] with a planned eventual collision energy of 14 [[TeV]]{{snd}} over seven times any previous collider{{snd}} and over 300 trillion (3\u00d710<sup>14</sup>) LHC proton\u2013proton collisions were analysed by the [[LHC Computing Grid]], the world's largest [[computing grid]] (as of 2012), comprising over 170 computing facilities in a [[distributed computing|worldwide network]] across 36 countries.<ref name=\"msnbc-discovery\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wlcg.web.cern.ch/ |title=Welcome to the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=WLCG{{snd}} Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |access-date=14 November 2012 |quote=[A] global collaboration of more than 170 computing centres in 36 countries \u2026 to store, distribute and analyse the ~25 Petabytes (25 million Gigabytes) of data annually generated by the Large Hadron Collider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://home.cern/about/computing/worldwide-lhc-computing-grid |title=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |website=The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid |publisher=CERN |date=November 2017 |quote=It now links thousands of computers and storage systems in over 170 centres across 41 countries. \u2026 The WLCG is the world's largest computing grid}}</ref>\n\n==== Search before 4 July 2012 ====\nThe first extensive search for the Higgs boson was conducted at the [[Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider]] (LEP) at CERN in the 1990s.

However, before [[Sheldon Lee Glashow|Sheldon L. Glashow]] extended the [[electroweak unification]] models in 1961, there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the [[weak nuclear force]] or a possible unified [[electroweak interaction]]. [[Fermion]]s with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant. (This can be seen by examining the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Dirac Lagrangian]] for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components; we find none of the spin-half particles could ever flip [[helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] as required for mass, so they must be massless.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In the Standard Model, the mass term arising from the Dirac Lagrangian for any fermion <math>\\psi</math> is <math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi</math>. This is ''not'' invariant under the electroweak symmetry, as can be seen by writing <math>\\psi</math> in terms of left and right handed components:\n\n:<math>-m\\bar{\\psi}\\psi\\;=\\;-m(\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_R+\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_L)</math>\ni.e., contributions from <math>\\bar{\\psi}_L\\psi_L</math> and <math>\\bar{\\psi}_R\\psi_R</math> terms do not appear. We see that the mass-generating interaction is achieved by constant flipping of particle [[chirality]]. Since the spin-half particles have no right/left helicity pair with the same [[SU(2)]] and [[SU(3)]] representation and the same weak hypercharge, then assuming these gauge charges are conserved in the vacuum, none of the spin-half particles could ever swap helicity. Therefore, in the absence of some other cause, all fermions must be massless.</ref>) [[W and Z bosons]] are observed to have mass, but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge, and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant. Therefore, it seems that ''none'' of the standard model fermions ''or'' bosons could \"begin\" with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance. If gauge invariance were to be retained, then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction. Additionally, whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not \"break\" gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well, ''and'' had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles or long-range forces (seemingly an inevitable consequence of [[Goldstone's theorem]]) which did not actually seem to exist in nature.\n\nA solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of Goldstone's theorem,<ref group=lower-alpha name=\"GoldstoneNote\">[[Goldstone's theorem]] only applies to gauges having [[Lorentz covariance|manifest Lorentz covariance]], a condition that took time to become questioned. But the process of [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]]<!--BRITISH ENGLISH SPELLING--> requires a [[gauge fixing|gauge to be fixed]] and at this point it becomes possible to choose a gauge such as the 'radiation' gauge which is not invariant over time, so that these problems can be avoided. According to {{harvp|Bernstein |1974|p=8}}:\n: \"the \"radiation gauge\" condition {{nowrap|1=\u2207\u22c5A(''x'') = 0}} is clearly noncovariant, which means that if we wish to maintain transversality of the photon in all [[Lorentz frame]]s, the [[photon field]] A<sub>\u03bc</sub>(''x'') cannot transform like a [[four-vector]]. This is no catastrophe, since the photon ''field'' is not an [[observable]], and one can readily show that the S-matrix elements, which ''are'' observable have covariant structures .... in gauge theories one might arrange things so that one had a symmetry breakdown because of the noninvariance of the vacuum; but, because the Goldstone ''et al.'' proof breaks down, the zero mass Goldstone mesons need not appear.\" [Emphasis in original]\n{{harvp|Bernstein |1974}} contains an accessible and comprehensive background and review of this area, see [[#external links|external links]]</ref> that under certain conditions it ''might'' theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken ''without'' disrupting gauge invariance and ''without'' any new massless particles or forces, and having \"sensible\" ([[renormalization|renormalisable]]) results mathematically. This became known as the [[Higgs mechanism]].\n\n[[File:Elementary particle interactions.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|Summary of interactions between certain [[elementary particle|particles]] described by the [[Standard Model]].]]\nThe Standard Model hypothesises a [[Quantum field theory|field]] which is responsible for this effect, called the Higgs field (symbol: <math>\\phi</math>), which has the unusual property of a non-zero amplitude in its [[ground state]]; i.e., a non-zero [[vacuum expectation value]]. It can have this effect because of its unusual \"Mexican hat\" shaped potential whose lowest \"point\" is not at its \"centre\". In simple terms, unlike all other known fields, the Higgs field requires ''less'' energy to have a non-zero value than a zero value, so it ends up having a non-zero value ''everywhere''. Below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this non-zero vacuum expectation [[symmetry breaking|spontaneously breaks]] [[electroweak interaction|electroweak]] [[Introduction to gauge theory|gauge symmetry]] which in turn gives rise to the Higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field. This effect occurs because [[scalar field]] components of the Higgs field are \"absorbed\" by the massive bosons as [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], and couple to the fermions via [[Yukawa coupling]], thereby producing the expected mass terms. When symmetry breaks under these conditions, the [[Goldstone boson]]s that arise ''interact'' with the Higgs field (and with other particles capable of interacting with the Higgs field) instead of becoming new massless particles. The intractable problems of both underlying theories \"neutralise\" each other, and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the Higgs field.

Precision measurements of electroweak parameters, such as the [[Fermi's interaction|Fermi constant]] and masses of W/Z bosons, can be used to calculate constraints on the mass of the Higgs. As of July 2011, the precision electroweak measurements tell us that the mass of the Higgs boson is likely to be less than about {{val|161|u=GeV/c2}} at 95% [[confidence level]] (this upper limit would increase to {{val|185|u=GeV/c2}} if the lower bound of {{val|114.4|u=GeV/c2}} from the LEP-2 direct search is allowed for<ref name=\"EWWG\">{{cite web |url=http://lepewwg.web.cern.ch/LEPEWWG/ |title=LEP Electroweak Working Group}}</ref>).

If the collided particles are [[hadron]]s such as the [[proton]] or [[antiproton]]{{snd}} as is the case in the LHC and Tevatron{{snd}} then it is most likely that two of the [[gluon]]s binding the hadron together collide. The easiest way to produce a Higgs particle is if the two gluons combine to form a loop of [[virtual particle|virtual]] quarks. Since the coupling of particles to the Higgs boson is proportional to their mass, this process is more likely for heavy particles. In practice it is enough to consider the contributions of virtual [[top quark|top]] and [[bottom quark|bottom]] quarks (the heaviest quarks). This process is the dominant contribution at the LHC and Tevatron being about ten times more likely than any of the other processes.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n* ''Higgs Strahlung''. If an elementary [[fermion]] collides with an anti-fermion{{snd}} e.g., a quark with an anti-quark or an [[electron]] with a [[positron]]{{snd}} the two can merge to form a virtual W or Z boson which, if it carries sufficient energy, can then emit a Higgs boson. This process was the dominant production mode at the LEP, where an electron and a positron collided to form a virtual Z boson, and it was the second largest contribution for Higgs production at the Tevatron. At the LHC this process is only the third largest, because the LHC collides protons with protons, making a quark-antiquark collision less likely than at the Tevatron. Higgs Strahlung is also known as ''associated production''.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n* ''Weak boson fusion''. Another possibility when two (anti-)fermions collide is that the two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson. The colliding fermions do not need to be the same type. So, for example, an [[up quark]] may exchange a Z boson with an anti-down quark. This process is the second most important for the production of Higgs particle at the LHC and LEP.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodLEP\" />\n* ''Top fusion''. The final process that is commonly considered is by far the least likely (by two orders of magnitude). This process involves two colliding gluons, which each decay into a heavy quark\u2013antiquark pair. A quark and antiquark from each pair can then combine to form a Higgs particle.<ref name=\"HprodLHC\" /><ref name=\"HprodTeva\" />\n\n=== Decay ===\n[[File:Higgsdecaywidth.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Standard Model prediction for the [[decay width]] of the Higgs particle depends on the value of its mass.]]\nQuantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles, then it will eventually do so.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2012/jun/22/higgs-boson-particlephysics |title=Why does the Higgs decay? |first=Lily |last=Asquith |work=Life and Physics |publisher=The Guardian |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |location=London}}</ref> This is also true for the Higgs boson. The likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including: the difference in mass, the strength of the interactions, etc. Most of these factors are fixed by the Standard Model, except for the mass of the Higgs boson itself.

Each of these possible processes has its own probability, expressed as the ''branching ratio''; the fraction of the total number decays that follows that process. The SM predicts these branching ratios as a function of the Higgs mass (see plot).\n\nOne way that the Higgs can decay is by splitting into a fermion\u2013antifermion pair. As general rule, the Higgs is more likely to decay into heavy fermions than light fermions, because the mass of a fermion is proportional to the strength of its interaction with the Higgs.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\">{{cite web\n|title=Higgs bosons: theory and searches\n|url=http://pdg.lbl.gov/2012/reviews/rpp2012-rev-higgs-boson.pdf\n|website=PDGLive\n|publisher=Particle Data Group\n|date=12 July 2012\n|accessdate=15 August 2012\n}}</ref> By this logic the most common decay should be into a [[top quark|top]]\u2013antitop quark pair. However, such a decay would only be possible if the Higgs were heavier than ~{{val|346|u=GeV/c2}}, twice the mass of the top quark. For a Higgs mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} the SM predicts that the most common decay is into a [[bottom quark|bottom]]\u2013antibottom quark pair, which happens 57.7% of the time.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The second most common fermion decay at that mass is a [[tau particle|tau]]\u2013antitau pair, which happens only about 6.3% of the time.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" />\n\nAnother possibility is for the Higgs to split into a pair of massive gauge bosons. The most likely possibility is for the Higgs to decay into a pair of W bosons (the light blue line in the plot), which happens about 21.5% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> The W bosons can subsequently decay either into a quark and an antiquark or into a charged lepton and a neutrino. The decays of W bosons into quarks are difficult to distinguish from the background, and the decays into leptons cannot be fully reconstructed (because neutrinos are impossible to detect in particle collision experiments). A cleaner signal is given by decay into a pair of Z-bosons (which happens about 2.6% of the time for a Higgs with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}),<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> if each of the bosons subsequently decays into a pair of easy-to-detect charged leptons ([[electron]]s or [[muon]]s).\n\nDecay into massless gauge bosons (i.e., [[gluon]]s or [[photon]]s) is also possible, but requires intermediate loop of virtual heavy quarks (top or bottom) or massive gauge bosons.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" /> The most common such process is the decay into a pair of gluons through a loop of virtual heavy quarks. This process, which is the reverse of the gluon fusion process mentioned above, happens approximately 8.6% of the time for a Higgs boson with a mass of {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}}.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> Much rarer is the decay into a pair of photons mediated by a loop of W bosons or heavy quarks, which happens only twice for every thousand decays.<ref name=\"LHCcrosssections\" /> However, this process is very relevant for experimental searches for the Higgs boson, because the energy and momentum of the photons can be measured very precisely, giving an accurate reconstruction of the mass of the decaying particle.<ref name=\"PDGreview2012\" />\n\n=== Alternative models ===\n{{Main|Alternatives to the Standard Model Higgs}}\n\nThe Minimal Standard Model as described above is the simplest known model for the Higgs mechanism with just one Higgs field. However, an extended Higgs sector with additional Higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible, and many extensions of the Standard Model have this feature. The non-minimal Higgs sector favoured by theory are the [[Two-Higgs-Doublet Model|two-Higgs-doublet models]] (2HDM), which predict the existence of a [[quintet]] of scalar particles: two [[CP violation|CP-even]] neutral Higgs bosons h<sup>0</sup> and H<sup>0</sup>, a CP-odd neutral Higgs boson A<sup>0</sup>, and two charged Higgs particles H<sup>\u00b1</sup>. [[Supersymmetry]] (\"SUSY\") also predicts relations between the Higgs-boson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons, and could accommodate a {{val|125|u=GeV/c2}} neutral Higgs boson.\n\nThe key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles' interactions (\"coupling\") and exact decay processes (\"branching ratios\"), which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions. In the Type-I 2HDM model one Higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks, while the second doublet does not couple to quarks. This model has two interesting limits, in which the lightest Higgs couples to just fermions (\"gauge-[[phobia|phobic]]\") or just gauge bosons (\"fermiophobic\"), but not both. In the Type-II 2HDM model, one Higgs doublet only couples to up-type quarks, the other only couples to down-type quarks.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Branco\n | first = G.

Because the weak force is about 10<sup>32</sup> times stronger than gravity, and (linked to this) the Higgs boson's mass is so much less than the [[Planck mass]] or the [[grand unification energy]], it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the Standard Model, or some unexplained and extremely precise [[fine-tuning]] of parameters{{snd}} however at present neither of these explanations is proven. This is known as a [[hierarchy problem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profmattstrassler.com/articles-and-posts/particle-physics-basics/the-hierarchy-problem/ |title=The Hierarchy Problem &#124; Of Particular Significance |publisher=Profmattstrassler.com |accessdate=2013-10-09}}</ref> More broadly, the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that [[physics beyond the standard model|a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions]] should not have excessive fine-tunings or unduly delicate cancellations, and should allow masses of particles such as the Higgs boson to be calculable.

{"title_page": "History of Jamaica", "text_new": "{{short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{Use Jamaican English|date=November 2018}}\n{{History of Jamaica}}\nThe Caribbean island of [[Jamaica]] was inhabited by the [[Arawak]] tribes prior to the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] in 1494. Early inhabitants of Jamaica named the land \"Xaymaca\", meaning \"Land of wood,water and god\". The Spanish enslaved the Arawak, who were so ravaged by their conflict with the Europeans and by [[Holy soil epidemic|foreign diseases]] that nearly the entire native population was extinct by 1600.  The Spanish also transported hundreds of West African slaves to the island.\n\nIn 1655, the [[Invasion of Jamaica|English invaded Jamaica]], defeating the Spanish colonists. African slaves took advantage of the political turmoil and escaped to the island's interior, forming independent communities (known as the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]]).  Meanwhile, on the coast, the English built the settlement of [[Port Royal]], which became a base of operations for pirates and [[privateer]]s, including Captain [[Henry Morgan]].\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar cane]] replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as British Jamaica's main source of income. The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the British brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica. By 1850 the black Jamaican population outnumbered the white population by a ratio of twenty to one. Enslaved Jamaicans mounted over a dozen major uprisings during the 18th century, including [[Tacky's revolt]] in 1760.  There were also periodic skirmishes between the British and the mountain communities, culminating in the [[First Maroon War]] of the 1730s and the [[Second Maroon War]] of the 1795\n\n== Pre-Columbian Jamaica ==\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian Jamaica}}\nThe first inhabitants of Jamaica probably came from islands to the east in two waves of migration. About 600 CE the culture known as the \u201cRedware people\u201d arrived; little is known of them, however, beyond the red pottery they left.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/place/Jamaica/History \"Jamaica\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> Alligator Pond in [[Manchester Parish]] and Little River in [[St. Ann Parish]] are among the earliest known sites of this Ostionoid person, who lived near the coast and extensively hunted turtles and fish.<ref>, Atkinson, Lesley-Gail. \"The Earliest Inhabitants: The Dynamics of the Jamaican Ta\u00edno.\"</ref>\n\nAround 800 CE, [[Arawak]] arrived, eventually settling throughout the island. Living in villages ruled by tribal chiefs called [[the cacique]]s, they sustained themselves on fishing and the cultivation of [[maize]] and [[cassava]]. At the height of their civilization, their population is estimated to have numbered as much as 60,000.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe Arawak brought from South America a system of raising [[yuca]] known as \"conuco.\"<ref name=rogozinski>Rogozinski, Jan.  \"A Brief History of the Caribbean.\"</ref>  To add nutrients to the soil, the Arawak burned local bushes and trees and heaped the ash into large mounds, into which they then planted yuca cuttings.<ref name=rogozinski /> Most Arawak lived in large circular buildings (''bohios''), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and [[Palm tree|palm]] leaves.  The Arawak spoke an [[Arawakan language]] and did not have writing. Some of the words used by them, such as ''barbacoa'' (\"barbecue\"), ''hamaca'' (\"hammock\"), ''kanoa'' (\"canoe\"), ''tabaco'' (\"tobacco\"), ''[[cassava|yuca]]'', ''batata'' (\"sweet potato\"), and ''[[jurac\u00e1n]]'' (\"hurricane\"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English.\n<ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Manihot esculenta dsc07325.jpg|Cassava (''yuca'') roots, the Ta\u00ednos' main crop\nFile:Duho.jpg|''Dujo'', a wooden chair crafted by Ta\u00ednos.\nFile:Reconstruction of Taino village, Cuba.JPG|Reconstruction of a Ta\u00edno village in Cuba\nFile:Parco Cerimoniale Indigeno di Caguana.jpg|Caguana Ceremonial ball court (''batey''), outlined with stones\n</gallery>\n</ref> https://jis.gov.jm/information/jamaican-history/\n\n== The Spanish colonial period (1494\u20131655) ==\n{{Main|Spanish Jamaica}}\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] is believed to be the first European to reach Jamaica.  He landed on the island on 5 May 1494, during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] to the Americas.<ref>[http://www.christopher-columbus.eu/voyage-2.htm \"Christopher Columbus \u2013 2nd Voyage\".]</ref> Columbus returned to Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the Americas.  He had been sailing around the Caribbean nearly a year when a storm beached his ships in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on 25 June 1503.  For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on the island, finally departing in June 1504.\n\nThe Spanish crown granted the island to the Columbus family, but for decades it was something of a backwater, valued chiefly as a supply base for food and animal hides.  In 1509 [[Juan de Esquivel]] founded the first permanent European settlement, the town of [[Sevilla la Nueva (Jamaica)|Sevilla la Nueva]] (New Seville), on the north coast. A decade later, Friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote Spanish authorities about Esquivel's conduct during the Hig\u00fcey massacre of 1503.\n\nIn 1534 the capital was moved to [[Villa de la Vega]] (later [[Santiago de la Vega]]), now called [[Spanish Town]].  This settlement served as the capital of both Spanish and English [[Jamaica]], from its founding in 1534 until 1872, after which the capital was moved to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].\n\nThe Spanish enslaved many of the Arawak;<ref>https://jis.gov.jm/information/jamaican-history/</ref> some escaped, but most died from European diseases and overwork. The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves. By the early 17th century, when virtually no Taino remained in the region, the population of the island was about 3,000, including a small number of African slaves.<ref name=discja>{{cite web|title=JAMAICAN HISTORY I |url=http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |publisher=Discover Jamaica |accessdate=23 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805083846/http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |archivedate=5 August 2013 }}</ref> Disappointed in the lack of gold on the isle, the Spanish mainly used Jamaica as a [[military base]] to supply colonising efforts in the mainland Americas.<ref name=jam2>{{cite web|title=Brief History of Jamaica|url=http://jamaicans.com/info/brief.htm|publisher=Jamaicans.com|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish colonists did not bring women in the first expeditions and took Ta\u00edno women for their common-law wives, resulting in [[mestizo]] children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guitar|first=Lynne|title=Criollos: The Birth of a Dynamic New Indo-Afro-European People and Culture on Hispaniola.|url=http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html|work=KACIKE: Journal of Caribbean Amerindian History and Anthropology|accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202053219/http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html |archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref>  Sexual violence against the Ta\u00edno women by the Spanish was also common.{{sfn|L\u00e9ger|1907|p=23}}{{sfn|Accilien et al.|2003|p=12}}\n\nAlthough the Taino referred to the island as \"Xaymaca\", the Spanish gradually changed the name to \"Jamaica\".<ref name=Cundall>Cundall, Frank.

In April 1655, [[Robert Venables|General Robert Venables]] led the armada in an attack on Spain's fort at [[Santo Domingo]], [[Hispaniola]]. After the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's [[Spanish Town]] capital and soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500).<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref>  Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the [[Battle of Ocho Rios (1657)|Battle of Ocho Rios]] in 1657 and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo (1658)|Battle of Rio Nuevo]] in 1658.

Due to the wars in Ireland at this time two-thirds of this 17th-century European population was Irish.  But [[tropical diseases]] kept the number of Europeans under 10,000 until about 1740.  Although the African slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded 10,000, by the end of the 17th century [[Slave trade|imports]] of [[slave]]s increased the [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|black population]] to at least five times the number of whites. Thereafter, Jamaica's African population did not increase significantly in number until well into the 18th century, in part because ships coming from the west coast of [[Africa]] preferred to unload at the islands of the [[Eastern Caribbean]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, the number of slaves in Jamaica did not exceed 45,000, but by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.\n\n====The House of Assembly====\n{{Main|House of Assembly of Jamaica}}\nBeginning with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart monarchy]]'s appointment of a civil [[Governor of Jamaica|governor to Jamaica]] in 1661, political patterns were established that lasted well into the 20th century. The second governor, [[Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Lord Windsor]], brought with him in 1662 a proclamation from the king giving Jamaica's non-slave populace the rights of English citizens, including the right to make their own laws. Although he spent only ten weeks in Jamaica, Lord Windsor laid the foundations of a governing system that was to last for two centuries: a crown-appointed governor acting with the advice of a nominated council in the legislature. The legislature consisted of the governor and an elected but highly unrepresentative [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|House of Assembly]].  For years, the planter-dominated Assembly was in continual conflict with the various governors and the Stuart kings; there were also contentious factions within the assembly itself. For much of the 1670s and 1680s, Charles II and [[James II of England|James II]] and the assembly feuded over such matters as the purchase of slaves from ships not run by the royal English trading company. The last Stuart governor, [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle]], who was more interested in [[treasure hunting]] than in planting, turned the planter oligarchy out of office. After the duke's death in 1688, the planters, who had fled Jamaica to London, succeeded in lobbying James II to order a return to the pre-Albemarle political arrangement (the local control of Jamaican planters belonging to the assembly).\n\n====Jamaica's pirates====\n{{Main|Port Royal|1692 Jamaica earthquake}}\n[[File:Henry Morgan in colour.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Morgan, governor of Jamaica]]\nFollowing the 1655 conquest, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica.  In response, in 1657, Governor [[Edward D'Oyley]] invited the [[Brethren of the Coast]] to come to Port Royal and make it their home port. The Brethren was made up of a group of pirates who were descendants of cattle-hunting ''boucaniers'' (later Anglicised to buccaneers), who had turned to piracy after being robbed by the Spanish (and subsequently thrown out of Hispaniola).<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Donny L. Hamilton, \"Pirates and Merchants: Port Royal, Jamaica,\" in ''X Marks the Spot: The Archaeology of Piracy,'' ed. Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen, 13\u201330 (Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 2006).</ref> These pirates concentrated their attacks on Spanish shipping, whose interests were considered the major threat to the town. These pirates later became legal English [[privateers]] who were given [[letters of marque]] by Jamaica's governor. Around the same time that pirates were invited to Port Royal, England launched a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defense for Port Royal.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Jamaica became a haven of privateers, buccaneers, and occasionally outright pirates: [[Christopher Myngs]], [[Edward Mansvelt]], and most famously, [[Henry Morgan]].\n\nEngland gained formal possession of Jamaica from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1670 through the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]]. Removing the pressing need for constant defense against Spanish attack, this change served as an incentive to [[Plantation economy|planting]]. This settlement also improved the supply of slaves and resulted in more protection, including military support, for the planters against foreign competition. As a result, the sugar monoculture and slave-worked plantation society spread across Jamaica throughout the 18th century, decreasing Jamaica's dependence on privateers for protection and funds.\n\nHowever, the English colonial authorities continued to have difficulties suppressing the Spanish Maroons, who made their homes in the mountainous interior, and mounted periodic raids on estates and towns, such as [[Spanish Town]]. The Karmahaly Maroons continued to stay in the forested mountains, and periodically fought the English.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-25.</ref>\n\nAnother blow to Jamaica's partnership with privateers was the violent [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake]] which destroyed much of Port Royal on 7 June 1692.  Two-thirds of the town sank into the sea immediately after the main shock.<ref name=\"USGS\">{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1692_06_07.php|title=Historic Earthquakes: Jamaica 1692 June 07 UTC|last=USGS|date=October 21, 2009|accessdate=6 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408181146/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1692_06_07.php|archivedate=8 April 2012}}</ref>  After the earthquake, the town was partially rebuilt but the colonial government was relocated to Spanish Town, which had been the capital under [[Spain|Spanish rule]]. Port Royal was further devastated by a fire in 1703 and a [[hurricane]] in 1722. Most of the sea trade moved to Kingston. By the late 18th century, Port Royal was largely abandoned.<ref name=\"Tortello\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story001.html|title=1692:Earthquake of Port Royal|last=Tortello|first=Rebecca|accessdate=22 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100309071447/http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story001.html|archivedate=9 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== 18th century ===\n====Jamaica's sugar boom====\n[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1700 and on.gif|thumb|European colonies in the 18th-century Caribbean]]\n\nIn the mid-17th century, sugarcane had been brought into the [[British West Indies]] by the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]],<ref>Nancy sharkey, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE3DF1E31F932A25751C1A96E948260&sec=travel&pagewanted=print \"A Barbados Synagogue Is Reborn\"], ''New York Times'', December 11, 1988</ref><ref>[http://www.planetware.com/bridgetown/synagogue-bar-mi-syn.htm Bridgetown synagogue]</ref><ref>Ralph G.

Upon landing in Jamaica and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] to sugarcane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. Sugarcane was quickly snapped up by the [[Great Britain|British]], who used it in [[cake]]s and to sweeten [[tea]].  In the 18th century, sugar replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as Jamaica's main source of income. The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the British brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica.  By 1832, the median-size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves.<ref>Robert William Fogel, \"Slavery in the New World\".  ''Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery'', pp. 21\u201323.</ref> In ''The Book of Night Women'', author Marlon James indicates that the ratio of slave owner to enslaved Africans is 1:33.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} James also depicts atrocities that slave owners subjected slaves to, and violent resistance from the slaves; numerous slaves died in pursuit of freedom. After slavery was abolished in 1834, sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s used a variety of forms of labour including workers imported from [[India]] under contracts of [[indenture]].\n\n====First Maroon War====\n{{Main|Jamaican_Maroons#History|First Maroon War}}\nWhen the British captured [[Jamaica]] in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three ''Palenques'', or settlements. Former slaves organised under the leadership of [[Juan de Serras]] allied with the Spanish guerrillas on the western end of the [[Cockpit Country]], while those under [[Juan de Bolas]] established themselves in modern-day [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon Parish]] and served as a \"black militia\" for the English. The third chose to join those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live and intermarry with the [[Arawak]] people. Each group of Maroons established distinct independent communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica. They survived by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. Over time, the Maroons came to control large areas of the Jamaican interior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainsbury|first1=W. Noel|title=America and West Indies|journal=Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies|volume=1, 5|issue=1574\u20131660, 1661\u20131668}}</ref>  Early in the 18th century, the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] took a heavy toll on the [[British Army|British troops]] and local militia sent against them in the interior, in what came to be known as the [[First Maroon War]].\n\nThe [[First Maroon War]] came to an end with a 1739\u201340 agreement between the Maroons and the British government. The Maroons were to remain in their five main towns ([[Accompong]]; [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]]; [[Nanny Town]], later known as [[Moore Town]]; [[Scott's Hall (Jamaica)]]; and [[Charles Town, Jamaica]]), living under their own rulers and a British supervisor. In exchange, they were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into Maroon settlements. Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.  The person responsible for the compromise with the British was the Leeward Maroon leader, [[Cudjoe]], a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skillfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. As he grew older, however, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned. He ran into quarrels with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was honorable peace with the enemy, which was just what the British were thinking. The 1739 treaty should be seen in this light. A year later, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of Trelawny Town also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons.\n\n====Tacky's revolt====\n{{Main|Tacky's revolt}}\n\nIn May 1760, Tacky, a slave overseer on the [[Frontier Estate|Frontier plantation]] in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]], led a group of enslaved Africans in taking over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their enslavers. They then marched to the storeroom at [[Fort Haldane]], where the munitions to defend the town of [[Port Maria]] were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with [[lead shot|shot]], before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/articles_culture/tackys_rebellion.shtml |title=Jamaican Culture |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref> By dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/> [[Obeah]]men (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>  Soon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>  Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, [[Davy the Maroon]]. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in [[Spanish Town]] until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\n====Second Maroon War====\n{{Main|Second Maroon War}}\nIn 1795, the Second Maroon War was instigated when two Maroons were flogged by a black slave for allegedly stealing two pigs. When six Maroon leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners.  This sparked an eight-month conflict, spurred by the fact that Maroons felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of [[Cudjoe]]'s Treaty of 1739, which ended the First Maroon War.  The war lasted for five months as a bloody stalemate. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the Maroons ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The Maroons surrendered in December 1795.  A treaty signed in December between Major General [[George Walpole (British Army officer)|George Walpole]] and the Maroon leaders established that the Maroons would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the Maroons only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796.  Suspicious of British intentions, most of the Maroons did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny Town Maroons to [[Nova Scotia]]. After a few years the Maroons were again deported to the new British settlement of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]].\n\n=== 19th century ===\n====The Baptist War====\n{{Main|Baptist War}}\nIn 1831, enslaved [[Baptist]] preacher [[Samuel Sharpe]] led a strike among demanding more freedom and a working wage of \"half the going wage rate.\" Upon refusal of their demands, the strike escalated into a full rebellion, in part because Sharpe had also made military preparations with a rebel military group known as the Black Regiment led by a slave known as Colonel Johnson of Retrieve Estate, about 150 strong with 50 guns among them. Colonel Johnson's Black Regiment clashed with a local militia led by Colonel Grignon at old Montpelier on December 28. The militia retreated to Montego Bay while the Black Regiment advanced an invasion of estates in the hills, inviting more slaves to join while burning houses, fields and other properties, setting off a trail of fires through the Great River Valley in Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth to St James.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jamaicagreathouses.com/slavery/index.html|title=Sam Sharpe and the Slave Rebellion (Baptist War)|last=|first=|date=|website=Slavery in the Great House era, Jamaica Great Houses|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[The Baptist War]], as it was known, became the largest slave uprising in the British West Indies,<ref name=Revauger>{{cite book |title=The Abolition of Slavery \u2013 The British Debate 1787\u20131840 |first=C\u00e9cile |last=R\u00e9vauger |authorlink =C\u00e9cile R\u00e9vauger |pages=107\u2013108 |publisher=Presse Universitaire de France |date=October 2008 |isbn=978-2-13-057110-0}}</ref> lasting 10 days and mobilised as many as 60,000 of Jamaica's 300,000 slaves.<ref name=Higman>Barry W.

Their reports on conditions contributed greatly to the abolition movement and passage of the 1833 law to abolish slavery as of August 1, 1834, throughout the [[British Empire]]. The Jamaican slaves were bound (indentured) to their former owners' service, albeit with a guarantee of rights, until 1838 under what was called the \"[[Apprenticeship]] System\".\n\nWith the [[Abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1808 and [[slavery]] itself in 1834, however, the island's sugar- and slave-based economy faltered. The period after [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] in 1834 initially was marked by a conflict between the plantocracy and elements in the [[Colonial Office]] over the extent to which individual freedom should be coupled with political participation for blacks. In 1840 the assembly changed the voting qualifications in a way that enabled a majority of blacks and [[Mixed race people|people of mixed race]] (browns or [[mulatto]]s) to vote. But neither change in the political system, nor abolition of slavery changed the planter's chief interest, which lay in the continued profitability of their estates, and they continued to dominate the [[Elitism|elitist]] assembly. Nevertheless, at the end of the 19th century and in the early years of the 20th century, the crown began to allow some Jamaicans \u2013 mostly local merchants, urban professionals, and artisans\u2014into the appointed councils.\n\n====The Morant Bay Rebellion====\n{{Main|Morant Bay Rebellion}}\nTensions resulted in the October 1865 [[Morant Bay rebellion]] led by [[Paul Bogle]]. The rebellion was sparked on 7 October, when a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for allegedly trespassing on a long-abandoned plantation. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial, and in the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policeman were beaten with sticks and stones.<ref>Holt (1992), p. 295.</ref> The following Monday arrest warrants were issued for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among them was Baptist preacher Paul Bogle. A few days later on 11 October, Mr. Paul Bogle marched with a group of protesters to Morant Bay. When the group arrived at the court house they were met by a small and inexperienced volunteer militia. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating.\n\nGovernor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] sent government troops, under Brigadier-General [[Alexander Nelson (British Army officer)|Alexander Nelson]],<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19875 \"Alexander Nelson\"] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Paul Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organised resistance, but regardless they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, \"we slaughtered all before us\u2026 man or woman or child\". In the end, 439 black Jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including Paul Bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. Paul Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning.\"<ref name=\"IPN\">\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\", ''The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record'' (London), 23 February 1867: 1.</ref> Other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences, with thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans were burned down without any justifiable reason.\n\n[[George William Gordon]], a Jamaican businessman and politician, who had been critical of Governor John Eyre and his policies, was later arrested by Governor John Eyre who believed he had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was eventually executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, he was transferred by Eyre to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under [[martial law]]. The execution and trial of Gordon via martial law raised some constitutional issues back in Britain, where concerns emerged about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license.<ref>{{cite book|last=Semmel|first=Bernard|title=The Governor Eyre Controversy|year=1962|publisher=MacGibbon & Kee|location=London|pages=128}}</ref>  The speedy trial saw Gordon hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun. He and William Bogle, Paul's brother, \"were both tried together, and executed at the same time.\n\n====Decline of the sugar industry====\n[[File:Cane cutters in Jamaica.jpg|thumb|upright|Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1880]]\nDuring most of the 18th century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugarcane production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. A major reason for the decline was the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden; the abolition of the slave trade was followed by [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years. Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\n[[File:Valentine_and_Sons_-_Cane_Cutters,_Jamaica,_1891.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1891]]\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm [[Tate & Lyle|Tate and Lyle]]. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]], by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares.\n\nThe rise of the [[banana]] trade during the second half of the 19th century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known [[United Fruit Company]] in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\n====Jamaica as a Crown Colony====\nIn 1846 Jamaican planters, adversely affected by the loss of slave labour, suffered a crushing blow when Britain passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846|Sugar Duties Act]], eliminating Jamaica's traditionally favoured status as its primary supplier of sugar. The Jamaica House of Assembly stumbled from one crisis to another until the collapse of the [[sugar trade]], when racial and religious tensions came to a head during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] of 1865. Although suppressed ruthlessly, the severe rioting so alarmed the planters that the two-centuries-old assembly voted to abolish itself and asked for the establishment of direct British rule.  In 1866 the new governor [[John Peter Grant]] arrived to implement a series of reforms which accompanied the transition to a [[crown colony]]. The government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In the late 19th century, crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica after 1884. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of [[English common law]] and county courts, and a [[Jamaica Constabulary Force|constabulary force]] was established.  The smooth working of the crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were [British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were [[Jamaican people|Jamaicans]]. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance \u2013 based on shared color, attitudes, and interest \u2013 between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.\n\n====Religion====\nUntil it was disestablished in 1870, the Church of England in Jamaica was the established church. It represented the white English community. It received funding from the colonial government, and was given responsibility for providing religious instruction to the slaves. It was challenged by Methodist missionaries from England, and the Methodists in turn were denounced as troublemakers. The Church of England in Jamaica established the Jamaica Home and Foreign Missionary Society in 1861; its mission stations multiplied, with financial help from religious organizations in London. The Society sent its own missionaries to West Africa. Baptist missions grew rapidly, thanks to missionaries from England and the United States, and became the largest denomination by 1900. Baptist missionaries denounced the apprentice system as a form of slavery. In the 1870s and 1880s the Methodists opened a high school and a theological college. Other Protestant groups included the Moravians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Seventh-day Adventist, Church of God, and others.  There were several thousand Roman Catholics.<ref>See [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08270a.htm \"Jamaica' in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910)]</ref>  The population was largely Christian by 1900, and most families were linked with the church or a Sunday School. Traditional pagan practices persisted in unorganized fashion, such as witchcraft.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette.

Kingston had been founded as a refuge for survivors of the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that destroyed [[Port Royal]].  The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703.  Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for [[Jamaica]]. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in [[Port Royal]], and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]]. In 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.  The [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] destroyed much of the city.  Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book|author=J.

Garvey left the colony in 1935 to live in the [[United Kingdom]], where he died heavily in debt five years later. He was proclaimed Jamaica's first national hero in the 1960s after [[Edward Seaga|Edward P.G. Seaga]], then a government minister, arranged the return of his remains to Jamaica.

Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Anglocentrism|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by black nationalist figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that the crowning of [[Haile Selassie]] as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's counter-cultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley.<ref>M.G.

Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\n====New unions and parties====\nThe rise of [[nationalism]], as distinct from island identification or desire for [[self-determination]], is generally dated to the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|1938 labour riots]] that affected both Jamaica and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. [[William Alexander Bustamante]], a moneylender in the capital city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] who had formed the Jamaica Trade Workers and Tradesmen Union (JTWTU) three years earlier, captured the imagination of the black masses with his messianic personality, even though he himself was light-skinned, affluent, and aristocratic. Bustamante emerged from the 1938 strikes and other disturbances as a populist leader and the principal spokesperson for the militant urban working class, and in that year, using the JTWTU as a stepping stone, he founded the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU), which inaugurated Jamaica's workers movement.\n\nA distant cousin of Bustamante's, [[Norman Manley|Norman W. Manley]], concluded as a result of the 1938 riots that the real basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union-oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over [[Power (social and political)|state power]] and [[political rights]] for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the [[People's National Party]] (PNP), which had begun as a nationalist movement supported by the mixed-race middle class and the liberal sector of the business community with leaders who were highly educated members of the [[upper middle class]]. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to [[Trade union|unionise labour]], although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining.\n\nThe PNP adopted a [[socialist]] ideology in 1940 and later joined the [[Socialist International]], allying itself formally with the [[social democratic]] parties of [[Western Europe]]. Guided by socialist principles, Manley was not a doctrinaire socialist. PNP socialism during the 1940s was similar to [[British Labour Party]] ideas on state control of the factors of production, [[equality of opportunity]], and a [[welfare state]], although a left-wing element in the PNP held more orthodox [[Marxist]] views and worked for the internationalisation of the trade union movement through the Caribbean Labour Congress. In those formative years of Jamaican political and union activity, relations between Manley and Bustamante were cordial. Manley defended Bustamante in court against charges brought by the British for his labour activism in the 1938 riots and looked after the BITU during Bustamante's imprisonment.\n\nBustamante had political ambitions of his own, however. In 1942, while still incarcerated, he founded a political party to rival the PNP, called the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class than those of the PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members, who encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC). Thus, from an early stage in modern Jamaica, unionised labour was an integral part of organised political life.\n\nFor the next quarter century, Bustamante and Manley competed for centre stage in Jamaican political affairs, the former espousing the cause of the \"barefoot man\"; the latter, \"democratic socialism,\" a loosely defined political and economic theory aimed at achieving a [[Classless society|classless]] system of government. Jamaica's two founding fathers projected quite different popular images. Bustamante, lacking even a [[high school diploma]], was an autocratic, charismatic, and highly adept politician; Manley was an athletic, [[University of Oxford|Oxford-trained]] lawyer, [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], humanist, and liberal intellectual. Although considerably more reserved than Bustamante, Manley was well liked and widely respected. He was also a visionary nationalist who became the driving force behind the crown colony's quest for independence.\n\nFollowing the 1938 disturbances in the [[West Indies]], [[London]] sent the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]] to study conditions in the [[British West Indies|British Caribbean territories]]. Its findings led in the early 1940s to better wages and a new constitution. Issued on 20 November 1944, the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]] modified the crown colony system and inaugurated limited self-government based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model of government]] and [[universal adult suffrage]]. It also embodied the island's principles of ministerial responsibility and the rule of law. Thirty-one percent of the population participated in the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|1944 elections]]. The JPL \u2013 helped by its promises to create jobs, its practice of dispensing public funds in pro-JLP parishes, and the PNP's relatively radical platform \u2013 won an 18 percent majority of the votes over the PNP, as well as 22 seats in the 32-member House of Representatives, with 5 going to the PNP and 5 to other short-lived parties. In 1945 Bustamante took office as Jamaica's first premier (the pre-independence title for [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|head of government]]).\n\nUnder the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials.<ref name=jlp>{{cite web|title=The Jamaican Labour Party (JLP) |url=http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php |work=2005 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803163859/http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php |archivedate=3 August 2013 }}</ref><ref name=Constit>{{cite web|title=History this week:Constitutional Developments in British Guiana and Jamaica between 1890 and 1945 (Part 3)|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/features/05/13/history-this-weekconstitutional-developments-in-british-guiana-and-jamaica-between-1890-and-1945-part-3/|work=13 May 2010|publisher=StabroekNews|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Independent Jamaica (1962-)}}Independent Jamaica (1962\u2013present)==\n===1960s===\n====The road to independence====\n{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Jamaica began a relatively [[Independence of Jamaica|long transition to full political independence]]. Jamaicans preferred [[British culture]] over [[American culture|American]], but they had a [[love-hate relationship]] with the British and resented British domination, [[racism]], and the dictatorial Colonial Office. Britain gradually granted the colony more self-government under periodic constitutional changes. Jamaica's political patterns and governmental structure were shaped during two decades of what was called \"constitutional [[decolonisation]],\" the period between 1944 and independence in 1962.\n\nHaving seen how little popular appeal the PNP's 1944 campaign position had, the party shifted toward the centre in 1949 and remained there until 1974. The PNP actually won a 0.8-percent majority of the votes over the JLP in the [[Jamaican general election, 1949|1949 election]], although the JLP won a majority of the House seats. In the 1950s, the PNP and JLP became increasingly similar in their sociological composition and ideological outlook. During the [[cold war]] years, socialism became an explosive domestic issue. The JLP exploited it among property owners and churchgoers, attracting more middle-class support. As a result, PNP leaders diluted their socialist rhetoric, and in 1952 the PNP moderated its image by expelling four prominent leftists who had controlled the TUC. The PNP then formed the more conservative [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]] (NWU). Henceforth, PNP socialism meant little more than national planning within a framework of private property and foreign capital. The PNP retained, however, a basic commitment to socialist precepts, such as public control of resources and a more equitable income distribution. Manley's PNP came to office for the first time after winning the [[Jamaican general election, 1955|1955 elections]] with an 11-percent majority over the JLP and 50.5 percent of the popular vote.\n\nAmendments to the constitution that took effect in May 1953 reconstituted the Executive Council and provided for eight ministers to be selected from among House members. The first ministries were subsequently established. These amendments also enlarged the limited powers of the House of Representatives and made elected members of the governor's executive council responsible to the legislature. Manley, elected [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|chief minister]] beginning in January 1955, accelerated the process of decolonisation during his able stewardship. Further progress toward [[self-government]] was achieved under constitutional amendments in 1955 and 1956, and cabinet government was established on 11 November 1957.\n\nAssured by British declarations that independence would be granted to a collective West Indian state rather than to individual colonies, Manley supported Jamaica's joining nine other British territories in the [[West Indies Federation]], established on 3 January 1958. Manley became the island's premier after the PNP again won a decisive victory in the [[Jamaican general election, 1959|general election in July 1959]], securing thirty of forty-five House seats.\n\nMembership in the federation remained an issue in Jamaican politics. Bustamante, reversing his previously supportive position on the issue, warned of the financial implications of membership \u2013 Jamaica was responsible for 43 percent of its own financing \u2013 and an inequity in Jamaica's proportional representation in the federation's House of Assembly. Manley's PNP favoured staying in the federation, but he agreed to hold a [[Jamaican Federation of the West Indies membership referendum, 1961|referendum in September 1961]] to decide on the issue. When 54 percent of the electorate voted to withdraw, Jamaica left the federation, which dissolved in 1962 after [[Trinidad and Tobago]] also pulled out. Manley believed that the rejection of his pro-federation policy in the 1961 referendum called for a renewed mandate from the electorate, but the JLP won the [[Jamaican general election, 1962|election of early 1962]] by a fraction. Bustamante assumed the premiership that April, and Manley spent his remaining few years in politics as leader of the opposition.\n\nJamaica received [[Independence of Jamaica|its independence]] on 6 August 1962. The new nation retained, however, its membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and adopted a [[Westminster parliamentary system|Westminster-style parliamentary system]]. Bustamante, at the age of 78, became the new nation's first prime minister.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jamaica: Self-government|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299716/Jamaica/214972/Self-government#ref515864|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The West Indies Federation |url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/west_indies_federation.jsp?menu=community |work=2011 |publisher=CARICOM |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929234257/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/west_indies_federation.jsp?menu=community |archivedate=29 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n====Jamaica under Bustamante====\nBustamante subsequently became the first [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]].

This pattern was accelerated with the export of bauxite beginning in the 1950s. The economic structure shifted from a dependence on agriculture that in 1950 accounted for 30.8 percent of GDP to an agricultural contribution of 12.9 percent in 1960 and 6.7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the contribution to GDP of mining increased from less than 1 percent in 1950 to 9.3 percent in 1960 and 12.6 percent in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaders since 1962 |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/leaders.html |publisher=This is Jamaica |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904154730/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/leaders.html |archivedate=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBustamante's government also continued the government's repression of Rastafarians.

Under Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers. In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas. The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.\n\nLand reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilisers and access to credit. An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration and/or purchased by large bauxite companies.\n\nThe minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Insight Guide: Jamaica, Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Master and Servant Act|Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSubsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">The Greenwood encyclopaedia of LGBT issues worldwide, Volume 1 by Chuck Stewart</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A.

The concert came to its peak during [[Bob Marley|Bob Marley & The Wailers]]' performance of \"Jammin'\", when [[Bob Marley|Marley]] joined the hands of political rivals [[Michael Manley]] ([[People's National Party|PNP]]) and [[Edward Seaga]] ([[Jamaican Labour Party|JLP]]).\n\n====Edward Seaga====\nIn the 1980 election, [[Edward Seaga]] and the JLP won by an overwhelming majority \u2013 57 percent of the popular vote and 51 of the 60 seats in the [[Parliament of Jamaica|House of Representatives]].  Seaga immediately began to reverse the policies of his predecessor by privatising industry and seeking closer ties with the USA.  Seaga was one of the first foreign heads of government to visit newly elected US president [[Ronald Reagan]] early the next year and was one of the architects of the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]], which was sponsored by Reagan. He delayed his promise to cut diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]] until a year later when he accused the Cuban government of giving [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to Jamaican criminals.\n\nSeaga supported the collapse of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] regime in [[Grenada]] and the subsequent US-led invasion of that island in October 1983. On the back of the Grenada invasion, Seaga called [[Jamaican general election, 1983|snap elections]] at the end of 1983, which Manley's PNP boycotted. His party thus controlled all seats in parliament. In an unusual move, because the Jamaican constitution required an opposition in the appointed [[Parliament of Jamaica|Senate]], Seaga appointed eight independent senators to form an official opposition.\n\nSeaga lost much of his US support when he was unable to deliver on his early promises of removing the bauxite levy, and his domestic support also plummeted. Articles attacking Seaga appeared in the US media and foreign investors left the country. Rioting in 1987 and 1988, the continued high popularity of Michael Manley, and complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake of the devastation of the island by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988, also contributed to his defeat in the [[Jamaican general election, 1989|1989 elections]].\n\n====Hurricane Gilbert====\n{{Main|Hurricane Gilbert}}\nIn 1988, [[Hurricane Gilbert]] produced a {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]] and brought up to {{convert|823|mm|in}} of rain in the mountainous areas of Jamaica,<ref name=\"uwi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mona.uwi.edu/cardin/virtual_library/docs/1139/1139.pdf|title=Assessment of Rainfall Characteristics and Landslide Hazards in Jamaica|author=Ahmad, Rafi, Lawrence Brown, Jamaica National Meteorological Service|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|page=27|date=10 January 2006|accessdate=6 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031308/http://www.mona.uwi.edu/cardin/virtual_library/docs/1139/1139.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> causing inland flash flooding. 49 people died.<ref name=\"1988mwr\">{{cite journal|author=Lawrence, Miles B.|author2=Gross, James M.|year=1989|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1988.pdf|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1988|accessdate=24 February 2007|issn=0027-0644|journal=Monthly Weather Review|page=2253|volume=117|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117<2248:AHSO>2.0.CO;2|issue=10|bibcode = 1989MWRv..117.2248L }}</ref> Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] stated that the hardest hit areas near where Gilbert made landfall looked \"like [[Hiroshima]] after the [[nuclear weapon|atom bomb]].\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Reyna|agency=Associated Press|date=14 September 1988|title=Jamaica's Premier Reports Island Devastated by Hurricane|location=Kingston, Jamaica}} (accessed through LexisNexis)</ref> The storm left US$4&nbsp;billion (in 1988 dollars) in damage from destroyed crops, buildings, houses, roads, and small aircraft.<ref name=\"The Storm and its Effects\">{{cite journal|title=The Storm And Its Effects |url=http://www.crid.or.cr/digitalizacion/pdf/eng/doc6803/doc6803-01.pdf |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222221941/http://www.crid.or.cr/digitalizacion/pdf/eng/doc6803/doc6803-01.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2012 }}</ref> Two people eventually had to be rescued because of [[mudslide]]s triggered by Gilbert and were sent to the hospital.

The hurricane caused almost $1 billion worth of damage to the island, with banana and coffee crops wiped out and thousands of homes destroyed.  Both parties engaged in campaigning through the distribution of relief supplies, a hallmark of the Jamaican patronage system.  Political commentators noted that prior to the hurricane, Edward Seaga and the JLP trailed Michael Manley and the PNP by twenty points in opinion polls.  The ability to provide relief as the party in charge allowed Seaga to improve his standing among voters and erode the inevitability of Manley's victory.  However, scandals related to the relief effort cost Seaga and the JLP some of the gains made immediately following the hurricane.  Scandals that emerged included National Security Minister [[Errol Anderson]] personally controlling a warehouse full of disaster relief supplies and candidate [[Joan Gordon-Webley]] distributing American-donated flour in sacks with her picture on them.<ref>Kurlansky, Mark, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/27/magazine/showdown-in-jamaica.html?pagewanted=all \"Showdown in Jamaica\"], ''The New York Times'', 27 November 1988.</ref>\n\nThe election was characterised by a narrower ideological difference between the two parties on economic issues.  Michael Manley facilitated his comeback campaign by moderating his leftist positions and admitting mistakes made as Prime Minister, saying he erred when he involved government in economic production and had abandoned all thoughts of nationalising industry.  He cited the PNP's desire to continue the market-oriented policies of the JLP government, but with a more participatory approach.<ref>Garrity, Michele and Picard, Louis A. \"Policy Reform for Sustainable Development in the Caribbean\", p. 39. {{ISBN|4274900991}}, 9784274900990.</ref>  Prime Minister Edward Seaga ran on his record of economic growth and the reduction of unemployment in Jamaica, using the campaign slogan \"Don't Let Them Wreck It Again\" to refer to Manley's tenure as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\">Melvin, Don, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-02-06/news/8901070618_1_michael-manley-minister-jamaica-labour-party \"Personalities Of Candidates Key Issue In Jamaica Election\"], ''Sun Sentinel'', 6 February 1989.</ref>  Seaga during his tenure as Prime Minister emphasised the need to tighten public sector spending and cut close to 27,000 public sector jobs in 1983 and 1984.<ref>Tanna, Laura, [http://mobile.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100314/arts/arts4.php \"On development and losing elections\"] (interview with former Prime Minister Edward Seaga), ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 14 March 2010.</ref> He shifted his plans as elections neared with a promise to spend J$1 billion on a five-year Social Well-Being Programme, which would build new hospitals and schools in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040111/focus/focus5.html |title=Missed opportunities: From old partners to new partnerships |author=Buddan, Robert |work=Jamaica Gleaner|date=11 January 2004|accessdate=7 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222246/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040111/focus/focus5.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref>  Foreign policy also played a role in the 1989 election.

Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of liberalisation. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>  The government also announced a 50% increase in the number of food stamps for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children) was announced. A small number of community councils were also created.

The government also had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.

Negotiations led in 1993 to the EU agreeing to maintain the Caribbean producers' preferential access until the end of Lom\u00e9 IV, pending possible negotiation on an extension.  In 1995, the United States government petitioned to the [[World Trade Organization]] to investigate whether the Lom\u00e9 IV convention had violated WTO rules. Then later in 1996, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, effectively ending the cross-subsidies that had benefited ACP countries for many years. But the US remained unsatisfied and insisted that all preferential trade agreements between the EU and ACP should cease. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body established another panel to discuss the issue and concluded that agreements between the EU and ACP were indeed not compatible with WTO regulations. Finally, the EU negotiated with the US through WTO to reach an agreement.[http://www.coha.org/2005/05/16/banana-wars-continue-%E2%80%93-chiquita-once-again-tries-to-work-its-omnipotent-will-now-under-new-management-likely-big-losers-will-be-caricom%E2%80%99s-windward-islands/]\n\nIn tourism, after a decrease in volume following the [[11 September attacks]] in the U.S., the number of tourists going to Jamaica eventually rebounded, with the island now receiving over a million tourists each year.

Early inhabitants of Jamaica named the land \"Xaymaca\", meaning \"Land of wood,water and god\". The Spanish enslaved the Arawak, who were so ravaged by their conflict with the Europeans and by [[Holy soil epidemic|foreign diseases]] that nearly the entire native population was extinct by 1600.  The Spanish also transported hundreds of West African slaves to the island.\n\nIn 1655, the [[Invasion of Jamaica|English invaded Jamaica]], defeating the Spanish colonists. African slaves took advantage of the political turmoil and escaped to the island's interior, forming independent communities (known as the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]]).  Meanwhile, on the coast, the English built the settlement of [[Port Royal]], which became a base of operations for pirates and [[privateer]]s, including Captain [[Henry Morgan]].\n\nIn the 19th century, [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar cane]] replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as British Jamaica's main source of income. The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the British brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica. By 1850 the black Jamaican population outnumbered the white population by a ratio of twenty to one. Enslaved Jamaicans mounted over a dozen major uprisings during the 18th century, including [[Tacky's revolt]] in 1760.  There were also periodic skirmishes between the British and the mountain communities, culminating in the [[First Maroon War]] of the 1730s and the [[Second Maroon War]] of the 1795\n\n== Pre-Columbian Jamaica ==\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian Jamaica}}\nThe first inhabitants of Jamaica probably came from islands to the east in two waves of migration. About 600 CE the culture known as the \u201cRedware people\u201d arrived; little is known of them, however, beyond the red pottery they left.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/place/Jamaica/History \"Jamaica\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica''.</ref> Alligator Pond in [[Manchester Parish]] and Little River in [[St. Ann Parish]] are among the earliest known sites of this Ostionoid person, who lived near the coast and extensively hunted turtles and fish.<ref>, Atkinson, Lesley-Gail. \"The Earliest Inhabitants: The Dynamics of the Jamaican Ta\u00edno.\"</ref>\n\nAround 800 CE, [[Arawak]] arrived, eventually settling throughout the island. Living in villages ruled by tribal chiefs called [[the cacique]]s, they sustained themselves on fishing and the cultivation of [[maize]] and [[cassava]]. At the height of their civilization, their population is estimated to have numbered as much as 60,000.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\nThe Arawak brought from South America a system of raising [[yuca]] known as \"conuco.\"<ref name=rogozinski>Rogozinski, Jan.  \"A Brief History of the Caribbean.\"</ref>  To add nutrients to the soil, the Arawak burned local bushes and trees and heaped the ash into large mounds, into which they then planted yuca cuttings.<ref name=rogozinski /> Most Arawak lived in large circular buildings (''bohios''), constructed with wooden poles, woven straw, and [[Palm tree|palm]] leaves.  The Arawak spoke an [[Arawakan language]] and did not have writing. Some of the words used by them, such as ''barbacoa'' (\"barbecue\"), ''hamaca'' (\"hammock\"), ''kanoa'' (\"canoe\"), ''tabaco'' (\"tobacco\"), ''[[cassava|yuca]]'', ''batata'' (\"sweet potato\"), and ''[[jurac\u00e1n]]'' (\"hurricane\"), have been incorporated into Spanish and English.\n<ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Manihot esculenta dsc07325.jpg|Cassava (''yuca'') roots, the Ta\u00ednos' main crop\nFile:Duho.jpg|''Dujo'', a wooden chair crafted by Ta\u00ednos.\nFile:Reconstruction of Taino village, Cuba.JPG|Reconstruction of a Ta\u00edno village in Cuba\nFile:Parco Cerimoniale Indigeno di Caguana.jpg|Caguana Ceremonial ball court (''batey''), outlined with stones\n</gallery>\n</ref> https://jis.gov.jm/information/jamaican-history/\n\n== The Spanish colonial period (1494\u20131655) ==\n{{Main|Spanish Jamaica}}\n\n[[Christopher Columbus]] is believed to be the first European to reach Jamaica.  He landed on the island on 5 May 1494, during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|second voyage]] to the Americas.<ref>[http://www.christopher-columbus.eu/voyage-2.htm \"Christopher Columbus \u2013 2nd Voyage\".]</ref> Columbus returned to Jamaica during his fourth voyage to the Americas.  He had been sailing around the Caribbean nearly a year when a storm beached his ships in [[Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica|St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica]], on 25 June 1503.  For a year Columbus and his men remained stranded on the island, finally departing in June 1504.\n\nThe Spanish crown granted the island to the Columbus family, but for decades it was something of a backwater, valued chiefly as a supply base for food and animal hides.  In 1509 [[Juan de Esquivel]] founded the first permanent European settlement, the town of [[Sevilla la Nueva (Jamaica)|Sevilla la Nueva]] (New Seville), on the north coast. A decade later, Friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] wrote Spanish authorities about Esquivel's conduct during the Hig\u00fcey massacre of 1503.\n\nIn 1534 the capital was moved to [[Villa de la Vega]] (later [[Santiago de la Vega]]), now called [[Spanish Town]].  This settlement served as the capital of both Spanish and English [[Jamaica]], from its founding in 1534 until 1872, after which the capital was moved to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].\n\nThe Spanish enslaved many of the Arawak;<ref>https://jis.gov.jm/information/jamaican-history/</ref> some escaped, but most died from European diseases and overwork. The Spaniards also introduced the first African slaves. By the early 17th century, when virtually no Taino remained in the region, the population of the island was about 3,000, including a small number of African slaves.<ref name=discja>{{cite web|title=JAMAICAN HISTORY I |url=http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |publisher=Discover Jamaica |accessdate=23 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805083846/http://www.discoverjamaica.com/gleaner/discover/geography/history1.htm |archivedate=5 August 2013 }}</ref> Disappointed in the lack of gold on the isle, the Spanish mainly used Jamaica as a [[military base]] to supply colonising efforts in the mainland Americas.<ref name=jam2>{{cite web|title=Brief History of Jamaica|url=http://jamaicans.com/info/brief.htm|publisher=Jamaicans.com|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish colonists did not bring women in the first expeditions and took Ta\u00edno women for their common-law wives, resulting in [[mestizo]] children.<ref>{{cite web|last=Guitar|first=Lynne|title=Criollos: The Birth of a Dynamic New Indo-Afro-European People and Culture on Hispaniola.|url=http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html|work=KACIKE: Journal of Caribbean Amerindian History and Anthropology|accessdate=27 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202053219/http://www.kacike.org/LynneGuitar.html |archivedate=2 December 2008}}</ref>  Sexual violence against the Ta\u00edno women by the Spanish was also common.{{sfn|L\u00e9ger|1907|p=23}}{{sfn|Accilien et al.|2003|p=12}}\n\nAlthough the Taino referred to the island as \"Xaymaca\", the Spanish gradually changed the name to \"Jamaica\".<ref name=Cundall>Cundall, Frank.

In April 1655, [[Robert Venables|General Robert Venables]] led the armada in an attack on Spain's fort at [[Santo Domingo]], [[Hispaniola]]. After the Spanish repulsed this poorly-executed attack, the English force then sailed for Jamaica, the only Spanish West Indies island that did not have new defensive works. In May 1655, around 7,000 English soldiers landed near Jamaica's [[Spanish Town]] capital and soon overwhelmed the small number of Spanish troops (at the time, Jamaica's entire population only numbered around 2,500).<ref>*{{cite book |last=Parker |first=Matthew |date=2011 |title=The Sugar Barons}}</ref>  Spain never recaptured Jamaica, losing the [[Battle of Ocho Rios (1657)|Battle of Ocho Rios]] in 1657 and the [[Battle of Rio Nuevo (1658)|Battle of Rio Nuevo]] in 1658.

Due to the wars in Ireland at this time two-thirds of this 17th-century European population was Irish.  But [[tropical diseases]] kept the number of Europeans under 10,000 until about 1740.  Although the African slave population in the 1670s and 1680s never exceeded 10,000, by the end of the 17th century [[Slave trade|imports]] of [[slave]]s increased the [[Jamaicans of African ancestry|black population]] to at least five times the number of whites. Thereafter, Jamaica's African population did not increase significantly in number until well into the 18th century, in part because ships coming from the west coast of [[Africa]] preferred to unload at the islands of the [[Eastern Caribbean]]. At the beginning of the 18th century, the number of slaves in Jamaica did not exceed 45,000, but by 1800 it had increased to over 300,000.\n\n====The House of Assembly====\n{{Main|House of Assembly of Jamaica}}\nBeginning with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart monarchy]]'s appointment of a civil [[Governor of Jamaica|governor to Jamaica]] in 1661, political patterns were established that lasted well into the 20th century. The second governor, [[Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Lord Windsor]], brought with him in 1662 a proclamation from the king giving Jamaica's non-slave populace the rights of English citizens, including the right to make their own laws. Although he spent only ten weeks in Jamaica, Lord Windsor laid the foundations of a governing system that was to last for two centuries: a crown-appointed governor acting with the advice of a nominated council in the legislature. The legislature consisted of the governor and an elected but highly unrepresentative [[House of Assembly of Jamaica|House of Assembly]].  For years, the planter-dominated Assembly was in continual conflict with the various governors and the Stuart kings; there were also contentious factions within the assembly itself. For much of the 1670s and 1680s, Charles II and [[James II of England|James II]] and the assembly feuded over such matters as the purchase of slaves from ships not run by the royal English trading company. The last Stuart governor, [[Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle]], who was more interested in [[treasure hunting]] than in planting, turned the planter oligarchy out of office. After the duke's death in 1688, the planters, who had fled Jamaica to London, succeeded in lobbying James II to order a return to the pre-Albemarle political arrangement (the local control of Jamaican planters belonging to the assembly).\n\n====Jamaica's pirates====\n{{Main|Port Royal|1692 Jamaica earthquake}}\n[[File:Henry Morgan in colour.jpg|thumb|upright|Henry Morgan, governor of Jamaica]]\nFollowing the 1655 conquest, Spain repeatedly attempted to recapture Jamaica.  In response, in 1657, Governor [[Edward D'Oyley]] invited the [[Brethren of the Coast]] to come to Port Royal and make it their home port. The Brethren was made up of a group of pirates who were descendants of cattle-hunting ''boucaniers'' (later Anglicised to buccaneers), who had turned to piracy after being robbed by the Spanish (and subsequently thrown out of Hispaniola).<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\">Donny L. Hamilton, \"Pirates and Merchants: Port Royal, Jamaica,\" in ''X Marks the Spot: The Archaeology of Piracy,'' ed. Russell K. Skowronek and Charles R. Ewen, 13\u201330 (Gainesville, Florida: University Press of Florida, 2006).</ref> These pirates concentrated their attacks on Spanish shipping, whose interests were considered the major threat to the town. These pirates later became legal English [[privateers]] who were given [[letters of marque]] by Jamaica's governor. Around the same time that pirates were invited to Port Royal, England launched a series of attacks against Spanish shipping vessels and coastal towns. By sending the newly appointed privateers after Spanish ships and settlements, England had successfully set up a system of defense for Port Royal.<ref name=\"autogenerated2006\"/>  Jamaica became a haven of privateers, buccaneers, and occasionally outright pirates: [[Christopher Myngs]], [[Edward Mansvelt]], and most famously, [[Henry Morgan]].\n\nEngland gained formal possession of Jamaica from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1670 through the [[Treaty of Madrid (1670)|Treaty of Madrid]]. Removing the pressing need for constant defense against Spanish attack, this change served as an incentive to [[Plantation economy|planting]]. This settlement also improved the supply of slaves and resulted in more protection, including military support, for the planters against foreign competition. As a result, the sugar monoculture and slave-worked plantation society spread across Jamaica throughout the 18th century, decreasing Jamaica's dependence on privateers for protection and funds.\n\nHowever, the English colonial authorities continued to have difficulties suppressing the Spanish Maroons, who made their homes in the mountainous interior, and mounted periodic raids on estates and towns, such as [[Spanish Town]]. The Karmahaly Maroons continued to stay in the forested mountains, and periodically fought the English.<ref>Mavis Campbell, ''The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal'' (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 14-25.</ref>\n\nAnother blow to Jamaica's partnership with privateers was the violent [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|earthquake]] which destroyed much of Port Royal on 7 June 1692.

Upon landing in Jamaica and other islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] to sugarcane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, due mainly to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. Sugarcane was quickly snapped up by the [[Great Britain|British]], who used it in [[cake]]s and to sweeten [[tea]].  In the 18th century, sugar replaced [[Piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]] as Jamaica's main source of income. The sugar industry was labour-intensive and the British brought hundreds of thousands of enslaved Africans to Jamaica.  By 1832, the median-size plantation in Jamaica had about 150 slaves, and nearly one of every four bondsmen lived on units that had at least 250 slaves.<ref>Robert William Fogel, \"Slavery in the New World\".  ''Without Consent or Contract: The Rise and Fall of American Slavery'', pp. 21\u201323.</ref> In ''The Book of Night Women'', author Marlon James indicates that the ratio of slave owner to enslaved Africans is 1:33.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} James also depicts atrocities that slave owners subjected slaves to, and violent resistance from the slaves; numerous slaves died in pursuit of freedom. After slavery was abolished in 1834, sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s used a variety of forms of labour including workers imported from [[India]] under contracts of [[indenture]].\n\n====First Maroon War====\n{{Main|Jamaican_Maroons#History|First Maroon War}}\nWhen the British captured [[Jamaica]] in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled, leaving a large number of African slaves. These former Spanish slaves created three ''Palenques'', or settlements. Former slaves organised under the leadership of [[Juan de Serras]] allied with the Spanish guerrillas on the western end of the [[Cockpit Country]], while those under [[Juan de Bolas]] established themselves in modern-day [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon Parish]] and served as a \"black militia\" for the English. The third chose to join those who had previously escaped from the Spanish to live and intermarry with the [[Arawak]] people. Each group of Maroons established distinct independent communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica. They survived by subsistence farming and periodic raids of plantations. Over time, the Maroons came to control large areas of the Jamaican interior.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sainsbury|first1=W. Noel|title=America and West Indies|journal=Calendar of State Papers Colonial, America and West Indies|volume=1, 5|issue=1574\u20131660, 1661\u20131668}}</ref>  Early in the 18th century, the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] took a heavy toll on the [[British Army|British troops]] and local militia sent against them in the interior, in what came to be known as the [[First Maroon War]].\n\nThe [[First Maroon War]] came to an end with a 1739\u201340 agreement between the Maroons and the British government. The Maroons were to remain in their five main towns ([[Accompong]]; [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]]; [[Nanny Town]], later known as [[Moore Town]]; [[Scott's Hall (Jamaica)]]; and [[Charles Town, Jamaica]]), living under their own rulers and a British supervisor. In exchange, they were asked to agree not to harbour new runaway slaves, but rather to help catch them. This last clause in the treaty naturally caused a split between the Maroons and the rest of the black population, although from time to time runaways from the plantations still found their way into Maroon settlements. Another provision of the agreement was that the Maroons would serve to protect the island from invaders. The latter was because the Maroons were revered by the British as skilled warriors.  The person responsible for the compromise with the British was the Leeward Maroon leader, [[Cudjoe]], a short, almost dwarf-like man who for years fought skillfully and bravely to maintain his people's independence. As he grew older, however, Cudjoe became increasingly disillusioned. He ran into quarrels with his lieutenants and with other Maroon groups. He felt that the only hope for the future was honorable peace with the enemy, which was just what the British were thinking. The 1739 treaty should be seen in this light. A year later, the even more rebellious Windward Maroons of Trelawny Town also agreed to sign a treaty under pressure from both white Jamaicans and the Leeward Maroons.\n\n====Tacky's revolt====\n{{Main|Tacky's revolt}}\n\nIn May 1760, Tacky, a slave overseer on the [[Frontier Estate|Frontier plantation]] in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]], led a group of enslaved Africans in taking over the Frontier and Trinity plantations while killing their enslavers. They then marched to the storeroom at [[Fort Haldane]], where the munitions to defend the town of [[Port Maria]] were kept. After killing the storekeeper, Tacky and his men stole nearly 4 barrels of gunpowder and 40 firearms with [[lead shot|shot]], before marching on to overrun the plantations at Heywood Hall and Esher.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicans.com/culture/articles_culture/tackys_rebellion.shtml |title=Jamaican Culture |publisher=Jamaicans.com |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-04-16}}</ref> By dawn, hundreds of other slaves had joined Tacky and his followers. At Ballard's Valley, the rebels stopped to rejoice in their success. One slave from Esher decided to slip away and sound the alarm.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/> [[Obeah]]men (Caribbean witch doctors) quickly circulated around the camp dispensing a powder that they claimed would protect the men from injury in battle and loudly proclaimed that an Obeahman could not be killed. Confidence was high.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>  Soon there were 70 to 80 mounted militia on their way along with some Maroons from Scott's Hall, who were bound by treaty to suppress such rebellions. When the militia learned of the Obeahman's boast of not being able to be killed, an Obeahman was captured, killed and hung with his mask, ornaments of teeth and bone and feather trimmings at a prominent place visible from the encampment of rebels. Many of the rebels, confidence shaken, returned to their plantations. Tacky and 25 or so men decided to fight on.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>  Tacky and his men went running through the woods being chased by the Maroons and their legendary marksman, [[Davy the Maroon]]. While running at full speed, Davy shot Tacky and cut off his head as evidence of his feat, for which he would be richly rewarded. Tacky's head was later displayed on a pole in [[Spanish Town]] until a follower took it down in the middle of the night. The rest of Tacky's men were found in a cave near Tacky Falls, having committed suicide rather than going back to slavery.<ref name=\"jamaicans1\"/>\n\n====Second Maroon War====\n{{Main|Second Maroon War}}\nIn 1795, the Second Maroon War was instigated when two Maroons were flogged by a black slave for allegedly stealing two pigs. When six Maroon leaders came to the British to present their grievances, the British took them as prisoners.  This sparked an eight-month conflict, spurred by the fact that Maroons felt that they were being mistreated under the terms of [[Cudjoe]]'s Treaty of 1739, which ended the First Maroon War.  The war lasted for five months as a bloody stalemate. The British 5,000 troops and militia outnumbered the Maroons ten to one, but the mountainous and forested topography of Jamaica proved ideal for guerrilla warfare. The Maroons surrendered in December 1795.  A treaty signed in December between Major General [[George Walpole (British Army officer)|George Walpole]] and the Maroon leaders established that the Maroons would beg on their knees for the King's forgiveness, return all runaway slaves, and be relocated elsewhere in Jamaica. The governor of Jamaica ratified the treaty, but gave the Maroons only three days to present themselves to beg forgiveness on 1 January 1796.  Suspicious of British intentions, most of the Maroons did not surrender until mid-March. The British used the contrived breach of treaty as a pretext to deport the entire Trelawny Town Maroons to [[Nova Scotia]]. After a few years the Maroons were again deported to the new British settlement of [[Sierra Leone]] in [[West Africa]].\n\n=== 19th century ===\n====The Baptist War====\n{{Main|Baptist War}}\nIn 1831, enslaved [[Baptist]] preacher [[Samuel Sharpe]] led a strike among demanding more freedom and a working wage of \"half the going wage rate.\" Upon refusal of their demands, the strike escalated into a full rebellion, in part because Sharpe had also made military preparations with a rebel military group known as the Black Regiment led by a slave known as Colonel Johnson of Retrieve Estate, about 150 strong with 50 guns among them. Colonel Johnson's Black Regiment clashed with a local militia led by Colonel Grignon at old Montpelier on December 28. The militia retreated to Montego Bay while the Black Regiment advanced an invasion of estates in the hills, inviting more slaves to join while burning houses, fields and other properties, setting off a trail of fires through the Great River Valley in Westmoreland and St. Elizabeth to St James.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jamaicagreathouses.com/slavery/index.html|title=Sam Sharpe and the Slave Rebellion (Baptist War)|last=|first=|date=|website=Slavery in the Great House era, Jamaica Great Houses|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[The Baptist War]], as it was known, became the largest slave uprising in the British West Indies,<ref name=Revauger>{{cite book |title=The Abolition of Slavery \u2013 The British Debate 1787\u20131840 |first=C\u00e9cile |last=R\u00e9vauger |authorlink =C\u00e9cile R\u00e9vauger |pages=107\u2013108 |publisher=Presse Universitaire de France |date=October 2008 |isbn=978-2-13-057110-0}}</ref> lasting 10 days and mobilised as many as 60,000 of Jamaica's 300,000 slaves.<ref name=Higman>Barry W.

Approximately five hundred slaves were killed in total: 207 during the revolt and somewhere in the range between 310 and 340 slaves were killed through \"various forms of judicial executions\" after the rebellion was concluded, at times, for quite minor offences (one recorded execution indicates the crime being the theft of a pig; another, a cow).<ref>Mary Reckord. \"The Jamaican Slave Rebellion of 1831\", ''Past & Present'' (July 1968), 40(3): pp. 122, 124\u2013125.</ref> An 1853 account by Henry Bleby described how three or four simultaneous executions were commonly observed; bodies would be allowed to pile up until workhouse slaves carted the bodies away at night and buried them in mass graves outside town.<ref name=Revauger/> The brutality of the plantocracy during the revolt is thought to have accelerated the process of emancipation, with initial measures beginning in 1833.\n\n====Emancipation====\nBecause of the loss of property and life in the 1831 Baptist War rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries.  Their reports on conditions contributed greatly to the abolition movement and passage of the 1833 law to abolish slavery as of August 1, 1834, throughout the [[British Empire]]. The Jamaican slaves were bound (indentured) to their former owners' service, albeit with a guarantee of rights, until 1838 under what was called the \"[[Apprenticeship]] System\".\n\nWith the [[Abolitionism|abolition of the slave trade]] in 1808 and [[slavery]] itself in 1834, however, the island's sugar- and slave-based economy faltered. The period after [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] in 1834 initially was marked by a conflict between the plantocracy and elements in the [[Colonial Office]] over the extent to which individual freedom should be coupled with political participation for blacks. In 1840 the assembly changed the voting qualifications in a way that enabled a majority of blacks and [[Mixed race people|people of mixed race]] (browns or [[mulatto]]s) to vote. But neither change in the political system, nor abolition of slavery changed the planter's chief interest, which lay in the continued profitability of their estates, and they continued to dominate the [[Elitism|elitist]] assembly. Nevertheless, at the end of the 19th century and in the early years of the 20th century, the crown began to allow some Jamaicans \u2013 mostly local merchants, urban professionals, and artisans\u2014into the appointed councils.\n\n====The Morant Bay Rebellion====\n{{Main|Morant Bay Rebellion}}\nTensions resulted in the October 1865 [[Morant Bay rebellion]] led by [[Paul Bogle]]. The rebellion was sparked on 7 October, when a black man was put on trial and imprisoned for allegedly trespassing on a long-abandoned plantation. During the proceedings, James Geoghegon, a black spectator, disrupted the trial, and in the police's attempts to seize him and remove him from the courthouse, a fight broke out between the police and other spectators. While pursuing Geoghegon, the two policeman were beaten with sticks and stones.<ref>Holt (1992), p. 295.</ref> The following Monday arrest warrants were issued for several men for rioting, resisting arrest, and assaulting the police. Among them was Baptist preacher Paul Bogle. A few days later on 11 October, Mr. Paul Bogle marched with a group of protesters to Morant Bay. When the group arrived at the court house they were met by a small and inexperienced volunteer militia. The crowd began pelting the militia with rocks and sticks, and the militia opened fire on the group, killing seven black protesters before retreating.\n\nGovernor [[Edward John Eyre|John Eyre]] sent government troops, under Brigadier-General [[Alexander Nelson (British Army officer)|Alexander Nelson]],<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/19875 \"Alexander Nelson\"] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''.</ref> to hunt down the poorly armed rebels and bring Paul Bogle back to Morant Bay for trial. The troops met with no organised resistance, but regardless they killed blacks indiscriminately, most of whom had not been involved in the riot or rebellion: according to one soldier, \"we slaughtered all before us\u2026 man or woman or child\". In the end, 439 black Jamaicans were killed directly by soldiers, and 354 more (including Paul Bogle) were arrested and later executed, some without proper trials. Paul Bogle was executed \"either the same evening he was tried or the next morning.\"<ref name=\"IPN\">\"The Jamaica Prosecutions. Further Examinations of Colonel Nelson and Lieutenant Brand\", ''The Illustrated Police News: Law-Courts and Weekly Record'' (London), 23 February 1867: 1.</ref> Other punishments included flogging for over 600 men and women (including some pregnant women), and long prison sentences, with thousands of homes belonging to black Jamaicans were burned down without any justifiable reason.\n\n[[George William Gordon]], a Jamaican businessman and politician, who had been critical of Governor John Eyre and his policies, was later arrested by Governor John Eyre who believed he had been behind the rebellion. Despite having very little to do with it, Gordon was eventually executed. Though he was arrested in Kingston, he was transferred by Eyre to Morant Bay, where he could be tried under [[martial law]]. The execution and trial of Gordon via martial law raised some constitutional issues back in Britain, where concerns emerged about whether British dependencies should be ruled under the government of law, or through military license.<ref>{{cite book|last=Semmel|first=Bernard|title=The Governor Eyre Controversy|year=1962|publisher=MacGibbon & Kee|location=London|pages=128}}</ref>  The speedy trial saw Gordon hanged on 23 October, just two days after his trial had begun. He and William Bogle, Paul's brother, \"were both tried together, and executed at the same time.\n\n====Decline of the sugar industry====\n[[File:Cane cutters in Jamaica.jpg|thumb|upright|Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1880]]\nDuring most of the 18th century, a [[Monocropping|monocrop]] economy based on sugarcane production for export flourished. In the last quarter of the century, however, the Jamaican sugar economy declined as famines, hurricanes, colonial wars, and wars of independence disrupted trade. By the 1820s, Jamaican sugar had become less competitive with that from high-volume producers such as Cuba and production subsequently declined. By 1882 sugar output was less than half the level achieved in 1828. A major reason for the decline was the [[British Parliament]]'s [[Slave Trade Act 1807|1807 abolition of the slave trade]], under which the transportation of slaves to Jamaica after 1 March 1808 was forbidden; the abolition of the slave trade was followed by [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|the abolition of slavery in 1834]] and full emancipation within four years. Unable to convert the ex-slaves into a sharecropping tenant class similar to the one established in the [[Reconstruction Era|post-Civil War South of the United States]], planters became increasingly dependent on wage labour and began recruiting workers abroad, primarily from [[British Raj|India]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], and [[Sierra Leone]]. Many of the former slaves settled in peasant or small farm communities in the interior of the island, the \"yam belt,\" where they engaged in subsistence and some [[cash crop]] farming.\n\nThe second half of the 19th century was a period of severe economic decline for Jamaica. Low crop prices, droughts, and disease led to serious social unrest, culminating in the [[Morant Bay rebellion]]s of 1865. However, renewed British administration after the 1865 rebellion, in the form of [[crown colony]] status, resulted in some social and economic progress as well as investment in the physical infrastructure. Agricultural development was the centrepiece of restored British rule in Jamaica. In 1868 the first large-scale irrigation project was launched. In 1895 the Jamaica Agricultural Society was founded to promote more scientific and profitable methods of farming. Also in the 1890s, the Crown Lands Settlement Scheme was introduced, a land reform program of sorts, which allowed small farmers to purchase two hectares or more of land on favourable terms.\n\n[[File:Valentine_and_Sons_-_Cane_Cutters,_Jamaica,_1891.jpg|thumb|left|Sugar cane cutters in Jamaica, 1891]]\nBetween 1865 and 1930, the character of landholding in Jamaica changed substantially, as sugar declined in importance. As many former plantations went bankrupt, some land was sold to Jamaican peasants under the Crown Lands Settlement whereas other cane fields were consolidated by dominant British producers, most notably by the British firm [[Tate & Lyle|Tate and Lyle]]. Although the concentration of land and wealth in Jamaica was not as drastic as in the [[Spanish Caribbean|Spanish-speaking Caribbean]], by the 1920s the typical sugar plantation on the island had increased to an average of 266 hectares. But, as noted, smallscale agriculture in Jamaica survived the consolidation of land by sugar powers. The number of small holdings in fact tripled between 1865 and 1930, thus retaining a large portion of the population as peasantry. Most of the expansion in small holdings took place before 1910, with farms averaging between two and twenty hectares.\n\nThe rise of the [[banana]] trade during the second half of the 19th century also changed production and trade patterns on the island. Bananas were first exported in 1867, and banana farming grew rapidly thereafter. By 1890, bananas had replaced sugar as Jamaica's principal export. Production rose from 5 million stems (32 percent of exports) in 1897 to an average of 20 million stems a year in the 1920s and 1930s, or over half of domestic exports. As with sugar, the presence of American companies, like the well-known [[United Fruit Company]] in Jamaica, was a driving force behind renewed agricultural exports. The British also became more interested in Jamaican bananas than in the country's sugar. Expansion of banana production, however, was hampered by serious labour shortages. The rise of the banana economy took place amidst a general exodus of up to 11,000 Jamaicans a year.\n\n====Jamaica as a Crown Colony====\nIn 1846 Jamaican planters, adversely affected by the loss of slave labour, suffered a crushing blow when Britain passed the [[Sugar Duties Act 1846|Sugar Duties Act]], eliminating Jamaica's traditionally favoured status as its primary supplier of sugar. The Jamaica House of Assembly stumbled from one crisis to another until the collapse of the [[sugar trade]], when racial and religious tensions came to a head during the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] of 1865. Although suppressed ruthlessly, the severe rioting so alarmed the planters that the two-centuries-old assembly voted to abolish itself and asked for the establishment of direct British rule.  In 1866 the new governor [[John Peter Grant]] arrived to implement a series of reforms which accompanied the transition to a [[crown colony]]. The government consisted of the Legislative Council and the executive Privy Council containing members of both chambers of the House of Assembly, but the Colonial Office exercised effective power through a presiding British governor. The council included a few handpicked prominent Jamaicans for the sake of appearance only.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} In the late 19th century, crown colony rule was modified; representation and limited self-rule were reintroduced gradually into Jamaica after 1884. The colony's legal structure was reformed along the lines of [[English common law]] and county courts, and a [[Jamaica Constabulary Force|constabulary force]] was established.  The smooth working of the crown colony system was dependent on a good understanding and an identity of interests between the governing officials, who were [British, and most of the nonofficial, nominated members of the Legislative Council, who were [[Jamaican people|Jamaicans]]. The elected members of this body were in a permanent minority and without any influence or administrative power. The unstated alliance \u2013 based on shared color, attitudes, and interest \u2013 between the British officials and the Jamaican upper class was reinforced in London, where the West India Committee lobbied for Jamaican interests. Jamaica's white or near-white propertied class continued to hold the dominant position in every respect; the vast majority of the black population remained poor and unenfranchised.\n\n====Religion====\nUntil it was disestablished in 1870, the Church of England in Jamaica was the established church. It represented the white English community. It received funding from the colonial government, and was given responsibility for providing religious instruction to the slaves. It was challenged by Methodist missionaries from England, and the Methodists in turn were denounced as troublemakers. The Church of England in Jamaica established the Jamaica Home and Foreign Missionary Society in 1861; its mission stations multiplied, with financial help from religious organizations in London. The Society sent its own missionaries to West Africa. Baptist missions grew rapidly, thanks to missionaries from England and the United States, and became the largest denomination by 1900. Baptist missionaries denounced the apprentice system as a form of slavery. In the 1870s and 1880s the Methodists opened a high school and a theological college. Other Protestant groups included the Moravians, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Seventh-day Adventist, Church of God, and others.  There were several thousand Roman Catholics.<ref>See [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08270a.htm \"Jamaica' in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910)]</ref>  The population was largely Christian by 1900, and most families were linked with the church or a Sunday School. Traditional pagan practices persisted in unorganized fashion, such as witchcraft.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette.

Kingston had been founded as a refuge for survivors of the [[1692 Jamaica earthquake|1692 earthquake]] that destroyed [[Port Royal]].  The town did not begin to grow until after the further destruction of Port Royal by fire in 1703.  Surveyor John Goffe drew up a plan for the town based on a grid bounded by North, East, West and Harbour Streets. By 1716 it had become the largest town and the center of trade for [[Jamaica]]. The government sold land to people with the regulation that they purchase no more than the amount of the land that they owned in [[Port Royal]], and only land on the sea front. Gradually wealthy merchants began to move their residences from above their businesses to the farm lands north on the plains of [[Liguanea]]. In 1755 the [[List of Governors of Jamaica|governor]], [[Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet|Sir Charles Knowles]], had decided to transfer the government offices from [[Spanish Town]] to Kingston. It was thought by some to be an unsuitable location for the Assembly in proximity to the moral distractions of Kingston, and the next governor rescinded the Act. However, by 1780 the population of Kingston was 11,000, and the merchants began lobbying for the administrative capital to be transferred from Spanish Town, which was by then eclipsed by the commercial activity in Kingston.  The [[1907 Kingston earthquake]] destroyed much of the city.  Considered by many writers of that time one of the world's deadliest earthquakes, it resulted in the death of over eight hundred Jamaicans and destroyed the homes of over ten thousand more.<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite book|author=J.

Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Anglocentrism|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by black nationalist figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably Leonard Howell, proclaimed that the crowning of [[Haile Selassie]] as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's counter-cultural stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley.<ref>M.G.

Economic stagnation, discontent with unemployment, low wages, high prices, and poor living conditions caused [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|social unrest in the 1930s]]. Uprisings in Jamaica began on the Frome Sugar Estate in the western [[Westmoreland Parish|parish of Westmoreland]] and quickly spread east to [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Jamaica, in particular, set the pace for the region in its demands for economic development from British colonial rule.\n\nBecause of disturbances in Jamaica and the rest of the region, the British in 1938 appointed the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]]. An immediate result of the Commission was the Colonial Development Welfare Act, which provided for the expenditure of approximately \u01411 million a year for twenty years on coordinated development in the [[British West Indies]]. Concrete actions, however, were not implemented to deal with Jamaica's massive structural problems.\n\n====New unions and parties====\nThe rise of [[nationalism]], as distinct from island identification or desire for [[self-determination]], is generally dated to the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|1938 labour riots]] that affected both Jamaica and the islands of the Eastern Caribbean. [[William Alexander Bustamante]], a moneylender in the capital city of [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] who had formed the Jamaica Trade Workers and Tradesmen Union (JTWTU) three years earlier, captured the imagination of the black masses with his messianic personality, even though he himself was light-skinned, affluent, and aristocratic. Bustamante emerged from the 1938 strikes and other disturbances as a populist leader and the principal spokesperson for the militant urban working class, and in that year, using the JTWTU as a stepping stone, he founded the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU), which inaugurated Jamaica's workers movement.\n\nA distant cousin of Bustamante's, [[Norman Manley|Norman W. Manley]], concluded as a result of the 1938 riots that the real basis for national unity in Jamaica lay in the masses. Unlike the union-oriented Bustamante, however, Manley was more interested in access to control over [[Power (social and political)|state power]] and [[political rights]] for the masses. On 18 September 1938, he inaugurated the [[People's National Party]] (PNP), which had begun as a nationalist movement supported by the mixed-race middle class and the liberal sector of the business community with leaders who were highly educated members of the [[upper middle class]]. The 1938 riots spurred the PNP to [[Trade union|unionise labour]], although it would be several years before the PNP formed major labour unions. The party concentrated its earliest efforts on establishing a network both in urban areas and in banana-growing rural [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], later working on building support among small farmers and in areas of bauxite mining.\n\nThe PNP adopted a [[socialist]] ideology in 1940 and later joined the [[Socialist International]], allying itself formally with the [[social democratic]] parties of [[Western Europe]]. Guided by socialist principles, Manley was not a doctrinaire socialist. PNP socialism during the 1940s was similar to [[British Labour Party]] ideas on state control of the factors of production, [[equality of opportunity]], and a [[welfare state]], although a left-wing element in the PNP held more orthodox [[Marxist]] views and worked for the internationalisation of the trade union movement through the Caribbean Labour Congress. In those formative years of Jamaican political and union activity, relations between Manley and Bustamante were cordial. Manley defended Bustamante in court against charges brought by the British for his labour activism in the 1938 riots and looked after the BITU during Bustamante's imprisonment.\n\nBustamante had political ambitions of his own, however. In 1942, while still incarcerated, he founded a political party to rival the PNP, called the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The new party, whose leaders were of a lower class than those of the PNP, was supported by conservative businessmen and 60,000 dues-paying BITU members, who encompassed dock and sugar plantation workers and other unskilled urban labourers. On his release in 1943, Bustamante began building up the JLP. Meanwhile, several PNP leaders organised the leftist-oriented Trade Union Congress (TUC). Thus, from an early stage in modern Jamaica, unionised labour was an integral part of organised political life.\n\nFor the next quarter century, Bustamante and Manley competed for centre stage in Jamaican political affairs, the former espousing the cause of the \"barefoot man\"; the latter, \"democratic socialism,\" a loosely defined political and economic theory aimed at achieving a [[Classless society|classless]] system of government. Jamaica's two founding fathers projected quite different popular images. Bustamante, lacking even a [[high school diploma]], was an autocratic, charismatic, and highly adept politician; Manley was an athletic, [[University of Oxford|Oxford-trained]] lawyer, [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes scholar]], humanist, and liberal intellectual. Although considerably more reserved than Bustamante, Manley was well liked and widely respected. He was also a visionary nationalist who became the driving force behind the crown colony's quest for independence.\n\nFollowing the 1938 disturbances in the [[West Indies]], [[London]] sent the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Moyne Commission]] to study conditions in the [[British West Indies|British Caribbean territories]]. Its findings led in the early 1940s to better wages and a new constitution. Issued on 20 November 1944, the [[Constitution of Jamaica|Constitution]] modified the crown colony system and inaugurated limited self-government based on the [[Westminster system|Westminster model of government]] and [[universal adult suffrage]]. It also embodied the island's principles of ministerial responsibility and the rule of law. Thirty-one percent of the population participated in the [[Jamaican general election, 1944|1944 elections]]. The JPL \u2013 helped by its promises to create jobs, its practice of dispensing public funds in pro-JLP parishes, and the PNP's relatively radical platform \u2013 won an 18 percent majority of the votes over the PNP, as well as 22 seats in the 32-member House of Representatives, with 5 going to the PNP and 5 to other short-lived parties. In 1945 Bustamante took office as Jamaica's first premier (the pre-independence title for [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|head of government]]).\n\nUnder the new charter, the British governor, assisted by the six-member Privy Council and ten-member Executive Council, remained responsible solely to the crown. The Jamaican Legislative Council became the upper house, or Senate, of the bicameral Parliament. House members were elected by adult suffrage from single-member electoral districts called constituencies. Despite these changes, ultimate power remained concentrated in the hands of the governor and other high officials.<ref name=jlp>{{cite web|title=The Jamaican Labour Party (JLP) |url=http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php |work=2005 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803163859/http://www.alexanderbustamante.com/the-jlp.php |archivedate=3 August 2013 }}</ref><ref name=Constit>{{cite web|title=History this week:Constitutional Developments in British Guiana and Jamaica between 1890 and 1945 (Part 3)|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2010/features/05/13/history-this-weekconstitutional-developments-in-british-guiana-and-jamaica-between-1890-and-1945-part-3/|work=13 May 2010|publisher=StabroekNews|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Independent Jamaica (1962-)}}Independent Jamaica (1962\u2013present)==\n===1960s===\n====The road to independence====\n{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}\n\nAfter [[World War II]], Jamaica began a relatively [[Independence of Jamaica|long transition to full political independence]]. Jamaicans preferred [[British culture]] over [[American culture|American]], but they had a [[love-hate relationship]] with the British and resented British domination, [[racism]], and the dictatorial Colonial Office. Britain gradually granted the colony more self-government under periodic constitutional changes. Jamaica's political patterns and governmental structure were shaped during two decades of what was called \"constitutional [[decolonisation]],\" the period between 1944 and independence in 1962.\n\nHaving seen how little popular appeal the PNP's 1944 campaign position had, the party shifted toward the centre in 1949 and remained there until 1974. The PNP actually won a 0.8-percent majority of the votes over the JLP in the [[Jamaican general election, 1949|1949 election]], although the JLP won a majority of the House seats. In the 1950s, the PNP and JLP became increasingly similar in their sociological composition and ideological outlook. During the [[cold war]] years, socialism became an explosive domestic issue. The JLP exploited it among property owners and churchgoers, attracting more middle-class support. As a result, PNP leaders diluted their socialist rhetoric, and in 1952 the PNP moderated its image by expelling four prominent leftists who had controlled the TUC. The PNP then formed the more conservative [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]] (NWU). Henceforth, PNP socialism meant little more than national planning within a framework of private property and foreign capital. The PNP retained, however, a basic commitment to socialist precepts, such as public control of resources and a more equitable income distribution. Manley's PNP came to office for the first time after winning the [[Jamaican general election, 1955|1955 elections]] with an 11-percent majority over the JLP and 50.5 percent of the popular vote.\n\nAmendments to the constitution that took effect in May 1953 reconstituted the Executive Council and provided for eight ministers to be selected from among House members. The first ministries were subsequently established. These amendments also enlarged the limited powers of the House of Representatives and made elected members of the governor's executive council responsible to the legislature. Manley, elected [[Prime Minister of Jamaica|chief minister]] beginning in January 1955, accelerated the process of decolonisation during his able stewardship. Further progress toward [[self-government]] was achieved under constitutional amendments in 1955 and 1956, and cabinet government was established on 11 November 1957.\n\nAssured by British declarations that independence would be granted to a collective West Indian state rather than to individual colonies, Manley supported Jamaica's joining nine other British territories in the [[West Indies Federation]], established on 3 January 1958. Manley became the island's premier after the PNP again won a decisive victory in the [[Jamaican general election, 1959|general election in July 1959]], securing thirty of forty-five House seats.\n\nMembership in the federation remained an issue in Jamaican politics. Bustamante, reversing his previously supportive position on the issue, warned of the financial implications of membership \u2013 Jamaica was responsible for 43 percent of its own financing \u2013 and an inequity in Jamaica's proportional representation in the federation's House of Assembly. Manley's PNP favoured staying in the federation, but he agreed to hold a [[Jamaican Federation of the West Indies membership referendum, 1961|referendum in September 1961]] to decide on the issue. When 54 percent of the electorate voted to withdraw, Jamaica left the federation, which dissolved in 1962 after [[Trinidad and Tobago]] also pulled out. Manley believed that the rejection of his pro-federation policy in the 1961 referendum called for a renewed mandate from the electorate, but the JLP won the [[Jamaican general election, 1962|election of early 1962]] by a fraction. Bustamante assumed the premiership that April, and Manley spent his remaining few years in politics as leader of the opposition.\n\nJamaica received [[Independence of Jamaica|its independence]] on 6 August 1962. The new nation retained, however, its membership in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and adopted a [[Westminster parliamentary system|Westminster-style parliamentary system]]. Bustamante, at the age of 78, became the new nation's first prime minister.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Jamaica: Self-government|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299716/Jamaica/214972/Self-government#ref515864|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The West Indies Federation |url=http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/west_indies_federation.jsp?menu=community |work=2011 |publisher=CARICOM |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929234257/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/west_indies_federation.jsp?menu=community |archivedate=29 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n====Jamaica under Bustamante====\nBustamante subsequently became the first [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]].

This pattern was accelerated with the export of bauxite beginning in the 1950s. The economic structure shifted from a dependence on agriculture that in 1950 accounted for 30.8 percent of GDP to an agricultural contribution of 12.9 percent in 1960 and 6.7 percent in 1970. During the same period, the contribution to GDP of mining increased from less than 1 percent in 1950 to 9.3 percent in 1960 and 12.6 percent in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leaders since 1962 |url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/leaders.html |publisher=This is Jamaica |accessdate=24 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904154730/http://www.jis.gov.jm/special_sections/This%20Is%20Jamaica/leaders.html |archivedate=4 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBustamante's government also continued the government's repression of Rastafarians.

Under Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers. In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas. The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.\n\nLand reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilisers and access to credit. An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration and/or purchased by large bauxite companies.\n\nThe minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Insight Guide: Jamaica, Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Master and Servant Act|Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights.

The concert came to its peak during [[Bob Marley|Bob Marley & The Wailers]]' performance of \"Jammin'\", when [[Bob Marley|Marley]] joined the hands of political rivals [[Michael Manley]] ([[People's National Party|PNP]]) and [[Edward Seaga]] ([[Jamaican Labour Party|JLP]]).\n\n====Edward Seaga====\nIn the 1980 election, [[Edward Seaga]] and the JLP won by an overwhelming majority \u2013 57 percent of the popular vote and 51 of the 60 seats in the [[Parliament of Jamaica|House of Representatives]].  Seaga immediately began to reverse the policies of his predecessor by privatising industry and seeking closer ties with the USA.  Seaga was one of the first foreign heads of government to visit newly elected US president [[Ronald Reagan]] early the next year and was one of the architects of the [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]], which was sponsored by Reagan. He delayed his promise to cut diplomatic relations with [[Cuba]] until a year later when he accused the Cuban government of giving [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to Jamaican criminals.\n\nSeaga supported the collapse of the [[Marxism|Marxist]] regime in [[Grenada]] and the subsequent US-led invasion of that island in October 1983. On the back of the Grenada invasion, Seaga called [[Jamaican general election, 1983|snap elections]] at the end of 1983, which Manley's PNP boycotted. His party thus controlled all seats in parliament. In an unusual move, because the Jamaican constitution required an opposition in the appointed [[Parliament of Jamaica|Senate]], Seaga appointed eight independent senators to form an official opposition.\n\nSeaga lost much of his US support when he was unable to deliver on his early promises of removing the bauxite levy, and his domestic support also plummeted. Articles attacking Seaga appeared in the US media and foreign investors left the country. Rioting in 1987 and 1988, the continued high popularity of Michael Manley, and complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake of the devastation of the island by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988, also contributed to his defeat in the [[Jamaican general election, 1989|1989 elections]].\n\n====Hurricane Gilbert====\n{{Main|Hurricane Gilbert}}\nIn 1988, [[Hurricane Gilbert]] produced a {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[storm surge]] and brought up to {{convert|823|mm|in}} of rain in the mountainous areas of Jamaica,<ref name=\"uwi\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mona.uwi.edu/cardin/virtual_library/docs/1139/1139.pdf|title=Assessment of Rainfall Characteristics and Landslide Hazards in Jamaica|author=Ahmad, Rafi, Lawrence Brown, Jamaica National Meteorological Service|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|page=27|date=10 January 2006|accessdate=6 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031308/http://www.mona.uwi.edu/cardin/virtual_library/docs/1139/1139.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> causing inland flash flooding. 49 people died.<ref name=\"1988mwr\">{{cite journal|author=Lawrence, Miles B.|author2=Gross, James M.|year=1989|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/general/lib/lib1/nhclib/mwreviews/1988.pdf|title=Atlantic Hurricane Season of 1988|accessdate=24 February 2007|issn=0027-0644|journal=Monthly Weather Review|page=2253|volume=117|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1989)117<2248:AHSO>2.0.CO;2|issue=10|bibcode = 1989MWRv..117.2248L }}</ref> Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] stated that the hardest hit areas near where Gilbert made landfall looked \"like [[Hiroshima]] after the [[nuclear weapon|atom bomb]].\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Patrick Reyna|agency=Associated Press|date=14 September 1988|title=Jamaica's Premier Reports Island Devastated by Hurricane|location=Kingston, Jamaica}} (accessed through LexisNexis)</ref> The storm left US$4&nbsp;billion (in 1988 dollars) in damage from destroyed crops, buildings, houses, roads, and small aircraft.<ref name=\"The Storm and its Effects\">{{cite journal|title=The Storm And Its Effects |url=http://www.crid.or.cr/digitalizacion/pdf/eng/doc6803/doc6803-01.pdf |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222221941/http://www.crid.or.cr/digitalizacion/pdf/eng/doc6803/doc6803-01.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2012 }}</ref> Two people eventually had to be rescued because of [[mudslide]]s triggered by Gilbert and were sent to the hospital.

Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]] announced the election date on January 15, 1989 at a rally in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]].<ref>Treaster, Joseph B., [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/17/world/jamaica-election-set-for-february.html \"Jamaica election set for February\"], ''The New York Times'', 17 January 1989.</ref>  He cited emergency conditions caused by [[Hurricane Gilbert]] in 1988 as the reason for extending the parliamentary term beyond its normal five-year mandate.<ref>Lansford, Tom (2014). \"Political Handbook of the World 2014\", p. 717. {{ISBN|1483333272}}, 9781483333274.</ref>\n\nThe date and tone of the election were shaped in part by [[Hurricane Gilbert]], which made landfall in September 1988 and decimated the island.  The hurricane caused almost $1 billion worth of damage to the island, with banana and coffee crops wiped out and thousands of homes destroyed.  Both parties engaged in campaigning through the distribution of relief supplies, a hallmark of the Jamaican patronage system.  Political commentators noted that prior to the hurricane, Edward Seaga and the JLP trailed Michael Manley and the PNP by twenty points in opinion polls.  The ability to provide relief as the party in charge allowed Seaga to improve his standing among voters and erode the inevitability of Manley's victory.  However, scandals related to the relief effort cost Seaga and the JLP some of the gains made immediately following the hurricane.  Scandals that emerged included National Security Minister [[Errol Anderson]] personally controlling a warehouse full of disaster relief supplies and candidate [[Joan Gordon-Webley]] distributing American-donated flour in sacks with her picture on them.<ref>Kurlansky, Mark, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/27/magazine/showdown-in-jamaica.html?pagewanted=all \"Showdown in Jamaica\"], ''The New York Times'', 27 November 1988.</ref>\n\nThe election was characterised by a narrower ideological difference between the two parties on economic issues.  Michael Manley facilitated his comeback campaign by moderating his leftist positions and admitting mistakes made as Prime Minister, saying he erred when he involved government in economic production and had abandoned all thoughts of nationalising industry.  He cited the PNP's desire to continue the market-oriented policies of the JLP government, but with a more participatory approach.<ref>Garrity, Michele and Picard, Louis A. \"Policy Reform for Sustainable Development in the Caribbean\", p. 39. {{ISBN|4274900991}}, 9784274900990.</ref>  Prime Minister Edward Seaga ran on his record of economic growth and the reduction of unemployment in Jamaica, using the campaign slogan \"Don't Let Them Wreck It Again\" to refer to Manley's tenure as Prime Minister.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\">Melvin, Don, [http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-02-06/news/8901070618_1_michael-manley-minister-jamaica-labour-party \"Personalities Of Candidates Key Issue In Jamaica Election\"], ''Sun Sentinel'', 6 February 1989.</ref>  Seaga during his tenure as Prime Minister emphasised the need to tighten public sector spending and cut close to 27,000 public sector jobs in 1983 and 1984.<ref>Tanna, Laura, [http://mobile.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100314/arts/arts4.php \"On development and losing elections\"] (interview with former Prime Minister Edward Seaga), ''Jamaica Gleaner'', 14 March 2010.</ref> He shifted his plans as elections neared with a promise to spend J$1 billion on a five-year Social Well-Being Programme, which would build new hospitals and schools in Jamaica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040111/focus/focus5.html |title=Missed opportunities: From old partners to new partnerships |author=Buddan, Robert |work=Jamaica Gleaner|date=11 January 2004|accessdate=7 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222246/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20040111/focus/focus5.html |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref>  Foreign policy also played a role in the 1989 election.

Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of liberalisation. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>  The government also announced a 50% increase in the number of food stamps for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children) was announced. A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government also had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader. His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.  Patterson led efforts to strengthen the country's social protection and security systems\u2014a critical element of his economic and social policy agenda to mitigate, reduce poverty and social deprivation.<ref>Franklyn, Delano (ed.): 2002.

Negotiations led in 1993 to the EU agreeing to maintain the Caribbean producers' preferential access until the end of Lom\u00e9 IV, pending possible negotiation on an extension.  In 1995, the United States government petitioned to the [[World Trade Organization]] to investigate whether the Lom\u00e9 IV convention had violated WTO rules. Then later in 1996, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, effectively ending the cross-subsidies that had benefited ACP countries for many years. But the US remained unsatisfied and insisted that all preferential trade agreements between the EU and ACP should cease. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body established another panel to discuss the issue and concluded that agreements between the EU and ACP were indeed not compatible with WTO regulations. Finally, the EU negotiated with the US through WTO to reach an agreement.[http://www.coha.org/2005/05/16/banana-wars-continue-%E2%80%93-chiquita-once-again-tries-to-work-its-omnipotent-will-now-under-new-management-likely-big-losers-will-be-caricom%E2%80%99s-windward-islands/]\n\nIn tourism, after a decrease in volume following the [[11 September attacks]] in the U.S., the number of tourists going to Jamaica eventually rebounded, with the island now receiving over a million tourists each year.

Dancehall brought a new generation of producers, including [[Linval Thompson]], [[Gussie Clarke]] and [[Jah Thomas]].  In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \"[[ragga]]\") becoming increasingly characterised by faster rhythms.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Yellowman backed by Sagittarius Band, Bersenbrueck 2007 -1 (cropped).jpg|[[Yellowman]]\nFile:Eek-A-Mouse (Swea reggae festival 2006).jpg|[[Eek-A-Mouse]]\n</gallery>\n\nIn the early 1990s songs by [[Dawn Penn]], [[Shabba Ranks]], [[Patra (singer)|Patra]] and [[Chaka Demus and Pliers]] were the first dancehall megahits in the US and abroad. Other varieties of dancehall achieved crossover success outside of Jamaica during the mid-to-late 1990s.  In the 1990s, dancehall came under increasing criticism for anti-gay lyrics such as those found in Buju Banton's 1988 hit \"Boom Bye Bye,\" which is about shooting a gay man in the head: \"It's like boom bye bye / Inna batty boy head / Rude boy nah promote no nasty man / Dem haffi dead.\" <ref>{{cite news |last=West |first=Keon |date=6 June 2014 |title=Why do so many Jamaicans hate gay people? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/jamaica-music-anti-gay-dancehall-homophobia |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=4 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe early 2000s saw the success of newer charting acts such as [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Tanya Stephens]], and [[Sean Paul]].

Under Christopher Coke's leadership, the gang trafficked drugs and dabbled in visa fraud (using a high-school athletics team) and extortion, charging small traders in the nearby market for \u201cprotection money\u201d.  The gang had close political ties. Tivoli Gardens is part of the Kingston Western parliamentary district, a seat was held for years by [[Edward Seaga]], long-time leader of the [[Jamaica Labour Party|JLP]].

Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of \"[[Averroism]]\" or \"radical [[Aristotelianism]]\" in the universities. In response to these perceived errors, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being ''De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas'' (''On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists'') in which he reprimands Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=10\u201311}} During his second regency, he finished the second part of the ''Summa'' and wrote ''De virtutibus'' and ''De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes'' (''On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers''),{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=5}} the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian ''beginninglessness'' of the world.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nDisputes with some important [[Franciscans]] conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266\u201367 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, most likely counting him as one of the \"blind leaders of the blind\". [[Eleonore Stump]] says, \"It has also been persuasively argued that Aquinas's ''De aeternitate mundi'' was directed in particular against his Franciscan colleague in theology, [[John Pecham]].\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nIn reality, Thomas was deeply disturbed by the spread of Averroism and was angered when he discovered [[Siger of Brabant]] teaching Averroistic interpretations of Aristotle to Parisian students.<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Reader| pages= 9\u201311}}</ref> On 10 December 1270, the Bishop of Paris, [[\u00c9tienne Tempier]], issued an edict condemning thirteen Aristotelian and Averroistic propositions as heretical and excommunicating anyone who continued to support them.<ref>McInerney, ''Against the Averroists'', p. 10.</ref> Many in the ecclesiastical community, the so-called Augustinians, were fearful that this introduction of Aristotelianism and the more extreme Averroism might somehow contaminate the purity of the Christian faith. In what appears to be an attempt to counteract the growing fear of Aristotelian thought, Thomas conducted a series of disputations between 1270 and 1272: ''De virtutibus in communi'' (''On Virtues in General''), ''De virtutibus cardinalibus'' (''On Cardinal Virtues''), ''De spe'' (''On Hope'').<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Reader| page= 11}}</ref>\n\n===Final days and \"straw\" (1272\u20131274)===\n[[File:Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Icon of the crucifixion speaking to Thomas Aquinas is depicted on this stained glass window in [[Saint Patrick Church (Columbus, Ohio)]]]]\n\nIn 1272 Thomas took leave from the University of Paris when the Dominicans from his home province called upon him to establish a ''studium generale'' wherever he liked and staff it as he pleased.

Much of his work bears upon philosophical topics, and in this sense may be characterized as philosophical. Thomas's philosophical thought has exerted enormous influence on subsequent Christian theology, especially that of the Catholic Church, extending to Western philosophy in general. Thomas stands as a vehicle and modifier of [[Aristotelianism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. It is said that Thomas modified both Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism by way of heavy reliance on the [[Pseudo-Dionysius]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Commentaries on Aristotle===\nThomas Aquinas wrote several important commentaries on [[Aristotle]]'s works, including ''[[On the Soul]]'', ''On Interpretation'', ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.

Thomas also describes the virtues as imperfect (incomplete) and perfect (complete) virtues. A perfect virtue is any virtue with charity, charity completes a cardinal virtue. A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity. These are somewhat supernatural and are distinct from other virtues in their object, namely, God:\n\n{{quote|Now the object of the theological virtues is God Himself, Who is the last end of all, as surpassing the knowledge of our reason.

Moreover, according to Thomas, [[oligarchy]] degenerates more easily into [[tyranny]] than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise the political situation could deteriorate into [[anarchy]], which would be even worse than tyranny.\n\nAccording to Thomas, monarchs are God's representatives in their territories, but the Church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and morality. As a consequence, worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic Church's doctrines and determinations.\n\nFollowing Aristotle's concept of [[slavery]], Thomas justifies this institution on the grounds of [[natural law]].<ref>Heinz-Dietrich Wendland (1962): ''Sklaverei und Christentum''. In: ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Third Edition, T\u00fcbingen (Germany), Vol. VI, col. 103</ref> However, Thomas also distinguished between 'natural slavery', which is for the benefit of both master and slave, and 'servile slavery', which removes all autonomy from the slave and is, according to Thomas, worse than death.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/@texts2/1271_aquinas/08_aq_slavery-ST3.htm |title=Aquinas on Slavery |website= stjohnsem.edu |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Psychology===\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2013}}\n{{Expert needed|Philosophy|section|talk=\"Psychology|reason=statements are not attributed or contextualised|date=September 2013}}\n}}\n\nThomas Aquinas maintains that a human is a single material substance. He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are \"human\" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.\n\nIn his ''Summa theologiae'' Thomas clearly states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as \"the first principle of life\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 1}}</ref> The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body. Because the intellect is incorporeal, it does not use the bodily organs, as \"the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luis mu\u00f1oz-santo tom\u00e1s de aquino.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Thomas Aquinas by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Lafuente]] \nAccording to Thomas the soul is not matter, not even incorporeal or spiritual matter. If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver's own nature, so for soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that \"something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body\", and \"a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Contra Gentiles |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=U. of Notre Dame Press |year=1975 |location=Notre Dame, Ind. |translator-last=Anton C. Pegis |chapter=5 volumes. |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe soul is a \"[[substantial form]]\"; it is a part of a substance, but it is not a substance by itself. Nevertheless, the soul exists separately from the body, and continues, after death, in many of the capacities we think of as human. Substantial form is what makes a thing a member of the species to which it belongs, and substantial form is also the structure or configuration that provides the object with the abilities that make the object what it is. For humans, those abilities are those of the rational animal.\n\nThese distinctions can be better understood in the light of Thomas's understanding of matter and form, a [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] (\"matter/form\") theory derived from [[Aristotle]]. In any given substance, matter and form are necessarily united, and each is a necessary aspect of that substance. However, they are conceptually separable. Matter represents what is changeable about the substance\u2014what is potentially something else. For example, bronze matter is potentially a statue, or also potentially a cymbal. Matter must be understood as the matter ''of'' something. In contrast, form is what determines some particular chunk of matter to be a specific substance and no other. When Thomas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter, he means the material body is only potentially a human being. The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being. Consequently, the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human.\n\n===Economics===\nAquinas addressed most economic questions within the framework of justice, which he contended was the highest of virtues. He says that justice is \"a habit whereby man renders to each his due by a constant and perpetual will.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q58, A1}}</ref> He argued that this concept of justice has its roots in natural law. Joseph Schumpeter, in his ''History of Economic Analysis'', concluded that \"All the economic questions put together matters less to him than did the smallest point of theological or philosophical doctrine, and it is only where economic phenomena raise questions of moral theology that he touches upon them at all.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1954 |location=New York |pages=90}}</ref>\n\nAquinas was careful to distinguish the [[Just price|just]], or natural, price of a good from that price which manipulates another party. He determines the just price from a number of things. First, the just price must be relative to the worth of the good. Aquinas holds that the price of a good measures its quality: \"the quality of a thing that comes into human use is measured by the price given for it.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A1}}</ref> He goes on to say that the price of a good, measured by its worth, is determined by its usefulness to man. This worth is subjective because each good has a different level of usefulness to every man. Aquinas argues, then, that the price should reflect the current value of a good according to its usefulness to man. He continues: \"Gold and silver are costly not only on account of the usefulness of the vessels and other like things made from them, but also on account of the excellence and purity of their substance.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A2}}</ref>\n\nAquinas also wrote extensively on [[usury]], that is, the lending of money with interest. He condemned its practice: \"to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inequality which is contrary to justice.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q78, A1}}</ref> Money, and other similar goods, are consumed only when they are used. Charging a premium for money lent is a charge for ''more'' than the use of the good. Thus, Aquinas concluded that the lender is charging for something not his own, in other words, not rendering to each his due.\n\n==Theology==\n{{See also|Works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n[[File:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|thumb|17th-century sculpture of Thomas Aquinas]]\n\nThomas Aquinas viewed [[theology]], or the ''[[sacred]] [[doctrine]]'', as a science,<ref name=Stanford/> the raw material data of which consists of written [[Sacred Tradition|scripture]] and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, while distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary\u2014or, rather, that the ''confluence'' of both was necessary\u2014for one to obtain true knowledge of God. Thomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas's mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth. The central thought is [[Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit]]. [[Divine grace|Grace]] does not destroy nature, but perfects it.\n\n===Revelation===\nThomas believed that truth is known through reason, rationality ([[natural revelation]]) and faith ([[supernatural revelation]]). ''Supernatural'' revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [[Magisterium]], the sum of which is called \"Tradition\". ''Natural'' revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [[Jesus Christ]]. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], and charity are revealed in the teachings of the Church and the [[Scripture]]s and may not otherwise be deduced.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion |last=Hankey |first=Wayne |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-78295-1 |edition=Second |location=CSU East Bay |pages=134\u201335}}</ref>\n\n====Preserving nature within grace====\nRevealed knowledge does not negate the truth and the completeness of human science as human, it further establishes them. First, it grants that the same things can be treated from two different perspectives without one canceling the other; thus there can be two sciences of God. Second, it provides the basis for the two sciences: one functions through the power of the light of natural reason, the other through the light of divine revelation. Moreover, they can, at least to some extent, keep out of each other's way because they differ \"according to genus\". Sacred doctrine is a fundamentally different kind of thing from theology, which is part of philosophy (ST I. 1.1 ad 2).\n\nFaith and reason complement rather than contradict each other, each giving different views of the same truth.\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:Tommaso - Super libros de generatione et corruptione - 4733257 00007.tif|thumb|''Super libros de generatione et corruptione'']]\n\nAs a Catholic Thomas believed that God is the \"maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible.\" Like Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life, a theory of ongoing [[abiogenesis]] known as [[spontaneous generation]]:\n\n{{quote|Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated.

Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [[mutation]]s in animal [[sperm]], and argued that they were not unintended by [[nature]]; rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]]'':\n\n{{quote|The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the 'ox-progeny', i.e., half ox and half man.

While it would be contradictory to speak of a \"just schism\", a \"just brawling\" or a \"just sedition\" (the three terms denote sin and sin only) \"war\" alone permits sub classification into good and bad kinds.

Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. <!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --> Examples of \"[[The Just War tradition|just war]]\" are:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.\n* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.\n* War to punish a guilty enemy.\n\nA war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* The response must be commensurate with the evil; more violence than is strictly necessary would be unjust.\n* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.\n* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.\n* The belligerents must exhaust all options for dialogue and negotiation before undertaking a war; war is legitimate only as a last resort.\n\nUnder this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.\n\n===Nature of God===\nThomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \"Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject{{nbsp}}... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature\u2014namely, by effects.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The Existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nThomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''Summa theologiae'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed analysis of the five proofs, see [[Existence of God]]}}\n{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[Quinque viae]]}}\n\n# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\n# \n# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.\n# \n# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\n# \n# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. {{H:title|Note that Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself.|This then, we call God}}\n# \n# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws.

This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:\n# [[divine simplicity|God is simple]], without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=74\u201377}}\n# God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God's complete actuality.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=86\u201387}} Thomas defined God as the '''Ipse [http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi] subsistens'',' subsisting act of being.<ref>See ''[[Actus Essendi]]''.

Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either \"natural law\" (that determined by reason) or \"divine law\" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God's will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one's own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with \"evil\" ([[privation]] of good, or ''[[privatio boni]]''<ref>{{cite book| chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2075.htm#article1 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= II-I | chapter= Question 75, Article 1| quote= For evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing.}}</ref>). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God's will for human beings.\n\n===Nature of the Trinity===\nThomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [[Trinity|Three Interrelated Persons]]. These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term \"Trinity\" \"does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1031.htm#article3 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The unity or plurality in God (Prima Pars, Q. 31) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit \"who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word.\"\n\nThis Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Word in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] and through the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit]] within those who have experienced [[salvation]] by God; according to Aidan Nichols.{{sfn|Nichols|2002|pp=173\u201374}}\n\n===''Prima causa'' (first cause)===\nThomas's five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle's assertions concerning principles of being. For God as ''[[prima causa]]'' (\"first cause\") comes from Aristotle's concept of the [[unmoved mover]] and asserts that God is the ultimate cause of all things.{{sfn|Nichols|2002|pp=80\u201382}}\n\n===Nature of Jesus Christ===\n\nIn the ''Summa Theologica'' Thomas begins his discussion of Jesus Christ by recounting the biblical story of [[Adam and Eve]] and by describing the negative effects of [[original sin]]. The purpose of Christ's Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing ''the contamination of sin'', which humans cannot do by themselves. \"Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.\"<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 228\u201329.</ref> Thomas argued in favor of the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of atonement]]; that is, that [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[death of Jesus|died]] \"to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4050.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= III | chapter= Question 50, Article 1 |via= newadvent.org |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Thomas Aquinas'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]], 1650]]\nThomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [[Photinus]], Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [[Nestorius]], who suggested that Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ's existence. However, countering [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]]' views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [[soul]], as well. This produced a duality of natures in Christ. Thomas argued against [[Eutyches]] that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [[Manichaeus]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 231\u201339.</ref>\n\nWith respect to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s assertion that Christ, \"though he was in the form of God{{nbsp}}... emptied himself\" ([[Philippians]] 2:6\u20137) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [[kenosis]] that has informed much subsequent Catholic [[Christology]]. Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], as well as the assertions of Scripture, Thomas held the doctrine of divine immutability.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum01.htm |title=First Council of Nicaea \u2013 325 AD |date=20 May 325| via= papalencyclicals.net}}</ref><ref>Augustine, Sermo VII, 7.</ref><ref>For instance, Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17</ref> Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas, \"the mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.\"<ref>ST III.1.1.</ref> Similarly, Thomas explained that Christ \"emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\">{{Cite web |url= http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm |title=Commentary on Saint Paul's Letter to the Philippians, available at \u00a72\u20132.}}</ref> For Thomas, \"the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there. But human nature and the soul are not full, but capable of fulness, because it was made as a slate not written upon. Therefore, human nature is empty.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\" /> Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ \"emptied himself\" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.\n\nIn short \"Christ had a ''real body'' of the same nature of ours, a ''true rational soul'', and, together with these, ''perfect Deity''\". Thus, there is both unity (in his one ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'') and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 241, 245\u201349. Emphasis is the author's.</ref>\n\n{{quote|I answer that, The Person or hypostasis of Christ may be viewed in two ways.

This goal is achieved through the [[beatific vision]], in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.\n\nThe goal of union with God has implications for the individual's life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual's [[Free Will|will]] must be ordered toward right things, such as charity, peace, and [[Sacred|holiness]]. He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature \"because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision].\" Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|p=383}}\n\n===Treatment of heretics===\nThomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally ''[[Ordo Praedicatorum]]'', the Order of Preachers) who began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [[Albigensians]] and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In the ''Summa theologiae'', he wrote: \n<blockquote>With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.\n\nOn the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but \"after the first and second admonition\", as [[Paul of Tarsus|the Apostle]] directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 |volume= II\u2013II| chapter= Question 11, Article 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeresy was a capital offense against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.\n\nSimple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offenses; Thomas's point seems to be that the gravity of this offense, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas's suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a \"secular tribunal\" rather than [[magisterium|magisterial]] authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics \"deserve{{nbsp}}... death\" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life (\"For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=ASV |title=Romans 6:23, ASV | work= The Bible| via= biblegateway.com |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>). Although the life of a heretic who repents should be spared, the former heretic should be executed if he relapses into heresy. Thomas elaborates on his opinion regarding heresy in the next article, when he says:<blockquote>In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.\n\nFor this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return from heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the good of peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems to prove them to be inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article4 ''Summa'', op. cit., art.4.])</blockquote>\n\nFor [[Jews]], Thomas argues for toleration of both their persons and their religious rites.<ref>Novak, Michael (December 1995), [http://www.firstthings.com/article/1995/12/003-aquinas-and-the-heretics \"Aquinas and the Heretics\"], ''First Things''.</ref>\n\n===Magic and its practitioners===\nRegarding magic, Aquinas wrote that:\n\n* only God can perform miracles, create and transform<ref>''[[Summa contra gentiles]]'' 102</ref>\n* angels and demons (\"spiritual substances\") may do wonderful things, but they are not miracles and merely use natural things as instruments<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 103</ref>\n* any efficacy of magicians does not come from the power of particular words, or celestial bodies, or special figures, or sympathetic magic, but by bidding (ibid.,105), \n* \"demons\" are intellective substances who were created good and have chosen to be bad, it is these who are bid.<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 106\u2013108</ref> \n* if there is some transformation that could not occur in nature it is either the demon working on human imagination or arranging a fake<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= I | chapter= Question 114, Article 4}}</ref>\n\nA mention of witchcraft appears in the ''Summa theologicae''<ref>{{cite book| title= Summa theologica Supplement| chapter= Question 38, Article 2 |quote= Whether a spell can be in impediment to marriage.}} Note this Supplement was written or compiled by others after Aquinas' death.</ref> and concludes that the Church does not treat temporary or permanent impotence attributed to a spell any differently to that of natural causes, as far as an impediment to marriage.\n\nUnder the ''[[canon Episcopi]]'', church doctrine held that witchcraft was not possible and any practitioners of sorcery were deluded and their acts an illusion.

Thomas, following Church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. Substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is rational animal.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=194}} So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter\u2014which allows for the separation of soul from body. Thomas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also comes into existence only in the material body.\n\nHuman beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=200}} Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.\n\nResurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet Thomas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the resurrection. Thomas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Thomas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=192}} For Thomas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not ''only'' spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Thomas's soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.\n\nThomas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, \"If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life.\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=461, 473}} Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Aquinas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Thomas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine. Thomas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Thomas's account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. Thomas conservatively guards Christian doctrine, and thus maintains physical and spiritual reward and punishment after death. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a heaven and hell described in scripture and church dogma.\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]\n\nMany modern ethicists both within and outside the Catholic Church (notably [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas's [[virtue ethics]] as a way of avoiding [[utilitarianism]] or Kantian \"sense of duty\" (called [[deontology]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] (especially in her book ''Intention''), Thomas's [[principle of double effect]] specifically and his theory of intentional activity generally have been influential.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn recent years the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' titled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas\".\n\n[[Henry Adams]]'s ''[[Mont Saint Michel and Chartres]]'' ends with a culminating chapter on Thomas, in which Adams calls Thomas an \"artist\" and constructs an extensive analogy between the design of Thomas's \"Church Intellectual\" and that of the gothic cathedrals of that period. [[Erwin Panofsky]] later would echo these views in ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'' (1951).\n\nThomas's aesthetic theories, especially the concept of ''claritas'', deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [[James Joyce]], who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers. Joyce refers to Thomas's doctrines in ''Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici'' (1898) of Girolamo Maria Mancini, professor of theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpYvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA570#v=onepage&q&f=false The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol V, Year 32, No. 378, June, 1899, p. 570] Accessed 3-7-2013</ref> For example, Mancini's ''Elementa'' is referred to in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame/page/221 221] |title=A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man |last=Joyce |first= James |date=4 December 1992 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |via=Internet Archive|isbn=9781853260063 }}</ref>\n\nThe influence of Thomas's aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas (published in 1956 and republished in 1988 in a revised edition).{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nTwentieth century philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Thomas's philosophy stating that,\n\n<blockquote>He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.<ref>{{harv|Russell|1967|p=463}} ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', Ch. 34, \"St. Thomas Aquinas\", Allen & Unwin, London; Simon & Schuster, New York 1946, pp. 484\u2013.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis criticism is illustrated with the following example: According to Russell, Thomas advocates the indissolubility of marriage \"on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\">{{harv|Russell|1967|p=462}}</ref> Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, \"No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\" /> It may be countered that the treatment of matrimony in the ''Summa Theologica'' is in the Supplements volume, which was not written by Thomas.<ref>{{Cite book |url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica Supplementum Tertiae Partis |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> Moreover, as noted above,<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas#Condemnation of 1277]]</ref> Thomas's introduction of arguments and concepts from the theistic non-Christian [[Aristotle]] and Muslim [[Averroes]] was controversial within the Catholic Church of his day.\n\n===Response to Russell's criticism===\n\n[[Anthony Kenny]] suggests that Russell is failing to reflect on what philosophers, himself included, actually do:\n\n<blockquote>It is extraordinary that that accusation should be made by Russell, who in the book ''Principia Mathematica'' takes hundreds of pages to prove that two and two make four, which is something he had believed all his life.<ref>''Aquinas on Mind'', New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-04415-4}}, 11)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n\nThe first edition of Thomas's [[The Complete Works|opera omnia]], the so-called ''editio Piana'' (from [[Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who commissioned it), was produced in 1570 at the ''studium'' of the Roman convent at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8qt63uOg6IC&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=In This Light Which Gives Light: A History of the College of St. Albert the Great (1930\u20131980) |last=Renz |first=Christopher J. |date=4 September 2009 |publisher=Dominican School |via=Google Books|isbn=9781883734183 }}</ref>\n\nThe critical edition of Thomas's works is the ongoing edition commissioned by [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1882\u20131903), the so-called [[Leonine Edition]].

Part of the reason for this sudden reassignment appears to have arisen from the rise of \"[[Averroism]]\" or \"radical [[Aristotelianism]]\" in the universities. In response to these perceived errors, Thomas wrote two works, one of them being ''De unitate intellectus, contra Averroistas'' (''On the Unity of Intellect, against the Averroists'') in which he reprimands Averroism as incompatible with Christian doctrine.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=10\u201311}} During his second regency, he finished the second part of the ''Summa'' and wrote ''De virtutibus'' and ''De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes'' (''On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers''),{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=5}} the latter of which dealt with controversial Averroist and Aristotelian ''beginninglessness'' of the world.{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nDisputes with some important [[Franciscans]] conspired to make his second regency much more difficult and troubled than the first. A year before Thomas re-assumed the regency at the 1266\u201367 Paris disputations, Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists, most likely counting him as one of the \"blind leaders of the blind\".

Leo XIII also decreed that all Catholic seminaries and universities must teach Thomas's doctrines, and where Thomas did not speak on a topic, the teachers were \"urged to teach conclusions that were reconcilable with his thinking.\" In 1880, Saint Thomas Aquinas was declared patron of all Catholic educational establishments.<ref name=\"britannica-250\" />\n\n===Canonization===\n[[File:Andrea di Bonaiuto.

A non-Christian can display courage, but it would be courage with temperance. A Christian would display courage with charity.

That is, the sphere of [[individual autonomy]] was one which the state could not interfere with.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2008 |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |publisher=[[SAGE Publications|Sage]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location=Thousand Oaks, California |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |last=Smith |first=George S. |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-first=Ronald |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |page=18 |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n11 |isbn=978-1-4129-6580-4 |lccn=2008009151 |oclc=750831024 |quote=Individuals, therefore, have a private 'sphere of action which is distinct from the whole.' |author-link=George H.

Moreover, according to Thomas, [[oligarchy]] degenerates more easily into [[tyranny]] than monarchy. To prevent a king from becoming a tyrant, his political powers must be curbed. Unless an agreement of all persons involved can be reached, a tyrant must be tolerated, as otherwise the political situation could deteriorate into [[anarchy]], which would be even worse than tyranny.\n\nAccording to Thomas, monarchs are God's representatives in their territories, but the Church, represented by the popes, is above the kings in matters of doctrine and morality. As a consequence, worldly rulers are obliged to adapt their laws to the Catholic Church's doctrines and determinations.\n\nFollowing Aristotle's concept of [[slavery]], Thomas justifies this institution on the grounds of [[natural law]].<ref>Heinz-Dietrich Wendland (1962): ''Sklaverei und Christentum''. In: ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Third Edition, T\u00fcbingen (Germany), Vol. VI, col. 103</ref> However, Thomas also distinguished between 'natural slavery', which is for the benefit of both master and slave, and 'servile slavery', which removes all autonomy from the slave and is, according to Thomas, worse than death.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ldysinger.stjohnsem.edu/@texts2/1271_aquinas/08_aq_slavery-ST3.htm |title=Aquinas on Slavery |website= stjohnsem.edu |access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\n===Psychology===\n{{Multiple issues|section=y|\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n{{essay-like|section|date=September 2013}}\n{{Expert needed|Philosophy|section|talk=\"Psychology|reason=statements are not attributed or contextualised|date=September 2013}}\n}}\n\nThomas Aquinas maintains that a human is a single material substance. He understands the soul as the form of the body, which makes a human being the composite of the two. Thus, only living, form-matter composites can truly be called human; dead bodies are \"human\" only analogously. One actually existing substance comes from body and soul. A human is a single material substance, but still should be understood as having an immaterial soul, which continues after bodily death.\n\nIn his ''Summa theologiae'' Thomas clearly states his position on the nature of the soul; defining it as \"the first principle of life\".<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 1}}</ref> The soul is not corporeal, or a body; it is the act of a body. Because the intellect is incorporeal, it does not use the bodily organs, as \"the operation of anything follows the mode of its being.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |year=1920 |edition=Second and Revised |translator-last=The Fathers of the English Dominican Province |chapter=Question 75, Article 3}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Luis mu\u00f1oz-santo tom\u00e1s de aquino.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Thomas Aquinas by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Lafuente]] \nAccording to Thomas the soul is not matter, not even incorporeal or spiritual matter. If it were, it would not be able to understand universals, which are immaterial. A receiver receives things according to the receiver's own nature, so for soul (receiver) to understand (receive) universals, it must have the same nature as universals. Yet, any substance that understands universals may not be a matter-form composite. So, humans have rational souls, which are abstract forms independent of the body. But a human being is one existing, single material substance that comes from body and soul: that is what Thomas means when he writes that \"something one in nature can be formed from an intellectual substance and a body\", and \"a thing one in nature does not result from two permanent entities unless one has the character of substantial form and the other of matter.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Contra Gentiles |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=U. of Notre Dame Press |year=1975 |location=Notre Dame, Ind. |translator-last=Anton C. Pegis |chapter=5 volumes. |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe soul is a \"[[substantial form]]\"; it is a part of a substance, but it is not a substance by itself. Nevertheless, the soul exists separately from the body, and continues, after death, in many of the capacities we think of as human. Substantial form is what makes a thing a member of the species to which it belongs, and substantial form is also the structure or configuration that provides the object with the abilities that make the object what it is. For humans, those abilities are those of the rational animal.\n\nThese distinctions can be better understood in the light of Thomas's understanding of matter and form, a [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic]] (\"matter/form\") theory derived from [[Aristotle]]. In any given substance, matter and form are necessarily united, and each is a necessary aspect of that substance. However, they are conceptually separable. Matter represents what is changeable about the substance\u2014what is potentially something else. For example, bronze matter is potentially a statue, or also potentially a cymbal. Matter must be understood as the matter ''of'' something. In contrast, form is what determines some particular chunk of matter to be a specific substance and no other. When Thomas says that the human body is only partly composed of matter, he means the material body is only potentially a human being. The soul is what actualizes that potential into an existing human being. Consequently, the fact that a human body is live human tissue entails that a human soul is wholly present in each part of the human.\n\n===Economics===\nAquinas addressed most economic questions within the framework of justice, which he contended was the highest of virtues. He says that justice is \"a habit whereby man renders to each his due by a constant and perpetual will.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q58, A1}}</ref> He argued that this concept of justice has its roots in natural law. Joseph Schumpeter, in his ''History of Economic Analysis'', concluded that \"All the economic questions put together matters less to him than did the smallest point of theological or philosophical doctrine, and it is only where economic phenomena raise questions of moral theology that he touches upon them at all.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of Economic Analysis |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1954 |location=New York |pages=90}}</ref>\n\nAquinas was careful to distinguish the [[Just price|just]], or natural, price of a good from that price which manipulates another party. He determines the just price from a number of things. First, the just price must be relative to the worth of the good. Aquinas holds that the price of a good measures its quality: \"the quality of a thing that comes into human use is measured by the price given for it.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A1}}</ref> He goes on to say that the price of a good, measured by its worth, is determined by its usefulness to man. This worth is subjective because each good has a different level of usefulness to every man. Aquinas argues, then, that the price should reflect the current value of a good according to its usefulness to man. He continues: \"Gold and silver are costly not only on account of the usefulness of the vessels and other like things made from them, but also on account of the excellence and purity of their substance.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q77, A2}}</ref>\n\nAquinas also wrote extensively on [[usury]], that is, the lending of money with interest. He condemned its practice: \"to take usury for money lent is unjust in itself, because this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leads to inequality which is contrary to justice.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Summa Theologica |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |publisher=English Dominican Fathers |year=1981 |location=New York |pages=II-II, Q78, A1}}</ref> Money, and other similar goods, are consumed only when they are used. Charging a premium for money lent is a charge for ''more'' than the use of the good. Thus, Aquinas concluded that the lender is charging for something not his own, in other words, not rendering to each his due.\n\n==Theology==\n{{See also|Works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n[[File:Thomas von Aquin 17th century sculpture.jpeg|thumb|17th-century sculpture of Thomas Aquinas]]\n\nThomas Aquinas viewed [[theology]], or the ''[[sacred]] [[doctrine]]'', as a science,<ref name=Stanford/> the raw material data of which consists of written [[Sacred Tradition|scripture]] and the tradition of the Catholic Church. These sources of data were produced by the self-revelation of God to individuals and groups of people throughout history. Faith and reason, while distinct but related, are the two primary tools for processing the data of theology. Thomas believed both were necessary\u2014or, rather, that the ''confluence'' of both was necessary\u2014for one to obtain true knowledge of God. Thomas blended Greek philosophy and Christian doctrine by suggesting that rational thinking and the study of nature, like revelation, were valid ways to understand truths pertaining to God. According to Thomas, God reveals himself through nature, so to study nature is to study God. The ultimate goals of theology, in Thomas's mind, are to use reason to grasp the truth about God and to experience salvation through that truth. The central thought is [[Gratia non tollit naturam, sed perficit]]. [[Divine grace|Grace]] does not destroy nature, but perfects it.\n\n===Revelation===\nThomas believed that truth is known through reason, rationality ([[natural revelation]]) and faith ([[supernatural revelation]]). ''Supernatural'' revelation has its origin in the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and is made available through the teaching of the prophets, summed up in Holy Scripture, and transmitted by the [[Magisterium]], the sum of which is called \"Tradition\". ''Natural'' revelation is the truth available to all people through their human nature and powers of reason. For example, he felt this applied to rational ways to know the existence of God.\n\nThough one may deduce the existence of God and his Attributes (Unity, Truth, Goodness, Power, Knowledge) through reason, certain specifics may be known only through the special revelation of God through [[Jesus Christ]]. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], and charity are revealed in the teachings of the Church and the [[Scripture]]s and may not otherwise be deduced.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion |last=Hankey |first=Wayne |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-78295-1 |edition=Second |location=CSU East Bay |pages=134\u201335}}</ref>\n\n====Preserving nature within grace====\nRevealed knowledge does not negate the truth and the completeness of human science as human, it further establishes them. First, it grants that the same things can be treated from two different perspectives without one canceling the other; thus there can be two sciences of God. Second, it provides the basis for the two sciences: one functions through the power of the light of natural reason, the other through the light of divine revelation. Moreover, they can, at least to some extent, keep out of each other's way because they differ \"according to genus\". Sacred doctrine is a fundamentally different kind of thing from theology, which is part of philosophy (ST I. 1.1 ad 2).\n\nFaith and reason complement rather than contradict each other, each giving different views of the same truth.\n\n===Creation===\n[[File:Tommaso - Super libros de generatione et corruptione - 4733257 00007.tif|thumb|''Super libros de generatione et corruptione'']]\n\nAs a Catholic Thomas believed that God is the \"maker of heaven and earth, of all that is visible and invisible.\" Like Aristotle, Thomas posited that life could form from non-living material or plant life, a theory of ongoing [[abiogenesis]] known as [[spontaneous generation]]:\n\n{{quote|Since the generation of one thing is the corruption of another, it was not incompatible with the first formation of things, that from the corruption of the less perfect the more perfect should be generated.

Thomas reasoned that these species were generated through [[mutation]]s in animal [[sperm]], and argued that they were not unintended by [[nature]]; rather, such species were simply not intended for perpetual existence. That discussion is found in his commentary on ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]]'':\n\n{{quote|The same thing is true of those substances Empedocles said were produced at the beginning of the world, such as the 'ox-progeny', i.e., half ox and half man. For if such things were not able to arrive at some end and final state of nature so that they would be preserved in existence, this was not because nature did not intend this [a final state], but because they were not capable of being preserved. For they were not generated according to nature, but by the corruption of some natural principle, as it now also happens that some monstrous offspring are generated because of the corruption of seed.<ref>Saint Thomas Aquinas, [http://dhspriory.org/thomas/Physics2.htm#14 Physica], ''Book 2, Lecture 14'', Fathers of the English Dominican Province</ref>}}\n\n===Just war===\n{{See also|Just War}}\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] agreed strongly with the conventional wisdom of his time, that Christians should be pacifists philosophically, but that they should use defense as a means of preserving peace in the long run. For example, he routinely argued that pacifism did not prevent the defence of innocents. In essence, the pursuit of peace might require fighting to preserve it in the long-term.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |title=St. Augustine of Hippo |website=Crusades-Encyclopedia |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |archive-date=28 July 2012}}</ref> Such a war must not be preemptive, but defensive, to restore peace.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jknirp.com/mattox.htm |title=Saint Augustine and the Theory of Just War| website= jknirp.com| publisher= | date= | access-date= }}</ref>\n\nClearly, some special characteristics sets apart \"war\" from \"schism\", \"brawling\", and \"sedition\". While it would be contradictory to speak of a \"just schism\", a \"just brawling\" or a \"just sedition\" (the three terms denote sin and sin only) \"war\" alone permits sub classification into good and bad kinds.

Given that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind, the adherents of the School reasoned that it ought to be resorted to only when it was necessary to prevent an even ''greater'' evil. A diplomatic agreement is preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started. <!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --> Examples of \"[[The Just War tradition|just war]]\" are:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success. If failure is a foregone conclusion, then it is just a wasteful spilling of blood.\n* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.\n* War to punish a guilty enemy.\n\nA war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n* The response must be commensurate with the evil; more violence than is strictly necessary would be unjust.\n* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.\n* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.\n* The belligerents must exhaust all options for dialogue and negotiation before undertaking a war; war is legitimate only as a last resort.\n\nUnder this doctrine, expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.\n\n===Nature of God===\nThomas believed that the [[existence of God]] is self-evident in itself, but not to us. \"Therefore I say that this proposition, \"God exists\", of itself is self-evident, for the predicate is the same as the subject{{nbsp}}... Now because we do not know the essence of God, the proposition is not self-evident to us; but needs to be demonstrated by things that are more known to us, though less known in their nature\u2014namely, by effects.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The Existence of God (Prima Pars, Q. 2) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nThomas believed that the existence of God can be demonstrated. Briefly in the ''Summa theologiae'' and more extensively in the ''[[Summa contra Gentiles]]'', he considered in great detail five arguments for the existence of God, widely known as the ''[[quinque viae]]'' (Five Ways).\n\n{{Hatnote|For detailed analysis of the five proofs, see [[Existence of God]]}}\n{{Hatnote|For the original text of the five proofs, see [[Quinque viae]]}}\n\n# Motion: Some things undoubtedly move, though cannot cause their own motion. Since, as Thomas believed, there can be no infinite chain of causes of motion, there must be a [[Unmoved mover|First Mover]] not moved by anything else, and this is what everyone understands by God.\n# \n# Causation: As in the case of motion, nothing can cause itself, and an infinite chain of causation is impossible, so there must be a [[Prima causa|First Cause]], called God.\n# \n# Existence of necessary and the unnecessary: Our experience includes things certainly existing but apparently unnecessary. Not everything can be unnecessary, for then once there was nothing and there would still be nothing. Therefore, we are compelled to suppose something that exists necessarily, having this necessity only from itself; in fact itself the cause for other things to exist.\n# \n# Gradation: If we can notice a gradation in things in the sense that some things are more hot, good, etc., there must be a superlative that is the truest and noblest thing, and so most fully existing. {{H:title|Note that Thomas does not ascribe actual qualities to God Himself.|This then, we call God}}\n# \n# Ordered tendencies of nature: A direction of actions to an end is noticed in all bodies following natural laws. Anything without awareness tends to a goal under the guidance of one who is aware. {{H:title|Note that even when we guide objects, in Thomas's view the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well.|This we call God}}<ref>Summa of Theology I, q.2, The Five Ways Philosophers Have Proven God's Existence</ref>\n\nConcerning the nature of God, Thomas felt the best approach, commonly called the ''[[negative theology|via negativa]]'', is to consider what God is not. This led him to propose five statements about the divine qualities:\n# [[divine simplicity|God is simple]], without composition of parts, such as body and soul, or matter and form.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=74\u201377}}\n# God is perfect, lacking nothing. That is, God is distinguished from other beings on account of God's complete actuality.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|pp=86\u201387}} Thomas defined God as the '''Ipse [http://aquinasactusessendi.blogspot.com Actus Essendi] subsistens'',' subsisting act of being.<ref>See ''[[Actus Essendi]]''.

Natural law is an instance or instantiation of eternal law. Because natural law is what human beings determine according to their own nature (as rational beings), disobeying reason is disobeying natural law and eternal law. Thus eternal law is logically prior to reception of either \"natural law\" (that determined by reason) or \"divine law\" (that found in the Old and New Testaments). In other words, God's will extends to both reason and revelation. Sin is abrogating either one's own reason, on the one hand, or revelation on the other, and is synonymous with \"evil\" ([[privation]] of good, or ''[[privatio boni]]''<ref>{{cite book| chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2075.htm#article1 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= II-I | chapter= Question 75, Article 1| quote= For evil is the absence of the good, which is natural and due to a thing.}}</ref>). Thomas, like all Scholastics, generally argued that the findings of reason and data of revelation cannot conflict, so both are a guide to God's will for human beings.\n\n===Nature of the Trinity===\nThomas argued that God, while perfectly united, also is perfectly described by [[Trinity|Three Interrelated Persons]]. These three persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) are constituted by their relations within the essence of God. Thomas wrote that the term \"Trinity\" \"does not mean the relations themselves of the Persons, but rather the number of persons related to each other; and hence it is that the word in itself does not express regard to another.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1031.htm#article3 | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= | chapter= The unity or plurality in God (Prima Pars, Q. 31) |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> The Father generates the Son (or the Word) by the relation of self-awareness. This eternal generation then produces an eternal Spirit \"who enjoys the divine nature as the Love of God, the Love of the Father for the Word.\"\n\nThis Trinity exists independently from the world. It transcends the created world, but the Trinity also decided to give grace to human beings. This takes place through the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the Word in the person of [[Jesus Christ]] and through the indwelling of the [[Holy Spirit]] within those who have experienced [[salvation]] by God; according to Aidan Nichols.{{sfn|Nichols|2002|pp=173\u201374}}\n\n===''Prima causa'' (first cause)===\nThomas's five proofs for the existence of God take some of Aristotle's assertions concerning principles of being.

The purpose of Christ's Incarnation was to restore human nature by removing ''the contamination of sin'', which humans cannot do by themselves. \"Divine Wisdom judged it fitting that God should become man, so that thus one and the same person would be able both to restore man and to offer satisfaction.\"<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 228\u201329.</ref> Thomas argued in favor of the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view of atonement]]; that is, that [[Christian views of Jesus|Jesus Christ]] [[death of Jesus|died]] \"to satisfy for the whole human race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin.\"<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/4050.htm#article1 |author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= III | chapter= Question 50, Article 1 |via= newadvent.org |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Thomas Aquinas'' by [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]], 1650]]\nThomas argued against several specific contemporary and historical theologians who held differing views about Christ. In response to [[Photinus]], Thomas stated that Jesus was truly divine and not simply a human being. Against [[Nestorius]], who suggested that Son of God was merely conjoined to the man Christ, Thomas argued that the fullness of God was an integral part of Christ's existence. However, countering [[Apollinaris of Laodicea|Apollinaris]]' views, Thomas held that Christ had a truly human (rational) [[soul]], as well. This produced a duality of natures in Christ. Thomas argued against [[Eutyches]] that this duality persisted after the Incarnation. Thomas stated that these two natures existed simultaneously yet distinguishably in one real human body, unlike the teachings of [[Manichaeus]] and [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]].<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 231\u201339.</ref>\n\nWith respect to [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s assertion that Christ, \"though he was in the form of God{{nbsp}}... emptied himself\" ([[Philippians]] 2:6\u20137) in becoming human, Thomas offered an articulation of divine [[kenosis]] that has informed much subsequent Catholic [[Christology]]. Following the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], [[Augustine of Hippo]], as well as the assertions of Scripture, Thomas held the doctrine of divine immutability.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum01.htm |title=First Council of Nicaea \u2013 325 AD |date=20 May 325| via= papalencyclicals.net}}</ref><ref>Augustine, Sermo VII, 7.</ref><ref>For instance, Malachi 3:6 and James 1:17</ref> Hence, in becoming human, there could be no change in the divine person of Christ. For Thomas, \"the mystery of Incarnation was not completed through God being changed in any way from the state in which He had been from eternity, but through His having united Himself to the creature in a new way, or rather through having united it to Himself.\"<ref>ST III.1.1.</ref> Similarly, Thomas explained that Christ \"emptied Himself, not by putting off His divine nature, but by assuming a human nature.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\">{{Cite web |url= http://dhspriory.org/thomas/english/SSPhilippians.htm |title=Commentary on Saint Paul's Letter to the Philippians, available at \u00a72\u20132.}}</ref> For Thomas, \"the divine nature is sufficiently full, because every perfection of goodness is there.

Therefore, human nature is empty.\"<ref name=\"dhspriory.org\" /> Thus, when Paul indicates that Christ \"emptied himself\" this is to be understood in light of his assumption of a human nature.\n\nIn short \"Christ had a ''real body'' of the same nature of ours, a ''true rational soul'', and, together with these, ''perfect Deity''\". Thus, there is both unity (in his one ''[[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]]'') and composition (in his two natures, human and Divine) in Christ.<ref>Thomas Aquinas, pp. 241, 245\u201349.

This goal is achieved through the [[beatific vision]], in which a person experiences perfect, unending happiness by seeing the essence of God. The vision occurs after death as a gift from God to those who in life experienced salvation and redemption through Christ.\n\nThe goal of union with God has implications for the individual's life on earth. Thomas stated that an individual's [[Free Will|will]] must be ordered toward right things, such as charity, peace, and [[Sacred|holiness]]. He saw this orientation as also the way to happiness. Indeed, Thomas ordered his treatment of the moral life around the idea of happiness. The relationship between will and goal is antecedent in nature \"because rectitude of the will consists in being duly ordered to the last end [that is, the beatific vision].\" Those who truly seek to understand and see God will necessarily love what God loves. Such love requires morality and bears fruit in everyday human choices.{{sfn|Kreeft|1990|p=383}}\n\n===Treatment of heretics===\nThomas Aquinas belonged to the Dominican Order (formally ''[[Ordo Praedicatorum]]'', the Order of Preachers) who began as an order dedicated to the conversion of the [[Albigensians]] and other heterodox factions, at first by peaceful means; later the Albigensians were dealt with by means of the [[Albigensian Crusade]]. In the ''Summa theologiae'', he wrote: \n<blockquote>With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith that quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put to death.\n\nOn the part of the Church, however, there is mercy, which looks to the conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but \"after the first and second admonition\", as [[Paul of Tarsus|the Apostle]] directs: after that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death.{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | chapter-url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article3 |volume= II\u2013II| chapter= Question 11, Article 3}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHeresy was a capital offense against the secular law of most European countries of the 13th century. Kings and emperors, even those at war with the papacy, listed heresy first among the crimes against the state. Kings claimed power from God according to the Christian faith. Often enough, especially in that age of papal claims to universal worldly power, the rulers' power was tangibly and visibly legitimated directly through coronation by the pope.\n\nSimple theft, forgery, fraud, and other such crimes were also capital offenses; Thomas's point seems to be that the gravity of this offense, which touches not only the material goods but also the spiritual goods of others, is at least the same as forgery. Thomas's suggestion specifically demands that heretics be handed to a \"secular tribunal\" rather than [[magisterium|magisterial]] authority. That Thomas specifically says that heretics \"deserve{{nbsp}}... death\" is related to his theology, according to which all sinners have no intrinsic right to life (\"For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%206:23&version=ASV |title=Romans 6:23, ASV | work= The Bible| via= biblegateway.com |access-date=2010-01-17}}</ref>). Although the life of a heretic who repents should be spared, the former heretic should be executed if he relapses into heresy. Thomas elaborates on his opinion regarding heresy in the next article, when he says:<blockquote>In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation, but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.\n\nFor this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return from heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the good of peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems to prove them to be inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.([http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3011.htm#article4 ''Summa'', op. cit., art.4.])</blockquote>\n\nFor [[Jews]], Thomas argues for toleration of both their persons and their religious rites.<ref>Novak, Michael (December 1995), [http://www.firstthings.com/article/1995/12/003-aquinas-and-the-heretics \"Aquinas and the Heretics\"], ''First Things''.</ref>\n\n===Magic and its practitioners===\nRegarding magic, Aquinas wrote that:\n\n* only God can perform miracles, create and transform<ref>''[[Summa contra gentiles]]'' 102</ref>\n* angels and demons (\"spiritual substances\") may do wonderful things, but they are not miracles and merely use natural things as instruments<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 103</ref>\n* any efficacy of magicians does not come from the power of particular words, or celestial bodies, or special figures, or sympathetic magic, but by bidding (ibid.,105), \n* \"demons\" are intellective substances who were created good and have chosen to be bad, it is these who are bid.<ref>''Summa contra gentiles'' 106\u2013108</ref> \n* if there is some transformation that could not occur in nature it is either the demon working on human imagination or arranging a fake<ref>{{cite book| author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica | volume= I | chapter= Question 114, Article 4}}</ref>\n\nA mention of witchcraft appears in the ''Summa theologicae''<ref>{{cite book| title= Summa theologica Supplement| chapter= Question 38, Article 2 |quote= Whether a spell can be in impediment to marriage.}} Note this Supplement was written or compiled by others after Aquinas' death.</ref> and concludes that the Church does not treat temporary or permanent impotence attributed to a spell any differently to that of natural causes, as far as an impediment to marriage.\n\nUnder the ''[[canon Episcopi]]'', church doctrine held that witchcraft was not possible and any practitioners of sorcery were deluded and their acts an illusion.

Thomas, following Church doctrine, accepts that the soul continues to exist after the death of the body. Because he accepts that the soul is the form of the body, then he also must believe that the human being, like all material things, is form-matter composite. Substantial form (the human soul) configures prime matter (the physical body) and is the form by which a material composite belongs to that species it does; in the case of human beings, that species is rational animal.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=194}} So, a human being is a matter-form composite that is organized to be a rational animal. Matter cannot exist without being configured by form, but form can exist without matter\u2014which allows for the separation of soul from body. Thomas says that the soul shares in the material and spiritual worlds, and so has some features of matter and other, immaterial, features (such as access to universals). The human soul is different from other material and spiritual things; it is created by God, but also comes into existence only in the material body.\n\nHuman beings are material, but the human person can survive the death of the body through continued existence of the soul, which persists. The human soul straddles the spiritual and material worlds, and is both a configured subsistent form as well as a configurer of matter into that of a living, bodily human.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=200}} Because it is spiritual, the human soul does not depend on matter and may exist separately. Because the human being is a soul-matter composite, the body has a part in what it is to be human. Perfected human nature consists in the human dual nature, embodied and intellecting.\n\nResurrection appears to require dualism, which Thomas rejects. Yet Thomas believes the soul persists after the death and corruption of the body, and is capable of existence, separated from the body between the time of death and the resurrection. Thomas believes in a different sort of dualism, one guided by Christian scripture. Thomas knows that human beings are essentially physical, but physicality has a spirit capable of returning to God after life.{{sfn|Stump|2003|p=192}} For Thomas, the rewards and punishment of the afterlife are not ''only'' spiritual. Because of this, resurrection is an important part of his philosophy on the soul. The human is fulfilled and complete in the body, so the hereafter must take place with souls enmattered in resurrected bodies. In addition to spiritual reward, humans can expect to enjoy material and physical blessings. Because Thomas's soul requires a body for its actions, during the afterlife, the soul will also be punished or rewarded in corporeal existence.\n\nThomas states clearly his stance on resurrection, and uses it to back up his philosophy of justice; that is, the promise of resurrection compensates Christians who suffered in this world through a heavenly union with the divine. He says, \"If there is no resurrection of the dead, it follows that there is no good for human beings other than in this life.\"{{sfn|Stump|2003|pp=461, 473}} Resurrection provides the impetus for people on earth to give up pleasures in this life. Aquinas believes the human who prepared for the afterlife both morally and intellectually will be rewarded more greatly; however, all reward is through the grace of God. Thomas insists beatitude will be conferred according to merit, and will render the person better able to conceive the divine. Thomas accordingly believes punishment is directly related to earthly, living preparation and activity as well. Thomas's account of the soul focuses on epistemology and metaphysics, and because of this he believes it gives a clear account of the immaterial nature of the soul. Thomas conservatively guards Christian doctrine, and thus maintains physical and spiritual reward and punishment after death. By accepting the essentiality of both body and soul, he allows for a heaven and hell described in scripture and church dogma.\n\n==Modern influence==\n[[File:Saint Joseph's Catholic Church (Central City, Kentucky) - stained glass, St. Thomas Aquinas, detail.jpg|thumb|upright|A stained glass window of Thomas Aquinas in St. Joseph's Catholic Church ([[Central City, Kentucky]])]]\n\nMany modern ethicists both within and outside the Catholic Church (notably [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]) have recently commented on the possible use of Thomas's [[virtue ethics]] as a way of avoiding [[utilitarianism]] or Kantian \"sense of duty\" (called [[deontology]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Through the work of twentieth-century philosophers such as [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Elizabeth Anscombe]] (especially in her book ''Intention''), Thomas's [[principle of double effect]] specifically and his theory of intentional activity generally have been influential.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn recent years the cognitive neuroscientist [[Walter J. Freeman (neuroscientist)|Walter Freeman]] proposes that Thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with [[neurodynamics]], in a 2008 article in the journal ''Mind and Matter'' titled \"Nonlinear Brain Dynamics and Intention According to Aquinas\".\n\n[[Henry Adams]]'s ''[[Mont Saint Michel and Chartres]]'' ends with a culminating chapter on Thomas, in which Adams calls Thomas an \"artist\" and constructs an extensive analogy between the design of Thomas's \"Church Intellectual\" and that of the gothic cathedrals of that period. [[Erwin Panofsky]] later would echo these views in ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism'' (1951).\n\nThomas's aesthetic theories, especially the concept of ''claritas'', deeply influenced the literary practice of modernist writer [[James Joyce]], who used to extol Thomas as being second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers. Joyce refers to Thomas's doctrines in ''Elementa philosophiae ad mentem D. Thomae Aquinatis doctoris angelici'' (1898) of Girolamo Maria Mancini, professor of theology at the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fpYvAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA570#v=onepage&q&f=false The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol V, Year 32, No. 378, June, 1899, p. 570] Accessed 3-7-2013</ref> For example, Mancini's ''Elementa'' is referred to in Joyce's ''[[Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/portraitofartist00jame/page/221 221] |title=A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man |last=Joyce |first= James |date=4 December 1992 |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |via=Internet Archive|isbn=9781853260063 }}</ref>\n\nThe influence of Thomas's aesthetics also can be found in the works of the Italian [[semiotics|semiotician]] [[Umberto Eco]], who wrote an essay on aesthetic ideas in Thomas (published in 1956 and republished in 1988 in a revised edition).{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Criticisms==\nTwentieth century philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Thomas's philosophy stating that,\n\n<blockquote>He does not, like the Platonic Socrates, set out to follow wherever the argument may lead. He is not engaged in an inquiry, the result of which it is impossible to know in advance. Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith. If he can find apparently rational arguments for some parts of the faith, so much the better; if he cannot, he need only fall back on revelation. The finding of arguments for a conclusion given in advance is not philosophy, but special pleading. I cannot, therefore, feel that he deserves to be put on a level with the best philosophers either of Greece or of modern times.<ref>{{harv|Russell|1967|p=463}} ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'', Ch. 34, \"St. Thomas Aquinas\", Allen & Unwin, London; Simon & Schuster, New York 1946, pp. 484\u2013.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis criticism is illustrated with the following example: According to Russell, Thomas advocates the indissolubility of marriage \"on the ground that the father is useful in the education of the children, (a) because he is more rational than the mother, (b) because, being stronger, he is better able to inflict physical punishment.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\">{{harv|Russell|1967|p=462}}</ref> Even though modern approaches to education do not support these views, \"No follower of Saint Thomas would, on that account, cease to believe in lifelong monogamy, because the real grounds of belief are not those which are alleged.\"<ref name=\"Russell 1967 462\" /> It may be countered that the treatment of matrimony in the ''Summa Theologica'' is in the Supplements volume, which was not written by Thomas.<ref>{{Cite book |url= http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5.htm | author= Thomas Aquinas| title= Summa Theologica Supplementum Tertiae Partis |via= newadvent.org}}</ref> Moreover, as noted above,<ref>[[Thomas Aquinas#Condemnation of 1277]]</ref> Thomas's introduction of arguments and concepts from the theistic non-Christian [[Aristotle]] and Muslim [[Averroes]] was controversial within the Catholic Church of his day.\n\n===Response to Russell's criticism===\n\n[[Anthony Kenny]] suggests that Russell is failing to reflect on what philosophers, himself included, actually do:\n\n<blockquote>It is extraordinary that that accusation should be made by Russell, who in the book ''Principia Mathematica'' takes hundreds of pages to prove that two and two make four, which is something he had believed all his life.<ref>''Aquinas on Mind'', New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-04415-4}}, 11)</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Works==\n{{main|List of works by Thomas Aquinas}}\n\nThe first edition of Thomas's [[The Complete Works|opera omnia]], the so-called ''editio Piana'' (from [[Pius V]], the Dominican Pope who commissioned it), was produced in 1570 at the ''studium'' of the Roman convent at [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8qt63uOg6IC&pg=PA42#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=In This Light Which Gives Light: A History of the College of St. Albert the Great (1930\u20131980) |last=Renz |first=Christopher J. |date=4 September 2009 |publisher=Dominican School |via=Google Books|isbn=9781883734183 }}</ref>\n\nThe critical edition of Thomas's works is the ongoing edition commissioned by [[Pope Leo XIII]] (1882\u20131903), the so-called [[Leonine Edition]].
