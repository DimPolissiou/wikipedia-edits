Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities.

As result the Greek communist publisher \"Nea Ellada\" issued a Macedonian grammar (1952) and developed a different alphabet.  Between 1952 and 1956, the Macedonian Department of Nea Hellas published a number of issues in this literary standard, officially called \" Macedonian language of the Slav Macedonians from Greek or Aegean Macedonia\".

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities.

As result the Greek communist publisher \"Nea Ellada\" issued a Macedonian grammar (1952) and developed a different alphabet.  Between 1952 and 1956, the Macedonian Department of Nea Hellas published a number of issues in this literary standard, officially called \" Macedonian language of the Slav Macedonians from Greek or Aegean Macedonia\".

It came into being on 31 May 1910 with the unification of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], the [[Colony of Natal|Natal Colony]], the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], and the [[Orange River Colony]]. It included the territories that were formerly a part of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]].\n\nFollowing the [[First World War]], the Union of South Africa was a signatory of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and became one of the [[Member states of the League of Nations|founding members]] of the [[League of Nations]]. It was conferred the administration of [[South West Africa]] (now known as [[Namibia]]) as a [[League of Nations mandate]]. It became treated in most respects as another province of the Union, but it never was formally annexed.\n\nLike [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], the Union of South Africa was a [[Associated state|self-governing]] [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. Its full sovereignty was confirmed with the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]] and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. It was governed under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], with the Crown being represented by a governor-general. The Union came to an end with the enactment of the [[Constitution of South Africa, 1961|constitution of 1961]], by which it became a [[republic]] and left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\n==Constitution==\n[[File:Red Ensign of South Africa (1912-1928).svg|thumb|right|250px|[[South Africa Red Ensign|Union of South Africa red ensign]] (1912\u20131928) and merchant ensign until 1951]]\n[[File:Blue Ensign of South Africa (1910\u20131912).svg|thumb|right|250px|Union of South Africa blue ensign (1910\u20131928)]]\n{{Main|South Africa Act 1909}}\n\n===Main features===\n[[File:Map of the provinces of South Africa 1910-1976 with English labels.svg|thumb|The provinces of the Union]]\n\nThe Union of South Africa was a [[unitary state]], rather than a [[federation]] like Canada and Australia, with each colony's parliaments being abolished and replaced with [[provincial council (South Africa)|provincial council]]s.<ref>South Africa Act, 1909, Part V, sections 68 to 94.</ref> A [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] was created, consisting of the [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] and [[Senate (South Africa)|Senate]], with members of the parliament being elected mostly by the country's white minority.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> During the course of the Union, the franchise changed on several occasions always to suit the needs of the government of the day.<ref>See Representation of Natives Act, No. 12 of 1936 and Separate Representation of Voters Act, No. 46 of 1951.</ref> Parliamentary supremacy was a convention of the constitution, inherited from the United Kingdom; save for procedural safeguards in respect of the entrenched sections of franchise and language, the courts were unable to intervene in Parliament's decisions.<ref>Hahlo & Kahn, Union of South Africa, Stevens & Sons Limited, London, 1960, pp. 146 to 163.</ref>\n\n===Capitals===\n\nOwing to disagreements over where the Union's [[capital (city)|capital]] should be, a compromise was reached in which every province would be dealt a share of the benefits of the capital:  the administration would be seated in [[Pretoria]]<ref>Section 18 of South Africa Act, 1909.</ref> (Transvaal), [[Parliament (South Africa)|Parliament]] would be in [[Cape Town]]<ref>Section 23 of South Africa Act, 1909.</ref> (Cape Province), the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] would be in [[Bloemfontein]]<ref>Section 109 of South Africa Act, 1909.</ref> (Orange Free State).

With the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster (1931)|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the Union and other dominions became equal in status to the United Kingdom, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom could no longer legislate on behalf of them.<ref>Hahlo & Kahn, supra, p. 146 et seq.</ref> This had the effect of making the Union and the other dominions ''de jure'' sovereign nations. The [[Status of the Union Act, 1934|Status of the Union Act]], passed by the South African Parliament in 1934, incorporated the applicable portions of the Statute of Westminster into South African law, underscoring its status as a sovereign nation. It removed what remaining authority Whitehall had to legislate for South Africa, as well as any nominal role that the Crown had in granting [[Royal Assent]]. The Governor-General was now required to sign or veto bills passed by Parliament, without the option of seeking advice from London. \n\nThe Monarch was represented in South Africa by a [[Governor-General (South Africa)|Governor-General]], while effective power was exercised by the Executive Council, headed by the [[Prime Minister (South Africa)|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> [[Louis Botha]], formerly a [[Boer]] general, was appointed first Prime Minister of the Union, heading a coalition representing the white [[Afrikaner]] and English-speaking [[British diaspora in Africa|British diaspora]] communities.\nProsecutions before courts were instituted in the name of the Crown (cited in the format ''Rex v Accused'') and government officials served in the name of the Crown.\n\n{{SouthAfrica state}}\n\n===Languages===\n\nAn [[entrenched clause]] in the Constitution mentioned [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]] and English as [[official language]]s of the Union, but the meaning of Dutch was changed by the [[Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925]] to include both Dutch and Afrikaans.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n===Final days of the South Africa Act and legacy===\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n\nMost English-speaking whites in South Africa supported the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] of [[Jan Smuts]], which favoured close relations with the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], unlike the Afrikaans-speaking [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which had held anti-British sentiments and was opposed to South Africa's intervention in the [[Second World War]].  Some Nationalist organisations, like the ''[[Ossewa Brandwag]]'', were openly supportive of [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\nMost English-speaking South Africans were opposed to the creation of a [[republic]], many of them voting \"no\" in the 5 October 1960 [[South African republic referendum, 1960|referendum]]. But due to the much larger number of Afrikaans-speaking voters, the referendum passed, leading to the establishment of a republic in 1961. The Afrikaner-dominated Government consequently withdrew South Africa from the Commonwealth. Following the results of the referendum, some whites in Natal, which had an English-speaking majority, called for secession from the Union.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WUVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2W8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5504,1422353&dq=natal+referendum+republic&hl=en Secession Talked by Some Anti-Republicans], ''[[Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]]'', 11 October 1960</ref> Five years earlier, some 33,000 Natalians had signed the [[Natal covenant|Natal Covenant]] in opposition to the plans for a republic.<ref name=Jeffery>{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Keith|title=An Irish Empire?: Aspects of Ireland and the British Empire|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=199\u2013201|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUTpAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA200#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the National Party government had passed a [[Constitution]] that repealed the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]]. The features of the Union were carried over with very little change to the newly formed Republic. The decision to transform from a Union to Republic was narrowly decided in the referendum. The decision together with the South African Government's insistence on adhering to its policy of [[apartheid]] resulted in South Africa's ''de facto'' expulsion from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n===Segregation===\n[[File:The Union of South Africa, Its Land and Its People (1956).webm|thumb|''Encyclopedia Britannica Films'' documentary about South Africa from 1956]]\nThe [[South Africa Act]] dealt with race in two specific provisions. First it entrenched the liberal (by South African standards) [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] system of the [[Cape Colony]] which operated free of any racial considerations (although due to socio-economic restrictions no real political expression of non-whites was possible).<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Janet|title=Liberalism in South Africa: 1948\u20131963|year=1971|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/soubg2.htm |title=EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements |publisher=Eisa.org.za |accessdate=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080718/http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/soubg2.htm |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Cape [[Prime Minister]] at the time, [[John X. Merriman]], fought hard, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to extend this system of multi-racial franchise to the rest of [[South Africa]].\n\nSecond it made \"native affairs\" a matter for the national government. The practice therefore was to establish a Minister of Native Affairs.\n\nAccording to Stephen Howe, colonialism in some cases\u2014most obviously among white minorities in South Africa\u2014meant mainly that these violent settlers wanted to maintain more racial inequalities than the colonial empire found just.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire A very Short Introduction|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=75}}</ref>\n\n==Previous attempts at unification==\n\nSeveral previous unsuccessful attempts to unite the colonies were made, with proposed political models ranging from [[unitary (state)|unitary]], to loosely [[confederation|federal]].\n\n===Early unification attempt under Sir George Grey (1850s)===\n\nSir [[George Grey]], the [[Governor of Cape Colony]] from 1854 to 1861, decided that unifying the states of southern Africa would be mutually beneficial. The stated reasons were that he believed that political divisions between the white-controlled states \"weakened them against the natives\", threatened an ethnic divide between British and Boer, and left the Cape vulnerable to interference from other European powers. He believed that a united \"South African Federation\", under British control, would resolve all three of these concerns.<ref>V.C. Malherbe: ''What They Said. 1795\u20131910 History Documents''. Cape Town: Maskew Miller. 1971.</ref>\n\nHis idea was greeted with cautious optimism in southern Africa; the [[Orange Free State]] agreed to the idea in principle and the [[Transvaal (colony)|Transvaal]] may also eventually have agreed. However, he was overruled by the [[British Colonial Office]] which ordered him to desist from his plans. His refusal to abandon the idea eventually led to him being recalled.\n\n===The imposition of confederation (1870s)===\nIn the 1870s, the London Colonial Office, under [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Secretary for the Colonies]] [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], decided to apply a system of [[Confederation]] onto southern Africa. On this occasion however, it was largely rejected by southern Africans, primarily due to its very bad timing. The various component states of [[southern Africa]] were still simmering after the last bout of British expansion, and inter-state tensions were high. The [[Orange Free State]] this time refused to even discuss the idea, and Prime Minister [[John Molteno]] of the [[Cape Colony]] called the idea badly informed and irresponsible. In addition, many local leaders resented the way it was imposed from outside without understanding of local issues.<ref>P.A. Molteno: ''A Federal South Africa''. Sampson Low, Marston & Co, 1896. {{ISBN|1-4367-2682-4}}</ref> The [[Confederation]] model was also correctly seen as unsuitable for the disparate entities of [[southern Africa]], with their wildly different sizes, economies and political systems.<ref>Phyllis Lewsen (ed.). ''Selections from the correspondence of John X. Merriman, 1905\u20131924''. South Africa: [[Van Riebeeck Society]], 1969</ref>\n\nThe Molteno Unification Plan (1877), put forward by the Cape government as a more feasible [[unitary (state)|unitary]] alternative to [[confederation]], largely anticipated the final act of Union in 1909. A crucial difference was that the Cape's liberal constitution and multiracial franchise were to be extended to the other states of the union. These smaller states would gradually accede to the much larger [[Cape Colony]] through a system of treaties, whilst simultaneously gaining elected seats in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape parliament]]. The entire process would be locally driven, with Britain's role restricted to policing any set-backs. While subsequently acknowledged to be more viable, this model was rejected at the time by London.<ref>Frank Richardson Cana: ''South Africa: From the Great Trek to the Union''. London: Chapman & Hall, ltd., 1909. Chapter VII \"Molteno's Unification Plan\". p.89</ref> At the other extreme, another powerful Cape politician at the time, [[Saul Solomon]], proposed an extremely loose system of federation, with the component states preserving their very different constitutions and systems of franchise.<ref>Solomon, W. E. C: ''Saul Solomon \u2013 the Member for Cape Town''. Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 1948.</ref>\n\nLord Carnarvon rejected the (more informed) local plans for unification, as he wished to have the process brought to a conclusion before the end of his tenure and, having little experience of southern Africa, he preferred to enforce the more familiar model of confederation used in Canada. He pushed ahead with his Confederation plan, which unravelled as predicted, leaving a string of destructive wars across southern Africa. These conflicts eventually fed into the first and second [[Anglo-Boer War]]s, with far-reaching consequences for the subcontinent.<ref>''Illustrated History of South Africa''.

The newly arrived miners, though needed for the mines, were distrusted by the politically-dominant Afrikaners, who called them \"[[uitlander]]s\", imposed heavy taxes on them and granted them very limited civil rights, with no right to vote. The United Kingdom, wanting the gold and diamond mines and highly protective of its own citizens, demanded reforms, which the Afrikaners rejected. A small-scale private British effort to overthrow Transvaal's President [[Paul Kruger]], the [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895, proved a fiasco, and presaged full-scale conflict as diplomatic efforts all failed.<ref>J.A.S.Grenville, ''Lord Salisbury, and Foreign Policy'' (1964) pp 235\u201364.</ref><ref>Iain R.

The United Kingdom gained the support of its Cape Colony, of its Colony of Natal and of some African allies. Volunteers from across the British Empire further supplemented the British war-effort. All other nations remained neutral, but public opinion in them was largely hostile to Britain. Inside Britain and its Empire there was also significant [[opposition to the Second Boer War]] because of the atrocities and military failures.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Judd\n | first1 = Denis\n | last2 = Surridge\n | first2 = Keith\n | orig-year = 2002\n | chapter = \n | title = The Boer War: A History\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wmGJDwAAQBAJ\n | edition = revised\n | location = London\n | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n | publication-date = 2013\n | page = 1-54\n | isbn = 9780857722317\n | access-date = 2019-12-19\n | quote = \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe British were overconfident and under-prepared. Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury | Salisbury]] and his top officials, especially [[Secretary of State for the Colonies | Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]], ignored the repeated warnings of military advisors that the Boers were well prepared, well armed, and fighting for their homes in a very difficult terrain. The Boers struck first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberly, and Mafeking in early 1900, and winning important battles at [[Battle of Colenso | Colenso]] (15 December 1899), Magersfontein and [[Battle of Stormberg | Stormberg]] (10 December 1899). Staggered, the British fought back, relieved the besieged cities, and prepared to invade first the Orange Free State, and then Transvaal in late 1900. The Boers refused to surrender or negotiate, and reverted to [[guerrilla warfare]]. After two years of hard fighting, Britain, using over 400,000 soldiers, systematically destroyed Boer resistance, raising worldwide complaints about brutality. The Boers fought for their homes and families, which provided them with food and hiding places. The British responded by forcefully relocating all the Boer civilians into heavily-guarded [[British concentration camps | concentration camps]], where about 28,000 died of disease, while British military forces systematically blocked off and tracked down the highly mobile Boer combat units. The battles were small operations; most of the dead succumbed to disease. The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both Boer republics, which became the [[Transvaal Colony]] and the [[Orange River Colony]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Judd\n | first1 = Denis\n | last2 = Surridge\n | first2 = Keith\n | orig-year = 2002\n | chapter = \n | title = The Boer War: A History\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wmGJDwAAQBAJ\n | edition = revised\n | location = London\n | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n | publication-date = 2013\n | page = 55-302\n | isbn = 9780857722317\n | access-date = 2019-12-19\n | quote = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Botha gouvernment 1910.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The first Union cabinet]]\n\n== History of the Union of South Africa ==\n{{main |History of South Africa (1910\u201348)}}\n\n==Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia==\n\nIn 1922 the colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] had a chance (ultimately rejected) to join the Union through a [[Southern Rhodesia government referendum, 1922|referendum]]. The referendum resulted from the fact that by 1920 [[British South Africa Company]] rule in Southern Rhodesia was no longer practical with many favouring some form of '[[responsible government]]'. Some favoured responsible government within Southern Rhodesia while others (especially in [[Matabeleland]]) favoured membership in the Union of South Africa. Politician [[Charles Coghlan (politician)|Sir Charles Coghlan]] claimed that such membership with the Union would make Southern Rhodesia the \"[[Ulster]] of South Africa\".<ref>{{cite book | first =Keith | last =Jeffrey  | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUTpAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA214&ots=TMAQPZUoCA&dq=%22Ulster%20of%20South%20Africa%22&pg=PA196#v=onepage&q=%22Ulster%20of%20South%20Africa%22&f=true | title =An Irish Empire?: Aspects of Ireland and the British Empire| publisher = Manchester University Press |location= | volume =   | year = 1996 | isbn =\t0719038731  | page =196 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the referendum, representatives of Southern Rhodesia visited Cape Town where the Prime Minister of South Africa, [[Jan Smuts]], eventually offered terms he considered reasonable and which the United Kingdom government found acceptable. Although opinion among the United Kingdom government, the South African government and the British South Africa Company favoured the union option (and none tried to interfere in the referendum), when the referendum was held the results saw 59.4% in favour of responsible government for a separate colony and 40.6% in favour of joining the Union of South Africa.\n\n==Union of South Africa and South West Africa==\n\n===Background===\n\n{{main|Palgrave Commission}}\n\nThe inhospitable coast of what is now the [[Republic of Namibia]] remained uncolonised up until the end of the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1874, the leaders of several indigenous peoples, notably [[Maharero]] of the [[Herero people|Herero]] nation, approached the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] to the south. Anticipating invasion by a European power and already suffering [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese encroachment]] from the north and [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner encroachment]] from the south, these leaders approached the [[Cape Colony]] government to discuss the possibility of accession and the political representation it would entail. Accession to the Cape Colony, a self-governing state with a [[Cape Qualified Franchise|system of multi-racial franchise]] and legal protection for traditional land rights, was at the time considered marginally preferable to annexation by [[Portugal]] or [[Germany]].\n\nIn response, the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] appointed a special Commission under [[Palgrave Commission|William Palgrave]], to travel to the territory between the [[Orange (river)|Orange]] and [[Cunene river]]s and to confer with these leaders regarding accession to the Cape. In the negotiations with the [[Palgrave Commission]], some indigenous nations such as the [[Damara (people)|Damara]] and the Herero responded positively (October 1876), other reactions were mixed. Discussions regarding the magisterial structure for the area's political integration into the Cape dragged on until, from 1876, it was blocked by Britain. Britain relented, insofar as allowing the Cape to incorporate [[Walvis Bay]], which was brought under the magisterial district of [[Cape Town]], but when the Germans established a protectorate over the area in 1884, South West Africa was predominantly autonomous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ukzn.ac.za/files/theses/david%20mccarney.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209150334/http://www.history.ukzn.ac.za/files/theses/david%20mccarney.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>P.

With the establishment of the [[League of Nations]] and cessation of the war, South Africa obtained a [[Class C mandate|Class C Mandate]] to administer South West Africa \"under the laws of the mandatory (South Africa) as integral portions of its territory\". Subsequently, the Union of South Africa generally regarded South West Africa as a fifth province, although this was never an official status.\n\nWith the creation of the [[United Nations]], the Union applied for the incorporation of South West Africa, but its application was rejected by the U.N., which invited South Africa to prepare a [[Trusteeship (United Nations)|Trusteeship]] agreement instead. This invitation was in turn rejected by the Union, which subsequently did not modify the administration of South West Africa and continued to adhere to the original mandate. This caused a complex set of legal wranglings that were not finalised when the Union was replaced with the Republic of South Africa. In 1949, the Union passed a law bringing South West Africa into closer association with it including giving South West Africa representation in the South African parliament.\n\n[[Walvis Bay]], which is now in [[Namibia]], was originally a part of the Union of South Africa as it was a part of the Cape Colony at the time of Unification. In 1921 Walvis Bay was integrated with the Class C Mandate over South West Africa for the rest of the Union's duration and for part of the republican era.\n\n==Statute of Westminster==\n\nThe [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] passed by the [[British Parliament]] in December 1931, which repealed the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act]] and implemented the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]], had a profound impact on the constitutional structure and status of the Union. The most notable effect was that the South African Parliament was released from many restrictions concerning the handling of the so-called \"native question\". However the repeal was not sufficient to enable the South African Parliament to ignore the entrenched clauses of its constitution (the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]]) which led to the [[coloured-vote constitutional crisis]] of the 1950s wherein the right of coloureds to vote in the main South African Parliament was removed and replaced with a separate, segregated, and largely powerless assembly.\n\n==Military==\n{{main|Union Defence Force (South Africa)}}\n\nThe military of the Union of South Africa was the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Force]] until 1957, when it became the [[South African Defence Force]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Monarchy|South Africa}}\n*[[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{wikiatlas|Union of South Africa}}\n* Beck, Roger B.

It came into being on 31 May 1910 with the unification of the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], the [[Colony of Natal|Natal Colony]], the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]], and the [[Orange River Colony]]. It included the territories that were formerly a part of the [[South African Republic]] and the [[Orange Free State]].\n\nFollowing the [[First World War]], the Union of South Africa was a signatory of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and became one of the [[Member states of the League of Nations|founding members]] of the [[League of Nations]]. It was conferred the administration of [[South West Africa]] (now known as [[Namibia]]) as a [[League of Nations mandate]]. It became treated in most respects as another province of the Union, but it never was formally annexed.\n\nLike [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], the Union of South Africa was a [[Associated state|self-governing]] [[dominion]] of the [[British Empire]]. Its full sovereignty was confirmed with the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]] and the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]]. It was governed under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], with the Crown being represented by a governor-general. The Union came to an end with the enactment of the [[Constitution of South Africa, 1961|constitution of 1961]], by which it became a [[republic]] and left the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].\n\n==Constitution==\n[[File:Red Ensign of South Africa (1912-1928).svg|thumb|right|250px|[[South Africa Red Ensign|Union of South Africa red ensign]] (1912\u20131928) and merchant ensign until 1951]]\n[[File:Blue Ensign of South Africa (1910\u20131912).svg|thumb|right|250px|Union of South Africa blue ensign (1910\u20131928)]]\n{{Main|South Africa Act 1909}}\n\n===Main features===\n[[File:Map of the provinces of South Africa 1910-1976 with English labels.svg|thumb|The provinces of the Union]]\n\nThe Union of South Africa was a [[unitary state]], rather than a [[federation]] like Canada and Australia, with each colony's parliaments being abolished and replaced with [[provincial council (South Africa)|provincial council]]s.<ref>South Africa Act, 1909, Part V, sections 68 to 94.</ref> A [[bicameral]] [[parliament]] was created, consisting of the [[House of Assembly (South Africa)|House of Assembly]] and [[Senate (South Africa)|Senate]], with members of the parliament being elected mostly by the country's white minority.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> During the course of the Union, the franchise changed on several occasions always to suit the needs of the government of the day.<ref>See Representation of Natives Act, No. 12 of 1936 and Separate Representation of Voters Act, No. 46 of 1951.</ref> Parliamentary supremacy was a convention of the constitution, inherited from the United Kingdom; save for procedural safeguards in respect of the entrenched sections of franchise and language, the courts were unable to intervene in Parliament's decisions.<ref>Hahlo & Kahn, Union of South Africa, Stevens & Sons Limited, London, 1960, pp. 146 to 163.</ref>\n\n===Capitals===\n\nOwing to disagreements over where the Union's [[capital (city)|capital]] should be, a compromise was reached in which every province would be dealt a share of the benefits of the capital:  the administration would be seated in [[Pretoria]]<ref>Section 18 of South Africa Act, 1909.</ref> (Transvaal), [[Parliament (South Africa)|Parliament]] would be in [[Cape Town]]<ref>Section 23 of South Africa Act, 1909.</ref> (Cape Province), the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]] would be in [[Bloemfontein]]<ref>Section 109 of South Africa Act, 1909.</ref> (Orange Free State).

With the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster (1931)|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, the Union and other dominions became equal in status to the United Kingdom, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom could no longer legislate on behalf of them.<ref>Hahlo & Kahn, supra, p. 146 et seq.</ref> This had the effect of making the Union and the other dominions ''de jure'' sovereign nations. The [[Status of the Union Act, 1934|Status of the Union Act]], passed by the South African Parliament in 1934, incorporated the applicable portions of the Statute of Westminster into South African law, underscoring its status as a sovereign nation. It removed what remaining authority Whitehall had to legislate for South Africa, as well as any nominal role that the Crown had in granting [[Royal Assent]]. The Governor-General was now required to sign or veto bills passed by Parliament, without the option of seeking advice from London. \n\nThe Monarch was represented in South Africa by a [[Governor-General (South Africa)|Governor-General]], while effective power was exercised by the Executive Council, headed by the [[Prime Minister (South Africa)|Prime Minister]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> [[Louis Botha]], formerly a [[Boer]] general, was appointed first Prime Minister of the Union, heading a coalition representing the white [[Afrikaner]] and English-speaking [[British diaspora in Africa|British diaspora]] communities.\nProsecutions before courts were instituted in the name of the Crown (cited in the format ''Rex v Accused'') and government officials served in the name of the Crown.\n\n{{SouthAfrica state}}\n\n===Languages===\n\nAn [[entrenched clause]] in the Constitution mentioned [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]] and English as [[official language]]s of the Union, but the meaning of Dutch was changed by the [[Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925]] to include both Dutch and Afrikaans.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/details/jstor-2212266|title=The South Africa Act, 1909|date=1 January 1910|journal=The American Journal of International Law|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>\n\n===Final days of the South Africa Act and legacy===\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n\nMost English-speaking whites in South Africa supported the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]] of [[Jan Smuts]], which favoured close relations with the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], unlike the Afrikaans-speaking [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which had held anti-British sentiments and was opposed to South Africa's intervention in the [[Second World War]].  Some Nationalist organisations, like the ''[[Ossewa Brandwag]]'', were openly supportive of [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].\n\nMost English-speaking South Africans were opposed to the creation of a [[republic]], many of them voting \"no\" in the 5 October 1960 [[South African republic referendum, 1960|referendum]]. But due to the much larger number of Afrikaans-speaking voters, the referendum passed, leading to the establishment of a republic in 1961. The Afrikaner-dominated Government consequently withdrew South Africa from the Commonwealth. Following the results of the referendum, some whites in Natal, which had an English-speaking majority, called for secession from the Union.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WUVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2W8NAAAAIBAJ&pg=5504,1422353&dq=natal+referendum+republic&hl=en Secession Talked by Some Anti-Republicans], ''[[Saskatoon Star-Phoenix]]'', 11 October 1960</ref> Five years earlier, some 33,000 Natalians had signed the [[Natal covenant|Natal Covenant]] in opposition to the plans for a republic.<ref name=Jeffery>{{cite book|last=Jeffery|first=Keith|title=An Irish Empire?: Aspects of Ireland and the British Empire|year=1996|publisher=Manchester University Press|pages=199\u2013201|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUTpAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA200#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, the National Party government had passed a [[Constitution]] that repealed the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]]. The features of the Union were carried over with very little change to the newly formed Republic. The decision to transform from a Union to Republic was narrowly decided in the referendum. The decision together with the South African Government's insistence on adhering to its policy of [[apartheid]] resulted in South Africa's ''de facto'' expulsion from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n===Segregation===\n[[File:The Union of South Africa, Its Land and Its People (1956).webm|thumb|''Encyclopedia Britannica Films'' documentary about South Africa from 1956]]\nThe [[South Africa Act]] dealt with race in two specific provisions. First it entrenched the liberal (by South African standards) [[Cape Qualified Franchise]] system of the [[Cape Colony]] which operated free of any racial considerations (although due to socio-economic restrictions no real political expression of non-whites was possible).<ref>{{cite book|last=Robertson|first=Janet|title=Liberalism in South Africa: 1948\u20131963|year=1971|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/soubg2.htm |title=EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements |publisher=Eisa.org.za |accessdate=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509080718/http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/soubg2.htm |archivedate=9 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Cape [[Prime Minister]] at the time, [[John X. Merriman]], fought hard, but ultimately unsuccessfully, to extend this system of multi-racial franchise to the rest of [[South Africa]].\n\nSecond it made \"native affairs\" a matter for the national government. The practice therefore was to establish a Minister of Native Affairs.\n\nAccording to Stephen Howe, colonialism in some cases\u2014most obviously among white minorities in South Africa\u2014meant mainly that these violent settlers wanted to maintain more racial inequalities than the colonial empire found just.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire A very Short Introduction|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=75}}</ref>\n\n==Previous attempts at unification==\n\nSeveral previous unsuccessful attempts to unite the colonies were made, with proposed political models ranging from [[unitary (state)|unitary]], to loosely [[confederation|federal]].\n\n===Early unification attempt under Sir George Grey (1850s)===\n\nSir [[George Grey]], the [[Governor of Cape Colony]] from 1854 to 1861, decided that unifying the states of southern Africa would be mutually beneficial. The stated reasons were that he believed that political divisions between the white-controlled states \"weakened them against the natives\", threatened an ethnic divide between British and Boer, and left the Cape vulnerable to interference from other European powers. He believed that a united \"South African Federation\", under British control, would resolve all three of these concerns.<ref>V.C. Malherbe: ''What They Said. 1795\u20131910 History Documents''. Cape Town: Maskew Miller. 1971.</ref>\n\nHis idea was greeted with cautious optimism in southern Africa; the [[Orange Free State]] agreed to the idea in principle and the [[Transvaal (colony)|Transvaal]] may also eventually have agreed. However, he was overruled by the [[British Colonial Office]] which ordered him to desist from his plans. His refusal to abandon the idea eventually led to him being recalled.\n\n===The imposition of confederation (1870s)===\nIn the 1870s, the London Colonial Office, under [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Secretary for the Colonies]] [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], decided to apply a system of [[Confederation]] onto southern Africa. On this occasion however, it was largely rejected by southern Africans, primarily due to its very bad timing. The various component states of [[southern Africa]] were still simmering after the last bout of British expansion, and inter-state tensions were high. The [[Orange Free State]] this time refused to even discuss the idea, and Prime Minister [[John Molteno]] of the [[Cape Colony]] called the idea badly informed and irresponsible. In addition, many local leaders resented the way it was imposed from outside without understanding of local issues.<ref>P.A. Molteno: ''A Federal South Africa''. Sampson Low, Marston & Co, 1896. {{ISBN|1-4367-2682-4}}</ref> The [[Confederation]] model was also correctly seen as unsuitable for the disparate entities of [[southern Africa]], with their wildly different sizes, economies and political systems.<ref>Phyllis Lewsen (ed.). ''Selections from the correspondence of John X. Merriman, 1905\u20131924''. South Africa: [[Van Riebeeck Society]], 1969</ref>\n\nThe Molteno Unification Plan (1877), put forward by the Cape government as a more feasible [[unitary (state)|unitary]] alternative to [[confederation]], largely anticipated the final act of Union in 1909. A crucial difference was that the Cape's liberal constitution and multiracial franchise were to be extended to the other states of the union. These smaller states would gradually accede to the much larger [[Cape Colony]] through a system of treaties, whilst simultaneously gaining elected seats in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape parliament]]. The entire process would be locally driven, with Britain's role restricted to policing any set-backs. While subsequently acknowledged to be more viable, this model was rejected at the time by London.<ref>Frank Richardson Cana: ''South Africa: From the Great Trek to the Union''. London: Chapman & Hall, ltd., 1909. Chapter VII \"Molteno's Unification Plan\". p.89</ref> At the other extreme, another powerful Cape politician at the time, [[Saul Solomon]], proposed an extremely loose system of federation, with the component states preserving their very different constitutions and systems of franchise.<ref>Solomon, W. E. C: ''Saul Solomon \u2013 the Member for Cape Town''. Cape Town: Oxford University Press, 1948.</ref>\n\nLord Carnarvon rejected the (more informed) local plans for unification, as he wished to have the process brought to a conclusion before the end of his tenure and, having little experience of southern Africa, he preferred to enforce the more familiar model of confederation used in Canada. He pushed ahead with his Confederation plan, which unravelled as predicted, leaving a string of destructive wars across southern Africa. These conflicts eventually fed into the first and second [[Anglo-Boer War]]s, with far-reaching consequences for the subcontinent.<ref>''Illustrated History of South Africa''.

The newly arrived miners, though needed for the mines, were distrusted by the politically-dominant Afrikaners, who called them \"[[uitlander]]s\", imposed heavy taxes on them and granted them very limited civil rights, with no right to vote. The United Kingdom, wanting the gold and diamond mines and highly protective of its own citizens, demanded reforms, which the Afrikaners rejected. A small-scale private British effort to overthrow Transvaal's President [[Paul Kruger]], the [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895, proved a fiasco, and presaged full-scale conflict as diplomatic efforts all failed.<ref>J.A.S.Grenville, ''Lord Salisbury, and Foreign Policy'' (1964) pp 235\u201364.</ref><ref>Iain R.

The United Kingdom gained the support of its Cape Colony, of its Colony of Natal and of some African allies. Volunteers from across the British Empire further supplemented the British war-effort. All other nations remained neutral, but public opinion in them was largely hostile to Britain. Inside Britain and its Empire there was also significant [[opposition to the Second Boer War]] because of the atrocities and military failures.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Judd\n | first1 = Denis\n | last2 = Surridge\n | first2 = Keith\n | orig-year = 2002\n | chapter = \n | title = The Boer War: A History\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wmGJDwAAQBAJ\n | edition = revised\n | location = London\n | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n | publication-date = 2013\n | page = 1-54\n | isbn = 9780857722317\n | access-date = 2019-12-19\n | quote = \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe British were overconfident and under-prepared. Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury | Salisbury]] and his top officials, especially [[Secretary of State for the Colonies | Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]], ignored the repeated warnings of military advisors that the Boers were well prepared, well armed, and fighting for their homes in a very difficult terrain. The Boers struck first, besieging Ladysmith, Kimberly, and Mafeking in early 1900, and winning important battles at [[Battle of Colenso | Colenso]] (15 December 1899), Magersfontein and [[Battle of Stormberg | Stormberg]] (10 December 1899). Staggered, the British fought back, relieved the besieged cities, and prepared to invade first the Orange Free State, and then Transvaal in late 1900. The Boers refused to surrender or negotiate, and reverted to [[guerrilla warfare]]. After two years of hard fighting, Britain, using over 400,000 soldiers, systematically destroyed Boer resistance, raising worldwide complaints about brutality. The Boers fought for their homes and families, which provided them with food and hiding places. The British responded by forcefully relocating all the Boer civilians into heavily-guarded [[British concentration camps | concentration camps]], where about 28,000 died of disease, while British military forces systematically blocked off and tracked down the highly mobile Boer combat units. The battles were small operations; most of the dead succumbed to disease. The war ended in victory for the British and the annexation of both Boer republics, which became the [[Transvaal Colony]] and the [[Orange River Colony]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Judd\n | first1 = Denis\n | last2 = Surridge\n | first2 = Keith\n | orig-year = 2002\n | chapter = \n | title = The Boer War: A History\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wmGJDwAAQBAJ\n | edition = revised\n | location = London\n | publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing\n | publication-date = 2013\n | page = 55-302\n | isbn = 9780857722317\n | access-date = 2019-12-19\n | quote = \n}}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:Botha gouvernment 1910.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The first Union cabinet]]\n\n== History of the Union of South Africa ==\n{{main |History of South Africa (1910\u201348)}}\n\n==Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia==\n\nIn 1922 the colony of [[Southern Rhodesia]] had a chance (ultimately rejected) to join the Union through a [[Southern Rhodesia government referendum, 1922|referendum]]. The referendum resulted from the fact that by 1920 [[British South Africa Company]] rule in Southern Rhodesia was no longer practical with many favouring some form of '[[responsible government]]'. Some favoured responsible government within Southern Rhodesia while others (especially in [[Matabeleland]]) favoured membership in the Union of South Africa. Politician [[Charles Coghlan (politician)|Sir Charles Coghlan]] claimed that such membership with the Union would make Southern Rhodesia the \"[[Ulster]] of South Africa\".<ref>{{cite book | first =Keith | last =Jeffrey  | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WUTpAAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA214&ots=TMAQPZUoCA&dq=%22Ulster%20of%20South%20Africa%22&pg=PA196#v=onepage&q=%22Ulster%20of%20South%20Africa%22&f=true | title =An Irish Empire?: Aspects of Ireland and the British Empire| publisher = Manchester University Press |location= | volume =   | year = 1996 | isbn =\t0719038731  | page =196 }}</ref>\n\nPrior to the referendum, representatives of Southern Rhodesia visited Cape Town where the Prime Minister of South Africa, [[Jan Smuts]], eventually offered terms he considered reasonable and which the United Kingdom government found acceptable. Although opinion among the United Kingdom government, the South African government and the British South Africa Company favoured the union option (and none tried to interfere in the referendum), when the referendum was held the results saw 59.4% in favour of responsible government for a separate colony and 40.6% in favour of joining the Union of South Africa.\n\n==Union of South Africa and South West Africa==\n\n===Background===\n\n{{main|Palgrave Commission}}\n\nThe inhospitable coast of what is now the [[Republic of Namibia]] remained uncolonised up until the end of the 19th century.\n\nFrom 1874, the leaders of several indigenous peoples, notably [[Maharero]] of the [[Herero people|Herero]] nation, approached the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] to the south. Anticipating invasion by a European power and already suffering [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese encroachment]] from the north and [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner encroachment]] from the south, these leaders approached the [[Cape Colony]] government to discuss the possibility of accession and the political representation it would entail. Accession to the Cape Colony, a self-governing state with a [[Cape Qualified Franchise|system of multi-racial franchise]] and legal protection for traditional land rights, was at the time considered marginally preferable to annexation by [[Portugal]] or [[Germany]].\n\nIn response, the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] appointed a special Commission under [[Palgrave Commission|William Palgrave]], to travel to the territory between the [[Orange (river)|Orange]] and [[Cunene river]]s and to confer with these leaders regarding accession to the Cape. In the negotiations with the [[Palgrave Commission]], some indigenous nations such as the [[Damara (people)|Damara]] and the Herero responded positively (October 1876), other reactions were mixed. Discussions regarding the magisterial structure for the area's political integration into the Cape dragged on until, from 1876, it was blocked by Britain. Britain relented, insofar as allowing the Cape to incorporate [[Walvis Bay]], which was brought under the magisterial district of [[Cape Town]], but when the Germans established a protectorate over the area in 1884, South West Africa was predominantly autonomous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ukzn.ac.za/files/theses/david%20mccarney.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209150334/http://www.history.ukzn.ac.za/files/theses/david%20mccarney.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2014 }}</ref><ref>P.

With the establishment of the [[League of Nations]] and cessation of the war, South Africa obtained a [[Class C mandate|Class C Mandate]] to administer South West Africa \"under the laws of the mandatory (South Africa) as integral portions of its territory\". Subsequently, the Union of South Africa generally regarded South West Africa as a fifth province, although this was never an official status.\n\nWith the creation of the [[United Nations]], the Union applied for the incorporation of South West Africa, but its application was rejected by the U.N., which invited South Africa to prepare a [[Trusteeship (United Nations)|Trusteeship]] agreement instead. This invitation was in turn rejected by the Union, which subsequently did not modify the administration of South West Africa and continued to adhere to the original mandate. This caused a complex set of legal wranglings that were not finalised when the Union was replaced with the Republic of South Africa. In 1949, the Union passed a law bringing South West Africa into closer association with it including giving South West Africa representation in the South African parliament.\n\n[[Walvis Bay]], which is now in [[Namibia]], was originally a part of the Union of South Africa as it was a part of the Cape Colony at the time of Unification. In 1921 Walvis Bay was integrated with the Class C Mandate over South West Africa for the rest of the Union's duration and for part of the republican era.\n\n==Statute of Westminster==\n\nThe [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] passed by the [[British Parliament]] in December 1931, which repealed the [[Colonial Laws Validity Act]] and implemented the [[Balfour Declaration 1926]], had a profound impact on the constitutional structure and status of the Union. The most notable effect was that the South African Parliament was released from many restrictions concerning the handling of the so-called \"native question\". However the repeal was not sufficient to enable the South African Parliament to ignore the entrenched clauses of its constitution (the [[South Africa Act 1909|South Africa Act]]) which led to the [[coloured-vote constitutional crisis]] of the 1950s wherein the right of coloureds to vote in the main South African Parliament was removed and replaced with a separate, segregated, and largely powerless assembly.\n\n==Military==\n{{main|Union Defence Force (South Africa)}}\n\nThe military of the Union of South Africa was the [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|Union Defence Force]] until 1957, when it became the [[South African Defence Force]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Monarchy|South Africa}}\n*[[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{wikiatlas|Union of South Africa}}\n* Beck, Roger B.
