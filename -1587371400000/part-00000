They also may be attacked by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a \"wanted level\" similar to that of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series; low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while giant walking machines can assault the player at higher wanted levels.<ref name=\"edge demo\"/> While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles.

Once constructed, the player can then immediately return to their base via teleportation from a space station in the rest of the galaxy. The base supports adding special stations, such as research terminals, that can be manned by one of the sentient aliens, which can help to unlock additional base components and blueprints, tend to harvesting flora for resources, and other aspects. The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. The player is able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | title = No Man\u2019s Sky gets gigantic update with new modes, features, fixes and more | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 30 November 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124649/http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | archivedate = 29 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation update also adds in two new play modes, with the original gameplay considered as the third, default mode. [[Survival mode]] is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher\u2014atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\"/>\n\nA second update released in March 2017, known as the \"Path Finder Update\", added several new features to the game.

It included significant contributions to the game's story mode, added an estimated 30 hours of narrative, and added procedurally generated missions.

When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a [[hyperspace]] jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy.  During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy.\n\nAlong the way to the centre, the Traveller receives a message from an alien entity named Artemis, who tells them that they, like the player, are a Traveller and wished to meet others of their kind.  They stepped through a strange, ancient portal, but they got trapped on a sunless world.  After triangulating their position and talking with the local alien species, the Traveller discovers that Artemis's location does not exist.  After telling Artemis the news, the transmission ends mysteriously and the Traveller learns of another Traveller named Apollo.\n\nThe Traveller contacts Apollo, telling them about Artemis's predicament.  The player is told to uncover the connection between the portals and the Sentinels.  After a skirmish with the Sentinels, the Traveller passes through a portal and is taken aboard a large, unknown vessel in space, where it comes face to face with a cosmic being.  The Traveller is then sent to an unknown planet where they find the grave of Artemis, revealing Artemis has been dead the entire time.  While trying to contact Apollo, they accidentally contact a new entity, -null.  -null tells the Traveller that Artemis can be saved, through the use of a \"Mind Arc\".\n\nWhile in space, they are alerted to a presence of a space anomaly in a nearby system. Traveling there they find a special space station (\"space anomaly\") where two aliens wait for them, Priest Entity Nada and Specialist Polo. Nada and Polo have knowledge beyond what other aliens in the galaxy appear to possess, including being able to speak without translation to the Traveller.  They tell of the entity the player met, called \"The Atlas\", found at the centre of the galaxy.  They are able to guide the Traveller towards meeting Atlas, either by directing them to the location of a nearby Atlas Interface, the vessel they were previously transported to, or to a [[black hole]] that can quickly take the Traveller closer to the centre of the galaxy.  After constructing the Mind Arc, the Traveller must choose whether to upload Artemis's soul into a machine aboard the Anomaly or to let them die. Regardless of the choice, they are directed by a distress beacon to another portal, where they find themselves aboard another Atlas Interface.  They learn that the Atlas is dying and must warn the other Travellers in the galaxy, but is unable to contact them.\n\nThe Traveller becomes aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.<ref name=\"crave plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Ending Explained: The Center of the Galaxy and the Simulation Theory | first = Paul | last = Tamburro | date = 11 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[CraveOnline]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821051616/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, and the Travellers, or the fourth race, are entities that were created by the Atlas to explore the simulation.  It is also revealed how Nada and Polo met, and how they are \"errors\" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/>\n\nThe Traveller investigates more Interfaces to find themselves once again in direct communication with the Atlas.  The Atlas informs them it doesn't want to die.  In order to save itself, it directs the Traveller to continue to explore and collect information all while moving towards the centre, where the entity appears to be.  The Atlas judges the Traveller's progress, and grants it the [[blueprint]] for a different Atlas Seed if it deems the Traveller worthy.  The Traveller must continue on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Seeds from other Interfaces.\n\nUltimately, the Traveller reaches the galaxy's centre, finding yet another Atlas Interface.  The Traveller must choose to either restart the simulation, saving the Atlas, or continue exploring.  If they choose to restart the simulation, the Traveller presents the Interface with the Atlas Seeds they have obtained.  The Atlas resets, upon which it creates a new galaxy, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to restart the exploration, but it is revealed this has happened many times before, each time shortening the life of the Atlas.  The Atlas tries to see into the future, past its death, but sees nothing, besides the hand of its creator on its glass casing. The current Traveller is released, free to explore on its own, while from the player's view, they are placed in control of this new Traveller, effectively restarting the game.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/><ref name=\"polygon plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | title = No Man's Sky's Atlas Interfaces, story path and you | first = Jeffrey | last = Parkin | date = 17 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821071150/http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{main|Development of No Man's Sky}}\n\n''No Man's Sky'' represented Hello Games' vision of a broad, attention-getting game that they wanted to pursue while they secured their financial well being through the ''[[Joe Danger]]'' series of games.<ref name=\"nms hello games\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | title = The Secret Story Behind No Man's Sky | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = 19 December 2014 | accessdate = 19 December 2014 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101227/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | archivedate = 23 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The game's original prototype was worked on by Hello Games' Sean Murray, who wanted to create a game about the spirit of exploration inspired by the optimistic science fiction of [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Arthur C.

Keighley felt that Murray could not \"rip off that band-aid\" and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to \"disrespect his audience\".

It was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in August 2016, and for [[Xbox One]] in July 2018. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] deterministic [[open world]] universe, which includes over 18 [[quintillion]] planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and various sentient alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, and otherwise seeking out the mystery around the Atlas, an entity at the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with ''No Man's Sky''. The game was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]. The game was seen as an ambitious project by a small team by the gaming media, and Murray and Hello Games drew significant attention leading to its release.\n\n''No Man's Sky'' received mixed reviews at its 2016 launch, with some critics praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lackluster and repetitive. However, the critical response was marred by the lack of several features that had been reported to be in the game, particularly [[multiplayer]] capabilities, though Murray had tried to downplay expectations prior to release. The game was further criticised due to Hello Games' lack of communication in the months following the launch, creating a hostile backlash from some of its player base. Murray stated later that Hello Games had failed to control the exaggerated expectations of the game from the media and the larger-than-expected player count at launch, and since have taken an approach of remaining quiet about updates to ''No Man's Sky'' until they are nearly ready to ship to avoid miscommunication. The promotion and marketing for ''No Man's Sky'' became a subject of debate, and the video game industry has used ''No Man's Sky'' as an example of missteps to avoid in marketing.\n\nSince the game's initial release, Hello Games has continued to improve and expand ''No Man's Sky'' to achieve the vision of the experience they wanted to build, while the game continued to have a [[cult following]] of players. The game has received multiple major content updates that have introduced several previously missing features, such as multiplayer components, while adding new features like surface vehicles, base-building, space fleet management, and [[virtual reality]] support, all of which have generally improved its overall reception.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:No mans sky screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|''No Man's Sky'' allows players to explore planets with procedurally generated flora and fauna]]\n''No Man's Sky'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival game]] played from a [[First-person perspective|first]] or [[Third-person perspective|third]] person perspective that allows players to engage in four principal activities: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.<ref name=\"polygon april2016\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | title = A brief tour of a tiny corner of No Man's Sky | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401191435/http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | archivedate = 1 April 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The player takes the role of a specimen of alien humanoid planetary explorer, known in-game as the Traveller<!-- British spelling, do not change -->, in an uncharted universe.

They also may be attacked by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a \"wanted level\" similar to that of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series; low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while giant walking machines can assault the player at higher wanted levels.<ref name=\"edge demo\"/> While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles.

Once constructed, the player can then immediately return to their base via teleportation from a space station in the rest of the galaxy. The base supports adding special stations, such as research terminals, that can be manned by one of the sentient aliens, which can help to unlock additional base components and blueprints, tend to harvesting flora for resources, and other aspects. The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. The player is able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | title = No Man\u2019s Sky gets gigantic update with new modes, features, fixes and more | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 30 November 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124649/http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | archivedate = 29 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation update also adds in two new play modes, with the original gameplay considered as the third, default mode. [[Survival mode]] is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher\u2014atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\"/>\n\nA second update released in March 2017, known as the \"Path Finder Update\", added several new features to the game. Among these included the ability to share bases with other players, as well as new vehicles called exocraft to help in exploration. The exocraft can be built on the player's set home planet, and called upon on any other planet via a minor update released a few days afterwards.

It included significant contributions to the game's story mode, added an estimated 30 hours of narrative, and added procedurally generated missions. The player can use portals to quickly transport across the game's galaxy. A limited online cooperative mode, called \"Joint Exploration\", allows for up to 16 players to explore the same planet and use voice chat and text commands to communicate to others in close proximity, seeing each other as glowing spheres, but otherwise they cannot directly interact with each other; Hello Games called it an \"important first step into the world of synchronous co-op\".

When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a [[hyperspace]] jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy.  During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy.\n\nAlong the way to the centre, the Traveller receives a message from an alien entity named Artemis, who tells them that they, like the player, are a Traveller and wished to meet others of their kind.  They stepped through a strange, ancient portal, but they got trapped on a sunless world.  After triangulating their position and talking with the local alien species, the Traveller discovers that Artemis's location does not exist.  After telling Artemis the news, the transmission ends mysteriously and the Traveller learns of another Traveller named Apollo.\n\nThe Traveller contacts Apollo, telling them about Artemis's predicament.  The player is told to uncover the connection between the portals and the Sentinels.  After a skirmish with the Sentinels, the Traveller passes through a portal and is taken aboard a large, unknown vessel in space, where it comes face to face with a cosmic being.  The Traveller is then sent to an unknown planet where they find the grave of Artemis, revealing Artemis has been dead the entire time.  While trying to contact Apollo, they accidentally contact a new entity, -null.  -null tells the Traveller that Artemis can be saved, through the use of a \"Mind Arc\".\n\nWhile in space, they are alerted to a presence of a space anomaly in a nearby system. Traveling there they find a special space station (\"space anomaly\") where two aliens wait for them, Priest Entity Nada and Specialist Polo. Nada and Polo have knowledge beyond what other aliens in the galaxy appear to possess, including being able to speak without translation to the Traveller.  They tell of the entity the player met, called \"The Atlas\", found at the centre of the galaxy.  They are able to guide the Traveller towards meeting Atlas, either by directing them to the location of a nearby Atlas Interface, the vessel they were previously transported to, or to a [[black hole]] that can quickly take the Traveller closer to the centre of the galaxy.  After constructing the Mind Arc, the Traveller must choose whether to upload Artemis's soul into a machine aboard the Anomaly or to let them die. Regardless of the choice, they are directed by a distress beacon to another portal, where they find themselves aboard another Atlas Interface.  They learn that the Atlas is dying and must warn the other Travellers in the galaxy, but is unable to contact them.\n\nThe Traveller becomes aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.<ref name=\"crave plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Ending Explained: The Center of the Galaxy and the Simulation Theory | first = Paul | last = Tamburro | date = 11 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[CraveOnline]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821051616/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, and the Travellers, or the fourth race, are entities that were created by the Atlas to explore the simulation.  It is also revealed how Nada and Polo met, and how they are \"errors\" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/>\n\nThe Traveller investigates more Interfaces to find themselves once again in direct communication with the Atlas.  The Atlas informs them it doesn't want to die.  In order to save itself, it directs the Traveller to continue to explore and collect information all while moving towards the centre, where the entity appears to be.  The Atlas judges the Traveller's progress, and grants it the [[blueprint]] for a different Atlas Seed if it deems the Traveller worthy.  The Traveller must continue on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Seeds from other Interfaces.\n\nUltimately, the Traveller reaches the galaxy's centre, finding yet another Atlas Interface.  The Traveller must choose to either restart the simulation, saving the Atlas, or continue exploring.  If they choose to restart the simulation, the Traveller presents the Interface with the Atlas Seeds they have obtained.  The Atlas resets, upon which it creates a new galaxy, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to restart the exploration, but it is revealed this has happened many times before, each time shortening the life of the Atlas.  The Atlas tries to see into the future, past its death, but sees nothing, besides the hand of its creator on its glass casing. The current Traveller is released, free to explore on its own, while from the player's view, they are placed in control of this new Traveller, effectively restarting the game.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/><ref name=\"polygon plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | title = No Man's Sky's Atlas Interfaces, story path and you | first = Jeffrey | last = Parkin | date = 17 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821071150/http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{main|Development of No Man's Sky}}\n\n''No Man's Sky'' represented Hello Games' vision of a broad, attention-getting game that they wanted to pursue while they secured their financial well being through the ''[[Joe Danger]]'' series of games.<ref name=\"nms hello games\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | title = The Secret Story Behind No Man's Sky | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = 19 December 2014 | accessdate = 19 December 2014 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101227/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | archivedate = 23 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The game's original prototype was worked on by Hello Games' Sean Murray, who wanted to create a game about the spirit of exploration inspired by the optimistic science fiction of [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Arthur C.

Keighley felt that Murray could not \"rip off that band-aid\" and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to \"disrespect his audience\".

This initial settlement place on the Swan River was soon named [[Perth#History|Perth]], and it became the capital city of Western Australia.\n\nThe name was a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for Western Australia. In 1832 the colony was renamed the [[Colony of Western Australia]], when the colony's founding [[Governor of Western Australia|lieutenant-governor]], Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]], belatedly received his commission. However, the name \"Swan River Colony\" remained in informal use for many years afterwards.\n\n==European exploration==\n[[File:Vlamingh ships at the Swan River, Keulen 1796.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Willem de Vlamingh]]'s ships, with [[black swan]]s, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia'', coloured engraving (1796), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696\u201397]]\nThe first recorded Europeans to sight land where the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] is now located were [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors. Most likely the first visitor to the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] area was [[Frederick de Houtman]] on 19 July 1619, travelling on the ships ''Dordrecht'' and ''Amsterdam''. His records indicate he first reached the Western Australian coast at [[latitude]] 32\u00b020' which would equate to [[Rottnest]] or just south of there. He did not land because of heavy surf, and so proceeded northwards without much investigation.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\">{{cite book |last1=Appleyard |first1= R.

Of the 193 on board, only 75 made it to shore. A small boat that survived the wreckage then sailed to Batavia for help, but a subsequent search party found none of the survivors. The wreck was rediscovered in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/backyard/shipwrecks/wa/transcript_vergulde.htm|website=ABC online |title=Shipwrecks Audio Transcript : Gilt Dragins & Elephant Tusks|year=2003| accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1658, three [[Dutch Republic]] ships, also partially searching for ''Vergulde Draeck'' visited the area. ''Waekende Boey'' under Captain S. Volckertszoon, ''Elburg'' under Captain J. Peereboom and ''Emeloort'' under Captain A. Joncke sighted [[Rottnest]] but did not proceed any closer to the mainland because of the many reefs. They then travelled north and subsequently found the wreck of ''Vergulde Draeck'' (but still no survivors). They gave an unfavourable opinion of the area partly due to the dangerous reefs.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\n[[Image:Battye freycinet swanriver lg.jpg|thumb|right|The first detailed map of the Swan River, drawn by the French in 1801]]\n\nThe Dutch captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] was the next European in the area. Commanding three ships, ''Geelvink'', ''Nyptangh'' and ''Wezeltje'', he arrived at and named Rottnest on 29 December 1696, and on 10 January 1697 visited and named the Swan River. His ships could not sail up the river because of a sand bar at its mouth, so he sent out a [[sloop]] which even then required some dragging over the sand bar. They sailed until reaching mud flats probably near [[Heirisson Island]]. They saw some [[Australian aborigine|Aborigines]] but were not able to meet any close up. Vlamingh was also not impressed with the area, and this was probably the reason for a lack of Dutch exploration from then on.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\nIn 1801, the French ships ''[[French corvette G\u00e9ographe|G\u00e9ographe]]'' captained by [[Nicolas Baudin]] and ''Naturaliste'' captained by [[Jacques F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Hamelin|Emmanuel Hamelin]] visited the area from the south. While ''G\u00e9ographe'' continued northwards, ''Naturaliste'' remained for a few weeks. A small expedition dragged longboats over the sand bar and explored the Swan River. They also gave unfavourable descriptions regarding any potential settlement due to many mud flats upstream and the sand bar (the sand bar wasn't removed until the 1890s when [[C. Y. O'Connor]] built Fremantle harbour).\n\nLater in March 1803, ''G\u00e9ographe'' with another ship ''Casuarina'' passed by Rottnest on their way eventually back to France, but did not stop longer than a day or two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multicultural.online.wa.gov.au/wppuser/owamc/onlinenews_3_04/page8.html|title=The Baudin Expedition of 1800\u20131804 |first=Kate |last=Pratt |website=Terra Australis 2001 WA Association Inc |access-date=14 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116051501/http://www.multicultural.online.wa.gov.au/wppuser/owamc/onlinenews_3_04/page8.html|archive-date=16 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/navigators/captains/baudin.htm|title=The Captains: Nicholas Baudin |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=14 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104075905/http://www.abc.net.au/navigators/captains/baudin.htm|archive-date=4 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe next visit to the area was the first Australian-born maritime explorer, [[Phillip Parker King]] in 1822 on ''Bathurst''. King was also the son of former Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] of [[New South Wales]]. However, King also was not impressed with the area.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\n==Background to the settlement==\n[[Image:Jamesstirling.jpg|right|thumb|Admiral Sir [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|James Stirling]]]]\n[[File:A Plan of Swan River Settlement and Surrounding Country.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Swan River Settlement and the surrounding country (1831)]]\nThe founding father of Western Australia was Captain [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|James Stirling]] who, in 1827, explored the Swan River area in {{HMS|Success|1825|6}} which first anchored off [[Rottnest Island|Rottnest]], and later in Cockburn Sound. He was accompanied by [[Charles Fraser (botanist)|Charles Fraser]], the [[New South Wales]] botanist.\n\nTheir initial exploration began on 8 March in a cutter and gig with parties continuing on foot from 13 March. In late March, {{HMS|Success|1825|2}} moved to [[Sydney]], arriving there on 15 April. Stirling arrived back in [[England]] in July 1828, promoting in glowing terms the agricultural potential of the area. His lobbying was for the establishment of a \"free\" settlement{{snd}}unlike [[penal colony|penal colonies]] at [[New South Wales]], [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Norfolk Island]]{{snd}}in the Swan River area with himself as its governor . As a result of these reports, and a rumour in [[London]] that the [[France|French]] were about to establish a penal colony in the western part of Australia, possibly at [[Shark Bay]], the Colonial Office assented to the proposal in mid-October 1828.\n\nIn December 1828 a Secretary of State for Colonies despatch reserved land for the Crown, as well as for the clergy, and for education, and specified that water frontage was to be rationed. The most cursory exploration had preceded the British decision to found a settlement at the Swan River; the most makeshift arrangements were to govern its initial establishment and the granting of land; and the most sketchy surveys were to be made before the grants were actually occupied. A set of regulations were worked out for distributing land to settlers on the basis of [[Land grants in the Swan River Colony|land grants]]. Negotiations for a privately run settlement were also started with a consortium of four gentlemen headed by [[Potter McQueen]], a member of Parliament who had already acquired a large tract of land in [[New South Wales]]. The consortium withdrew after the Colonial Office refused to give it preference over independent settlers in selecting land, but one member, [[Thomas Peel]], accepted the terms and proceeded alone.

They described the poor conditions and the starving state of the colonists, deemed the land totally unfit for agriculture, and reported (incorrectly) that the settlers had abandoned the colony. As a result of these reports, many people cancelled their migration plans or diverted to [[Cape Town]] in South Africa, or to the more well-established [[New South Wales]] colony.\n\nNevertheless, a few settlers arrived and additional stores were dispatched. By 1832 the population of the colony had reached about 1,500. Aboriginal people were not counted at that time, but in the south west have been estimated to number 15,000. The difficulty of clearing land to grow crops was so great that by 1850 the population of settlers had increased only to 5,886.

This initial settlement place on the Swan River was soon named [[Perth#History|Perth]], and it became the capital city of Western Australia.\n\nThe name was a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for Western Australia. In 1832 the colony was renamed the [[Colony of Western Australia]], when the colony's founding [[Governor of Western Australia|lieutenant-governor]], Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]], belatedly received his commission. However, the name \"Swan River Colony\" remained in informal use for many years afterwards.\n\n==European exploration==\n[[File:Vlamingh ships at the Swan River, Keulen 1796.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Willem de Vlamingh]]'s ships, with [[black swan]]s, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia'', coloured engraving (1796), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696\u201397]]\nThe first recorded Europeans to sight land where the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] is now located were [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors. Most likely the first visitor to the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] area was [[Frederick de Houtman]] on 19 July 1619, travelling on the ships ''Dordrecht'' and ''Amsterdam''. His records indicate he first reached the Western Australian coast at [[latitude]] 32\u00b020' which would equate to [[Rottnest]] or just south of there. He did not land because of heavy surf, and so proceeded northwards without much investigation.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\">{{cite book |last1=Appleyard |first1= R.

Of the 193 on board, only 75 made it to shore. A small boat that survived the wreckage then sailed to Batavia for help, but a subsequent search party found none of the survivors. The wreck was rediscovered in 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/backyard/shipwrecks/wa/transcript_vergulde.htm|website=ABC online |title=Shipwrecks Audio Transcript : Gilt Dragins & Elephant Tusks|year=2003| accessdate=14 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1658, three [[Dutch Republic]] ships, also partially searching for ''Vergulde Draeck'' visited the area. ''Waekende Boey'' under Captain S. Volckertszoon, ''Elburg'' under Captain J. Peereboom and ''Emeloort'' under Captain A. Joncke sighted [[Rottnest]] but did not proceed any closer to the mainland because of the many reefs. They then travelled north and subsequently found the wreck of ''Vergulde Draeck'' (but still no survivors). They gave an unfavourable opinion of the area partly due to the dangerous reefs.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\n[[Image:Battye freycinet swanriver lg.jpg|thumb|right|The first detailed map of the Swan River, drawn by the French in 1801]]\n\nThe Dutch captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] was the next European in the area. Commanding three ships, ''Geelvink'', ''Nyptangh'' and ''Wezeltje'', he arrived at and named Rottnest on 29 December 1696, and on 10 January 1697 visited and named the Swan River. His ships could not sail up the river because of a sand bar at its mouth, so he sent out a [[sloop]] which even then required some dragging over the sand bar. They sailed until reaching mud flats probably near [[Heirisson Island]]. They saw some [[Australian aborigine|Aborigines]] but were not able to meet any close up. Vlamingh was also not impressed with the area, and this was probably the reason for a lack of Dutch exploration from then on.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\nIn 1801, the French ships ''[[French corvette G\u00e9ographe|G\u00e9ographe]]'' captained by [[Nicolas Baudin]] and ''Naturaliste'' captained by [[Jacques F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Hamelin|Emmanuel Hamelin]] visited the area from the south. While ''G\u00e9ographe'' continued northwards, ''Naturaliste'' remained for a few weeks. A small expedition dragged longboats over the sand bar and explored the Swan River. They also gave unfavourable descriptions regarding any potential settlement due to many mud flats upstream and the sand bar (the sand bar wasn't removed until the 1890s when [[C. Y. O'Connor]] built Fremantle harbour).\n\nLater in March 1803, ''G\u00e9ographe'' with another ship ''Casuarina'' passed by Rottnest on their way eventually back to France, but did not stop longer than a day or two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multicultural.online.wa.gov.au/wppuser/owamc/onlinenews_3_04/page8.html|title=The Baudin Expedition of 1800\u20131804 |first=Kate |last=Pratt |website=Terra Australis 2001 WA Association Inc |access-date=14 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116051501/http://www.multicultural.online.wa.gov.au/wppuser/owamc/onlinenews_3_04/page8.html|archive-date=16 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/navigators/captains/baudin.htm|title=The Captains: Nicholas Baudin |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=14 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104075905/http://www.abc.net.au/navigators/captains/baudin.htm|archive-date=4 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe next visit to the area was the first Australian-born maritime explorer, [[Phillip Parker King]] in 1822 on ''Bathurst''. King was also the son of former Governor [[Philip Gidley King]] of [[New South Wales]]. However, King also was not impressed with the area.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\n==Background to the settlement==\n[[Image:Jamesstirling.jpg|right|thumb|Admiral Sir [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|James Stirling]]]]\n[[File:A Plan of Swan River Settlement and Surrounding Country.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Swan River Settlement and the surrounding country (1831)]]\nThe founding father of Western Australia was Captain [[James Stirling (Royal Navy officer)|James Stirling]] who, in 1827, explored the Swan River area in {{HMS|Success|1825|6}} which first anchored off [[Rottnest Island|Rottnest]], and later in Cockburn Sound. He was accompanied by [[Charles Fraser (botanist)|Charles Fraser]], the [[New South Wales]] botanist.\n\nTheir initial exploration began on 8 March in a cutter and gig with parties continuing on foot from 13 March. In late March, {{HMS|Success|1825|2}} moved to [[Sydney]], arriving there on 15 April. Stirling arrived back in [[England]] in July 1828, promoting in glowing terms the agricultural potential of the area. His lobbying was for the establishment of a \"free\" settlement{{snd}}unlike [[penal colony|penal colonies]] at [[New South Wales]], [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Norfolk Island]]{{snd}}in the Swan River area with himself as its governor . As a result of these reports, and a rumour in [[London]] that the [[France|French]] were about to establish a penal colony in the western part of Australia, possibly at [[Shark Bay]], the Colonial Office assented to the proposal in mid-October 1828.\n\nIn December 1828 a Secretary of State for Colonies despatch reserved land for the Crown, as well as for the clergy, and for education, and specified that water frontage was to be rationed. The most cursory exploration had preceded the British decision to found a settlement at the Swan River; the most makeshift arrangements were to govern its initial establishment and the granting of land; and the most sketchy surveys were to be made before the grants were actually occupied. A set of regulations were worked out for distributing land to settlers on the basis of [[Land grants in the Swan River Colony|land grants]]. Negotiations for a privately run settlement were also started with a consortium of four gentlemen headed by [[Potter McQueen]], a member of Parliament who had already acquired a large tract of land in [[New South Wales]]. The consortium withdrew after the Colonial Office refused to give it preference over independent settlers in selecting land, but one member, [[Thomas Peel]], accepted the terms and proceeded alone. Peel was allocated {{convert|500,000|acres|km2}}, conditional on his arrival at the settlement before 1 November 1829 with 400 settlers. Peel arrived after this date with only 300 settlers, but was still granted {{convert|250,000|acres|km2}}.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Events of the settlement==\n{| class=wikitable align=right style=\"font-size: 85%; margin-left: 10pt;\"\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=2|Swan River Colony<br/>ship arrivals in 1829<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membership.wags.org.au/1829-ships/78-1829-shipping-arrivals|title=WA 1829 Passenger Ship Arrivals|publisher=Western Australian Genealogical Society|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n|-\n|25 April || {{HMS|Challenger|1826|6}}<br/>([[Charles Fremantle|Fremantle]])\n|-\n|31 May || ''[[Parmelia (barque)|Parmelia]]''<br/>([[James Stirling (Australian governor)|Stirling]])\n|-\n|6 June || {{HMS|Sulphur|1826|6}}\n|-\n|5 August ||''Calista''\n|-\n|6 August ||''Saint Leonard''\n|-\n|23 August ||''Marquis of Anglesea''\n|-\n|19 September ||''Thompson''\n|-\n|21 September ||''[[Amity (brig)|Amity]]''\n|-\n|5 October ||''Georgiana''\n|-\n|9 October ||''Ephemina''\n|-\n|12 October ||''Orelia''\n|-\n|12 October ||{{ship||Cumberland|1827 ship|2}}\n|-\n|12 October ||''Caroline''\n|-\n|17 October ||''Governor Phillip''\n|-\n|19 October ||''Atwick''\n|-\n|23 October ||{{ship||Lotus|1826 ship|6}}<br/>John Summerson\n|-\n|31 October ||{{ship||Admiral Gifford|ship|6}}\n|-\n|11 November ||''Lion (Lyon)''\n|-\n|14 November ||''Dragon''\n|-\n|28 November ||{{HMS|Success|1825|6}}\n|-\n|15 December ||{{ship||Gilmore|1824 ship|2}}<br/>[[Thomas Peel|(Peel)]]\n|}\n\nThe first ship to reach the Swan River was {{HMS|Challenger|1826|6}}.

Javier Rodriguez Iglesias, {{a.k.a.}} DJ Linetech, produced their first few songs before he was replaced by Peter Goos. The repertoire mainly consisted of 1980s covers.

France, Italy and Austria-Hungary used large numbers of smaller patrol aircraft for the [[Mediterranean]], [[Adriatic]] and other coastal areas while the Germans and British fought over the North Sea.\nAt first, [[blimp]]s and [[zeppelin]]s were the only aircraft capable of staying aloft for the longer 10 hour patrols whilst carrying a useful payload while shorter-range patrols were mounted with landplanes such as the [[Sopwith 1\u00bd Strutter]]. A number of specialized patrol balloons were built, particularly by the British, including the [[SS class airship]] of which 158 were built including subtypes. Later in the war, aircraft were also developed specifically for the role including small flying boats such as the [[FBA Type C]] as well as large [[floatplane]]s such as the [[Short 184]] or [[flying boat]]s such as the [[Felixstowe F.3]]. Developments of the Felixstowe served with the [[Royal Air Force]] until the mid 20s, and with the [[US Navy]] as the [[Curtiss F5L]] and [[Naval Aircraft Factory PN]] whose developments saw service until 1938. \nDuring the war, Dornier did considerable pioneering work in all aluminium aircraft structures while working for Zeppelin and built four large patrol flying boats, the last of which, the [[Zeppelin-Lindau Rs.IV]] influenced development elsewhere resulting in the replacement of wooden hulls with metal ones, such as on the [[Short Singapore]]. The success of long range patrol aircraft led to the development of fighters specifically designed to intercept them, such as the [[Hansa-Brandenburg W.29]].\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:Short Sunderland Mk V.jpg|thumb|British [[Short Sunderland]] maritime reconnaissance flying boat]]\n[[File:Focke-Wulf Fw 200C Condor in flight.jpg|thumb|German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]] on patrol]]\nMany of the [[World War II]] patrol airplanes were converted from either [[bomber]]s or [[airliner]]s such as the [[Lockheed Hudson]] which started out as the [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra]], as well as older biplane designs such as the [[Supermarine Stranraer]] which had begun to be replaced by monoplanes just before the outbreak of war. The British in particular used obsolete bombers to supplement purpose-built aircraft for maritime patrol, such as the [[Vickers Wellington]] and [[Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley]] while the US relegated the [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]] to the same role until better aircraft became available. Blimps were widely used by the [[U.S. Navy]], especially in the warmer and calmer latitudes of the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Trinidad]], and later [[the Azores]].\n\nSpecial-purpose aircraft were also used, including the American-made twin-engine [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] flying boats, and the large, four-engine British [[Short Sunderland]] flying boats of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. In the [[War in the Pacific|Pacific]], the Catalina was gradually superseded by the longer-ranged [[Martin PBM Mariner]] flying boat. For the [[Axis Powers]], there were the long-range Japanese [[Kawanishi H6K]] and [[Kawanishi H8K]] flying boats, and the German [[Blohm & Voss BV 138]] [[Junkers Jumo 205|diesel-engined]] trimotor flying boat as well as the converted [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor]] airliner landplane.\n\nTo finally close the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]], or \"Black Gap\", the British [[Royal Air Force]], the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], and the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] employed the very long [[Range (aeronautics)|range]] American [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]] [[bomber]] which also saw service in the Pacific as the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator#PB4Y-1|PB4Y]] with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]].\n\nNew developments in [[radar|airborne radar]] and [[sonobuoy]]s enhanced the ability of aircraft to find and destroy submarines, especially at night and in poor weather, while the need for effective [[Aircraft camouflage|camouflage]] came under fresh review, with the widespread adoption of white paint schemes in the Atlantic to reduce the warning available to surfaced [[U-boat]]s, while US Navy aircraft transitioned from an upper light blue-gray and lower white to an all-over dark blue due to the increasing threat of Japanese forces at night-time.\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n[[File:Inside breguet atlantic.JPG|thumb|Interior of a French Navy [[Breguet Atlantic]]]]\n\nIn the decades following World War II, the patrol duties were partially taken over by aircraft derived from civilian airliners. These had range and performance factors better than most of the wartime bombers. The latest jet-powered bombers of the 1950s did not have the endurance needed for long, overwater patrolling, and they did not have the low loitering speeds necessary for antisubmarine operations.\n\nThe RAF also flew a derivative of the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber{{spaced ndash}} the [[Avro Shackleton]]{{spaced ndash}}, and then eventually replaced it with the [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]], a derivation of the [[De Havilland Comet]] airliner.\n\nThe U.S. Navy flew a mixture of patrol planes such as the [[Lockheed P2V Neptune]] (P2V) and the [[aircraft carrier|carrier-based]] [[Grumman S-2 Tracker]]. The P2V was replaced by the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]], which is still in service after many decades. The P-3 is derived from the 1950s [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Lockheed Electra]] airliner with four [[turboprop]] engines. Produced in [[United States]], [[Japan]] and [[Canada]], the P-3 has been operated by the air forces and navies of United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Germany, the Netherlands, [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], Spain, and Taiwan. The Canadian version is called the [[CP-140 Aurora]].\n\nAt first, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] had to make do with a stretched-fuselage modification of the [[Avro Lincoln]] bomber, before replacing those with the P2V and then the P-3C, still in service.\n\nIn addition to their ASW and SAR capabilities, most P-3Cs have been modified to carry [[Harpoon missile|Harpoon]] and [[AGM-65 Maverick|Maverick]] missiles for attacking surface ships. American P-3s were formerly armed with the [[Mk 101 Lulu|Lulu]] nuclear [[depth charge]] for ASW, but those were removed from the arsenal and scrapped decades ago.\n\nThe [[Soviet Union]] developed the [[Ilyushin Il-38]] from a civilian airliner. Similarly, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] derived the [[Canadair CP-107 Argus]] from a British airliner. The Argus was superseded by the CP-140 Aurora, derived from the Lockheed Electra.\n\nThe [[French Navy]] developed the [[Breguet Atlantic]] following a Request for Proposal (RFP) from the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO). Some of these were also produced for some other NATO members that were not flying the P-3 or the CP-140.\n\nJapan has developed  purpose-designed aircraft as well, the [[Shin Meiwa US-1A|Shin Meiwa PS-1]] and [[ShinMaywa US-2]] flying boats, and the [[Kawasaki P-1]] Maritime Patrol Aircraft.\n\nThe main threat to NATO maritime supremacy throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s was [[Soviet Navy]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] submarines. These were countered by the NATO fleets, the NATO patrol planes mentioned above, and by sophisticated underwater listening systems. These span the so-called \"GIUK Gap\" of the North Atlantic that extends from Greenland to Iceland, to the [[Faroe Islands]], to Scotland in the [[United Kingdom]]. Air bases for NATO patrol planes have also been located in these areas: U.S. Navy and Canadian aircraft based in Greenland, Iceland, and Newfoundland; British aircraft based in Scotland and [[Northern Ireland]]; and Norwegian, Dutch, and German aircraft based in their home countries.\n\nSince the end of the [[Cold War]] the threat of a large-scale submarine attack is a remote one, and many of the air forces and navies have been downsizing their fleets of patrol planes. Those still in service are still used for search-and-rescue, counter-smuggling, anti[[piracy]], antipoaching of marine life, the enforcement of the [[exclusive economic zone]]s, and enforcement of the [[laws of the sea]]s.\n\n==Armament and countermeasures==\n[[File:PBY dropping depth charge.jpg|thumb|Pre-World War II [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] dropping a depth charge]]\n{{see also|RAF Coastal Command during World War II#Pre-war equipment}}\nThe earliest patrol aircraft carried bombs and machine guns. Between the wars the British experimented with equipping their patrol aircraft with the [[COW 37 mm gun]]. During World War II, [[depth charge]]s that could be set to detonate at specific depths, and later when in proximity with large metal objects replaced \"anti-submarine\" bombs that detonated on contact.\n\nPatrol aircraft also carried defensive armament which was necessary when patrolling areas close to enemy territory such as Allied operations in the [[Bay of Biscay]] targeting [[U-boats]] starting out from their base.\n\nAs a result of Allied successes with patrol aircraft against U-boats, the Germans introduced [[German Type VII submarine#U-flak|U-''flak'']] (submarines equipped with more antiaircraft weaponry) to escort U-boats out of base and encouraged commanders to remain on the surface and fire back at attacking craft rather than trying to escape by diving. The advantage was short lived as the submarine was defenceless if it tried to dive for long enough for the aircraft to make its attack, effectively preventing it from diving until a surface ship could arrive to destroy it. Equipping submarines with radar-warning devices and the [[submarine snorkel|snorkel]] made them harder to find.\n\nTo counter the German long-range patrol aircraft that targeted merchant convoys, the [[Royal Navy]] introduced the \"[[CAM ship]]\", which was a merchant vessel equipped with a lone [[fighter plane]] which could be launched once to engage the enemy planes.\n\nThen the small [[aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s of WW II became available to cover the deep oceans, and the land air bases in [[the Azores]] became available in mid-1943 from [[Portugal]].\n\n==Sensors==\n[[Image:P-3 Orion underside view 20080614.jpg|thumb|P-3 Orion clearly showing the [[Magnetic anomaly detector|MAD]] (tail boom) and sonobuoy chutes (array of dark spots under rear fuselage) while the [[Infrared|IR sensor]] is retracted and not visible.]]\nMaritime patrol aircraft are typically fitted with a wide range of sensors:<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/asw3.htm Global Security.com - ASW Sensors] accessdate:March 2014</ref>\n* [[Radar]] to detect surface shipping movements.

The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to [[San Antonio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Greater [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Boston]] and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director [[Jack Swarbrick]] announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.<ref>{{cite

their current home uniforms]]\nNotre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. In recent years, neither jersey included the player's name on the back, but names were included during the Dan Devine and Gerry Faust eras. However, for the Irish's [[Hawaii Bowl|Hawai'i Bowl]] appearance in 2008 vs. the [[Hawaii Warriors football|University of Hawai'i]], Notre Dame once again wore last names on their jerseys. Gold pants, with a small ND logo just below the left waist, are worn with both home and away jerseys.\n[[File:Maillots ND d\u00e9placement.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Former quarterback Brady Quinn in the current away uniform]]\nNotre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome.\"  Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc.\n\nOver the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season \u2013 or more \u2013 at a time. Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for \"special\" occasions. Often on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game, and in the loss to [[Nile Kinnick]]-led [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the Green jerseys as a reward to his senior players, as well finally ending the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061107aab.html|title=Notre Dame Football Team to Wear Throwback Uniforms Against USC|work=cstv.com|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey: a white jersey with green numbers. Champion supplied football jerseys for The University of Notre Dame for over 50 years until they switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame Athletic department will begin wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour.\n[[File:Tyler Eifert.jpg|thumb|110px|Former tight end Tyler Eifert.]]\nDuring Gerry Faust's tenure (1981\u201385), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The navy blue jerseys returned in 1984.\n\nNo uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card which lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by [[Ralph Guglielmi]], [[George Izo]], [[Daryle Lamonica]], [[Coley O'Brien]], [[Joe Montana]], Michael Floyd, [[Rick Mirer]] and [[Ron Powlus]], among others.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\">{{cite web| url=http://www.und.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/FBRecSuppAll-TimeRoster |title=ND Archives: All-Time Roster |publisher=und.cstv.com |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}</ref> Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen ([[Elmer Layden]]) a Heisman Trophy Winner ([[Paul Hornung]]) and a National Title winning Quarterback ([[Terry Hanratty]]).<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/> Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/>\n\nIn 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For the Shamrock Series games Notre Dame and their outfitters have announced that the school will wear specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Notre Dame Stadium===\n[[File:Notredamestadiumgamedayband.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Notre Dame Stadium on game day, with student section and band]]\n{{main| Notre Dame Stadium}}\n\nNotre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a [[seating capacity]] of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.<ref name=\"capacity\" /> The ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranks Notre Dame Stadium as # 2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".<ref name=\"Sporting News Cathedrals\">{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/Default.asp?cp1=1|title=Sporting News College Football Cathedrals|work=MSNBC|accessdate=January 30, 2007 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010912195116/http://msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/default.asp?cp1=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 12, 2001}}</ref> and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400&nbsp;million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season.\n\n===Cartier Field===\n{{main| Cartier Field}}\nCartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Notre Dame's practice facility still bears the Cartier Field name. Most ND practices take place on Cartier Field.\n\n===Guglielmino Athletics Complex===\nKnown by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family.\n\n===Irish Athletic Center===\nThe indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and avideo board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak.\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{main|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries}}\n\n[[File:Jeweledshillelagh.jpg|thumb|250px|The First [[Jeweled Shillelagh]], awarded to the winner of the annual USC vs. Notre Dame game.]]\nNotre Dame has rivalries with several universities.

Some of these are:\n* The tradition of having 23.9 karat gold in the helmet paint continues, with the painting process provided by Hydro Graphics, Inc. and no longer by student managers. The gold particles that are used on the helmet were collected from the re-gilding on the Notre Dame dome in 2007.  During the 2011 season, however, a new helmet paint scheme was introduced; while retaining the basic gold helmet and grey facemask look, the \"new\" gold is much more reflective than the \"old\"; there have already been several variations of this new \"gold chrome\" look, including \"brick\" and \"fish-scale\" texturing.<ref name=\"50 yrs of CFB\" />\n*Formerly, prior to the start of the game, the team attended mass in semi-formal attire at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana|Sacred Heart Basilica]].

The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to [[San Antonio]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Greater [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Chicago]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Boston]] and the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex.\n\nPrior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director [[Jack Swarbrick]] announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.<ref>{{cite

their current home uniforms]]\nNotre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. In recent years, neither jersey included the player's name on the back, but names were included during the Dan Devine and Gerry Faust eras. However, for the Irish's [[Hawaii Bowl|Hawai'i Bowl]] appearance in 2008 vs. the [[Hawaii Warriors football|University of Hawai'i]], Notre Dame once again wore last names on their jerseys. Gold pants, with a small ND logo just below the left waist, are worn with both home and away jerseys.\n[[File:Maillots ND d\u00e9placement.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Former quarterback Brady Quinn in the current away uniform]]\nNotre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome.\"  Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc.\n\nOver the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season \u2013 or more \u2013 at a time. Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for \"special\" occasions. Often on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game, and in the loss to [[Nile Kinnick]]-led [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the Green jerseys as a reward to his senior players, as well finally ending the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/061107aab.html|title=Notre Dame Football Team to Wear Throwback Uniforms Against USC|work=cstv.com|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}</ref> On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey: a white jersey with green numbers. Champion supplied football jerseys for The University of Notre Dame for over 50 years until they switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the University of Notre Dame Athletic department will begin wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour.\n[[File:Tyler Eifert.jpg|thumb|110px|Former tight end Tyler Eifert.]]\nDuring Gerry Faust's tenure (1981\u201385), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves. The navy blue jerseys returned in 1984.\n\nNo uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card which lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by [[Ralph Guglielmi]], [[George Izo]], [[Daryle Lamonica]], [[Coley O'Brien]], [[Joe Montana]], Michael Floyd, [[Rick Mirer]] and [[Ron Powlus]], among others.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\">{{cite web| url=http://www.und.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/nd/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/FBRecSuppAll-TimeRoster |title=ND Archives: All-Time Roster |publisher=und.cstv.com |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}</ref> Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen ([[Elmer Layden]]) a Heisman Trophy Winner ([[Paul Hornung]]) and a National Title winning Quarterback ([[Terry Hanratty]]).<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/> Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.<ref name=\"ND All-Time Roster\"/>\n\nIn 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For the Shamrock Series games Notre Dame and their outfitters have announced that the school will wear specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Notre Dame Stadium===\n[[File:Notredamestadiumgamedayband.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Notre Dame Stadium on game day, with student section and band]]\n{{main| Notre Dame Stadium}}\n\nNotre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a [[seating capacity]] of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.<ref name=\"capacity\" /> The ''[[Sporting News]]'' ranks Notre Dame Stadium as # 2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".<ref name=\"Sporting News Cathedrals\">{{cite web|url=https://www.msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/Default.asp?cp1=1|title=Sporting News College Football Cathedrals|work=MSNBC|accessdate=January 30, 2007 |archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20010912195116/http://msnbc.com/modules/sports/collegefootballstadiums/default.asp?cp1=1 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 12, 2001}}</ref> and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400&nbsp;million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season.\n\n===Cartier Field===\n{{main| Cartier Field}}\nCartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Notre Dame's practice facility still bears the Cartier Field name. Most ND practices take place on Cartier Field.\n\n===Guglielmino Athletics Complex===\nKnown by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family.\n\n===Irish Athletic Center===\nThe indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and avideo board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak.\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{main|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football rivalries}}\n\n[[File:Jeweledshillelagh.jpg|thumb|250px|The First [[Jeweled Shillelagh]], awarded to the winner of the annual USC vs. Notre Dame game.]]\nNotre Dame has rivalries with several universities.

Some of these are:\n* The tradition of having 23.9 karat gold in the helmet paint continues, with the painting process provided by Hydro Graphics, Inc. and no longer by student managers. The gold particles that are used on the helmet were collected from the re-gilding on the Notre Dame dome in 2007.  During the 2011 season, however, a new helmet paint scheme was introduced; while retaining the basic gold helmet and grey facemask look, the \"new\" gold is much more reflective than the \"old\"; there have already been several variations of this new \"gold chrome\" look, including \"brick\" and \"fish-scale\" texturing.<ref name=\"50 yrs of CFB\" />\n*Formerly, prior to the start of the game, the team attended mass in semi-formal attire at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Indiana|Sacred Heart Basilica]].

Only adult males have the distinctive small, rusty-brown throat patch, which gives the species its common name and the absence of which makes the identification of females and juveniles more difficult. The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark brownish-grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail has prominent white patches on the tips of the outer feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body.

The upper part of the head, body, wings, and tail are a dark brownish-grey, particularly dark on the rump and tail. While the underbody is predominantly whitish-grey, with a more whitish belly and pale buff colour blending into the flanks and undertail-coverts. The tail has prominent white patches on the tips of the outer feathers, which can be seen during flight and with the tail folded. Fine off-white scalloping is visible on the forehead, with off-white eye rings and lores merging into the lighter underparts of the body. It may be confused with some [[Acanthiza|thornbill]] species, which are more compact with a shorter tail than the redthroat.
