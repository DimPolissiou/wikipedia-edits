Philip Gooderson, author of ''The Gangs of Birmingham'', states that the Peaky Blinders originated as a specific gang, but the term later became a generic label. An earlier gang known as the Cheapside Sloggers had evolved in the 1870s, and the term \"Sloggers\" (meaning fighters) had already become a generic local label for street gangs when the Peaky Blinders emerged at the end of the century in Adderley Street, in the Bordesley and Small Heath areas, which was an extremely deprived slum section of Birmingham at the time. The Peaky Blinders were distinguished by their sartorial style, unlike earlier gangs. Notable members included David Taylor (imprisoned for carrying a gun at 13 years old), \"baby-faced\" Harry Fowles, Ernest Haynes and Stephen McNickle.<ref name=\"Peak\">{{cite news|author=Larner, Tony|title=When Peaky Blinders Ruled Streets with Fear|work=Sunday Mercury|date= 1 August 2010|page= 14}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 20th century, one of the Birmingham gangs known as the [[Brummagem Boys]] (Brummagem being slang for Birmingham) began to spread their criminal network from the streets of Birmingham to around the country. Helped by greatly improved transport, for the first time, regional gangs were able to expand beyond the streets that bred them. The new connecting railway between Birmingham and London meant they could target the racecourse riches of the country's capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/birmingham-gangs|title=Birmingham Gangs|date=13 February 2014|work=crimeandinvestigation.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[1985 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]] in 1985, young people banded together in groups which soon turned to petty crime and robbery.

This began a violent feud between the Johnsons and the Burger Bar Boys, which was resolved in a truce instigated by Matthias \"Shabba\" Thompson in 2010, with assistance from documentary maker Penny Woolcock.

Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. Since its emergence as a major city, it had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] respectively, although they are also referred to as '[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]' and '[[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]]'.<ref name=\"Sutton Index of Deaths\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2007-09-10 | date=11 April 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent example of this is known as [[the Troubles]] - a civil conflict that raged from c.1969 to the late 1990s. Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups forming on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The [[Provisional IRA]] detonated twenty-two bombs, all in a confined area in the city centre in 1972, on what is known as \"[[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]]\", killing nine people.<ref name=\"Sutton Index of Deaths\"/>\n\nThe IRA also killed hundreds of other civilians and members of the security forces. Loyalist paramilitaries the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation to the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|PIRA campaign]]. Most of their victims were Roman Catholic civilians unconnected to the Provisional IRA. A particularly notorious group, based on the [[Shankill Road]] in the mid 1970s became known as the [[Shankill Butchers]]. In all, over one thousand five hundred people were killed in political violence in the city from 1969 until 2001.<ref name=\"Sutton Index of Deaths\"/> Part of the legacy of [[the Troubles]] is that both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups in Belfast have become involved in organised crime and [[racket (crime)|racketeering]].\n\n==Debate surrounding the impact of gangs==\n\nHistorically, societal fears of gangs have centered around frameworks which argue that effects like increased mass production, consumption, democracy, and communication lead to the rise of organized crime groups.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|last=Humphries|first=Stephen|title=Hooligans or Rebels?

His analysis of interviews with former gang members led him to the idea that gangs allowed working-class youths to feel rebellious and also express a need to resist the monotonous nature of industrial towns.<ref name=\":6\" />\u00a0 Building on this idea, Andrew Davies argues that the concept of masculinity among working-class men prompted this behavior, and was a way for members to prove themselves to their peers.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Andrew|date=Winter 1998|title=Youth Gangs, Masculinity and Violence in Late Victorian Manchester and Salford|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789665?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=32|pages=350-354|via=}}</ref>  He connects acts of violence committed in the household to idealized criminals in popular culture at the time that would have  contributed to the working-class idea of masculinity.<ref name=\":12\" /> However, in other works he notes how many women took part in organized crimes, thus proving that this idea was not the only motive of gang crime.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Runnymede Trust]] suggested that despite the well-rehearsed public discourse around modern youth gangs and 'gang culture':\n\n''We actually know very little about 'gangs' in the UK: about how 'a gang' might be defined or understood, about what being in 'a gang' means... We know still less about how 'the gang' links to levels of youth violence.''<ref name=Runnymede>{{cite web|last=Runnymede Trust|title=(Re)thinking Gangs|url=http://www.runnymedetrust.org/uploads/publications/pdfs/RethinkingGangs-2008.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nProfessor [[Simon Hallsworth]] argues that where they exist, gangs in the UK are 'far more fluid, volatile and amorphous than the myth of the organized group with a corporate structure'.<ref name=Cottrell-Boyce />  This assertion is supported by a field study conducted by [[Manchester University]], which found that, 'most within- and between-gang disputes... emanated from interpersonal disputes regarding friends, family and romantic relationships', as opposed to territorial rivalries, and that criminal enterprises were 'rarely gang-coordinated... most involved gang members operating as individuals or in small groups.'<ref name=Cottrell-Boyce />\n\nCottrell-Boyce, writing in the Youth Justice journal, argues that gangs have been constructed as a 'suitable enemy' by politicians and the media, obscuring the wider, structural roots of youth violence. At the level of enforcement, a focus on gang membership may be counterproductive; creating confusion and resulting in a drag-net approach which can criminalise innocent young people rather than focusing resources on serious violent crime.<ref name=Cottrell-Boyce />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[British firms (organised crime)]]\n* [[Crime in the United Kingdom]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Europe topic|Gangs in}}\n{{Organized crime groups in Europe}}\n{{Gangs}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gangs In The United Kingdom}}\n[[Category:Gangs in the United Kingdom|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n\nGang-related [[organised crime]] in the United Kingdom is concentrated around the cities of [[London]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] and regionally across the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands region]], south coast and northern England, according to the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soca.gov.uk/assessPublications/downloads/SeriousOrganisedCrimeReview.pdf|title=National Crime Agency - Home|work=soca.gov.uk|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> With regards to [[street gangs]] the cities identified as having the most serious gang problems, which also accounted for 65% of firearm homicides in England and Wales, were London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]].<ref>[http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Speeches/Pages/TacklingGangsActionPlan.aspx Tackling Gangs Action Plan Press Release | Attorney General] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725150545/http://www.attorneygeneral.gov.uk/NewsCentre/Speeches/Pages/TacklingGangsActionPlan.aspx |date=2011-07-25 }}</ref> [[Glasgow]] in [[Scotland]] also has a historical gang culture with the city having as many teenage gangs as London, which had six times the population, in 2008.<ref name=sixtimes>{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/teenage-gang-plague-six-times-worse-in-glasgow-than-london-1-1076853|title=Teenage gang plague 'six times worse in Glasgow than London'|date=4 February 2008|work=scotsman.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, the cities of [[Leeds]], [[Bristol]], [[Bradford]] (including [[Keighley]]) and [[Nottingham]] all commanded headlines pertaining to street gangs and suffered their share of high-profile firearms murders.

Philip Gooderson, author of ''The Gangs of Birmingham'', states that the Peaky Blinders originated as a specific gang, but the term later became a generic label. An earlier gang known as the Cheapside Sloggers had evolved in the 1870s, and the term \"Sloggers\" (meaning fighters) had already become a generic local label for street gangs when the Peaky Blinders emerged at the end of the century in Adderley Street, in the Bordesley and Small Heath areas, which was an extremely deprived slum section of Birmingham at the time. The Peaky Blinders were distinguished by their sartorial style, unlike earlier gangs. Notable members included David Taylor (imprisoned for carrying a gun at 13 years old), \"baby-faced\" Harry Fowles, Ernest Haynes and Stephen McNickle.<ref name=\"Peak\">{{cite news|author=Larner, Tony|title=When Peaky Blinders Ruled Streets with Fear|work=Sunday Mercury|date= 1 August 2010|page= 14}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 20th century, one of the Birmingham gangs known as the [[Brummagem Boys]] (Brummagem being slang for Birmingham) began to spread their criminal network from the streets of Birmingham to around the country. Helped by greatly improved transport, for the first time, regional gangs were able to expand beyond the streets that bred them. The new connecting railway between Birmingham and London meant they could target the racecourse riches of the country's capital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandinvestigation.co.uk/crime-files/birmingham-gangs|title=Birmingham Gangs|date=13 February 2014|work=crimeandinvestigation.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[1985 Handsworth riots|Handsworth riots]] in 1985, young people banded together in groups which soon turned to petty crime and robbery. By the late 1980s, the Johnson Crew, named after their Johnsons Caf\u00e9 hang-out, controlled the drugs market and nightclub security across a large area of Birmingham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/348421/Britain-s-most-infamous-gangs-The-families-that-ruled-the-UK-s-underworld|title=Britain's most infamous gangs: The 'families' that ruled the UK's underworld|date=1 November 2013|work=dailystar.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter a fall-out between members of the Johnson Crew, the Burger Bar Boys formed, taking their name from a Soho Road fast-food joint. This began a violent feud between the Johnsons and the Burger Bar Boys, which was resolved in a truce instigated by Matthias \"Shabba\" Thompson in 2010, with assistance from documentary maker Penny Woolcock. The process of forming the truce was captured in the Channel 4 documentary, One Mile Away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/one-mile-away/on-demand/52750-001|title=One Mile Away - All 4|work=channel4.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2206354/|title=One Mile Away|date=29 March 2013|accessdate=26 September 2016|via=IMDb}}</ref> Following the truce, violent crime fell by 50% in the B6 postcode area and 30% in B21.\n\nThe increasingly collaborative relationship between the two gangs has led to some in the media describing them as more akin to a 'super gang', seeking to establish a greater national network of organised crime rather than controlling their post-code areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-street-gangs-plan-crime-8318025|title=Birmingham street gangs 'uniting with other cities to form supergangs'|first=Amardeep|last=Bassey|date=21 December 2014|work=birminghammail.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref> Other reports suggest both gangs are effectively inactive, and there is no 'super gang'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/there-is-no-super-gang-in-birmingham-930|title=Investigating Birmingham's 'Super Gang' - VICE - United Kingdom|date=21 January 2015|work=vice.com|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, 20 shootings in mid 2015 onwards were linked to the feud between the Burger Bar Boys and the Johnson Crew, suggesting any truce is no longer active and the gang rivalry has been renewed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/burger-bar-boys-johnson-crew-10825757|title=Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew behind up to 20 Birmingham shootings|first=Nick|last=McCarthy|date=2 February 2016|work=birminghammail.co.uk|accessdate=26 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nSee also:\n\n* [[Peaky Blinders]]\n* [[Birmingham Boys]]\n* [[Murder of Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis]]\n\n===Glasgow===\nThe history of [[Glasgow]] gangs can be traced back to the 18th century, although the first media reference to Glasgow gangs was not until the 1870s, with the acknowledgement of the [[Penny Mobs]].

Belfast has been the capital of Northern Ireland since its establishment in 1921 following the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. Since its emergence as a major city, it had been the scene of various episodes of sectarian conflict between its [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. These opposing groups in this conflict are now often termed [[Irish republicanism|republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] respectively, although they are also referred to as '[[Irish nationalism|nationalist]]' and '[[Unionism (Ireland)|unionist]]'.<ref name=\"Sutton Index of Deaths\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/1269206.stm |title=Sutton Index of Deaths |publisher=CAIN |accessdate=2007-09-10 | date=11 April 2001}}</ref>\n\nThe most recent example of this is known as [[the Troubles]] - a civil conflict that raged from c.1969 to the late 1990s. Belfast saw some of the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, particularly in the 1970s, with rival paramilitary groups forming on both sides. Bombing, assassination and street violence formed a backdrop to life throughout the Troubles. The [[Provisional IRA]] detonated twenty-two bombs, all in a confined area in the city centre in 1972, on what is known as \"[[Bloody Friday (1972)|Bloody Friday]]\", killing nine people.<ref name=\"Sutton Index of Deaths\"/>\n\nThe IRA also killed hundreds of other civilians and members of the security forces. Loyalist paramilitaries the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) and [[Ulster Defence Association]] (UDA) claimed that the killings they carried out were in retaliation to the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969-1997|PIRA campaign]]. Most of their victims were Roman Catholic civilians unconnected to the Provisional IRA. A particularly notorious group, based on the [[Shankill Road]] in the mid 1970s became known as the [[Shankill Butchers]]. In all, over one thousand five hundred people were killed in political violence in the city from 1969 until 2001.<ref name=\"Sutton Index of Deaths\"/> Part of the legacy of [[the Troubles]] is that both republican and loyalist paramilitary groups in Belfast have become involved in organised crime and [[racket (crime)|racketeering]].\n\n==Debate surrounding the impact of gangs==\n\nHistorically, societal fears of gangs have centered around frameworks which argue that effects like increased mass production, consumption, democracy, and communication lead to the rise of organized crime groups.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite book|last=Humphries|first=Stephen|title=Hooligans or Rebels?

His analysis of interviews with former gang members led him to the idea that gangs allowed working-class youths to feel rebellious and also express a need to resist the monotonous nature of industrial towns.<ref name=\":6\" />\u00a0 Building on this idea, Andrew Davies argues that the concept of masculinity among working-class men prompted this behavior, and was a way for members to prove themselves to their peers.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Andrew|date=Winter 1998|title=Youth Gangs, Masculinity and Violence in Late Victorian Manchester and Salford|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3789665?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Journal of Social History|volume=32|pages=350-354|via=}}</ref>  He connects acts of violence committed in the household to idealized criminals in popular culture at the time that would have  contributed to the working-class idea of masculinity.<ref name=\":12\" /> However, in other works he notes how many women took part in organized crimes, thus proving that this idea was not the only motive of gang crime.\n\nIn 2014, the [[Runnymede Trust]] suggested that despite the well-rehearsed public discourse around modern youth gangs and 'gang culture':\n\n''We actually know very little about 'gangs' in the UK: about how 'a gang' might be defined or understood, about what being in 'a gang' means...

Introduced for national distribution as the '''Broadcaster''' in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation.<ref>Duchossoir, A. R. (1991). ''The Fender Telecaster: The Detailed Story of America's Senior Solid Body Electric Guitar''. Milwaukee: [[Hal Leonard Publishing Co]]. {{ISBN|0-7935-0860-6}}.</ref>\n\nJust like the [[Fender Stratocaster]], the Telecaster is also a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, blues, jazz, punk, metal, alternative, indie, and R&B.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Fender Telecaster was developed by [[Leo Fender]] in [[Fullerton, California]] in 1950. In the period roughly between 1932 and 1949, several craftsmen and companies experimented with solid-body electric guitars, but none had made a significant impact on the market. Leo Fender's Telecaster was the design that made bolt-on neck, solid body guitars viable in the marketplace.\n\n[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] had an electronics repair shop called Fender's Radio Service where he first repaired, then designed, [[amplifier]]s and electromagnetic pickups for musicians \u2014 chiefly players of electric [[semi-acoustic guitar]]s, electric Hawaiian [[lap steel guitar]]s, and [[mandolin]]s. Players had been \"wiring up\" their instruments in search of greater volume and projection since the late 1920s, and electric semi-acoustics (such as the [[Gibson ES-150]]) had long been widely available. Tone had never, until then, been the primary reason for a guitarist to go electric, but in 1943, when Fender and his partner,\n[[Doc Kauffman|Clayton Orr \"Doc\" Kauffman]], built a crude wooden guitar as a pickup test rig, local country players started asking to borrow it for gigs. It sounded bright and sustaining. Fender was intrigued, and in 1949, when it was long understood that solid construction offered great advantages in electric instruments, but before any commercial solid-body Spanish guitars had caught on (the then-small [[Voxx International|Audiovox]] company apparently offered a modern, solid-body electric guitar as early as the mid-1930s), he built a better prototype.\n\nThat hand-built prototype, an unbranded white guitar with no model name, had most of the features of what would become the Telecaster. It was designed in the spirit of the solid-body Hawaiian guitars manufactured by [[Rickenbacker]]&nbsp;\u2014 small, simple units made of [[Bakelite]] and aluminum with the parts bolted together&nbsp;\u2014 but with wooden construction. (Rickenbacker, then spelled \"Rickenbacher\", also offered a solid Bakelite-bodied electric Spanish guitar in 1935 that seemed to presage details of Fender's design.)\n\n{{multiple image\n|header = Telecaster evolution\n|align = left\n|total_width = 450\n|image1 = Fender Esquire 1st prototype in 1949 at Fender Guitar Factory museum.jpg\n|caption1 = 1st prototype (1949)\n|image2 = Fender Broadcaster (1950), Museum of Making Music.jpg\n|caption2 = Broadcaster (1950)\n|image3 = Fender_Nocaster_(1951),_Museum_of_Making_Music_(clip).jpg\n|caption3 = \"Nocaster\" (1951)\n|image4 = Fender '51 Precision Bass, FGF museum.jpg\n|caption4 = Precision Bass (1951, replica)\n|image5 = Fender_Telecaster_American_Vintage_1952_transparent.png\n|caption5 = Telecaster replica (1952)\n|image6 = 1954 Fender Esquire ($27,000), Vintage Guitar show, SXSW2009 (clip).jpg\n|caption6 = Esquire (1954)\n|footer = \n}}\n\nThe initial single-pickup production model appeared in 1950, and was called the [[Fender Esquire]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |title=The Fender Story |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=978-0-87930-897-1 |pages=15}}</ref> Ash and maple were used to construct the body and neck respectively and the guitar came in one color entitled, blond.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=60 Years of Fender ( Six decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars)|last=Bacon|first=Tony|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0-87930-966-4|location=London, England|pages=}}</ref> Fewer than fifty guitars were originally produced under that name, and most were replaced under warranty because of early manufacturing problems. In particular, the Esquire necks had no [[truss rod]] and many were replaced due to bent necks. Later in 1950, this single-pickup model was discontinued, and a two-pickup model was renamed the Broadcaster. From this point onward all Fender necks incorporated truss rods. The Esquire was reintroduced in 1951 as a single pickup Telecaster, at a lower price.<ref>[[Fender Esquire]]</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe so-called \"Nocaster\" was a short-lived variant of Telecaster. Produced in early to mid-1951, it was the result of legal action from the [[Gretsch]] company over the guitar's previous name, the ''Broadcaster'' (Gretsch already had the \"Broadkaster\" name registered for a line of drums). In the interim, before [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] had come up with an alternate name and printed appropriately revised [[headstock]] decals, factory workers simply snipped the \"Broadcaster\" name from its existing stock of decals, so guitars with these decals are identified simply as \"Fender\", without any model name. By the summer of 1951 the guitar was officially renamed as the ''Telecaster'' and has been known as such ever since.\n\nThe term ''Nocaster'' was coined by collectors to denote these transitional guitars that appeared without a model name on the headstock. Since they were manufactured in this form for only a few months very early in the Broadcaster/Telecaster's history, original Nocasters are highly prized and expensive collector's items. There are no official production numbers, but experts estimate that fewer than 500 Nocasters were produced. Fender has since registered ''Nocaster'' as a [[trademark]] to denote its modern replicas of this famous rarity.\n\nIn 1951, Fender released the innovative and musically influential [[Fender Precision Bass|Precision Bass]] as a similar looking stable-mate to the Telecaster. This body style was later released as the [[Fender Telecaster Bass]] in 1968 after the Precision Bass had been changed in 1957 to make it more closely resemble the [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar. This double cut away style was the shape that influenced how the Stratocaster was created.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the time Leo Fender began marketing the new  more refined Stratocaster in 1954, he expected it to replace the Telecaster, but the Telecaster's many virtues and unique musical personality have kept it in demand to the present day.\n\n==Construction==\nLeo Fender's simple and modular design was geared to mass production and made servicing broken guitars easier. Guitars were not constructed individually, as in traditional [[luthiery]]. Rather, components were produced quickly and inexpensively in quantity and assembled into a guitar on an assembly line. The bodies were [[bandsaw]]n and [[router (woodworking)|routed]] from slabs, rather than hand-carved individually, as with other guitars made at the time, such as [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibsons]]. Fender did not use the traditional [[set-in neck|glued-in neck]], but rather a \"bolt-on\" neck (which is actually attached using screws, not bolts). This not only made production easier, but allowed the neck to be quickly removed and serviced, or replaced entirely. In addition, the classic Telecaster neck was fashioned from a single piece of [[maple]] ''without'' a separate fingerboard, and the frets were slid directly into the side of the maple surface. The very design of the headstock (inspired by Croatian instruments, according to Leo Fender) followed that simplicity principle : it's very narrow, since it was cut in a single piece of wood (without glued \"wings\"): nonetheless, that headstock is very effective, as the six strings are kept straight behind the nut, keeping the guitar easily in tune.  While this has changed over time with new reincarnations of the guitar,<ref name=\":0\" /> this was a highly unorthodox approach in its day as guitars traditionally featured [[rosewood]] or [[ebony]] fingerboards glued onto [[mahogany]] necks. The electronics were easily accessed for repair or replacement through a removable control plate, a great advantage over the construction of the then-predominant hollow-body instruments, in which the electronics could be accessed only through the soundholes.\n\nIn its classic form, the guitar is simply constructed, with the neck and fingerboard comprising a single piece of maple, screwed to an [[fraxinus|ash]] or [[alder]] body inexpensively jigged with flat surfaces on the front and back. The hardware includes two [[single coil]] [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] controlled by a three-way selector switch, and one each of volume and tone controls. The pickguard was first [[Bakelite]], soon thereafter it was [[celluloid]] (later other plastics), screwed directly onto the body with five (later eight) screws. The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] has three adjustable saddles, with strings doubled up on each. In its original design nearly all components are secured using only screws (body, neck, tuners, bridge, scratchplate, pickups to body, control plate, output socket), with glue used to secure the nut and solder used to connect the electronic components. With the introduction of the truss rod, and later a rosewood fingerboard, more gluing was required during construction. The guitar quickly gained a following, and soon other, more established guitar companies (such as Gibson, whose [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] model was introduced in 1952, and later Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and others) began working on wooden solid-body production models of their own.\n\n[[File:Guitarra2.jpg|thumb|150px|A Telecaster in \"Paisley Red\" (originally released during 1968\u201369)<ref>[https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/1968_69_Paisley_Red_Blue_Flower_Fender_Telecasters 1968 - 69 Paisley Red & Blue Flower Fender Telecasters] by\nDave Rogers, Laun Braithwaite, and Tim Mullally on Premier Guitar website</ref>]]\nThe Telecaster has always had a three-position selector switch to allow for different pickup configurations, as well as two knobs for controlling volume and tone.  However, different eras had different functions for these controls.  The original switch and knob configuration was used from 1950 to 1952. The first position (switch towards neck) activated the neck pickup with treble tone cut, which produced a muffled, bass-heavy tone (sometimes called the \"dark circuit\").  The middle position selected the neck pickup without the treble cut, giving it a fuller sound, and in the third position had both pickups together and activated the tone knob.  On these models, the tone knob acted as a blending knob, with the \"0\" position using only the bridge pickup, blending to a 50/50 neck/bridge mix in the \"10\" position. The first knob functioned normally as a master volume control.<ref name=\"Duchossoir, 1991, 15\">Duchossoir, 1991, 15</ref>\n\nIn late 1952, Fender made several changes to the circuitry of the guitar.  First, a true tone control knob was installed, that could be used to alter the tone from bass-heavy (in the 0 position) to treble-heavy (in the 10 position). The first position stayed the same as before, with the neck pickup in \"dark circuit\" treble-cut mode.  In this position, the tone knob was disabled.  The middle position turned off the dark circuit, and turned on the tone control knob for the neck pickup.  The third position selected the bridge pick-up alone, again with an active tone control knob.  Although this provided the player with a proper tone control, the change also made it impossible to blend the signal from both pickups.  In late 1967 Fender again modified the circuit.  They removed the \"dark circuit\" from the first position, and installed what has become the standard twin pickup switching system: neck pickup alone with tone control in the first position, both pickups together with the tone control in the middle position and in the third position the bridge pickup alone with the tone control.<ref name=\"Duchossoir, 1991, 15\"/>\n\nTypical modern Telecasters (such as the American Standard version) incorporate several details different from the classic form. They typically feature 22 frets (rather than 21) and truss rod adjustments are made at the [[headstock]] end, or the body end depending on the model (typically at the head-stock in newer models). The body end requires removal of the neck<ref name=\":0\" /> (the [[Fender Custom Shop|Custom Shop]] Bajo Sexto Baritone Tele was the only Telecaster featuring a two-octave 24-fret neck). The three-saddle bridge of the original has been replaced with a six-saddle version, allowing independent length and height adjustment for each string. The long saddle bridge screws allow a wide range of saddle bridge positions for intonation tuning. The stamped metal bridge plate has been replaced with a flat plate, and the removable chromed bridge cover (often called the \"ashtray\" for its secondary use) has been discontinued for most models; it improved [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]]\nbut prevented players from muting strings at the bridge and made it impossible to pick near the saddles to produce the characteristic Telecaster 'twang'.\n\nDuring the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation#Sale to CBS|CBS era]] in the 1970s, the Telecaster body style was changed to a new \"notchless\" shape, having a less pronounced notch in the crook where the upper bout meets the neck. The notchless body style was discontinued in 1982.\n\nThe short-lived Elite Telecaster of 1983 incorporated two specially designed [[humbucker|humbucking]] pickups powered by an active circuitry that featured a \"TBX\" [[guitar expander]] and an MDX midrange booster with 12&nbsp;dB of gain. Other features included a \"Freeflyte\" hardtail bridge and die-cast tuning machines with pearloid buttons. This guitar was among the latest CBS-era Fenders to feature a BiFlex truss-rod system, low-friction EasyGlider string trees and active electronics. After CBS sold Fender to a group of employees led by Bill C. Schultz in 1985, production ceased on the Elite Telecaster and other Elite models. [[Fender Japan]] made its own version of the Elite Telecaster in late 1984, which featured a 22-fret neck with medium-jumbo fretwire and a modern 9.5 inch fingerboard radius. Notable Elite Telecaster players include [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Dave Davies]] of [[The Kinks]], [[Michael Houser]] with Widespread Panic, and [[Andy Summers]] of [[The Police]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==The Telecaster sound==\nThe Telecaster is known for its ability to produce both a bright, rich cutting tone (the typical Telecaster country twang) and a mellow, warm, bluesy jazz tone depending on the selected [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], respectively \"bridge\" pickup or \"neck\" pickup, and by adjusting the tone control. The bridge pickup has more windings than the neck pickup, hence producing higher output, which compensates for a lower amplitude of vibration of the strings at the bridge position. At the same time, a [[capacitor]] between the slider of the volume control and the output allows treble sounds to bleed through while damping mid and lower ranges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excellentleads.com/Telecaster.html|title=The Telecaster Sound|author=|date=|website=excellentleads.com}}</ref> Slanting the bridge pickup also increased the guitar's treble response. The [[solid body]] allows the guitar to deliver a clear and sustaining amplified version of the strings' sound; this was an improvement over previous electric guitar designs, whose resonant hollow bodies made them prone to unwanted acoustic feedback when volume was increased. These design elements intentionally allowed guitarists to emulate [[steel guitar]] sounds, as well as \"cut-through\" and be heard in roadhouse [[Honky-Tonk]] and big [[Western Swing]] bands, initially making this guitar particularly useful in country music. Since this, Fender has developed even more in the way of pickups and tones for the telecaster, with changes from Alnico III magnets to Alnico V magnets.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Six Decades of the Fender Telecaster|last=Bacon|first=Tony|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2005|isbn=0-87930-856-7|location=San Francisco|pages=}}</ref> Its wide range of tonalities allows the Telecaster to be used successfully for many styles of music including [[country music|country]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]].\n\n==Variants==\nThe Telecaster has long been a favorite guitar for \"hot-rod\" customizing. Several variants have appeared throughout the years with a wide assortment of pickup configurations, such as a [[humbucker]] in the neck position, three single-coil pickups, and even dual humbuckers with special wiring schemes. Fender offered factory hot-rodded Teles with such pickup configurations, the US Fat and [[Fender Nashville B-Bender Telecaster|Nashville B-Bender]] Telecasters around 1998. The Deluxe Blackout Tele was also equipped with three single-coil pickups, a \"Strat-o-Tele\" selector switch and a smaller headstock than a standard Telecaster. Some also preferred tremolos on their Telecasters, installing a Bigsby on them.<ref name=\":1\" /> The most common variants of the standard two-pickup solid body Telecaster are the semi-hollow ''Thinline'', the ''Custom,'' which replaced the neck single coil-pickup with a humbucking pickup, and the twin-humbucker ''Deluxe''. The ''Custom'' and ''Deluxe'' were introduced during the CBS period and reissues of both designs are currently offered.\n\n===Telecaster Thinline===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Thinline}}\n[[File:Fender 72 Telecaster Thinline (horizontal).png|130px|left]]\nDesigned by German luthier [[Roger Rossmeisl]], the Telecaster Thinline model first appeared in 1968/69. It is characterized by a body having a solid center core with hollow wings to reduce weight. The '69 version has two standard Telecaster [[single-coil pickup]]s, string-through-body bridge, and a choice of an ash or mahogany body. Later a '72 version was introduced based on the Fender Telecaster Deluxe with two [[Fender Wide Range]] [[humbucking pickup]]s. In 2011, Fender released the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline as a part of the Modern Player series. This guitar features two MP-90 pickups, similar to the Gibson [[P-90]] and a mahogany body. The Fender Custom Shop has produced a variation referred to as the \"50s Telecaster Thinline\" with an ash body, maple neck and a Twisted Tele neck pickup matched with a Nocaster bridge pickup.\n\n===Telecaster Custom===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Custom}}\n[[File:TeleCustom 76 horiz.jpg|130px|left]]\nThe first edition of the Telecaster Custom was produced between 1959-1968, and featured a double-bound body but otherwise-standard configuration. While the guitar was known as the Telecaster Custom, the decal on the headstock read \"Custom Telecaster\". Later editions of the Telecaster Custom were popularized by [[Rolling Stones]]' guitarist and composer [[Keith Richards]], featuring a [[Fender Wide Range]] humbucker in the neck position and a single-coil pickup in the bridge. To distinguish this model from the mid-1960s Custom with body binding, the market generally refers to the guitar as the \"1972 Custom\", indicating the year this model was released.\n\n===Telecaster Deluxe===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Deluxe}}\n[[File:Fender Telecaster Deluxe (clip) (horizontal).jpg|130px|left]]\nThis model includes two [[Fender Wide Range]] [[humbucker|humbucking pickups]] and was originally produced from 1972 to 1981 and has since then been reissued. The Telecaster Deluxe sported a large headstock similar to the [[Stratocaster]], maple neck and a contoured body, as well as a tremolo bridge option on models manufactured after 1973/74. This model also had 2 volume and 2 tone control knobs on the front of the guitar, rather than the usual 1 of each.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n===Telecaster Plus===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Plus}}\n[[File:Fender Telecaster Plus Deluxe.jpg|130px|left]]\nDesigned to restore Fender's reputation after a group of employees led by [[Bill Schultz (Fender)|William C. Schultz]] took over ownership from CBS in the early 1980s. The pickups used in early models were dual humbucking Red Lace Sensors in the bridge position and a single Blue Lace Sensor in the neck position. Later models (post-1995 or so) used three Gold Lace Sensors or a Red/Silver/Blue set in a Stratocaster-like configuration, as well as low-friction roller nuts, locking synchronized vibrato bridge and tuners, and a bound contoured alder body with ash veneers. These instruments were discontinued in 1998 with the advent of the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe]] series. In 2011 Fender released the entry level Modern Player Telecaster Plus as a part of the Modern Player series. The guitar has a humbucker in the bridge, a Stratocaster style single coil pickup in the middle, and a Telecaster covered neck pickup.\n\n===Tele Jr.===\n{{Main|Fender Tele Jr.}}\n[[File:Fender Tele Jr (horizontal).jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Fender Tele Jr. is a variant of the Telecaster that the [[Fender Custom Shop]] produced in a limited run of 100 units in the early 1990s. It uses a Telecaster body shape, scale length, and electronics controls (albeit, with a reversed control plate). However, many of its construction and electronic features\u2014for example its [[set-in neck]] and [[P-90]]-style pickups\u2014are similar to those of a [[Gibson Les Paul Junior]] and [[Gibson Les Paul Special]] electric guitars.\n\n===J5 Triple Tele Deluxe===\n{{Main|Fender J5 Telecaster}}\n[[File:Fender Telecaster John 5 signature (clip) (horizontal).jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Triple Tele Deluxe is [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] and [[Rob Zombie]] guitarist [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]]'s signature model. It is similar to the regular Telecaster Deluxe, in that it has 22 frets and a 3 way selector switch for the pickups,<ref name=\":1\" /> but it features three Fender \"Enforcer\" humbuckers and a chrome pickguard.{{Clear}}\n\n===Cabronita===\n{{Main|Fender Cabronita}}\n[[File:2012 Fender Telecaster Cabronita (Mexico).jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Cabronita (and Custom Shop variant '''La Cabronita''') is a model that is distinguished by the use of Fidelitron or the more expensive TV Jones Classic humbucking pickups, which look like the original [[Gretsch]] humbuckers. The ''La Cabronita'' is an American-made, custom-built-to-order instrument. It typically has one TV Jones Classic pickup in the bridge position although being custom built, in can be ordered in any configuration. All Cabronitas can be distinguished by use of a smaller pickguard that covers the lower horn only, similar to the pickguard used in the original prototype for the Telecaster in 1949.\n\nThe versions built in Mexico offered either a solid body or Thinline body, with both featuring two Fender Fidelitron pickups, a volume knob and pickup selector. They both have maple necks, 25.5\" scale, a 9.5 inch radius fretboard, \"Medium C\" profile and 1 5/8\" nut width, common to many standard Telecasters made in Mexico, although the Cabronita comes with 22 frets instead of the more common 21. For a brief period, Fender offered an American made \"Telebration Cabronita\" that used two of the TV Jones pickups.\n\nWhile \"Cabronita\" isn't a proper Spanish word, it roughly translates to English as \"little bastard\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicstate.com/amped/2013/09/16/fender-mexican-cabronita-telecaster-review/|title=Fender Cabronita Telecaster Mexico Review|author=|date=|website=sonicstate.com}}</ref> or \"little devil\".\n\n===Modern Player Telecaster===\n[[File:Fender Modern Player Telecaster Plus in Transparent Charcoal.jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Modern Player Telecaster is offered in two distinct styles: a ''Plus'' model and a ''Thinline'' model. The ''Plus'' utilizes a pine body, a standard Telecaster pickup in the neck position, a reverse wound single-coil [[Fender Stratocaster|strat]]-pickup in the middle position and a humbucker in the bridge position. It is equipped with [[coil splitting]] and a five way switch to provide seven different pickup combinations.\n\nThe Modern Player Thinline adopts a pickguard similar to the Deluxe models and a Stratocaster style bridge, without tremolo. It features a mahogany body, two [[P-90]] style single-coil pickups, individual volume and tone controls and the three-way pickup selector in the upper horn position.\n\nBoth use the standard 25.5\" scale on 22 fret maple necks that are unlike any other Telecasters in that they do not utilize an overhang to accomplish the 22nd fret, but instead use a longer, square ended neck that is not fully compatible with previous Fender parts.\n\n=== Tele Sub-Sonic ===\nThe sub-sonic Telecaster was first made in 2002 and is still produced. It is made in the USA and was produced as a custom guitar. It has a 22 fret maple neck with an extended scale size (27\"). It consists of a hum bucker in the neck pickup and a slanted single coil in the bridge position. There is a 3-way pickup selector switch and a volume and control knob as found on most telecasters.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Telecaster XII 12-String ===\nThis 12-string telecaster was produced from 1995 until 1998. It had 6 tuners per side of the headstock with the fender logo in-between. There were two options for the fretboard being maple, and rosewood; the necks were all maple. Pick-guards came in white or black and there was a 12 saddle bridge to accommodate the strings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== B Bender Telecaster ===\nThis Telecaster was produced from the year 1996 to the year 2000. The [[B-Bender]] device was used to change the B string's pitch to a C# at the press of a lever located on the guitar strap peg. The styles of music usually utilizing this device on their telecasters were country, and country-rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fender.com/articles/gear/pitch-perfect-a-history-of-the-b-bender|title=Pitch Perfect: A History of the B-Bender|last=Owens|first=Jeff|date=2018|website=Fender|access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nIn keeping with other models Fender distinguishes product lines manufactured in different locations.\n* The moderately-priced ''Standard'', ''Classic Player'', ''Blacktop'', ''Modern Player'' and ''Deluxe Telecaster'' models are manufactured in Mexico, Japan, China and Korea. Each of these instruments has a feature set that makes them more affordable.\n* The ''American Professional'', ''American Vintage'', ''American Elite'', ''Artist Series'', ''Custom Shop'', ''Acoustasonic'', and ''American Special'' model lines are manufactured in the United States.\n\nThe '''American Deluxe Telecaster''' (introduced in 1998; upgraded in 2004, 2008, and 2010) features a pair of Samarium Cobalt Noiseless pickups and the S-1 switching system. Models made prior to 2004 featured two Fender Vintage Noiseless Tele single-coils, Fender/Fishman Powerbridge piezo system and four-bolt neck fixing. Other refinements include a bound contoured alder or ash body and an abalone dot-inlaid maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, rolled fingerboard edges, and highly detailed nut and fret work. The HH model sported an ebony fingerboard, quilted or flamed maple top and a pair of Enforcer humbuckers with S-1 switching (discontinued as of 2008). As of March 23, 2010, Fender updated the American Deluxe Telecaster with a compound radius maple neck, N3 Noiseless Tele pickups and a reconfigured S-1 switching system for wider sonic possibilities. The new model now sports staggered, locking tuning machines, which provide a better break angle over the nut for increased sustain and improved tuning stability. The Thinline version has been introduced in 2013. Fender discontinued the American Deluxe series in 2016.\n\nThe '''American Series''' model used two single-coil pickups with DeltaTone system (featuring a high output bridge pickup and a reverse-wound neck pickup). Other features included a parchment pickguard, non-veneered alder or ash bodies and rolled fingerboard edges.\n\nIn 2003 Fender offered Telecasters with a humbucking/single coil pickup arrangement or two humbucking pickups featuring Enforcer humbucking pickups, and S-1 switching. These models were discontinued in 2007. As of 2008, all '''American Standard Telecasters''' came with a redesigned Tele bridge with vintage-style bent steel saddles, and a bridgeplate made of chromed brass instead of steel. In March 2012 the American Standard Telecaster was updated with Custom Shop pickups (Broadcaster in the bridge, Twisted in the neck); the body is now contoured for reduced weight and more comfort. In 2014 the American Standard Telecaster HH was introduced, sporting a pair of Twin Head Vintage humbucking pickups (open-coil with black bobbins in the bridge, metal-covered in the neck). Controls include a dual concentric volume pot for each pickup, a master tone and 3-way pickup switching.\n\nThe '''[[Fender Nashville B-Bender Telecaster|American Nashville B-Bender]]''' guitar is modeled after the personally customized instruments of some of Nashville's top players, featuring a Fender/Parsons/Green [[B-Bender#History|B-Bender system]], two American Tele single-coils (neck, bridge), a Texas Special Strat single-coil (middle) and five-way \"Strat-O-Tele\" pickup switching. Ideal for country bends and steel guitar glisses, this Tele is available only with a maple fingerboard.\n\nThe '''American Series Ash Telecaster''' is based on the '52 vintage reissue. It features an ash body, one-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 22 frets and two Modern Vintage Tele single-coil pickups. Fender discontinued this guitar in 2006.\n\nThe '''Custom Classic Telecaster''' was the Custom Shop version of the '''American Series Tele''', featuring a pair of Classic and Twisted single-coils in the bridge and neck positions, as well as a reverse control plate. Earlier versions made before 2003 featured an American Tele single-coil paired with two Texas Special Strat pickups and 5-way switching. Discontinued in 2009 and replaced by the '''Custom Deluxe Telecaster''' series models. The 2011 version of the Custom Shop \"Custom Deluxe\" Telecaster featured a lightweight Ash body with contoured heel, Birdseye maple neck, and a pickup set that included a Twisted Tele neck pickup and a Seymour Duncan Custom Shop BG-1400 stacked humbucker in the bridge position.\n\nThe '''Highway One Telecaster''' (introduced in 2000) featured a pair of distortion-friendly alnico III, single-coil pickups, super-sized 22 frets, Greasebucket circuit, satin nitrocellulose finish, and 1970s styling font(since 2006). A change over came in 2005/2006 with the line until 2011. Limited colors from previous years down to at least satin nitrocellulose Crimson Transparent, honey blonde, black, daphne blue and 3-color sunburst. The Fender Highway One series came in both maple and rosewood fretboards. The '''Highway One Texas Telecaster''' sported a one-piece maple neck/fretboard with a modern 12\" radius and 21 medium jumbo frets, bone nut, single ply pickguard, round string guide, brass saddles, \"spaghetti\" style Fender font, solid ash body, vintage tuners, offered in two satin nitrocellulose colors, honey blonde and 2-color sunburst with a pair of Hot Vintage alnico V pickups.\n\nIn 2010, the '''American Special Telecaster''' was introduced. While retaining such features from the Highway One as jumbo frets, changing to a 9.5 radius neck, Greasebucket tone circuit and 1970s logo, the American Special also includes some upgrades such as a glossy urethane finish, compensated brass 3-saddle bridge and Highway One Texas Tele pickups (alnico III). In the Fall of 2013, Fender upgraded the pickups on the American Special line to Custom Shop Texas Special pickups. As of 2018 the American Special Telecaster is available in 3-color sunburst, lake placid blue, sherwood green metallic and vintage blonde.\n\n'''Artist Series Telecasters''' have features favored by world-famous Fender endorsees [[James Burton Telecaster|James Burton]], [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Jim Root]], [[G. E. Smith]], [[Joe Strummer]] and [[Jimmy Eat World|Jim Adkins]]. Custom Artist models are made at the Fender Custom Shop, differing slightly quality and construction-wise; their prices are much higher than the standard production versions.\n\nIn September 2010, Fender introduced the Mexican-made '''Black Top Telecaster HH''', featuring dual hot vintage alnico humbucking pickups, a one-piece maple neck with rosewood or maple fretboard and 22 medium-jumbo frets. Other features include a solid contoured alder body, a reversed control assembly and black skirted amp control knobs.\n\nIn 2011, Fender released the Modern Player series, which featured the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline and the Modern Player Telecaster Plus.\n\nThe '''Acoustasonic Telecaster''' is a combination of an acoustic and electric guitar. First produced in 2010, this 22 fret guitar was then reintroduced in 2019 after some changes were made. They are made in Corona, California and come in 5 colors, (Black, Sonic Gray, Natural, Sunburst, and Surf Green).\n\nThe Acoustasonic is equipped with a Fender Acoustasonic Noiseless-TM pickup and uses Fender's Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS) system to allow the guitar to still maintain a loud sound when it is unplugged, as an acoustic guitar would generally sound. The guitars are made out of a spruce top with an ebony fret board and a mahogany neck. The neck is bolt on and the fender logo is engraved on the head-stock next to the staggered-height tuners. There is a 5 way switch to select between sounds and a USB port for charging the electronics in the guitar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acousticguitar.com/fender-unveils-the-american-acoustasonic-telecaster/|title=Fender Unveils The American Acoustasonic Telecaster|last=Rodgers|first=Jefferey Pepper|date=22 January 2019|website=Acoustic Guitar|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2019/01/fender-announces-american-acoustasonic-series-telecaster/|title=Fender Announces American Acoustasonic Series Telecaster|last=Songwriter|first=American|date=22 January 2019|website=American Songwrites|access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Replicated Telecasters ====\nA variety of Telecasters have been Replicated over the years.\n\n- The '52 Telecaster, which was made in 1982\u20131984 and then 1986 to present.\n\n- The '52 Tele Special made from 1999\u20132001, which had gold fixtures.\n\n- The 50s Telecaster, a custom shop guitar that was made from 1996-1998.\n\n- The 60s Telecaster Custom was made from 1996\u20131998; in addition, a '60 Telecaster Custom replica was made from 2003-2004.\n\n- The '62 Telecaster Custom is still currently made, with production starting in 1999.\n\n- The '63 Telecaster is a custom shop guitar produced from 1999 to the present day.\n\n- The '67 Telecaster made from 2004 to the present day and is a custom shop guitar.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Squier models===\nSquier model Telecasters are sold by [[Squier]], a Fender-owned import brand.

Its solid construction let guitarists play loudly as a lead instrument, with long sustain if desired. It produced less of the uncontrolled, whistling, 'hard' [[audio feedback|feedback]] ('microphonic feedback') that hollowbodied instruments tend to produce at volume (different from the controllable feedback later explored by [[Pete Townshend]] and countless other players). Even though the Telecaster is more than half a century old, and more sophisticated designs have appeared since the early 1950s (including [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender's own Stratocaster]]), the Telecaster remains in production. There have been numerous variations and modifications, but a model with something close to the original features has always been available.\nIn a recent article for Music Aficionado, [[Alex Lifeson]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] wrote \"I bought a reissue 1959 Telecaster back in 1981, and that guitar has since become my primary writing guitar for all of these years, especially for the electric work.

Introduced for national distribution as the '''Broadcaster''' in the autumn of 1950, it was the first guitar of its kind manufactured on a substantial scale and has been in continuous production in one form or another since its first incarnation.<ref>Duchossoir, A. R. (1991). ''The Fender Telecaster: The Detailed Story of America's Senior Solid Body Electric Guitar''. Milwaukee: [[Hal Leonard Publishing Co]]. {{ISBN|0-7935-0860-6}}.</ref>\n\nJust like the [[Fender Stratocaster]], the Telecaster is also a versatile guitar, usable for most styles of music and has been used in many genres, including country, reggae, rock, pop, folk, soul, blues, jazz, punk, metal, alternative, indie, and R&B.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Fender Telecaster was developed by [[Leo Fender]] in [[Fullerton, California]] in 1950. In the period roughly between 1932 and 1949, several craftsmen and companies experimented with solid-body electric guitars, but none had made a significant impact on the market. Leo Fender's Telecaster was the design that made bolt-on neck, solid body guitars viable in the marketplace.\n\n[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] had an electronics repair shop called Fender's Radio Service where he first repaired, then designed, [[amplifier]]s and electromagnetic pickups for musicians-chiefly&nbsp;players of electric [[semi-acoustic guitar]]s, electric Hawaiian [[lap steel guitar]]s, and [[mandolin]]s. Players had been \"wiring up\" their instruments in search of greater volume and projection since the late 1920s, and electric semi-acoustics (such as the [[Gibson ES-150]]) had long been widely available. Tone had never, until then, been the primary reason for a guitarist to go electric, but in 1943, when Fender and his partner,\n[[Doc Kauffman|Clayton Orr \"Doc\" Kauffman]], built a crude wooden guitar as a pickup test rig, local country players started asking to borrow it for gigs. It sounded bright and sustaining. Fender was intrigued, and in 1949, when it was long understood that solid construction offered great advantages in electric instruments, but before any commercial solid-body Spanish guitars had caught on (the then-small [[Voxx International|Audiovox]] company apparently offered a modern, solid-body electric guitar as early as the mid-1930s), he built a better prototype.\n\nThat hand-built prototype, an unbranded white guitar with no model name, had most of the features of what would become the Telecaster. It was designed in the spirit of the solid-body Hawaiian guitars manufactured by [[Rickenbacker]]&nbsp;\u2014 small, simple units made of [[Bakelite]] and aluminum with the parts bolted together&nbsp;\u2014 but with wooden construction. (Rickenbacker, then spelled \"Rickenbacher\", also offered a solid Bakelite-bodied electric Spanish guitar in 1935 that seemed to presage details of Fender's design.)\n\n{{multiple image\n|header = Telecaster evolution\n|align = left\n|total_width = 450\n|image1 = Fender Esquire 1st prototype in 1949 at Fender Guitar Factory museum.jpg\n|caption1 = 1st prototype (1949)\n|image2 = Fender Broadcaster (1950), Museum of Making Music.jpg\n|caption2 = Broadcaster (1950)\n|image3 = Fender_Nocaster_(1951),_Museum_of_Making_Music_(clip).jpg\n|caption3 = \"Nocaster\" (1951)\n|image4 = Fender '51 Precision Bass, FGF museum.jpg\n|caption4 = Precision Bass (1951, replica)\n|image5 = Fender_Telecaster_American_Vintage_1952_transparent.png\n|caption5 = Telecaster replica (1952)\n|image6 = 1954 Fender Esquire ($27,000), Vintage Guitar show, SXSW2009 (clip).jpg\n|caption6 = Esquire (1954)\n|footer = \n}}\n\nThe initial single-pickup production model appeared in 1950, and was called the [[Fender Esquire]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bacon |first1=Tony |title=The Fender Story |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=978-0-87930-897-1 |pages=15}}</ref> Ash and maple were used to construct the body and neck respectively and the guitar came in one color entitled, blond.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=60 Years of Fender ( Six decades of the Greatest Electric Guitars)|last=Bacon|first=Tony|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2010|isbn=978-0-87930-966-4|location=London, England|pages=}}</ref> Fewer than fifty guitars were originally produced under that name, and most were replaced under warranty because of early manufacturing problems. In particular, the Esquire necks had no [[truss rod]] and many were replaced due to bent necks. Later in 1950, this single-pickup model was discontinued, and a two-pickup model was renamed the Broadcaster. From this point onward all Fender necks incorporated truss rods. The Esquire was reintroduced in 1951 as a single pickup Telecaster, at a lower price.<ref>[[Fender Esquire]]</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe so-called \"Nocaster\" was a short-lived variant of Telecaster. Produced in early to mid-1951, it was the result of legal action from the [[Gretsch]] company over the guitar's previous name, the ''Broadcaster'' (Gretsch already had the \"Broadkaster\" name registered for a line of drums). In the interim, before [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] had come up with an alternate name and printed appropriately revised [[headstock]] decals, factory workers simply snipped the \"Broadcaster\" name from its existing stock of decals, so guitars with these decals are identified simply as \"Fender\", without any model name. By the summer of 1951 the guitar was officially renamed as the ''Telecaster'' and has been known as such ever since.\n\nThe term ''Nocaster'' was coined by collectors to denote these transitional guitars that appeared without a model name on the headstock. Since they were manufactured in this form for only a few months very early in the Broadcaster/Telecaster's history, original Nocasters are highly prized and expensive collector's items. There are no official production numbers, but experts estimate that fewer than 500 Nocasters were produced. Fender has since registered ''Nocaster'' as a [[trademark]] to denote its modern replicas of this famous rarity.\n\nIn 1951, Fender released the innovative and musically influential [[Fender Precision Bass|Precision Bass]] as a similar looking stable-mate to the Telecaster. This body style was later released as the [[Fender Telecaster Bass]] in 1968 after the Precision Bass had been changed in 1957 to make it more closely resemble the [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar. This double cut away style was the shape that influenced how the Stratocaster was created.<ref name=\":0\" /> At the time Leo Fender began marketing the new  more refined Stratocaster in 1954, he expected it to replace the Telecaster, but the Telecaster's many virtues and unique musical personality have kept it in demand to the present day.\n\n==Construction==\nLeo Fender's simple and modular design was geared to mass production and made servicing broken guitars easier. Guitars were not constructed individually, as in traditional [[luthiery]]. Rather, components were produced quickly and inexpensively in quantity and assembled into a guitar on an assembly line. The bodies were [[bandsaw]]n and [[router (woodworking)|routed]] from slabs, rather than hand-carved individually, as with other guitars made at the time, such as [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibsons]]. Fender did not use the traditional [[set-in neck|glued-in neck]], but rather a \"bolt-on\" neck (which is actually attached using screws, not bolts). This not only made production easier, but allowed the neck to be quickly removed and serviced, or replaced entirely. In addition, the classic Telecaster neck was fashioned from a single piece of [[maple]] ''without'' a separate fingerboard, and the frets were slid directly into the side of the maple surface. The very design of the headstock (inspired by Croatian instruments, according to Leo Fender) followed that simplicity principle : it's very narrow, since it was cut in a single piece of wood (without glued \"wings\"): nonetheless, that headstock is very effective, as the six strings are kept straight behind the nut, keeping the guitar easily in tune.  While this has changed over time with new reincarnations of the guitar,<ref name=\":0\" /> this was a highly unorthodox approach in its day as guitars traditionally featured [[rosewood]] or [[ebony]] fingerboards glued onto [[mahogany]] necks. The electronics were easily accessed for repair or replacement through a removable control plate, a great advantage over the construction of the then-predominant hollow-body instruments, in which the electronics could be accessed only through the soundholes.\n\nIn its classic form, the guitar is simply constructed, with the neck and fingerboard comprising a single piece of maple, screwed to an [[fraxinus|ash]] or [[alder]] body inexpensively jigged with flat surfaces on the front and back. The hardware includes two [[single coil]] [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]] controlled by a three-way selector switch, and one each of volume and tone controls. The pickguard was first [[Bakelite]], soon thereafter it was [[celluloid]] (later other plastics), screwed directly onto the body with five (later eight) screws. The [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] has three adjustable saddles, with strings doubled up on each. In its original design nearly all components are secured using only screws (body, neck, tuners, bridge, scratchplate, pickups to body, control plate, output socket), with glue used to secure the nut and solder used to connect the electronic components. With the introduction of the truss rod, and later a rosewood fingerboard, more gluing was required during construction. The guitar quickly gained a following, and soon other, more established guitar companies (such as Gibson, whose [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]] model was introduced in 1952, and later Gretsch, Rickenbacker, and others) began working on wooden solid-body production models of their own.\n\n[[File:Guitarra2.jpg|thumb|150px|A Telecaster in \"Paisley Red\" (originally released during 1968\u201369)<ref>[https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/1968_69_Paisley_Red_Blue_Flower_Fender_Telecasters 1968 - 69 Paisley Red & Blue Flower Fender Telecasters] by\nDave Rogers, Laun Braithwaite, and Tim Mullally on Premier Guitar website</ref>]]\nThe Telecaster has always had a three-position selector switch to allow for different pickup configurations, as well as two knobs for controlling volume and tone.  However, different eras had different functions for these controls.  The original switch and knob configuration was used from 1950 to 1952. The first position (switch towards neck) activated the neck pickup with treble tone cut, which produced a muffled, bass-heavy tone (sometimes called the \"dark circuit\").  The middle position selected the neck pickup without the treble cut, giving it a fuller sound, and in the third position had both pickups together and activated the tone knob.  On these models, the tone knob acted as a blending knob, with the \"0\" position using only the bridge pickup, blending to a 50/50 neck/bridge mix in the \"10\" position. The first knob functioned normally as a master volume control.<ref name=\"Duchossoir, 1991, 15\">Duchossoir, 1991, 15</ref>\n\nIn late 1952, Fender made several changes to the circuitry of the guitar.  First, a true tone control knob was installed, that could be used to alter the tone from bass-heavy (in the 0 position) to treble-heavy (in the 10 position). The first position stayed the same as before, with the neck pickup in \"dark circuit\" treble-cut mode.  In this position, the tone knob was disabled.  The middle position turned off the dark circuit, and turned on the tone control knob for the neck pickup.  The third position selected the bridge pick-up alone, again with an active tone control knob.  Although this provided the player with a proper tone control, the change also made it impossible to blend the signal from both pickups.  In late 1967 Fender again modified the circuit.  They removed the \"dark circuit\" from the first position, and installed what has become the standard twin pickup switching system: neck pickup alone with tone control in the first position, both pickups together with the tone control in the middle position and in the third position the bridge pickup alone with the tone control.<ref name=\"Duchossoir, 1991, 15\"/>\n\nTypical modern Telecasters (such as the American Standard version) incorporate several details different from the classic form. They typically feature 22 frets (rather than 21) and truss rod adjustments are made at the [[headstock]] end, or the body end depending on the model (typically at the head-stock in newer models). The body end requires removal of the neck<ref name=\":0\" /> (the [[Fender Custom Shop|Custom Shop]] Bajo Sexto Baritone Tele was the only Telecaster featuring a two-octave 24-fret neck). The three-saddle bridge of the original has been replaced with a six-saddle version, allowing independent length and height adjustment for each string. The long saddle bridge screws allow a wide range of saddle bridge positions for intonation tuning. The stamped metal bridge plate has been replaced with a flat plate, and the removable chromed bridge cover (often called the \"ashtray\" for its secondary use) has been discontinued for most models; it improved [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]]\nbut prevented players from muting strings at the bridge and made it impossible to pick near the saddles to produce the characteristic Telecaster 'twang'.\n\nDuring the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation#Sale to CBS|CBS era]] in the 1970s, the Telecaster body style was changed to a new \"notchless\" shape, having a less pronounced notch in the crook where the upper bout meets the neck. The notchless body style was discontinued in 1982.\n\nThe short-lived Elite Telecaster of 1983 incorporated two specially designed [[humbucker|humbucking]] pickups powered by an active circuitry that featured a \"TBX\" [[guitar expander]] and an MDX midrange booster with 12&nbsp;dB of gain. Other features included a \"Freeflyte\" hardtail bridge and die-cast tuning machines with pearloid buttons. This guitar was among the latest CBS-era Fenders to feature a BiFlex truss-rod system, low-friction EasyGlider string trees and active electronics. After CBS sold Fender to a group of employees led by Bill C. Schultz in 1985, production ceased on the Elite Telecaster and other Elite models. [[Fender Japan]] made its own version of the Elite Telecaster in late 1984, which featured a 22-fret neck with medium-jumbo fretwire and a modern 9.5 inch fingerboard radius. Notable Elite Telecaster players include [[Johnny Hallyday]], [[Dave Davies]] of [[The Kinks]], [[Michael Houser]] with Widespread Panic, and [[Andy Summers]] of [[The Police]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==The Telecaster sound==\nThe Telecaster is known for its ability to produce both a bright, rich cutting tone (the typical Telecaster country twang) and a mellow, warm, bluesy jazz tone depending on the selected [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]], respectively \"bridge\" pickup or \"neck\" pickup, and by adjusting the tone control. The bridge pickup has more windings than the neck pickup, hence producing higher output, which compensates for a lower amplitude of vibration of the strings at the bridge position. At the same time, a [[capacitor]] between the slider of the volume control and the output allows treble sounds to bleed through while damping mid and lower ranges.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excellentleads.com/Telecaster.html|title=The Telecaster Sound|author=|date=|website=excellentleads.com}}</ref> Slanting the bridge pickup also increased the guitar's treble response. The [[solid body]] allows the guitar to deliver a clear and sustaining amplified version of the strings' sound; this was an improvement over previous electric guitar designs, whose resonant hollow bodies made them prone to unwanted acoustic feedback when volume was increased. These design elements intentionally allowed guitarists to emulate [[steel guitar]] sounds, as well as \"cut-through\" and be heard in roadhouse [[Honky-Tonk]] and big [[Western Swing]] bands, initially making this guitar particularly useful in country music. Since this, Fender has developed even more in the way of pickups and tones for the telecaster, with changes from Alnico III magnets to Alnico V magnets.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Six Decades of the Fender Telecaster|last=Bacon|first=Tony|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2005|isbn=0-87930-856-7|location=San Francisco|pages=}}</ref> Its wide range of tonalities allows the Telecaster to be used successfully for many styles of music including [[country music|country]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]] and [[jazz]].\n\n==Variants==\nThe Telecaster has long been a favorite guitar for \"hot-rod\" customizing. Several variants have appeared throughout the years with a wide assortment of pickup configurations, such as a [[humbucker]] in the neck position, three single-coil pickups, and even dual humbuckers with special wiring schemes. Fender offered factory hot-rodded Teles with such pickup configurations, the US Fat and [[Fender Nashville B-Bender Telecaster|Nashville B-Bender]] Telecasters around 1998. The Deluxe Blackout Tele was also equipped with three single-coil pickups, a \"Strat-o-Tele\" selector switch and a smaller headstock than a standard Telecaster. Some also preferred tremolos on their Telecasters, installing a Bigsby on them.<ref name=\":1\" /> The most common variants of the standard two-pickup solid body Telecaster are the semi-hollow ''Thinline'', the ''Custom,'' which replaced the neck single coil-pickup with a humbucking pickup, and the twin-humbucker ''Deluxe''. The ''Custom'' and ''Deluxe'' were introduced during the CBS period and reissues of both designs are currently offered.\n\n===Telecaster Thinline===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Thinline}}\n[[File:Fender 72 Telecaster Thinline (horizontal).png|130px|left]]\nDesigned by German luthier [[Roger Rossmeisl]], the Telecaster Thinline model first appeared in 1968/69. It is characterized by a body having a solid center core with hollow wings to reduce weight. The '69 version has two standard Telecaster [[single-coil pickup]]s, string-through-body bridge, and a choice of an ash or mahogany body. Later a '72 version was introduced based on the Fender Telecaster Deluxe with two [[Fender Wide Range]] [[humbucking pickup]]s. In 2011, Fender released the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline as a part of the Modern Player series. This guitar features two MP-90 pickups, similar to the Gibson [[P-90]] and a mahogany body. The Fender Custom Shop has produced a variation referred to as the \"50s Telecaster Thinline\" with an ash body, maple neck and a Twisted Tele neck pickup matched with a Nocaster bridge pickup.\n\n===Telecaster Custom===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Custom}}\n[[File:TeleCustom 76 horiz.jpg|130px|left]]\nThe first edition of the Telecaster Custom was produced between 1959-1968, and featured a double-bound body but otherwise-standard configuration. While the guitar was known as the Telecaster Custom, the decal on the headstock read \"Custom Telecaster\". Later editions of the Telecaster Custom were popularized by [[Rolling Stones]]' guitarist and composer [[Keith Richards]], featuring a [[Fender Wide Range]] humbucker in the neck position and a single-coil pickup in the bridge. To distinguish this model from the mid-1960s Custom with body binding, the market generally refers to the guitar as the \"1972 Custom\", indicating the year this model was released.\n\n===Telecaster Deluxe===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Deluxe}}\n[[File:Fender Telecaster Deluxe (clip) (horizontal).jpg|130px|left]]\nThis model includes two [[Fender Wide Range]] [[humbucker|humbucking pickups]] and was originally produced from 1972 to 1981 and has since then been reissued. The Telecaster Deluxe sported a large headstock similar to the [[Stratocaster]], maple neck and a contoured body, as well as a tremolo bridge option on models manufactured after 1973/74. This model also had 2 volume and 2 tone control knobs on the front of the guitar, rather than the usual 1 of each.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n===Telecaster Plus===\n{{Main|Fender Telecaster Plus}}\n[[File:Fender Telecaster Plus Deluxe.jpg|130px|left]]\nDesigned to restore Fender's reputation after a group of employees led by [[Bill Schultz (Fender)|William C. Schultz]] took over ownership from CBS in the early 1980s. The pickups used in early models were dual humbucking Red Lace Sensors in the bridge position and a single Blue Lace Sensor in the neck position. Later models (post-1995 or so) used three Gold Lace Sensors or a Red/Silver/Blue set in a Stratocaster-like configuration, as well as low-friction roller nuts, locking synchronized vibrato bridge and tuners, and a bound contoured alder body with ash veneers. These instruments were discontinued in 1998 with the advent of the [[Fender American Deluxe Series|American Deluxe]] series. In 2011 Fender released the entry level Modern Player Telecaster Plus as a part of the Modern Player series. The guitar has a humbucker in the bridge, a Stratocaster style single coil pickup in the middle, and a Telecaster covered neck pickup.\n\n===Tele Jr.===\n{{Main|Fender Tele Jr.}}\n[[File:Fender Tele Jr (horizontal).jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Fender Tele Jr. is a variant of the Telecaster that the [[Fender Custom Shop]] produced in a limited run of 100 units in the early 1990s. It uses a Telecaster body shape, scale length, and electronics controls (albeit, with a reversed control plate). However, many of its construction and electronic features\u2014for example its [[set-in neck]] and [[P-90]]-style pickups\u2014are similar to those of a [[Gibson Les Paul Junior]] and [[Gibson Les Paul Special]] electric guitars.\n\n===J5 Triple Tele Deluxe===\n{{Main|Fender J5 Telecaster}}\n[[File:Fender Telecaster John 5 signature (clip) (horizontal).jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Triple Tele Deluxe is [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]] and [[Rob Zombie]] guitarist [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]]'s signature model. It is similar to the regular Telecaster Deluxe, in that it has 22 frets and a 3 way selector switch for the pickups,<ref name=\":1\" /> but it features three Fender \"Enforcer\" humbuckers and a chrome pickguard.{{Clear}}\n\n===Cabronita===\n{{Main|Fender Cabronita}}\n[[File:2012 Fender Telecaster Cabronita (Mexico).jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Cabronita (and Custom Shop variant '''La Cabronita''') is a model that is distinguished by the use of Fidelitron or the more expensive TV Jones Classic humbucking pickups, which look like the original [[Gretsch]] humbuckers. The ''La Cabronita'' is an American-made, custom-built-to-order instrument. It typically has one TV Jones Classic pickup in the bridge position although being custom built, in can be ordered in any configuration. All Cabronitas can be distinguished by use of a smaller pickguard that covers the lower horn only, similar to the pickguard used in the original prototype for the Telecaster in 1949.\n\nThe versions built in Mexico offered either a solid body or Thinline body, with both featuring two Fender Fidelitron pickups, a volume knob and pickup selector. They both have maple necks, 25.5\" scale, a 9.5 inch radius fretboard, \"Medium C\" profile and 1 5/8\" nut width, common to many standard Telecasters made in Mexico, although the Cabronita comes with 22 frets instead of the more common 21. For a brief period, Fender offered an American made \"Telebration Cabronita\" that used two of the TV Jones pickups.\n\nWhile \"Cabronita\" isn't a proper Spanish word, it roughly translates to English as \"little bastard\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sonicstate.com/amped/2013/09/16/fender-mexican-cabronita-telecaster-review/|title=Fender Cabronita Telecaster Mexico Review|author=|date=|website=sonicstate.com}}</ref> or \"little devil\".\n\n===Modern Player Telecaster===\n[[File:Fender Modern Player Telecaster Plus in Transparent Charcoal.jpg|130px|left]]\nThe Modern Player Telecaster is offered in two distinct styles: a ''Plus'' model and a ''Thinline'' model. The ''Plus'' utilizes a pine body, a standard Telecaster pickup in the neck position, a reverse wound single-coil [[Fender Stratocaster|strat]]-pickup in the middle position and a humbucker in the bridge position. It is equipped with [[coil splitting]] and a five way switch to provide seven different pickup combinations.\n\nThe Modern Player Thinline adopts a pickguard similar to the Deluxe models and a Stratocaster style bridge, without tremolo. It features a mahogany body, two [[P-90]] style single-coil pickups, individual volume and tone controls and the three-way pickup selector in the upper horn position.\n\nBoth use the standard 25.5\" scale on 22 fret maple necks that are unlike any other Telecasters in that they do not utilize an overhang to accomplish the 22nd fret, but instead use a longer, square ended neck that is not fully compatible with previous Fender parts.\n\n=== Tele Sub-Sonic ===\nThe sub-sonic Telecaster was first made in 2002 and is still produced. It is made in the USA and was produced as a custom guitar. It has a 22 fret maple neck with an extended scale size (27\"). It consists of a hum bucker in the neck pickup and a slanted single coil in the bridge position. There is a 3-way pickup selector switch and a volume and control knob as found on most telecasters.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Telecaster XII 12-String ===\nThis 12-string telecaster was produced from 1995 until 1998. It had 6 tuners per side of the headstock with the fender logo in-between. There were two options for the fretboard being maple, and rosewood; the necks were all maple. Pick-guards came in white or black and there was a 12 saddle bridge to accommodate the strings.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== B Bender Telecaster ===\nThis Telecaster was produced from the year 1996 to the year 2000. The [[B-Bender]] device was used to change the B string's pitch to a C# at the press of a lever located on the guitar strap peg. The styles of music usually utilizing this device on their telecasters were country, and country-rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fender.com/articles/gear/pitch-perfect-a-history-of-the-b-bender|title=Pitch Perfect: A History of the B-Bender|last=Owens|first=Jeff|date=2018|website=Fender|access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nIn keeping with other models Fender distinguishes product lines manufactured in different locations.\n* The moderately-priced ''Standard'', ''Classic Player'', ''Blacktop'', ''Modern Player'' and ''Deluxe Telecaster'' models are manufactured in Mexico, Japan, China and Korea. Each of these instruments has a feature set that makes them more affordable.\n* The ''American Professional'', ''American Vintage'', ''American Elite'', ''Artist Series'', ''Custom Shop'', ''Acoustasonic'', and ''American Special'' model lines are manufactured in the United States.\n\nThe '''American Deluxe Telecaster''' (introduced in 1998; upgraded in 2004, 2008, and 2010) features a pair of Samarium Cobalt Noiseless pickups and the S-1 switching system. Models made prior to 2004 featured two Fender Vintage Noiseless Tele single-coils, Fender/Fishman Powerbridge piezo system and four-bolt neck fixing. Other refinements include a bound contoured alder or ash body and an abalone dot-inlaid maple neck with rosewood or maple fingerboard, 22 medium-jumbo frets, rolled fingerboard edges, and highly detailed nut and fret work. The HH model sported an ebony fingerboard, quilted or flamed maple top and a pair of Enforcer humbuckers with S-1 switching (discontinued as of 2008). As of March 23, 2010, Fender updated the American Deluxe Telecaster with a compound radius maple neck, N3 Noiseless Tele pickups and a reconfigured S-1 switching system for wider sonic possibilities. The new model now sports staggered, locking tuning machines, which provide a better break angle over the nut for increased sustain and improved tuning stability. The Thinline version has been introduced in 2013. Fender discontinued the American Deluxe series in 2016.\n\nThe '''American Series''' model used two single-coil pickups with DeltaTone system (featuring a high output bridge pickup and a reverse-wound neck pickup). Other features included a parchment pickguard, non-veneered alder or ash bodies and rolled fingerboard edges.\n\nIn 2003 Fender offered Telecasters with a humbucking/single coil pickup arrangement or two humbucking pickups featuring Enforcer humbucking pickups, and S-1 switching. These models were discontinued in 2007. As of 2008, all '''American Standard Telecasters''' came with a redesigned Tele bridge with vintage-style bent steel saddles, and a bridgeplate made of chromed brass instead of steel. In March 2012 the American Standard Telecaster was updated with Custom Shop pickups (Broadcaster in the bridge, Twisted in the neck); the body is now contoured for reduced weight and more comfort. In 2014 the American Standard Telecaster HH was introduced, sporting a pair of Twin Head Vintage humbucking pickups (open-coil with black bobbins in the bridge, metal-covered in the neck). Controls include a dual concentric volume pot for each pickup, a master tone and 3-way pickup switching.\n\nThe '''[[Fender Nashville B-Bender Telecaster|American Nashville B-Bender]]''' guitar is modeled after the personally customized instruments of some of Nashville's top players, featuring a Fender/Parsons/Green [[B-Bender#History|B-Bender system]], two American Tele single-coils (neck, bridge), a Texas Special Strat single-coil (middle) and five-way \"Strat-O-Tele\" pickup switching. Ideal for country bends and steel guitar glisses, this Tele is available only with a maple fingerboard.\n\nThe '''American Series Ash Telecaster''' is based on the '52 vintage reissue. It features an ash body, one-piece maple neck/fingerboard with 22 frets and two Modern Vintage Tele single-coil pickups. Fender discontinued this guitar in 2006.\n\nThe '''Custom Classic Telecaster''' was the Custom Shop version of the '''American Series Tele''', featuring a pair of Classic and Twisted single-coils in the bridge and neck positions, as well as a reverse control plate. Earlier versions made before 2003 featured an American Tele single-coil paired with two Texas Special Strat pickups and 5-way switching. Discontinued in 2009 and replaced by the '''Custom Deluxe Telecaster''' series models. The 2011 version of the Custom Shop \"Custom Deluxe\" Telecaster featured a lightweight Ash body with contoured heel, Birdseye maple neck, and a pickup set that included a Twisted Tele neck pickup and a Seymour Duncan Custom Shop BG-1400 stacked humbucker in the bridge position.\n\nThe '''Highway One Telecaster''' (introduced in 2000) featured a pair of distortion-friendly alnico III, single-coil pickups, super-sized 22 frets, Greasebucket circuit, satin nitrocellulose finish, and 1970s styling font(since 2006). A change over came in 2005/2006 with the line until 2011. Limited colors from previous years down to at least satin nitrocellulose Crimson Transparent, honey blonde, black, daphne blue and 3-color sunburst. The Fender Highway One series came in both maple and rosewood fretboards. The '''Highway One Texas Telecaster''' sported a one-piece maple neck/fretboard with a modern 12\" radius and 21 medium jumbo frets, bone nut, single ply pickguard, round string guide, brass saddles, \"spaghetti\" style Fender font, solid ash body, vintage tuners, offered in two satin nitrocellulose colors, honey blonde and 2-color sunburst with a pair of Hot Vintage alnico V pickups.\n\nIn 2010, the '''American Special Telecaster''' was introduced. While retaining such features from the Highway One as jumbo frets, changing to a 9.5 radius neck, Greasebucket tone circuit and 1970s logo, the American Special also includes some upgrades such as a glossy urethane finish, compensated brass 3-saddle bridge and Highway One Texas Tele pickups (alnico III). In the Fall of 2013, Fender upgraded the pickups on the American Special line to Custom Shop Texas Special pickups. As of 2018 the American Special Telecaster is available in 3-color sunburst, lake placid blue, sherwood green metallic and vintage blonde.\n\n'''Artist Series Telecasters''' have features favored by world-famous Fender endorsees [[James Burton Telecaster|James Burton]], [[John 5 (guitarist)|John 5]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Jim Root]], [[G. E. Smith]], [[Joe Strummer]] and [[Jimmy Eat World|Jim Adkins]]. Custom Artist models are made at the Fender Custom Shop, differing slightly quality and construction-wise; their prices are much higher than the standard production versions.\n\nIn September 2010, Fender introduced the Mexican-made '''Black Top Telecaster HH''', featuring dual hot vintage alnico humbucking pickups, a one-piece maple neck with rosewood or maple fretboard and 22 medium-jumbo frets. Other features include a solid contoured alder body, a reversed control assembly and black skirted amp control knobs.\n\nIn 2011, Fender released the Modern Player series, which featured the Modern Player Telecaster Thinline and the Modern Player Telecaster Plus.\n\nThe '''Acoustasonic Telecaster''' is a combination of an acoustic and electric guitar. First produced in 2010, this 22 fret guitar was then reintroduced in 2019 after some changes were made. They are made in Corona, California and come in 5 colors, (Black, Sonic Gray, Natural, Sunburst, and Surf Green).\n\nThe Acoustasonic is equipped with a Fender Acoustasonic Noiseless-TM pickup and uses Fender's Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS) system to allow the guitar to still maintain a loud sound when it is unplugged, as an acoustic guitar would generally sound. The guitars are made out of a spruce top with an ebony fret board and a mahogany neck. The neck is bolt on and the fender logo is engraved on the head-stock next to the staggered-height tuners. There is a 5 way switch to select between sounds and a USB port for charging the electronics in the guitar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://acousticguitar.com/fender-unveils-the-american-acoustasonic-telecaster/|title=Fender Unveils The American Acoustasonic Telecaster|last=Rodgers|first=Jefferey Pepper|date=22 January 2019|website=Acoustic Guitar|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americansongwriter.com/2019/01/fender-announces-american-acoustasonic-series-telecaster/|title=Fender Announces American Acoustasonic Series Telecaster|last=Songwriter|first=American|date=22 January 2019|website=American Songwrites|access-date=23 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Replicated Telecasters ====\nA variety of Telecasters have been Replicated over the years.\n\n- The '52 Telecaster, which was made in 1982\u20131984 and then 1986 to present.\n\n- The '52 Tele Special made from 1999\u20132001, which had gold fixtures.\n\n- The 50s Telecaster, a custom shop guitar that was made from 1996-1998.\n\n- The 60s Telecaster Custom was made from 1996\u20131998; in addition, a '60 Telecaster Custom replica was made from 2003-2004.\n\n- The '62 Telecaster Custom is still currently made, with production starting in 1999.\n\n- The '63 Telecaster is a custom shop guitar produced from 1999 to the present day.\n\n- The '67 Telecaster made from 2004 to the present day and is a custom shop guitar.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Squier models===\nSquier model Telecasters are sold by [[Squier]], a Fender-owned import brand. These can bear the Telecaster name, since Squier is owned by Fender. Squier guitars, especially the Telecasters, have gained popularity<ref name=\":1\" /> and a good reputation amongst guitar players, since it has expanded its production of guitar models. Squier has a wide range of different Telecaster-type guitars available, from the entry-level Affinity Series to the better quality Standard and Classic Vibe Series. Also available are the Artist Series and Vintage Modified Series. Among other famous musicians, [[Sheryl Crow]] has occasionally used a Squier Telecaster for recordings and live performances.<ref name=\"Cheap Guitarists\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cheapguitarists.com/famous-cheap-guitarists.html|title=Famous cheap guitarists|author=Andrew|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=28 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118010146/http://www.cheapguitarists.com/famous-cheap-guitarists.html|archivedate=January 18, 2012|url-status=dead|publisher=Cheap Guitarists}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nThe Telecaster was important in the evolution of [[country music|country]], electric [[blues]], [[funk]], [[rock and roll]], and other forms of [[popular music]]. Its solid construction let guitarists play loudly as a lead instrument, with long sustain if desired. It produced less of the uncontrolled, whistling, 'hard' [[audio feedback|feedback]] ('microphonic feedback') that hollowbodied instruments tend to produce at volume (different from the controllable feedback later explored by [[Pete Townshend]] and countless other players). Even though the Telecaster is more than half a century old, and more sophisticated designs have appeared since the early 1950s (including [[Fender Stratocaster|Fender's own Stratocaster]]), the Telecaster remains in production. There have been numerous variations and modifications, but a model with something close to the original features has always been available.\nIn a recent article for Music Aficionado, [[Alex Lifeson]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]] wrote \"I bought a reissue 1959 Telecaster back in 1981, and that guitar has since become my primary writing guitar for all of these years, especially for the electric work. Every time I pick it up, it feels like an old friend. I took all of the finish off of the neck, so it's raw wood, and I feel very connected to it when I'm playing it. That is my number-one \u201cgo to\u201d for writing new music.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.musicaficionado.com/main.html#!/image/d3296b92-d4cf-4cdf-9996-2da4c93d243a?referringCollection=alexlifeson-1457922214322|title=Reissue 1959 Fender Telecaster|last=Lifeson|first=Alex|website=Music Aficionado|access-date=3 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Signature Telecaster players==\n{{further|List of Telecaster players}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bacon, Tony (1991).

The French media also spreads propaganda, but no one bombs them for that.\" Afterwards, the professor wanted to expel him from the class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/287497/Zavoleo-Srbiju-tokom-agresije-NATO-a|title=\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043e \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u041d\u0410\u0422\u041e-\u0430|last=\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0414\u0435\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430|website=Politika Online|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\nAs a teenager, Arnaud Gouillon expressed his revolt against the system by participating in political rallies of several patriotic associations and actively fighting for the preservation of traditional French values and against the military interventionism of the West in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]].\n\nWhen he was only 24 years old, in 2010, the ambitious young Arnaud Gouillon tried to get 500 signatures from mayors so he could run in the French presidential election two years later.

Following this experience, which ended in 2011, he left his political activities and devoted himself fully to his humanitarian and socially useful work.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n=== In Serbia ===\nHe published the book, \"All My Roads Lead to Serbia,\" explaining the reasons that led him to defend the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija and then connect his fate with the fate of the Serbian people by moving to Belgrade. The author also describes Serbia the way a foreigner sees it and points out that Serbia is \"at the beginning of a significant phase in its history, at the beginning of a new historical journey. The challenges are serious, but it will resist them. There is a lot to build, a lot to be preserved. From this alchemical process a modern Serbia will emerge, based on its traditional foundations. Because Serbia, like all the old countries, is the roots without which nothing would make sense, but it is also the wings with which Serbia will fly and overcome what exists now.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/arno-gujon-svi-moji-putevi-vode-ka-srbiji/dvtz3c9|title=Arno Gujon: Svi moji putevi vode ka Srbiji|last=Tanjug|website=Blic.rs|language=sr|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\n=== In France ===\nHe participated in writing and publishing of three books in French on Serbia and Kosovo and Metohija:\n\n* 2013.

In [[2016]], Arnaud Gouillon was invited to be one of the participants in the campaign \"Let's cherish the Serbian language\", sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Serbia, with the aim of cultivating and protecting the Serbian language, alphabet, general linguistic culture and literacy. Two years later, he became the trademark and the leader of the Speech Culture Caravan, which organizes trainings and panels for young people across Serbia and Republika Srpska.\n\nHe also often responds to calls from other cultural or humanitarian associations, such as Telethon in Belgrade, Dani Jorgovana in Kraljevo, Ljubi\u010devski Equestrian Games in Po\u017earevac, etc....\n\n=== Lectures and panels ===\nHe is a frequent guest of the different Institutes of Culture, Universities and Secondary Schools from Serbia and Republika Srpska, that invite him to talk about his experience in the field of humanitarian work and social involvement, but also on philosophical topics such as the symbol of life, humanism, justice ... From 2012 to the present, he has delivered over one hundred lectures and panels in the [[Serbian language]].\n\n=== Fighting brain drain ===\nAware that in addition to the Kosovo issue, one of the biggest challenges for Serbia is the departure of young people abroad, Arnaud Gouillon founded the INOMS Association in Belgrade in 2016 (Initiative for Birthrate and Staying of the Young People in Serbia \u2013 in Serbian: Inicijativa za Natalitet i Ostanak Mladih u Srbiji). The aim of this association is to encourage young people to stay in Serbia through positive and successful examples from Serbia, as well as with the demystification of an idealized life abroad.\n\n== Political involvement ==\nArnaud Gouillon became politically aware at the age of 13 when he publicly defended his political stance for the first time in history class, days after the bombing of the [[NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters|Serbian National Television building on April 23, 1999]]. His history professor at the time justified the crime by saying that \"the Serbian Television has become a military target as it broadcasts propaganda\", to which the young Arnaud Gouillon replied that \"a media house, no matter how it works, must not become a military target and by killing civilians and innocent people, we do not do humanitarian work. The French media also spreads propaganda, but no one bombs them for that.\u201d Afterwards, the professor wanted to expel him from the class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/287497/Zavoleo-Srbiju-tokom-agresije-NATO-a|title=\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043e \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u041d\u0410\u0422\u041e-\u0430|last=\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0414\u0435\u0458\u0430\u043d\u0430|website=Politika Online|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> \n\nAs a teenager, Arnaud Gouillon expressed his revolt against the system by participating in political rallies of several patriotic associations and actively fighting for the preservation of traditional French values and against the military interventionism of the West in the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]].\n\nWhen he was only 24 years old, in 2010, the ambitious young Arnaud Gouillon tried to get 500 signatures from mayors so he could run in the French presidential election two years later. In this challenge, he received the support of several movements, including the Bloc Identitaire movement, of which the young Arnaud Gouillon was a member, known for its commitment to a strong Europe and opposition to the illegal arrival of migrants in France. Following this experience, which ended in 2011, he left his political activities and devoted himself fully to his humanitarian and socially useful work.\n\n== Publications ==\n\n=== In Serbia ===\nHe published the book, \"All My Roads Lead to Serbia,\" explaining the reasons that led him to defend the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija and then connect his fate with the fate of the Serbian people by moving to Belgrade. The author also describes Serbia the way a foreigner sees it and points out that Serbia is \"at the beginning of a significant phase in its history, at the beginning of a new historical journey. The challenges are serious, but it will resist them. There is a lot to build, a lot to be preserved. From this alchemical process a modern Serbia will emerge, based on its traditional foundations. Because Serbia, like all the old countries, is the roots without which nothing would make sense, but it is also the wings with which Serbia will fly and overcome what exists now.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blic.rs/kultura/vesti/arno-gujon-svi-moji-putevi-vode-ka-srbiji/dvtz3c9|title=Arno Gujon: Svi moji putevi vode ka Srbiji|last=Tanjug|website=Blic.rs|language=sr|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref>\n\n=== In France ===\nHe participated in writing and publishing of three books in French on Serbia and Kosovo and Metohija:\n\n* 2013.

There are both solid-body and hollow body electro-acoustic models available. True electric harps have a solid body versus a hollow body electro-acoustic harp, which can be played either acoustically or electronically. A true electric solid-body harp cannot be played acoustically since it has no [[resonator|hollow soundbox]], and must be amplified when played.\n\n== Early models ==\n\n[[Alan Stivell]] writes in his book ''Telenn, la harpe bretonne'' of his first dreams of electric harps going back to the late 1950s. He designed and had made a solid body (after different electric-acoustic harps) electric harp at the turn of the 1970s\u201380s, about the same time as [[Rudiger Oppermann]]. Alan Stivell later (early 80s) had a meeting with  [[Joel Garnier]] who decided to create a model. Alan Stivell went on independently to design and have different single models been made with [[Leo Goas-Straajer]] (before the [[Camac Harps|Camac]]\u2013Alan Stivell last experiment).  The first such commercially manufactured instrument was made by Camac, also helped later by the request of jazz-pop harpist [[Deborah Henson-Conant]].<ref name=\"DHCBluelight\">{{cite web | title=DHC Bluelight | publisher=Camac | url=http://www.camac-harps.com/camac-harps-eng/dhcbluelight.html | accessdate=April 11, 2013 }}</ref> The result looked like a light framed Celtic-style harp, but each string had a crystal (Piezo) [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] at its base. They can be plugged into various amplification systems, and players are able to use [[Effects unit|effects pedals]] similarly to electric guitar players. Another part of Henson-Conant's request was that she should be able to move around the stage with the harp, and thus the smaller electric harps usually include a system to strap the harp to one's body.\n\n== Function ==\n\nSolid-body electric harps are usually [[Harp#Folk harps.2Flever harps|lever harps]], though solid body [[Harp#The pedal.2Fconcert harp|pedal harps]] have also been built. Since the cost of a pedal harp is so high, it is more economical for a harpist to purchase an electro-acoustic model of pedal harp, as it can also be played without amplification.\n\nAn electro-acoustic harp looks nearly identical to a regular acoustic harp, whether lever or pedal. It has piezo pickups at the base of each string, and some also contain a separate microphone inside the soundbox, enabling the harpist to mix the signals from both kinds of pickups to produce special effects. Often such harps include an onboard [[preamplifier]]. One of the most famous electro-acoustic pedal harp models is Camac's \"Big Blue\", finished in a striking electric blue colour.\n\n== Developments and variations ==\n\nThe Lyon and Healy electric and electro-acoustic harps are built first on the quality of the traditional Lyon and Healy harp.  In the development of the initial electric harp, there was an effort to mimic the acoustic sound.  While this sound may not be ideal (from a frequency standpoint), it is the sound that most characterizes what the classically trained harpist hears and expects.  It was assumed that the sound would come from the individual transducers and the string, with minimal influence of the sounding board.  Therefore, the board was thickened to provide less resonance and less interference of pedal noise.  The sound was better than using traditional on-board microphones, but, again, not ideal for all settings.  Following much input from performers, Lyon and Healy, with the assistance of Susan Mazer and several other harpists including Greg Buchanan and Harvi Griffin, developed the electro-acoustic harp, which retained the thin resonant sounding board, playable acoustically, with individual transducers that would necessarily integrate all vibrations from the board and the string.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nNot unlike the process of moving from the acoustic piano to the electric and eventually digital piano, the traditional harp being transformed by innovative amplification technologies, began in the 1950s with the late [[Casper Reardon]] and later, in the 70s, by [[Lloyd Lindroth]]. Lindroth integrated many electronic effects including distortion, digital delay, and reverb.  At the time, it was new for guitars, let alone harps. Concurrently, [[Gail Laughton]] used electronic techniques in his classic recording of ''Harps of the Ancient Temples'', foreshadowing the use of electronic effects to enhance live performance.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n[[File:Gravikord.JPG|150px|thumb|right|Signature Series [[Gravikord]]]]\nIn the late 20th century instrument builder and American musician Robert Grawi created an electric double harp-[[lute]] based on the [[West Africa]]n [[kora (instrument)|kora]] but strung and tuned differently. The [[gravikord]] is a light [[ergonomic]]ally designed instrument made of modern materials mostly [[stainless steel]] tubing. It is a double harp that has 24 strings evenly divided in two ranks arrayed on a free standing \"Vee\" shaped bridge made of synthetic material including an integral [[piezo-electric]] sensor. The tuning of the gravikord is an extended version of the \"G\" major / \"E\" minor tuning system of the [[Hugh Tracey]] [[kalimba]] while its overall physical structure is derived from the African kora. Tones rise in a strictly alternate left right hand symmetry familiar to any [[thumb piano]] player, so that tunes and techniques learned on these instruments can be directly played on the gravikord. It was created to enable easier playing of complex African [[cross rhythm]]s on an African derived modern electro-acoustic harp.  \n\n[[Susan Mazer]], with audiophile sound engineer Ron Robinson, developed a custom [[preamplifier|pre-amp]] for the Lyon and Healy electro-acoustic harp brought further clarity to the amplified harp sound.  In addition, she developed a technique of playing the bass on the classical concert harp that had previously not been possible because of the excessive reverberation in the lower-end of the electroacoustic harp.  This pre-amp has not been brought to market due to costs of development and concern for end-user pricing.\n[[Roberto Perera]] performs original Latin rock and jazz, and smooth jazz also on the amplified Peruvian Harp.{{cn|date=April 2017}}       \n\nThe [[MIDI]] harp possesses a piezo [[transducer]] that touches each string, allowing an [[electrical current]] to escape.  The piezo pickup then outputs a current that corresponds to the vibration when the string is plucked.  Once this occurs, the MIDI harp\u2019s [[microprocessor]] that converts the analog signal to digital instruction devises a MIDI message that is sent by means of the MIDI-out port.  The [[laser harp]] is a harp-shaped electronic instrument with laser beams instead of strings, triggered by MIDI.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\nSome harps feature built in [[optic fiber]] and [[LED]] lights.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n== Manufacturers ==\n* [[Camac Harps]]\n* [[Lyon & Healy]]\n* Salvi\n* Pilgrim\n* Resonance harps\n\n== Performers ==\n* [[Kiki Bello]], [[Colombia|Colombian]] electric harpist, singer and songwriter.

Activists joined forces to stand up to what they said was exploitation and degradation of the [[Earth]], as well as the negation of the rights of [[indigenous peoples]]. ''[[National Geographic]]'' said that activists that support protecting the environment, are particularly relevant in [[Brazil]], as [[deforestation]] threatens [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] ethnic groups everyday.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallace |first=Scott |title=Last of the Amazon|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/habitats/last-of-amazon/ |work=National Geographic |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to holding signs and shouting chants, the crowds took a theatric route to convey their messages. Firstly, they poked at [[Brazilian President]] [[Dilma Rousseff]], claiming she has given in to the global North's corporate hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/22/megastars-of-the-earth-summit/|title=Stars of the Earth Summit|first=Taylor|last=Barnes|date=4 August 1692|website=Green Blog}}</ref>  Rousseff's controversy has arisen over her steadfast desire to further industrialize Brazil, and its economy. Additionally, the crowds assembled for a ritual and symbolic \"tearing up\" of the plenary's negotiated text,<ref>{{cite web|author=Jonathan Watts, in Rio de Janeiro |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/21/rio-20-protesters-text-agreement |title=The Guardian June 21, 2012 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> conveying their disapproval.\n\nThousands of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) gathered at the Flamengo Park in Rio. They criticized the draft negotiating text, particularly for its failure to mention planetary boundaries or nuclear energy, in light of the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]] in [[Japan]].<ref name=\"Gerhardt\"/> Organizations, such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], as well as members of indigenous communities, activists and artists participated. The Danish artist [[Jens Galschi\u00f8t]], the leader of the group [[AIDOH]], and the Group 92 used his Freedom to Pollute sculptures to focus on global warming and its resulting increased flow of refugees. About 20,000 flyers about Freedom to Pollute were distributed during [[Rio+20]] and a related television program was produced in [[Denmark]].\n\n===Ahmadinejad Visit to Rio===\nThere was some controversy over Iran's involvement in the Rio+20 conference. Iran sent a delegation, which included President [[Ahmadinejad]], to Rio in June to attend the summit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1477999-ahmadinejad-otra-vez-en-america-latina |title=Ahmadinejad, otra vez en Am\u00e9rica latina |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irandailybrief.com/2012/05/30/iranian-president-to-attend-rio20-conference/ |title=Iranian president to attend Rio+20 Conference \" Iran Daily Brief |publisher=Irandailybrief.com |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> The controversy of Iranian attendance at the summit surrounds the fact that Iran has serious environmental issues, which it has refused to address, continuing human rights violations and is refusing to cooperate with the [[IAEA]] over its contentious nuclear program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/globo-news/jornal-das-dez/videos/t/todos-os-videos/v/iraniano-acredita-que-ahmadinejad-vem-a-rio-20-para-mostrar-que-o-ira-tem-amigos/1971439/ |title=Iraniano acredita que Ahmadinejad vem \u00e0 Rio +20 para mostrar que o Ir\u00e3 tem amigos \u2013 GloboNews \u2013 V\u00eddeos do Jornal das Dez \u2013 Cat\u00e1logo de V\u00eddeos |publisher=G1.globo.com |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> Ahmadinejad was met with demonstrations, attended by thousands of people, on his arrival in Rio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8136098@N05/7388334902/ |title=Activists walk through Rio, demonstrating against the presence of the Iranian delegation at the summit |publisher=Flickr.com |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8136098@N05/7388322554/ |title=Activists walk through Rio, demonstrating against the presence of the Iranian delegation at the summit |publisher=Flickr.com |date=17 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> \nThe Iranian delegation were met with protesters waving banners with the slogan \"Ahmadinejad go home\" on their arrival in Rio on 20 June.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rozen |first=Laura |url=http://backchannel.al-monitor.com/index.php/2012/06/blame-it-on-rio-israeli-delegate-says-irans-president-waved-at-them/ |title=Blame it on Rio?

In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\n\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \"Green Schools\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.\n\nThe idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Earth Summit]]\n** [[Agenda 21]]\n** [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]\n* [[Durban III]] The conference opened on 22 September 2011\n* [[Planetary boundaries#United Nations endorsement|Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n* [[The United Nations Ocean Conference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110420002837/http://www.uncsd2012.org/ United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]\n* [[Brundtland Report|Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development]]\n** [http://rio20.ebc.com.br/memoria/ Videos, photos and information about the Summit in Brazil]\n** [http://rio20.net/en/ Rio+20 Portal.

The decision to hold the conference was made by UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/236 on 24 December 2009. It was intended to be a high-level conference, including heads of state and government or other representatives and resulting in a focused political document designed to shape global environmental policy.<ref name=\"about.html\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uncsd2012.org/about.html |title=Rio+20 \u2013 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=Uncsd2012.org |date=22 June 2012 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818215812/http://www.uncsd2012.org/about.html |archivedate=18 August 2014 }}</ref>\n\nDuring final three days of the Conference, from 20 to 22 June 2012, world leaders and representatives met for intense meetings which culminated in finalizing the non-binding document, \"The World We Want\" which opens with \"We the Heads of State and Government and high-level representatives\", having met at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 20 to 22 June 2012, with the full participation of civil society, renew our commitment to sustainable development and to ensuring the promotion of an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future for our planet and for present and future generations.\"<ref name=\"UN_FutureWeWant_202006_20-22\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1992, the first conference of its kind, the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] ([[UNCED]]), commonly referred to as the Rio Conference or Earth Summit, succeeded in raising public awareness of the need to integrate environment and development. The conference drew 109 heads of state to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], to address what were dubbed urgent problems of environmental protection and socio-economic development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/earthsummit/ |title=United Nations Earth Summit+5 |publisher=United Nations |date=27 June 1997 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref> The Earth Summit influenced subsequent UN conferences, including Rio+20 and set the global green agenda. \"The World Conference on Human Rights, for example, focused on the right of people to a healthy environment and the right to development; controversial demands that had met with resistance from some Member States until the Earth Summit.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/geninfo/bp/enviro.html/ |title=Earth_Summit |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nMajor outcomes of the conference include the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) \u2014a climate-change agreement that led to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], [[Agenda 21]], the [[United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD) and the [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]] (UNCCD).

At Rio+10, [[sustainable development]] was recognized as an overarching goal for institutions at the national, regional and international levels. There, the need to enhance the integration of sustainable development in the activities of all relevant United Nations agencies, programs and funds was highlighted. The discussion also encompassed the role of institutions in stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between the international financial institutions and the multilateral development banks and the rest of the UN system.<ref name=\"isfd.html\"/>\n\nMajor outcomes of that conference include the [[Johannesburg Declaration]] and almost 300 international partnership initiatives meant to help achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]].\n\n== Objectives ==\n[[File:Rio+20 statue of liberty and Dilma Rousseff.JPG|thumb|Demonstration at Rio+20.

In coordination with the Rio+20 event, the platform hosted a World Environment Day Global School Contest in which 7th graders at the International School of Ulaanbaatar (ISU) in Mongolia were declared the Global Winners for their awareness campaign on the environmental impact of plastic shopping bags, including research on plastic bag manufacturing processes, development of videos documenting plastic bag waste, and a school presentation at which reusable cloth shopping bags were sold to approximately 50 percent of the community.\n\nSarasota, Fla.'s Brookside Middle School won in the World Environment Day contest's North American sub-category for its mangrove propagule growth project while International School of Brussels in Belgium won the European sub-category, for their creation of a sustainable food source and composting program. The Middle-Eastern sub-category winner was [[Hridith Sudev]], a seventh grader from [[Indian School Salalah]] in Oman for his organization, '[[Project GreenWorld International]]' which helped promote sustainable awareness across the region through interactive projects. Hridith Sudev later went on to become an inventor and the organization has become a global environmental presence. The World Environment Day contest followed an Earth Day \"Green Schools\" contest regionally focused toward 6th to 12th grade students in the Western New York area.\n\nThe idea behind the platform was to encourage sustainability in students across the world. Despite the huge response, the platform was taken down two years later due to technical and economic constraints but has since remained as a positive legacy through the activities of students who were first recognized by the network.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Earth Summit]]\n** [[Agenda 21]]\n** [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]]\n* [[Durban III]] The conference opened on 22 September 2011\n* [[Planetary boundaries#United Nations endorsement|Planetary boundaries]]\n* [[Sustainable Development Goals]]\n* [[The United Nations Ocean Conference]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110420002837/http://www.uncsd2012.org/ United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]\n* [[Brundtland Report|Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development]]\n** [http://rio20.ebc.com.br/memoria/ Videos, photos and information about the Summit in Brazil]\n** [http://rio20.net/en/ Rio+20 Portal.
