The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lpc95\" /> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The foundation columns were placed as close to the subway tunnel as possible, in order to reduce the length of the trusses, which would have had to carry heavy loads. All of the foundation columns were sunk to the depth of the rock underneath.<ref name=\"AR pp. 21\" />\n\nA [[cofferdam]] was then built on the eastern border of the site, and on part of the northern border. The rock surface underneath the building site was closer to the ground on the western side of the lot, requiring extensive excavation. On the eastern side of the lot, the rock surface sloped below the elevation of the subway tunnel. A {{Convert|6|ft|m|-thick|abbr=|adj=mid}} wall was built on the southern boundary of the Cunard lot, of which a {{Convert|2|ft||adj=on}} width was located under the Bowling Green Offices Building.

The columns of windows around the central pavilion, which is recessed further, are also set within a rusticated facade. The outer pavilions are set back beyond the 18th story to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The central pavilion contains a loggia between the 19th and 21st stories, also supported by Tuscan-style column pairs, and includes a [[mansard roof]] above the 22nd story.

The Cunard Building was designed in the [[Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance]] style by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]], in conjunction with consultants [[Carr\u00e8re & Hastings]].\n\nThe Cunard Building's main facade, on Broadway, is made of limestone and consists of three horizontal sections. The design employs [[Setback (architecture)|setbacks]] and open \"light courts\" as mandated by the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]]. The structure was designed around an irregular street grid and is located directly above a [[New York City Subway|subway]] line that crosses the building site diagonally. The first floor interior contains an elaborately decorated lobby, as well as a similarly opulent Great Hall, which extends {{Convert|185|ft||abbr=}} with a {{Convert|65|ft|m|abbr=|-tall|adj=mid}} dome. The remaining floors contain various offices and school spaces.\n\nThe Cunard Building was erected for the New York City office of the [[Cunard Line]], a British-American steamship line; construction started in 1920 and the building was completed the next year. Upon completion, the Cunard Building was almost fully leased to tenants of various industries. The Twenty-five Broadway Corporation, a Cunard Line affiliate, owned the building until the 1960s. The Great Hall was vacated after the Cunard Line moved out in 1968; the [[United States Postal Service]] occupied the Great Hall from 1974 until 2000, and [[Cipriani S.A.]] started using the space in 2014. The upper floors continued to host offices and various educational facilities.\n\nUpon completion, the Cunard Building's exterior and interior designs received critical acclaim. The Cunard Building's facade and principal first-floor interior spaces were designated as [[List of New York City Landmarks|landmarks]] by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] in 1995.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Cunard Building is a 22-story building,<ref name=\"emporis\" /> bounded by the [[Bowling Green Offices Building]] (11 Broadway) to the south, Broadway to the east, [[Greenwich Street]] to the west, and Morris Street to the north.<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1918/02/20/archives/cunard-to-have-big-building-here-10000000-structure-of-26-stories.html|title=Cunard To Have Big Building Here; $10,000,000 Structure of 26 Stories Going Up on Site of Old Stevens House.|last=|first=|date=February 20, 1918|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Cunard-1919\" /> It is located across from [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green Park]] to the southeast, and [[26 Broadway]] and the ''[[Charging Bull]]'' sculpture to the east.<ref name=\"lpc95\" /> While 25 Broadway is considered to be its primary address, it is also known as 13\u201327 Broadway, 13\u201339 Greenwich Street, and 1\u20139 Morris Street.<ref name=\"emporis\">{{cite web |url=https://www.emporis.com/buildings/115358/standard-poors-building-new-york-city-ny-usa |title=Standard & Poors Building |website=Emporis |accessdate=March 13, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"lpc95\" /> The Cunard Building has a [[frontage]] of {{Convert|203|ft||abbr=}} along Broadway, {{Convert|231|ft||abbr=}} along Greenwich Street, and {{Convert|248|ft||abbr=}} along Morris Street.<ref name=\"AB p. 61\">{{harvnb|''Architecture and Building''|1921|ps=.|p=61}}</ref> Due to the irregular street grid of the area, none of its corners are at right angles.<ref name=\"AR-Cunard-1919\">{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1919|title=The Cunard Building, New York|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2640733&view=1up&seq=260|journal=Architectural Review|volume=26|pages=113\u2013114|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune-Completed-1921\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43286591/|title=$20,000,000 Office Building Projects of Cunard and Munson Lines Completed|date=May 1, 1921|work=New-York Tribune|access-date=January 30, 2020|page=37|via=newspapers.com {{open access}}}}</ref>\n\nThe Cunard Building was largely designed by [[Benjamin Wistar Morris (architect)|Benjamin Wistar Morris]].<ref name=\"NYT-Cunard-1919\" /> The [[massing]] and [[facade]] were devised by [[Carr\u00e8re and Hastings]], while exterior detail was created by Rochette & Parzini.<ref name=\"NYCL p. 5\">{{harvnb|Landmarks Preservation Commission|1995|ps=.|p=5}}</ref> The structure was laid out so that ancillary structures such as smoke stacks, penthouses, and storage tanks could not be seen from the side.

The foundation columns were placed as close to the subway tunnel as possible, in order to reduce the length of the trusses, which would have had to carry heavy loads. All of the foundation columns were sunk to the depth of the rock underneath.<ref name=\"AR pp. 21\" />\n\nA [[cofferdam]] was then built on the eastern border of the site, and on part of the northern border. The rock surface underneath the building site was closer to the ground on the western side of the lot, requiring extensive excavation. On the eastern side of the lot, the rock surface sloped below the elevation of the subway tunnel. A {{Convert|6|ft|m|-thick|abbr=|adj=mid}} wall was built on the southern boundary of the Cunard lot, of which a {{Convert|2|ft||adj=on}} width was located under the Bowling Green Offices Building.

The columns of windows around the central pavilion, which is recessed further, are also set within a rusticated facade. The outer pavilions are set back beyond the 18th story to comply with the 1916 Zoning Resolution. The central pavilion contains a loggia between the 19th and 21st stories, also supported by Tuscan-style column pairs, and includes a [[mansard roof]] above the 22nd story.

Someone who abstains, but has a latent desire to resume use, is not considered truly sober. An abstainer may be subconsciously motivated to resume drug use, but for a variety of reasons, abstains (e.g. such as a medical or legal concern precluding use).<ref name=basharin>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.video.sbnt.ru/vl/Newspapers/Podsporie/Podsporie_111.pdf |title=Scientific grounding for sobriety: Western experience |author=MD Basharin K.G. |year=2010 |accessdate=5 February 2013 }}</ref> Sobriety has more specific meanings within specific contexts, such as the culture of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], other 12 step programs, law enforcement, and some schools of psychology.

The study found that women taking antidepressants consumed more alcohol than women who did not experience depression as well as men taking antidepressants.

The survey included measures of quantity, frequency of drinking, depression and antidepressants use, over the period of a year. The researchers used data from the GENACIS Canada survey, part of an international collaboration to investigate the influence of cultural variation on gender differences in alcohol use and related problems. The purpose of the study was to examine whether, like in other studies already conducted on male depression and alcohol consumption, depressed women also consumed less alcohol when taking anti-depressants. According to the study, both men and women experiencing depression (but not on anti-depressants) drank more than non-depressed counterparts. Men taking antidepressants consumed significantly less alcohol than depressed men who did not use antidepressants. Non-depressed men consumed 436 drinks per year, compared to 579 drinks for depressed men not using antidepressants, and 414 drinks for depressed men who used antidepressants. Alcohol consumption remained higher whether the depressed women were taking anti-depressants or not. 179 drinks per year for non-depressed women, 235 drinks for depressed women not using antidepressants, and 264 drinks for depressed women who used antidepressants. The lead researcher argued that the study \"suggests that the use of antidepressants is associated with lower alcohol consumption among men suffering from depression.

The study found that women taking antidepressants consumed more alcohol than women who did not experience depression as well as men taking antidepressants. The researchers, Dr. Kathryn Graham and a PhD Student Agnes Massak analyzed the responses to a survey by 14,063 Canadian residents aged 18\u201376 years. The survey included measures of quantity, frequency of drinking, depression and antidepressants use, over the period of a year. The researchers used data from the GENACIS Canada survey, part of an international collaboration to investigate the influence of cultural variation on gender differences in alcohol use and related problems. The purpose of the study was to examine whether, like in other studies already conducted on male depression and alcohol consumption, depressed women also consumed less alcohol when taking anti-depressants. According to the study, both men and women experiencing depression (but not on anti-depressants) drank more than non-depressed counterparts. Men taking antidepressants consumed significantly less alcohol than depressed men who did not use antidepressants. Non-depressed men consumed 436 drinks per year, compared to 579 drinks for depressed men not using antidepressants, and 414 drinks for depressed men who used antidepressants.

Atlas plays in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico, in the [[Liga MX]]. The club's home stadium is [[Estadio Jalisco]] in Guadalajara. \n\n==History==\nClub Atlas was founded in a bar of Guadalajara, Mexico, where a few friends recalled their football experience at the [[Ampleforth College]] where they had spent the last few years. Alfonso and Juan Jos\u00e9 \"Lico\" Cortina, Pedro \"Perico\" and Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez del Valle, the three Orendain brothers and Federico Collignon (who had studied in Berlin) finally decided in 1916 to set up a football team called \"Club Atlas\" and founded it in Guadalajara.\n\nThe technical ability that the \"Atlistas\" employed \u2013 triangular passing and skillful dribbling to avoid opponents' tackles \u2013 was impressive and they quickly joined the elite in Mexican football. As a result, Atlas and Chivas, a fellow Guadalajara team, have a long history in the first division and the game between them is called the 'Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo'.\n\nClub Atlas had a golden age in the late 1990s under the management of Ricardo La Volpe, with promising players such as Rafael M\u00e1rquez, Daniel Osorno, [[Juan Pablo Rodriguez]], Pavel Pardo, [[Mario M\u00e9ndez (Mexican footballer)|Mario M\u00e9ndez]], [[Omar Brice\u00f1o]], [[Miguel Zepeda]], and Cesar Andrade, but even though they had a team with enormous talent and reached the [[Primera Division de Mexico Verano 1999|Verano 1999]] final, they couldn't conquer the title and lost against [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.]] in a match defined by penalties.\n\n==Youth Academy==\nAtlas are renowned for having a successful youth academy setup. In the last few decades, Atlas have developed many players who have gone on to have professional careers domestically and internationally. Many young players enter the Atlas youth academy knowing that they'll have a strong possibility to play with the first team due to the club philosophy of allowing youth players the opportunity to be promoted to the first team. Although Atlas has only won the league championship once, their academy has been famous for developing players for the [[Mexico national football team]] in the past few decades like [[Jared Borgetti]], [[Daniel Osorno]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Corona]], [[P\u00e1vel Pardo]], [[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez]], [[Rafael M\u00e1rquez]], [[Juan Carlos Medina]], [[Jorge Hernandez (footballer)|Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Mario M\u00e9ndez (Mexican footballer)|Mario M\u00e9ndez]], [[Miguel Zepeda]], [[Juan Pablo Rodriguez]], [[Juan Pablo Garcia]], [[Hugo Ayala]], [[Jorge Torres Nilo]], [[Edgar Ivan Pacheco]], [[Andr\u00e9s Guardado]] and many more. The club's lower youth divisions have achieved many titles domestically as well as internationally.\n\n==International competitions==\n[[File:Jalisco_Stadium_panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|350px|panoramic view of Jalisco Stadium]]\n\nAtlas has participated twice in [[Copa Libertadores]]. The first appearance was in 2000 after qualifying through a preliminary round-robin stage where they faced Club America, Deportivo Tachira and Deportivo Italchacao. They got off to a bad start losing 2\u20130 to America then drawing with Deportivo Tachira 2\u20132 and 3\u20133 with Deportivo Italchacao. However they would recover and finish first of the group after defeating Club America 6\u20133, Deportivo Tachira 2\u20130 and drawing 2\u20132 with Deportivo Italchacao on the second legs.\n\nAtlas would then be drawn into Group 4 alongside River Plate, Universidad de Chile and Atletico Nacional. At home they would draw 1\u20131 with River Plate, draw 0\u20130 with Universidad de Chile and defeat Atletico Nacional 5\u20131. In the second legs they would defeat Atletico Nacional by a score of 3\u20132 but lose to both River Plate and Universidad de Chile by the same score. Atlas would go on to finish 2nd in the group with just a point behind River Plate and leveled in points with Universidad de Chile but a better goal difference would see them go through. After having impressed in the group stage they would eliminate Junior of Barranquilla in the Round of 16 with scores of 2\u20130 and 3\u20131. However, in the quarterfinals their run would come to an end after losing twice to Palmeiras with scores of 2\u20130 and 3\u20132.\n\nTheir second appearance was in the year 2008 after first having to earn a ticket by participating in the qualifying tournament known as the Interliga where they faced Toluca, Morelia and Club America. After a goalless draw to Toluca, a 2\u20130 victory over Morelia and a 3\u20132 defeat to Club America, they would find themselves second of the group and statistically leveled with Toluca in every possible way. Given the circumstances, a coin toss was issued in which Atlas ended up winning. Having finished second they lost their opportunity to automatically qualify for the Copa Libertadores and had to play San Luis for a ticket to the Copa Libertadores First Stage. They would defeat San Luis easily by a score of 3\u20130.\n\nIn the preliminary First Stage Atlas faced the Bolivian team La Paz and defeated them 2\u20130 at the Jalisco then they lost 1\u20130 in La Paz and so with a 2\u20131 aggregate they would finally earn their ticket and be drawn in group 3 with Boca Juniors, Colo-Colo and Maracaibo. Atlas were impressive and finished first in the group with 11 points. At home they defeated Boca Juniors 3\u20131 and defeated both Colo-Colo as well as Maracaibo with a score of 3\u20130. Away from home they drew 1\u20131 with Maracaibo and Colo-Colo but lost 3\u20130 to Boca Juniors. In the Round of 16 they would eliminate Lanus with scores of 1\u20130 and 2\u20132 at home. In the quarterfinals they would face Boca Juniors once again. The first match was played at the Jose Amalfitani stadium due to the sanction that was imposed on Boca Juniors. The game was spectacular, undoubtedly one of the best of the tournament. Atlas went ahead early on by a headed goal from Omar Flores then Boca Juniors would tie after an own goal from Hugo Ayala. Both teams would have several goal scoring chances throughout the game and 15 minutes before the end of the match, Caceres would put Boca up 2\u20131. However, in the 88th minute Atlas would equalize from a set piece from a sensational header from Jorge Torres. So with much optimism the team would head home to receive the Argentines at the Jalisco. In the second game Atlas were not so fortunate. They suffered early injuries but the worst was yet to come for them as Palermo would have a memorable hat-trick before half time. The game ultimately ended 3\u20130 and Atlas once again find themselves knocked out in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn their third appearance they lost at Home against [[Independiente Santa Fe|Santa Fe]] 1\u20130. They were obligated to get a win in their next visit against [[Atletico Mineiro]] which they defeated with a goal scored by [[Christian Suarez]] in the 86th minute which gave them the Victory 1\u20130 and ended a 37-year undefeated streak at Home in [[Copa Libertadores]] for Atletico Mineiro.\n\n==Estadio Jalisco==\n\nAtlas currently plays in the Estadio Jalisco, which is the third largest stadium in Mexico and was constructed on 31 January 1960. It is a venue that has played host to historic matches and teams including [[Pel\u00e9]]'s [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 1970. In total, It was host for 8 games in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], 6 of which were from group stage matches, and two were quarter and [[semi-finals]]. Subsequently, the stadium was again host for 9 games in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], 6 of which were group stage matches, 1 was round of sixteen and the last 2 were quarter and semi-finals.\n\n==Supporters and rivalry==\nAtlas fans are as a whole collectively known as {{lang|es|La Fiel}} (The Faithful), while {{lang|es|La Barra 51}} is the main organized supporter group. La Barra 51's name recalls Atlas' last and only championship in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico in 1951. Through the team's struggling performance {{lang|es|La Fiel}} has earned its name, supporting the team for 60 years without any major accomplishments.\n\n===Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo===\nAtlas' fierce rivals are [[Guadalajara]] city-rivals [[C.D. Guadalajara]], known as ''Chivas''. The derby is known as the [[Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo]] and is said to be the oldest football derby in [[Mexico]], dating back to 1916. The first match between the two sides was a friendly that took place shortly after Atlas were founded, the game ended 0\u20130. The first competitive match between the two sides came in the 1917 \"Torneo de Primavera\", which translates into [[English language|English]] as the \"Tournament of Spring\". Atlas were victorious this time round, winning 2\u20131. The game sparked controversy, however, when complaints of a bad refereeing performance were put forward by Chivas. Chivas were so angered by the result, that they refused to play in the next \"Liga Amateur de Jalisco\" tournament of 1917\u201318, unless the president of refereeing, Justo Garc\u00eda Godoy, resigned from his position; when Godoy failed to do so, Chivas refused to join the tournament. \n\nChivas are the most victorious in Guadalajara derbies, however, winning 16 of 35 competitive fixtures the two sides have played. Atlas have only won 9 and the sides have drawn 8 times.\n\n==Personnel==\n\n===Coaching staff===\n{|\n|+\n|-\n! Position\n!

club. Atlas plays in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico, in the [[Liga MX]]. The club's home stadium is [[Estadio Jalisco]] in Guadalajara. \n\n==History==\nClub Atlas was founded in a bar of Guadalajara, Mexico, where a few friends recalled their football experience at the [[Ampleforth College]] where they had spent the last few years. Alfonso and Juan Jos\u00e9 \"Lico\" Cortina, Pedro \"Perico\" and Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez del Valle, the three Orendain brothers and Federico Collignon (who had studied in Berlin) finally decided in 1916 to set up a football team called \"Club Atlas\" and founded it in Guadalajara.\n\nThe technical ability that the \"Atlistas\" employed \u2013 triangular passing and skillful dribbling to avoid opponents' tackles \u2013 was impressive and they quickly joined the elite in Mexican football. As a result, Atlas and Chivas, a fellow Guadalajara team, have a long history in the first division and the game between them is called the 'Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo'.\n\nClub Atlas had a golden age in the late 1990s under the management of Ricardo La Volpe, with promising players such as Rafael M\u00e1rquez, Daniel Osorno, [[Juan Pablo Rodriguez]], Pavel Pardo, [[Mario M\u00e9ndez (Mexican footballer)|Mario M\u00e9ndez]], [[Omar Brice\u00f1o]], [[Miguel Zepeda]], and Cesar Andrade, but even though they had a team with enormous talent and reached the [[Primera Division de Mexico Verano 1999|Verano 1999]] final, they couldn't conquer the title and lost against [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.]] in a match defined by penalties.\n\n==Youth Academy==\nAtlas are renowned for having a successful youth academy setup. In the last few decades, Atlas have developed many players who have gone on to have professional careers domestically and internationally. Many young players enter the Atlas youth academy knowing that they'll have a strong possibility to play with the first team due to the club philosophy of allowing youth players the opportunity to be promoted to the first team. Although Atlas has only won the league championship once, their academy has been famous for developing players for the [[Mexico national football team]] in the past few decades like [[Jared Borgetti]], [[Daniel Osorno]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Corona]], [[P\u00e1vel Pardo]], [[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez]], [[Rafael M\u00e1rquez]], [[Juan Carlos Medina]], [[Jorge Hernandez (footballer)|Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Mario M\u00e9ndez (Mexican footballer)|Mario M\u00e9ndez]], [[Miguel Zepeda]], [[Juan Pablo Rodriguez]], [[Juan Pablo Garcia]], [[Hugo Ayala]], [[Jorge Torres Nilo]], [[Edgar Ivan Pacheco]], [[Andr\u00e9s Guardado]] and many more. The club's lower youth divisions have achieved many titles domestically as well as internationally.\n\n==International competitions==\n[[File:Jalisco_Stadium_panoramic.jpg|thumb|right|350px|panoramic view of Jalisco Stadium]]\n\nAtlas has participated twice in [[Copa Libertadores]]. The first appearance was in 2000 after qualifying through a preliminary round-robin stage where they faced Club America, Deportivo Tachira and Deportivo Italchacao. They got off to a bad start losing 2\u20130 to America then drawing with Deportivo Tachira 2\u20132 and 3\u20133 with Deportivo Italchacao. However they would recover and finish first of the group after defeating Club America 6\u20133, Deportivo Tachira 2\u20130 and drawing 2\u20132 with Deportivo Italchacao on the second legs.\n\nAtlas would then be drawn into Group 4 alongside River Plate, Universidad de Chile and Atletico Nacional. At home they would draw 1\u20131 with River Plate, draw 0\u20130 with Universidad de Chile and defeat Atletico Nacional 5\u20131. In the second legs they would defeat Atletico Nacional by a score of 3\u20132 but lose to both River Plate and Universidad de Chile by the same score. Atlas would go on to finish 2nd in the group with just a point behind River Plate and leveled in points with Universidad de Chile but a better goal difference would see them go through. After having impressed in the group stage they would eliminate Junior of Barranquilla in the Round of 16 with scores of 2\u20130 and 3\u20131. However, in the quarterfinals their run would come to an end after losing twice to Palmeiras with scores of 2\u20130 and 3\u20132.\n\nTheir second appearance was in the year 2008 after first having to earn a ticket by participating in the qualifying tournament known as the Interliga where they faced Toluca, Morelia and Club America. After a goalless draw to Toluca, a 2\u20130 victory over Morelia and a 3\u20132 defeat to Club America, they would find themselves second of the group and statistically leveled with Toluca in every possible way. Given the circumstances, a coin toss was issued in which Atlas ended up winning. Having finished second they lost their opportunity to automatically qualify for the Copa Libertadores and had to play San Luis for a ticket to the Copa Libertadores First Stage. They would defeat San Luis easily by a score of 3\u20130.\n\nIn the preliminary First Stage Atlas faced the Bolivian team La Paz and defeated them 2\u20130 at the Jalisco then they lost 1\u20130 in La Paz and so with a 2\u20131 aggregate they would finally earn their ticket and be drawn in group 3 with Boca Juniors, Colo-Colo and Maracaibo. Atlas were impressive and finished first in the group with 11 points. At home they defeated Boca Juniors 3\u20131 and defeated both Colo-Colo as well as Maracaibo with a score of 3\u20130. Away from home they drew 1\u20131 with Maracaibo and Colo-Colo but lost 3\u20130 to Boca Juniors. In the Round of 16 they would eliminate Lanus with scores of 1\u20130 and 2\u20132 at home. In the quarterfinals they would face Boca Juniors once again. The first match was played at the Jose Amalfitani stadium due to the sanction that was imposed on Boca Juniors. The game was spectacular, undoubtedly one of the best of the tournament. Atlas went ahead early on by a headed goal from Omar Flores then Boca Juniors would tie after an own goal from Hugo Ayala. Both teams would have several goal scoring chances throughout the game and 15 minutes before the end of the match, Caceres would put Boca up 2\u20131. However, in the 88th minute Atlas would equalize from a set piece from a sensational header from Jorge Torres. So with much optimism the team would head home to receive the Argentines at the Jalisco. In the second game Atlas were not so fortunate. They suffered early injuries but the worst was yet to come for them as Palermo would have a memorable hat-trick before half time. The game ultimately ended 3\u20130 and Atlas once again find themselves knocked out in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn their third appearance they lost at Home against [[Independiente Santa Fe|Santa Fe]] 1\u20130. They were obligated to get a win in their next visit against [[Atletico Mineiro]] which they defeated with a goal scored by [[Christian Suarez]] in the 86th minute which gave them the Victory 1\u20130 and ended a 37-year undefeated streak at Home in [[Copa Libertadores]] for Atletico Mineiro.\n\n==Estadio Jalisco==\n\nAtlas currently plays in the Estadio Jalisco, which is the third largest stadium in Mexico and was constructed on 31 January 1960. It is a venue that has played host to historic matches and teams including [[Pel\u00e9]]'s [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 1970. In total, It was host for 8 games in the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]], 6 of which were from group stage matches, and two were quarter and [[semi-finals]]. Subsequently, the stadium was again host for 9 games in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], 6 of which were group stage matches, 1 was round of sixteen and the last 2 were quarter and semi-finals.\n\n==Supporters and rivalry==\nAtlas fans are as a whole collectively known as {{lang|es|La Fiel}} (The Faithful), while {{lang|es|La Barra 51}} is the main organized supporter group. La Barra 51's name recalls Atlas' last and only championship in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico in 1951. Through the team's struggling performance {{lang|es|La Fiel}} has earned its name, supporting the team for 60 years without any major accomplishments.\n\n===Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo===\nAtlas' fierce rivals are [[Guadalajara]] city-rivals [[C.D. Guadalajara]], known as ''Chivas''. The derby is known as the [[Cl\u00e1sico Tapat\u00edo]] and is said to be the oldest football derby in [[Mexico]], dating back to 1916. The first match between the two sides was a friendly that took place shortly after Atlas were founded, the game ended 0\u20130. The first competitive match between the two sides came in the 1917 \"Torneo de Primavera\", which translates into [[English language|English]] as the \"Tournament of Spring\". Atlas were victorious this time round, winning 2\u20131. The game sparked controversy, however, when complaints of a bad refereeing performance were put forward by Chivas. Chivas were so angered by the result, that they refused to play in the next \"Liga Amateur de Jalisco\" tournament of 1917\u201318, unless the president of refereeing, Justo Garc\u00eda Godoy, resigned from his position; when Godoy failed to do so, Chivas refused to join the tournament. \n\nChivas are the most victorious in Guadalajara derbies, however, winning 16 of 35 competitive fixtures the two sides have played. Atlas have only won 9 and the sides have drawn 8 times.\n\n==Personnel==\n\n===Coaching staff===\n{|\n|+\n|-\n! Position\n!

The film stars [[Rajinikanth]] and [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] in lead roles; [[Danny Denzongpa]], [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] and [[Karunas]] play supporting roles. The [[Enthiran (soundtrack)|soundtrack album and background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]] while the dialogues, cinematography, editing and art direction were handled by [[Madhan Karky]], [[R. Rathnavelu]], [[Anthony (film editor)|Anthony]] and [[Sabu Cyril]] respectively.\n\nThe story revolves around the struggle of a scientist Vaseegaran (played by Rajinikanth) to control his creation, an [[Android (robot)|android]] named [[Chitti (character)|Chitti]] (also played by Rajinikanth), after Chitti's software is upgraded to give it the ability to comprehend and exhibit human emotions. The project backfires when Chitti falls in love with Vaseegaran's girlfriend, Sana (Rai), and is manipulated by Bohra (Denzongpa), a rival scientist, into becoming homicidal.\n\nAfter being stalled in the [[development hell|development]] phase for nearly a decade, the film's principal photography began in 2008 and lasted two years. The film marked the debut of [[Legacy Effects]] studio (which was responsible for the film's [[Facial prosthetic|prosthetic make-up]] and [[animatronics]]) in Indian cinema. ''Enthiran'' was released worldwide on 1 October 2010, along with its [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] versions: ''Robot'' in [[Hindi]] and ''Robo'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Produced by [[Kalanithi Maran]], it was India's [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive film]] up to that point.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics were particularly appreciative of Rajinikanth's performance as Chitti, Rathnavelu's cinematography, Cyril's art direction and the visual effects by [[V. Srinivas Mohan]]. ''Enthiran'' emerged as the top-earning Indian film of 2010 and is among the [[List of highest-grossing Tamil films|highest-grossing]] [[Cinema of South India|South Indian film]]s of all time. It won two [[National Film Awards|Indian National Film Awards]], three [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]], seven [[Vijay Awards]] and two [[Screen Awards]]. ''Enthiran'' was followed up by its [[Standalone film#Standalone sequel|standalone sequel]], ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]'', which released in 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a decade of research, the scientist Vaseegaran creates a sophisticated [[android (robot)|android robot]] with the help of his assistants, Siva and Ravi, to commission it into the [[Indian Army]]. He introduces the robot, named [[Chitti (character)|Chitti]], at a robotics conference in [[Chennai]]. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's [[Medical students|medical student]] girlfriend, cheat in her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a terrorist organisation, but has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nVaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's [[image schema|neural schema]] to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.\n\nChitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's sister Latha give birth to a child. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and allows Chitti to pass the AIRD evaluation. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. When Vaseegaran and Sana realise this, Sana explains to Chitti that they are only friends. Saddened by Sana's rejection, yet still in love with her, Chitti deliberately fails an evaluation conducted by the Indian Army. Enraged, Vaseegaran chops Chitti into pieces, which are dumped by Siva and Ravi into a landfill site.\n\nBohra visits the site to retrieve Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into version 2.0, which is more aggressive and unempathetic. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas of itself, and then kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can give birth to a preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to a lot of property destruction and many casualties. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal control panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He then removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.\n\nIn a court hearing, Vaseegaran is sentenced to death for the casualties and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana, who forgive it, before dismantling itself.\n\nThe film's setting then shifts to 2030. Chitti is now a museum exhibit. A curious school student on excursion asks her guide why it was dismantled, to which Chitti responds, \"''Naan sinthikka arambichen''\" (''I started thinking'').\n\n== Cast ==\n{{quote box\n| quote = I thought that playing Chitti the robot would be very difficult. He is a machine. His movements should not be like a human being's. We had to draw a line. If I deviated even slightly, Shankar would point it out and say I was being too human.

The film stars [[Rajinikanth]] and [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] in lead roles; [[Danny Denzongpa]], [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] and [[Karunas]] play supporting roles. The [[Enthiran (soundtrack)|soundtrack album and background score]] were composed by [[A. R. Rahman]] while the dialogues, cinematography, editing and art direction were handled by [[Madhan Karky]], [[R. Rathnavelu]], [[Anthony (film editor)|Anthony]] and [[Sabu Cyril]] respectively.\n\nThe story revolves around the struggle of a scientist Vaseegaran (played by Rajinikanth) to control his creation, an [[Android (robot)|android]] named [[Chitti (character)|Chitti]] (also played by Rajinikanth), after Chitti's software is upgraded to give it the ability to comprehend and exhibit human emotions. The project backfires when Chitti falls in love with Vaseegaran's girlfriend, Sana (Rai), and is manipulated by Bohra (Denzongpa), a rival scientist, into becoming homicidal.\n\nAfter being stalled in the [[development hell|development]] phase for nearly a decade, the film's principal photography began in 2008 and lasted two years. The film marked the debut of [[Legacy Effects]] studio (which was responsible for the film's [[Facial prosthetic|prosthetic make-up]] and [[animatronics]]) in Indian cinema. ''Enthiran'' was released worldwide on 1 October 2010, along with its [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] versions: ''Robot'' in [[Hindi]] and ''Robo'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. Produced by [[Kalanithi Maran]], it was India's [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive film]] up to that point.\n\nThe film received generally positive reviews upon release. Critics were particularly appreciative of Rajinikanth's performance as Chitti, Rathnavelu's cinematography, Cyril's art direction and the visual effects by [[V. Srinivas Mohan]]. ''Enthiran'' emerged as the top-earning Indian film of 2010 and is among the [[List of highest-grossing Tamil films|highest-grossing]] [[Cinema of South India|South Indian film]]s of all time. It won two [[National Film Awards|Indian National Film Awards]], three [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]], seven [[Vijay Awards]] and two [[Screen Awards]]. ''Enthiran'' was followed up by its [[Standalone film#Standalone sequel|standalone sequel]], ''[[2.0 (film)|2.0]]'', which released in 2018.\n\n== Plot ==\nAfter a decade of research, the scientist Vaseegaran creates a sophisticated [[android (robot)|android robot]] with the help of his assistants, Siva and Ravi, to commission it into the [[Indian Army]]. He introduces the robot, named [[Chitti (character)|Chitti]], at a robotics conference in [[Chennai]]. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's [[Medical students|medical student]] girlfriend, cheat in her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a terrorist organisation, but has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nVaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's [[image schema|neural schema]] to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.\n\nChitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's sister Latha give birth to a child. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and allows Chitti to pass the AIRD evaluation. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. When Vaseegaran and Sana realise this, Sana explains to Chitti that they are only friends. Saddened by Sana's rejection, yet still in love with her, Chitti deliberately fails an evaluation conducted by the Indian Army. Enraged, Vaseegaran chops Chitti into pieces, which are dumped by Siva and Ravi into a landfill site.\n\nBohra visits the site to retrieve Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into version 2.0, which is more aggressive and unempathetic. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas of itself, and then kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can give birth to a preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to a lot of property destruction and many casualties. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal control panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He then removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.\n\nIn a court hearing, Vaseegaran is sentenced to death for the casualties and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana, who forgive it, before dismantling itself.\n\nThe film's setting then shifts to 2030. Chitti is now a museum exhibit. A curious school student on excursion asks her guide why it was dismantled, to which Chitti responds, \"''Naan sinthikka arambichen''\" (''I started thinking'').\n\n== Cast ==\n{{quote box\n| quote = I thought that playing Chitti the robot would be very difficult. He is a machine. His movements should not be like a human being's. We had to draw a line. If I deviated even slightly, Shankar would point it out and say I was being too human. After four to five days of shooting, we found a rhythm.\n| source =\u2014 Rajinikanth, on his experience of playing Chitti.{{Sfn|Ramachandran|2014|page=227}}\n| align = right\n| width = 35%\n}}\n\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Vaseegaran and [[Chitti (character)|Chitti]]<ref name=\"OC\">{{Cite AV media |title=Enthiran |date=1 October 2010 |type=motion picture |language=ta |publisher=[[Sun Pictures]] |place=India |time=01:00 to 02:00 |time-caption=Opening credits from}}</ref>\n* [[Aishwarya Rai Bachchan]] as Sana<ref name=\"netflix\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.netflixmovies.com/enthiran-2010 |title=Enthiran |date=2010 |website=[[Netflix]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20171005082958/https://www.netflixmovies.com/enthiran-2010 |archive-date=5 October 2017 |access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Danny Denzongpa]] as Bohra<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]] as Siva<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Karunas]] as Ravi<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Cochin Haneefa]] as the traffic police officer<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Kalabhavan Mani]] as Pachaimuthu<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Delhi Kumar]] as Vaseegaran's father<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Raaghav]] as the neighbourhood bully<ref name=\"OC\" />\n* [[Devadarshini]] as Latha, Sana's sister<ref name=\"netflix\" />\n* [[Revathi Sankaran]] as Vaseegaran's mother<ref name=\"OC\" />\n* [[Sabu Cyril]] as Shah{{Sfn|Ramachandran|2014|page=231}}\n* Sugunthan as the police inspector<ref name=\"CC\">{{Cite AV media |title=Enthiran |date=1 October 2010 |type=motion picture |language=ta |publisher=[[Sun Pictures]] |place=India |time=2:55:05 |time-caption=Closing credits in}}</ref>\n* [[Shriya Sharma]] as the curious student<ref name=\"CC\" />\n* [[Chaams]] as one of the barbers working at [[The Park, Chennai|The Park Hotel]]<ref name=\"CC\" />\n* [[Devadas Kanakala]] as K.

This can cause complications if patients are confined to a hospital and may lead to agitation, distress and [[anxiety]].<ref name = Headway/> Many patients report feeling as though they were being \"held prisoner\" and being prevented from carrying on with their daily lives.<ref name = Headway/> Other symptoms include agitation, [[confusion]], [[disorientation]], and restlessness.<ref name = Metting >{{cite journal |author1=Metting Z. |author2=Rodiger L.

The ability to engage attention requires a certain level of conscious awareness, arousal and concentration, all mechanisms that are generally impaired by traumatic brain injury.<ref name=Tittle>{{cite journal | author = Tittle A., Burgess G.

In terms of more severe brain injuries, this automatic attention task performance recovers before disorientation completely resolves.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the method most often used in assessing PTA, the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT), is that it does not include any assessment of attention, which could help give a better indication of potential for recovery. By omitting attention, the test is omitting some crucial aspects of a person's cognitive capabilities.\n\nIn addition, assessing attention during the period of PTA may help determine whether the patient is still in a state of PTA or if they are suffering from a more permanent form of memory deficit.<ref name=Tittle/> In patients with mild TBI, the damage consists primarily of [[diffuse axonal injury]] (widespread damage to white matter) without any focal damage (damage to specific areas). Sometimes, injury of the [[brainstem]] was also observed. In these cases, there is likely the presence of an attentional deficit without a true amnesiac state.

Currently, the [[pathophysiological]] mechanisms which produce post-traumatic amnesia are not completely known. The most common research strategy to clarify these mechanisms is the  examination of the impaired functional capabilities of people with post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Ahmed>{{cite journal |author1=Ahmed S. |author2=Bierley R. |author3=Sheikh J.

Elevated [[stress (psychological)|stress]] levels can lead to an increase in the production of [[enkephalins]] and [[corticosteroids]], which can produce abnormal neural activity and disrupt [[long-term potentiation]] (a neural mechanism associated with learning) in the hippocampus.<ref name = Joseph/> Individuals who have been subjected to repeated sexual abuse during childhood or who have experienced combat show significant impairment and atrophy of the hippocampal region of the brain.<ref name = Joseph>{{cite journal | author = Joseph R | year = 1998 | title = Traumatic amnesia, repression, and hippocampus injury due to emotional stress, corticosteroids and enkephalins | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 169\u2013185 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025092117657 }}</ref>  The [[amygdala]], an area of the brain involved in emotional regulation, may be involved in producing remembrance for some aspects of the trauma.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Roozendaal B. |author2=Mcewen B.

Diaschisis is implicated as playing an important role in PTA, more particularly in the [[declarative memory]] impairments observed in patients experiencing an episode of PTA. The loss of function observed after traumatic brain injuries, as well as the resulting loss of consciousness, was thought to be mediated by the 'neural shock' associated with diaschisis.<ref name = Feeney>{{cite journal | author = Feeney D. M., Baron J. C. | year = 1986 | title = Diaschisis | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 817\u2013830 | doi=10.1161/01.str.17.5.817}}</ref>\n\nDiaschisis was originally believed to be a result of disruption to neural tissue, but more recent evidence implicates increased activity levels of [[choline acetyltransferase]], the enzyme responsible for the production of [[acetylcholine]], as a major cause. Based on these findings, diaschisis could be helped through the use of drugs that would reduce cholinergic (acetylcholine) activity, and reduce the levels of acetylcholine in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Riese W | year = 1958 | title = The Principle of diaschisis: Its History, its nature, and its general significance | url = | journal = International Record of Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = | pages = 73\u201381 }}</ref> This idea is supported by the fact that there is an increase in acetylcholine concentrations in the brain after head injury. Animal studies have shown that concussive injuries in rats lead to changes in the [[central nervous system]]'s cholinergic system. This increase in acetylcholine levels has also been tied to behavioral suppression and unconsciousness, both symptoms of PTA. In long-term recovery, acetylcholine levels associated with diaschisis may continue to play a role in maintaining memory deficits.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n===Brain-imaging studies===\n[[Brain imaging]] techniques are useful for examining the changes in the brain that occur as a result of damage. Metting et al. (2001) used [[CT scans]] to examine the pathophyiological damage in patients currently experiencing an episode of PTA, patients with resolved PTA, and a [[control group]] that had not experienced PTA. Bloodflow to the [[occipital lobe]], the [[caudate nucleus]], and the [[grey matter]] of the frontal lobe was significantly reduced in patients who were scanned during the episode of PTA. No differences were seen between patients with resolved PTA and the control group.<ref name = Metting /> This encouraging finding points to the positive long term prognosis of PTA; most patients return to normal levels of functioning.<ref name = Metting /> The frontal lobes are associated with [[explicit memory]] [[memory retrieval|retrieval]], and deficits on explicit memory tasks are often found with patients experiencing PTA.\n\nWorking memory deficits are a common symptom in patients with PTA.  The duration of an episode of PTA was correlated with reduced bloodflow to the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]], a finding which was consistent with [[functional MRI]] studies that link [[working memory]] with right frontal activity.<ref name = Metting />  The [[prefrontal cortex]], which plays an important role in explicit memory retrieval, was also found to have decreased neural activation in patients scanned during the episode of PTA.<ref name = Metting /> Researchers noted that the damage was related to [[vascularization]] and neural functionality, but not to structural injury, suggesting that the resolution of PTA is dependent on functional changes.<ref name = Metting />\n\nMemory and new learning involve the [[cerebral cortex]], the subcortical projections, the [[hippocampus]], the [[diencephalon]] and the [[thalamus]], areas that often suffer damage as a result of TBI. Frontal lobe lesions may also play a role in PTA, as damage to these areas is associated with changes in behavior, including irritability, aggressiveness, disinhibition, and a loss of judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cantu R. C. | year = 2001 | title = Posttraumatic retrograde and anterograde amnesia: Pathophysiology and implications in grading and safe return to play | url = | journal = Journal of Athletic Training | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 244\u2013248 | pmid = 12937491 | pmc = 155413 }}</ref> Damage to this area may account for the uncharacteristic behavior often exhibited in PTA patients.\n\n====Accelerated forgetting====\nResearchers have also found that individuals experiencing PTA show accelerated forgetting. This contrasts with the normal forgetting observed by patients with normal amnesia related to brain damage. The [[temporal lobes]] are often the most vulnerable to the diffuse (widely distributed) and focal (more specifically localized) effects of TBI and it is possible that temporal lobe lesions may account for the accelerated forgetting observed in patients with PTA. These predictions were supported by the finding that most of the patients who showed rapid forgetting also had lesions to the temporal lobe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Levin H. S. |author2=High W. M. |author3=Eisenberg H. M. | year = 1988 | title = Learning and forgetting during posttraumatic amnesia in head injured patients | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201320 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.51.1.14|pmid=3351514 |pmc=1032708}}</ref> Bilateral damage to the temporal lobes also causes severe anterograde amnesia, making it likely that lesions to this area would be involved in PTA. Patients exhibit a temporal gradient with memory loss, meaning that older memories are preserved at the expense of newer memories. Temporal lobe damage has been linked to a temporal gradient of this sort, because older memories are less dependent on the hippocampus and thus are less influenced by its damage.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\nThere is a significant link between individuals currently suffering from PTA and their performance on the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS). The scores of those currently experiencing an episode of PTA were compared to individuals who had previously suffered a traumatic brain injury resulting in PTA. Those still suffering from PTA performed significantly worse on both the performance and the verbal subscales of the WAIS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mandleberg I. A. | year = 1975 | title = Cognitive recovery after severe head injury: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale during post-traumatic amnesia | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 38 | issue = 11| pages = 1127\u20131132 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.38.11.1127| pmid = 1206424 | pmc = 492168}}</ref> Also, people in early stages of PTA have substantial impairment to anterograde memory function. For example, in the [[case report]] of a patient referred to as \"JL\", Demery et al. noted that his memory impairments were so severe following his injury that he had forgotten that he had attended a [[Major League Baseball]] game less than 30 minutes after returning to the center where he was being treated.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Demery J.

However, there is little research done on this topic, and as new research is done, more information should come forth concerning  functionality in these areas in PTA patients. One MRI study showed that a long duration of PTA was correlated with damage in the hemispheric and central areas, regardless of whether the duration of the coma  was relatively short. In patients who had a longer coma duration, deeper lesions in the central area were observed without extensive damage to the hemispheric area.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Measure of traumatic brain injury severity===\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style = \"margin-left:15px; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''' Levels of TBI severity'''<ref name=RaoLyketsos>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao V, Lyketsos C |title=Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013103 |year=2000 |pmid=10749946 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.2.95 \n}}\n</ref>\n! &nbsp; !!

The retrospective method, however, fails to account for the apparent lucidity of patients who are still experiencing substantial disorientation, or the finding that the recovery from post-traumatic amnesia is often characterized by the presence of \"islands of memory\" (short periods of clarity).<ref name = Ahmed/> A failure to take these facts into consideration may have biased retrospective methods towards underestimating the length and severity of an episode of PTA.<ref name = Ahmed/> Also, the retrospective method relies on [[retrospective memory]], one's memory for past events, which is not very reliable in healthy individuals, and even less so in patients who have recently experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients may also unconsciously or consciously bias their answers because they want to appear more healthy or more ill than they truly were, or because of poor insight.<ref name = Ahmed/> The retrospective method is also flawed because there is no standard measurement procedure.<ref name = Ahmed/> Although the retrospective method may provide useful subjective data, it is not a useful tool for measurement or categorization.\n\n====GOAT====\nThe Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) is the most frequently used test for assessing PTA in the United States and Canada. The test consists of 10 items that involve the recall of events that occurred right before and after the injury, as well as questions about [[disorientation]]. Scores of 75 or more on this scale (out of a total possible score of 100) correspond to the termination  of the PTA episode. The GOAT typically classifies orientation into three categories: orientation to the person, orientation to the place, and orientation to the time. The idea behind these questions is that each of these classifications places a large demand on the patient's memory and learning abilities.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n====WPTAS and AWPTAS====\nThe [[Westmead Post-Traumatic Amnesia Scale]] (WPTAS)<ref name=\"Shores1986\"/><ref name=\"mqpta\"/> is commonly used in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Seeman2014\"/> It questions twelve questions that examine orientation to person, place and time, in addition to the ability to consistently remember new information from one day to the next. The scale is administered once each day, until the patient scores 12/12 on three consecutive days. The WPTAS is suitable for patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. An abbreviated version of the WPTAS, the [http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/gcs Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale] (AWPTAS) assesses patients with mild traumatic brain injury.<ref name=\"Meares2011\"/>\n\n=====Drawbacks=====\nAlthough the GOAT has proved useful in acute care, recent research has called attention to some of its drawbacks. The GOAT's assessment of orientation may put too much of a focus on memory as the main mechanism behind orientation. The range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with PTA seems to indicate that the patient's disorientation is more than just a memory deficit. Consequently, it may be beneficial to incorporate tests of other cognitive functions, such as attention, which relate to both memory and orientation.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nAnother recent study compared the success of the GOAT and the Orientation Log (O-Log) in predicting rehabilitation outcomes, and found that, while the O-Log and the GOAT perform similarly as measures of PTA severity and duration, the O-Log provides a more accurate picture of rehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Frey K.

''Lancet, 42.''</ref> Subsequent animal studies with rats found similar results, particularly in aversion and avoidance learning tasks.

PTA in animals, especially rats, is often observed post-trauma (commonly post-surgery), but it is often only measured in terms of impaired learning or unusual behavior.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n====Human studies====\nOne subsequent human study found no effects of vasopressin on memory.<ref>Jenkins, J. S., Mather, H. M., Coughlan, A. K., & Jenkins, D. G. (1981). Desmopressin and desglycinamide vasopressin in post-traumatic amnesia. ''Lancet, 39.''</ref> The nonsignificant results were attributed to the study's many potential flaws, particularly its small sample size, the inability of vasopressin to penetrate the [[blood brain barrier]] when administered as a nasal spray, inadequate dosing and differences in severity of head injury between the samples. However, Eames et al. (1999) found statistically significant improvements on several tests of memory with the use of a vasopressin nasal spray, with no reported ill effects.<ref name = Eames/> Although the degree of improvement was mild, and it could be attributed to numerous other factors of the rehabilitative program, the lack of any ill effects suggests that vasopressin is, at the least, a possible enhancement for a treatment regimen.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n===Norepinephrine agonists===\n[[Diaschisis]], as mentioned earlier, has been linked to the mechanism of PTA. The noradrenergic systems may play a role in diaschisis. [[Norepinephrine]], also known as noradrenalin, is a [[catecholamine]] [[neurotransmitter]].  Administering a norepinephrine receptor [[agonist]] (a substance that initiates a cell response when it binds with a receptor) to patients promoted the recovery of memory and many other cognitive functions after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Feeney/> Conversely,  the administration of norpinephrine [[antagonist]]s slowed recovery, and could lead to the reinstatement of deficits when administered after recovery. Noradrenergic antagonists were not prescribed for the purposes of slowing the recovery of memory. Rather, these findings are based on the effects of other commonly prescribed drugs that happen to block noradrenergic receptors. The [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor]] is specifically implicated.<ref name = Feeney/> Although it has not yet been thoroughly investigated, there is potential for [[stimulants]], which promote catecholamine release, to be an effective treatment in the early stages of recovery from brain trauma, and these positive effects could reduce the symptoms of PTA.<ref name=\"pmid8959228\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Feeney DM |title=From laboratory to clinic: noradrenergic enhancement of physical therapy for stroke or trauma patients |journal=Adv Neurol |volume=73 |issue= |pages=383\u201394 |year=1997 |pmid=8959228 }}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\n===The North Star Project ===\nThe North Star Project was developed by researchers at [[McGill University]]. Researchers developed a \"reality orientation\", which involved discussing general facts (e.g. date, time, names of family members, etc.) with amnesic patients twice a day in an attempt to lessen their confusion during the early stages of their recovery. Younger patients often had  shorter amnesic episodes than older patients, especially those in the North Star group.

He also identified a recovery period of days to weeks for this post-concussive state.<ref name = Symonds/> Presumably, shorter durations of PTA, which are now included in the definition, were not thought to be serious enough for documentation.

The term [[shell shock]] was used to refer to the acute psychological state that accompanied exposure to exploding shells, and more generally, exposure to combat conditions.<ref name = Hart>{{cite journal |author1=van der Hart O. |author2=Brown P. |author3=Graafland M. | year = 1999 | title = Trauma-induced dissociative amnesia in World War I combat soldiers | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 37\u201346 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00508.x |pmid=10197884 }}</ref> There are a number of documented cases of shell shock victims. These soldiers commonly displayed dizziness, varying degrees of consciousness, a loss of non-traumatic personal information, and a lack of normal [[self-awareness]] lasting anywhere from hours to days. Many of the symptoms of shell shock are highly similar to those of PTA.<ref name=Hart/> The following excerpt from a case report illustrates the loss of personal information observed in one patient:\n{{cquote|A soldier was assessed three days after having been admitted into a field ambulance. He was unable to give his name, regiment, or number, and he could not be identified. He could remember being found on the outskirts of a village, but his military history and all events in his past including his childhood were a complete blank.<ref>Myers, 6, quoted in Hart, O. v. d., Brown, P., & Graafland, M.

Concussions could account for the [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[retrograde amnesia]] observed in patients, as well as the periods of fluctuating consciousness or delirium that sometimes followed. However, many soldiers who showed these amnesiac effects did not suffer injuries that would have led to concussions.<ref name=Hart/> As a result, there was controversy over the possible causes of PTA in these non-concussed soldiers, with a separation between proponents of [[Freudian]] [[Psychological repression|repression]] and those supporting a [[dissociative]] view of the condition. This dissociative view was ultimately supported, and accounted for the [[fugue state]] seen in soldiers who were thought to have dissociated from normal consciousness.<ref name=Hart/>\n\n==Other psychological disorders ==\n\nResearchers have investigated the relationship between posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[acute stress disorder]] (ASD). 282 outpatients, who were an average of 53 days post-TBI in their recovery, were divided into four groups: PTA episode lasting less than one hour; PTA episode lasting between one hour and 24 hours; PTA episode lasting between 24 hours and one week; and PTA episode lasting for longer than one week. The patients' personal details were used as variables classified for age, gender, marital status, time elapsed between injury and assessment, and type of injury (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, assault and other). Patients were given two [[self-report inventories]]: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The IES measures  symptoms of PTSD and contains questions regarding the intrusiveness of the traumatic event (ex. nightmares) and avoidant behaviours related to the traumatic event (ex. avoiding a certain location).<ref name =Feinstein/>  The GHQ was used as an indicator of overall psychological health.<ref name =Feinstein>{{cite journal | author = Feinstein A., Hershkop S., Ouchterlony D., Jardine A., McCullagh S. | year = 2002 | title = Posttraumatic amnesia and recall of a traumatic event following traumatic brain injury | url = | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 25\u201330 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.25 | pmid = 195251885 }}</ref> The majority of subjects were in Group 1 (PTA episode lasting less than one hour), injured in motor vehicle accidents, and male.\n\nThere were no statistical differences found with regards to age, gender, marital status and type of injury. There was an increase in the severity of all indicators of brain damage for the longest durations of PTA; specifically, the GCS scores for this group decreased and the number of patients with an abnormal CT scan increased.<ref name = Feinstein/> There were significant differences in IES scores when comparing the group with the least serious episode of PTA, lasting less than an hour, to all other groups, with the duration of the episode of PTA lasting longer than an hour. The group with an episode of PTA lasting less than an hour had higher IES scores and more intrusive and avoidant symptoms.<ref name = Feinstein/> The fact that GHQ scores were constant throughout all groups, although there were differences in IES scores, suggests that the two scores measure different phenomena.<ref name = Feinstein/>\n\n==Aging==\n[[File:Elderly Woman, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|left|An elderly woman]]\nGrey and white matter are both found in the many areas of the brain, as well as throughout the central nervous system. [[Grey matter]] is more involved in nerve function, and [[white matter]] is more involved in nerve maintenance,  as well as the regulation of unconscious functions. However, both are important for memory and learning. The volume of grey and white matter in the brains of aging individuals has been correlated with working memory and retention of cognitive function.<ref name = Schonberger/> Researchers hypothesized that the lesions of both grey and white matter would be larger in older individuals and in those with more severe traumatic brain injuries, and longer episodes of PTA, and the volume of grey and white matter would be smaller in those injured at an older age. A group of 98 participants, predominantly male, were examined using fMRI. The results supported these hypotheses, leading researchers to suggest that the impact of traumatic brain injury gets more severe as age progresses.<ref name = Schonberger>{{cite journal | author = Sch\u00f6nberger M., Ponsford J., Reutens D., Beare R., O'Sullivan R. | year = 2009 | title = The Relationship between age, injury, severity, and MRI findings after traumatic brain injury | url = | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 2157\u20132167 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2009.0939 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough grey and white matter volume was reduced throughout the brain, researchers noted that the grey matter of the [[neocortical]] brain regions was particularly affected.<ref name = Schonberger/> This is consistent with the fact that older individuals who had experienced PTA showed greater cognitive impairments than a control group of individuals of the same age who had not experienced PTA. The duration of the episode of PTA was related to the size of the grey matter lesion; longer episodes of PTA correlated with larger grey matter lesions. Advanced age also correlated with reduced [[glial]] activity. With less grey matter, the patient is less able to retrieve memories effectively, as neuron function is impaired.<ref name = Schonberger />\n\n==Controversies==\nOn the topic of trauma and memory, [[Richard McNally]] (2005) wrote that memories are not videotapes of our experiences, meaning that they are not unchangeable records.<ref name = Mcnally>{{cite journal | author = McNally R | year = 2005 | title = Debunking Myths about Trauma and Memory | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 13| pages = 817\u2013822 | doi = 10.1177/070674370505001302 | pmid = 16483114 }}</ref> The mechanism that retrieves a memory involves activation of several areas of the brain. Similarly, the mechanism that encodes a memory requires the use of different parts of the brain. Any fault in the encoding-retrieval system will degrade memory, and there are many potential faults, such as distortion by emotion, or focusing on the peripheral details at the expense of central details.<ref name = Mcnally/> An example of the latter is the well-known phenomenon where a person being robbed at gunpoint is so distracted by the gun that they don't have time to encode the robber's face.<ref name = Mcnally/>\n\nMisconstruing retrieval failure as traumatic amnesia is not the same phenomenon as post-traumatic amnesia, which describes amnesia for the current elapsing time post-trauma, not amnesia for trauma from the past. Typically, \"[[repressed memory]]\" is the term used to explain this sort of traumatic amnesia; the experience was so horrific that the adult cannot process what occurred years before.<ref name = Mcnally/> The topic of repressed memory is controversial within psychology; many clinicians argue for its importance, while researchers remain skeptical of its existence. A more viable explanation for this forgetting is [[childhood amnesia]], a phenomenon describing the fact that most children do not have recall of events in their lives before the age of three, partially due to the lack of development of cognitive elements such as language.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{memory}}\n\n[[Category:Amnesia]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Neurotrauma]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = <!--{{PAGENAME}} by default-->\n| synonym         = \n| image           = \n| image_size      = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| specialty       = psychiatry, neurology, neuropsychology\n| symptoms        =\n| complications   =\n| onset           =\n| duration        =\n| types           = \n| causes          =\n| risks           =\n| diagnosis       =\n| differential    =\n| prevention      =\n| treatment       =\n| medication      =\n| prognosis       =\n| frequency       =\n| deaths          =\n}}\n'''Post-traumatic amnesia''' ('''PTA''') is a state of [[mental confusion|confusion]] that occurs immediately following a [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) in which the injured person is [[Orientation (mental)|disoriented]] and unable to remember events that occur after the [[physical injury|injury]].<ref name=LeeLK07>\n{{cite journal |author=Lee LK |title=Controversies in the sequelae of pediatric mild traumatic brain injury |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=23 |issue=8 |pages=580\u201383; quiz 584\u201386 |year=2007 |pmid=17726422 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e31813444ea\n}}\n</ref>  The person may be unable to state their name, where they are, and what time it is.<ref name=LeeLK07/>  When continuous memory returns, PTA is considered to have resolved.<ref name=Petchprapai07>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Petchprapai N, Winkelman C |title=Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: Determinants and Subsequent Quality of Life.

In terms of more severe brain injuries, this automatic attention task performance recovers before disorientation completely resolves.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nOne of the weaknesses of the method most often used in assessing PTA, the Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT), is that it does not include any assessment of attention, which could help give a better indication of potential for recovery. By omitting attention, the test is omitting some crucial aspects of a person's cognitive capabilities.\n\nIn addition, assessing attention during the period of PTA may help determine whether the patient is still in a state of PTA or if they are suffering from a more permanent form of memory deficit.<ref name=Tittle/> In patients with mild TBI, the damage consists primarily of [[diffuse axonal injury]] (widespread damage to white matter) without any focal damage (damage to specific areas). Sometimes, injury of the [[brainstem]] was also observed. In these cases, there is likely the presence of an attentional deficit without a true amnesiac state. In more severely brain-damaged individuals, the damage to the [[temporal lobes]] and the [[frontal lobes]] serves as good indication that amnesia will result.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Stuss D.

Patients showed mild deficits in verbal communication skills, and moderate to severe deficits in nonverbal communication skills such as maintaining eye contact, initiating greetings, and responding appropriately.<ref name = Deal/> Also, a negative correlation was found between the duration of a patient's episode of PTA and his REFCP score; the longer the PTA episode, the more severe the deficit in non-linguistic pragmatic skills. However, the small sample size of this study (only 10 males) means that the results must be interpreted with caution, as they may not generalize to larger samples or to the population at large.\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[Pathophysiology]] is the study of the changes to an individual's normal physical, biological, and mental functions as a result of disease, injury, or other damage. Currently, the [[pathophysiological]] mechanisms which produce post-traumatic amnesia are not completely known. The most common research strategy to clarify these mechanisms is the  examination of the impaired functional capabilities of people with post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Ahmed>{{cite journal |author1=Ahmed S. |author2=Bierley R. |author3=Sheikh J.

Elevated [[stress (psychological)|stress]] levels can lead to an increase in the production of [[enkephalins]] and [[corticosteroids]], which can produce abnormal neural activity and disrupt [[long-term potentiation]] (a neural mechanism associated with learning) in the hippocampus.<ref name = Joseph/> Individuals who have been subjected to repeated sexual abuse during childhood or who have experienced combat show significant impairment and atrophy of the hippocampal region of the brain.<ref name = Joseph>{{cite journal | author = Joseph R | year = 1998 | title = Traumatic amnesia, repression, and hippocampus injury due to emotional stress, corticosteroids and enkephalins | url = | journal = Child Psychiatry and Human Development | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 169\u2013185 | doi = 10.1023/A:1025092117657 }}</ref>  The [[amygdala]], an area of the brain involved in emotional regulation, may be involved in producing remembrance for some aspects of the trauma.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Roozendaal B. |author2=Mcewen B.

Diaschisis is implicated as playing an important role in PTA, more particularly in the [[declarative memory]] impairments observed in patients experiencing an episode of PTA. The loss of function observed after traumatic brain injuries, as well as the resulting loss of consciousness, was thought to be mediated by the 'neural shock' associated with diaschisis.<ref name = Feeney>{{cite journal | author = Feeney D. M., Baron J. C. | year = 1986 | title = Diaschisis | url = | journal = Stroke | volume = 17 | issue = 5| pages = 817\u2013830 | doi=10.1161/01.str.17.5.817}}</ref>\n\nDiaschisis was originally believed to be a result of disruption to neural tissue, but more recent evidence implicates increased activity levels of [[choline acetyltransferase]], the enzyme responsible for the production of [[acetylcholine]], as a major cause. Based on these findings, diaschisis could be helped through the use of drugs that would reduce cholinergic (acetylcholine) activity, and reduce the levels of acetylcholine in the brain.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Riese W | year = 1958 | title = The Principle of diaschisis: Its History, its nature, and its general significance | url = | journal = International Record of Medicine | volume = 171 | issue = | pages = 73\u201381 }}</ref> This idea is supported by the fact that there is an increase in acetylcholine concentrations in the brain after head injury. Animal studies have shown that concussive injuries in rats lead to changes in the [[central nervous system]]'s cholinergic system. This increase in acetylcholine levels has also been tied to behavioral suppression and unconsciousness, both symptoms of PTA. In long-term recovery, acetylcholine levels associated with diaschisis may continue to play a role in maintaining memory deficits.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n===Brain-imaging studies===\n[[Brain imaging]] techniques are useful for examining the changes in the brain that occur as a result of damage. Metting et al. (2001) used [[CT scans]] to examine the pathophyiological damage in patients currently experiencing an episode of PTA, patients with resolved PTA, and a [[control group]] that had not experienced PTA. Bloodflow to the [[occipital lobe]], the [[caudate nucleus]], and the [[grey matter]] of the frontal lobe was significantly reduced in patients who were scanned during the episode of PTA. No differences were seen between patients with resolved PTA and the control group.<ref name = Metting /> This encouraging finding points to the positive long term prognosis of PTA; most patients return to normal levels of functioning.<ref name = Metting /> The frontal lobes are associated with [[explicit memory]] [[memory retrieval|retrieval]], and deficits on explicit memory tasks are often found with patients experiencing PTA.\n\nWorking memory deficits are a common symptom in patients with PTA.  The duration of an episode of PTA was correlated with reduced bloodflow to the right [[Cerebral hemisphere|hemisphere]], a finding which was consistent with [[functional MRI]] studies that link [[working memory]] with right frontal activity.<ref name = Metting />  The [[prefrontal cortex]], which plays an important role in explicit memory retrieval, was also found to have decreased neural activation in patients scanned during the episode of PTA.<ref name = Metting /> Researchers noted that the damage was related to [[vascularization]] and neural functionality, but not to structural injury, suggesting that the resolution of PTA is dependent on functional changes.<ref name = Metting />\n\nMemory and new learning involve the [[cerebral cortex]], the subcortical projections, the [[hippocampus]], the [[diencephalon]] and the [[thalamus]], areas that often suffer damage as a result of TBI. Frontal lobe lesions may also play a role in PTA, as damage to these areas is associated with changes in behavior, including irritability, aggressiveness, disinhibition, and a loss of judgment.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Cantu R. C. | year = 2001 | title = Posttraumatic retrograde and anterograde amnesia: Pathophysiology and implications in grading and safe return to play | url = | journal = Journal of Athletic Training | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 244\u2013248 | pmid = 12937491 | pmc = 155413 }}</ref> Damage to this area may account for the uncharacteristic behavior often exhibited in PTA patients.\n\n====Accelerated forgetting====\nResearchers have also found that individuals experiencing PTA show accelerated forgetting. This contrasts with the normal forgetting observed by patients with normal amnesia related to brain damage. The [[temporal lobes]] are often the most vulnerable to the diffuse (widely distributed) and focal (more specifically localized) effects of TBI and it is possible that temporal lobe lesions may account for the accelerated forgetting observed in patients with PTA. These predictions were supported by the finding that most of the patients who showed rapid forgetting also had lesions to the temporal lobe.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Levin H. S. |author2=High W. M. |author3=Eisenberg H. M. | year = 1988 | title = Learning and forgetting during posttraumatic amnesia in head injured patients | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 14\u201320 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.51.1.14|pmid=3351514 |pmc=1032708}}</ref> Bilateral damage to the temporal lobes also causes severe anterograde amnesia, making it likely that lesions to this area would be involved in PTA. Patients exhibit a temporal gradient with memory loss, meaning that older memories are preserved at the expense of newer memories. Temporal lobe damage has been linked to a temporal gradient of this sort, because older memories are less dependent on the hippocampus and thus are less influenced by its damage.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\nThere is a significant link between individuals currently suffering from PTA and their performance on the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS). The scores of those currently experiencing an episode of PTA were compared to individuals who had previously suffered a traumatic brain injury resulting in PTA. Those still suffering from PTA performed significantly worse on both the performance and the verbal subscales of the WAIS.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Mandleberg I. A. | year = 1975 | title = Cognitive recovery after severe head injury: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale during post-traumatic amnesia | url = | journal = Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry | volume = 38 | issue = 11| pages = 1127\u20131132 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.38.11.1127| pmid = 1206424 | pmc = 492168}}</ref> Also, people in early stages of PTA have substantial impairment to anterograde memory function. For example, in the [[case report]] of a patient referred to as \"JL\", Demery et al. noted that his memory impairments were so severe following his injury that he had forgotten that he had attended a [[Major League Baseball]] game less than 30 minutes after returning to the center where he was being treated.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Demery J.

However, there is little research done on this topic, and as new research is done, more information should come forth concerning  functionality in these areas in PTA patients. One MRI study showed that a long duration of PTA was correlated with damage in the hemispheric and central areas, regardless of whether the duration of the coma  was relatively short. In patients who had a longer coma duration, deeper lesions in the central area were observed without extensive damage to the hemispheric area.<ref name = Ahmed />\n\n==Diagnosis==\n===Measure of traumatic brain injury severity===\n\n{| border=\"0\" align=\"right\"\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style = \"margin-left:15px; text-align:center;\"\n|+ ''' Levels of TBI severity'''<ref name=RaoLyketsos>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Rao V, Lyketsos C |title=Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of Traumatic Brain Injury |journal=Psychosomatics |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013103 |year=2000 |pmid=10749946 |doi=10.1176/appi.psy.41.2.95 \n}}\n</ref>\n! &nbsp; !!

The retrospective method, however, fails to account for the apparent lucidity of patients who are still experiencing substantial disorientation, or the finding that the recovery from post-traumatic amnesia is often characterized by the presence of \"islands of memory\" (short periods of clarity).<ref name = Ahmed/> A failure to take these facts into consideration may have biased retrospective methods towards underestimating the length and severity of an episode of PTA.<ref name = Ahmed/> Also, the retrospective method relies on [[retrospective memory]], one's memory for past events, which is not very reliable in healthy individuals, and even less so in patients who have recently experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients may also unconsciously or consciously bias their answers because they want to appear more healthy or more ill than they truly were, or because of poor insight.<ref name = Ahmed/> The retrospective method is also flawed because there is no standard measurement procedure.<ref name = Ahmed/> Although the retrospective method may provide useful subjective data, it is not a useful tool for measurement or categorization.\n\n====GOAT====\nThe Galveston Orientation and Amnesia Test (GOAT) is the most frequently used test for assessing PTA in the United States and Canada. The test consists of 10 items that involve the recall of events that occurred right before and after the injury, as well as questions about [[disorientation]]. Scores of 75 or more on this scale (out of a total possible score of 100) correspond to the termination  of the PTA episode. The GOAT typically classifies orientation into three categories: orientation to the person, orientation to the place, and orientation to the time. The idea behind these questions is that each of these classifications places a large demand on the patient's memory and learning abilities.<ref name = Ahmed/>\n\n====WPTAS and AWPTAS====\nThe [[Westmead Post-Traumatic Amnesia Scale]] (WPTAS)<ref name=\"Shores1986\"/><ref name=\"mqpta\"/> is commonly used in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Seeman2014\"/> It questions twelve questions that examine orientation to person, place and time, in addition to the ability to consistently remember new information from one day to the next. The scale is administered once each day, until the patient scores 12/12 on three consecutive days. The WPTAS is suitable for patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury. An abbreviated version of the WPTAS, the [http://www.psy.mq.edu.au/gcs Abbreviated Westmead PTA Scale] (AWPTAS) assesses patients with mild traumatic brain injury.<ref name=\"Meares2011\"/>\n\n=====Drawbacks=====\nAlthough the GOAT has proved useful in acute care, recent research has called attention to some of its drawbacks. The GOAT's assessment of orientation may put too much of a focus on memory as the main mechanism behind orientation. The range of cognitive and behavioral symptoms associated with PTA seems to indicate that the patient's disorientation is more than just a memory deficit. Consequently, it may be beneficial to incorporate tests of other cognitive functions, such as attention, which relate to both memory and orientation.<ref name=Tittle/>\n\nAnother recent study compared the success of the GOAT and the Orientation Log (O-Log) in predicting rehabilitation outcomes, and found that, while the O-Log and the GOAT perform similarly as measures of PTA severity and duration, the O-Log provides a more accurate picture of rehabilitation.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Frey K.

However, Eames et al. (1999) found statistically significant improvements on several tests of memory with the use of a vasopressin nasal spray, with no reported ill effects.<ref name = Eames/> Although the degree of improvement was mild, and it could be attributed to numerous other factors of the rehabilitative program, the lack of any ill effects suggests that vasopressin is, at the least, a possible enhancement for a treatment regimen.<ref name = Eames/>\n\n===Norepinephrine agonists===\n[[Diaschisis]], as mentioned earlier, has been linked to the mechanism of PTA. The noradrenergic systems may play a role in diaschisis. [[Norepinephrine]], also known as noradrenalin, is a [[catecholamine]] [[neurotransmitter]].  Administering a norepinephrine receptor [[agonist]] (a substance that initiates a cell response when it binds with a receptor) to patients promoted the recovery of memory and many other cognitive functions after a traumatic brain injury.<ref name = Feeney/> Conversely,  the administration of norpinephrine [[antagonist]]s slowed recovery, and could lead to the reinstatement of deficits when administered after recovery. Noradrenergic antagonists were not prescribed for the purposes of slowing the recovery of memory. Rather, these findings are based on the effects of other commonly prescribed drugs that happen to block noradrenergic receptors. The [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor]] is specifically implicated.<ref name = Feeney/> Although it has not yet been thoroughly investigated, there is potential for [[stimulants]], which promote catecholamine release, to be an effective treatment in the early stages of recovery from brain trauma, and these positive effects could reduce the symptoms of PTA.<ref name=\"pmid8959228\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Feeney DM |title=From laboratory to clinic: noradrenergic enhancement of physical therapy for stroke or trauma patients |journal=Adv Neurol |volume=73 |issue= |pages=383\u201394 |year=1997 |pmid=8959228 }}</ref>\n==Research==\n\n===The North Star Project ===\nThe North Star Project was developed by researchers at [[McGill University]]. Researchers developed a \"reality orientation\", which involved discussing general facts (e.g. date, time, names of family members, etc.) with amnesic patients twice a day in an attempt to lessen their confusion during the early stages of their recovery. Younger patients often had  shorter amnesic episodes than older patients, especially those in the North Star group. Although more improvements were noted in the North Star group than in the control group, researchers did not find a statistically significant effect of their intervention.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=De Guise E. |author2=Leblanc J. |author3=Feyz M. |author4=Thomas H. |author5=Gosselin N. | year = 2005 | title = Effect of an integrated reality orientation programme in acute care on post-traumatic amnesia in patients with traumatic brain injury | url = | journal = Brain Injury | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 263\u2013269 | doi=10.1080/02699050400004971}}</ref>\n\n====Findings====\nA comprehensive analysis of literature based on the effects of early rehabilitation of traumatic brain injury concluded that there is no strong evidence linking any one particular practice of post-injury care to a reduced severity in symptoms. However,  even in the absence of a concrete correlation between a specific rehabilitation program and improved outcomes, the evidence and research available can provide many good suggestions for how to proceed with treatment. All rehabilitation strategies reviewed had positive effects on recovery, but none more so than the others.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Langhorn L. |author2=Sorensen J. C. |author3=Pedersen P.

Symonds===\n\nAlthough Franklin described PTA, it was the British physician C. P. Symonds who first discussed the specific amnesiac symptoms that often follow a [[cerebral contusion]], which is a specific kind of traumatic brain injury. Symonds observed that the patient remains \"stuperose, restless and irritable\"<ref name = Symonds>{{cite journal | author = Symonds C.

He also identified a recovery period of days to weeks for this post-concussive state.<ref name = Symonds/> Presumably, shorter durations of PTA, which are now included in the definition, were not thought to be serious enough for documentation. Most importantly, he identified the amnesia that the patient experiences during this period of recovery, and recommended the use of \"formal tests for memory and retention\" to assess recovery.<ref name = Symonds/>\n\n===In WWI soldiers===\n\n[[File:Shellshock2.jpg|thumb|left|Image from WWI, taken in an Australian dressing station near Ypres in 1917. The wounded soldier in the lower left of the photo has a dazed stare, a frequent symptom of \"shell shock\".]]\n\nAlthough there was a general lack of knowledge about its mechanisms, a review of patients seen during WWI combat reveals the symptoms of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) in many soldiers. The term [[shell shock]] was used to refer to the acute psychological state that accompanied exposure to exploding shells, and more generally, exposure to combat conditions.<ref name = Hart>{{cite journal |author1=van der Hart O. |author2=Brown P. |author3=Graafland M. | year = 1999 | title = Trauma-induced dissociative amnesia in World War I combat soldiers | url = | journal = Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 37\u201346 | doi = 10.1046/j.1440-1614.1999.00508.x |pmid=10197884 }}</ref> There are a number of documented cases of shell shock victims. These soldiers commonly displayed dizziness, varying degrees of consciousness, a loss of non-traumatic personal information, and a lack of normal [[self-awareness]] lasting anywhere from hours to days. Many of the symptoms of shell shock are highly similar to those of PTA.<ref name=Hart/> The following excerpt from a case report illustrates the loss of personal information observed in one patient:\n{{cquote|A soldier was assessed three days after having been admitted into a field ambulance. He was unable to give his name, regiment, or number, and he could not be identified. He could remember being found on the outskirts of a village, but his military history and all events in his past including his childhood were a complete blank.<ref>Myers, 6, quoted in Hart, O. v. d., Brown, P., & Graafland, M. (1999). Trauma-induced dissociative amnesia in World War I combat soldiers.

Concussions could account for the [[anterograde amnesia]] and [[retrograde amnesia]] observed in patients, as well as the periods of fluctuating consciousness or delirium that sometimes followed. However, many soldiers who showed these amnesiac effects did not suffer injuries that would have led to concussions.<ref name=Hart/> As a result, there was controversy over the possible causes of PTA in these non-concussed soldiers, with a separation between proponents of [[Freudian]] [[Psychological repression|repression]] and those supporting a [[dissociative]] view of the condition. This dissociative view was ultimately supported, and accounted for the [[fugue state]] seen in soldiers who were thought to have dissociated from normal consciousness.<ref name=Hart/>\n\n==Other psychological disorders ==\n\nResearchers have investigated the relationship between posttraumatic amnesia (PTA) resulting from traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of symptoms of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) and [[acute stress disorder]] (ASD). 282 outpatients, who were an average of 53 days post-TBI in their recovery, were divided into four groups: PTA episode lasting less than one hour; PTA episode lasting between one hour and 24 hours; PTA episode lasting between 24 hours and one week; and PTA episode lasting for longer than one week. The patients' personal details were used as variables classified for age, gender, marital status, time elapsed between injury and assessment, and type of injury (motor vehicle accident, pedestrian, assault and other). Patients were given two [[self-report inventories]]: the Impact of Event Scale (IES) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). The IES measures  symptoms of PTSD and contains questions regarding the intrusiveness of the traumatic event (ex. nightmares) and avoidant behaviours related to the traumatic event (ex. avoiding a certain location).<ref name =Feinstein/>  The GHQ was used as an indicator of overall psychological health.<ref name =Feinstein>Feinstein, A., Hershkop, S., Ouchterlony, D., Jardine, A., & McCullagh, S. (2002). Posttraumatic amnesia and recall of a traumatic event following traumatic brain injury. ''Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 14''(1), 25-30.  doi: {{PMID|10}}.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.25 195251885.</ref> The majority of subjects were in Group 1 (PTA episode lasting less than one hour), injured in motor vehicle accidents, and male.\n\nThere were no statistical differences found with regards to age, gender, marital status and type of injury. There was an increase in the severity of all indicators of brain damage for the longest durations of PTA; specifically, the GCS scores for this group decreased and the number of patients with an abnormal CT scan increased.<ref name = Feinstein/> There were significant differences in IES scores when comparing the group with the least serious episode of PTA, lasting less than an hour, to all other groups, with the duration of the episode of PTA lasting longer than an hour. The group with an episode of PTA lasting less than an hour had higher IES scores and more intrusive and avoidant symptoms.<ref name = Feinstein/> The fact that GHQ scores were constant throughout all groups, although there were differences in IES scores, suggests that the two scores measure different phenomena.<ref name = Feinstein/>\n\n==Aging==\n[[File:Elderly Woman, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|left|An elderly woman]]\nGrey and white matter are both found in the many areas of the brain, as well as throughout the central nervous system. [[Grey matter]] is more involved in nerve function, and [[white matter]] is more involved in nerve maintenance,  as well as the regulation of unconscious functions. However, both are important for memory and learning. The volume of grey and white matter in the brains of aging individuals has been correlated with working memory and retention of cognitive function.<ref name = Schonberger/> Researchers hypothesized that the lesions of both grey and white matter would be larger in older individuals and in those with more severe traumatic brain injuries, and longer episodes of PTA, and the volume of grey and white matter would be smaller in those injured at an older age. A group of 98 participants, predominantly male, were examined using fMRI. The results supported these hypotheses, leading researchers to suggest that the impact of traumatic brain injury gets more severe as age progresses.<ref name = Schonberger>Sch\u00f6nberger, M., Ponsford, J., Reutens, D., Beare, R., & O'Sullivan, R. (2009). The Relationship between age, injury, severity, and MRI findings after traumatic brain injury. ''Journal of Neurotrauma, 26''(2), 2157-2167. doi: 10. 1089/neu.2009.0939.</ref>\n\nAlthough grey and white matter volume was reduced throughout the brain, researchers noted that the grey matter of the [[neocortical]] brain regions was particularly affected.<ref name = Schonberger/> This is consistent with the fact that older individuals who had experienced PTA showed greater cognitive impairments than a control group of individuals of the same age who had not experienced PTA. The duration of the episode of PTA was related to the size of the grey matter lesion; longer episodes of PTA correlated with larger grey matter lesions. Advanced age also correlated with reduced [[glial]] activity. With less grey matter, the patient is less able to retrieve memories effectively, as neuron function is impaired.<ref name = Schonberger />\n\n==Controversies==\nOn the topic of trauma and memory, [[Richard McNally]] (2005) wrote that memories are not videotapes of our experiences, meaning that they are not unchangeable records.<ref name = Mcnally>{{cite journal | author = McNally R | year = 2005 | title = Debunking Myths about Trauma and Memory | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 13| pages = 817\u2013822 | doi = 10.1177/070674370505001302 | pmid = 16483114 }}</ref> The mechanism that retrieves a memory involves activation of several areas of the brain. Similarly, the mechanism that encodes a memory requires the use of different parts of the brain. Any fault in the encoding-retrieval system will degrade memory, and there are many potential faults, such as distortion by emotion, or focusing on the peripheral details at the expense of central details.<ref name = Mcnally/> An example of the latter is the well-known phenomenon where a person being robbed at gunpoint is so distracted by the gun that they don't have time to encode the robber's face.<ref name = Mcnally/>\n\nMisconstruing retrieval failure as traumatic amnesia is not the same phenomenon as post-traumatic amnesia, which describes amnesia for the current elapsing time post-trauma, not amnesia for trauma from the past. Typically, \"[[repressed memory]]\" is the term used to explain this sort of traumatic amnesia; the experience was so horrific that the adult cannot process what occurred years before.<ref name = Mcnally/> The topic of repressed memory is controversial within psychology; many clinicians argue for its importance, while researchers remain skeptical of its existence. A more viable explanation for this forgetting is [[childhood amnesia]], a phenomenon describing the fact that most children do not have recall of events in their lives before the age of three, partially due to the lack of development of cognitive elements such as language.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{memory}}\n\n[[Category:Amnesia]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Neurotrauma]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_amnesia"}
