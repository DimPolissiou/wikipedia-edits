The role of NK cells is analogous to that of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s in the vertebrate [[adaptive immune response]]. NK cells provide rapid responses to [[virus]]-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after [[infection]], and respond to [[tumor]] formation.  Typically, [[immune cells]] detect the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering [[cytokine]] release, causing [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]]. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of [[antibodies]] and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction.  They were named \"natural killers\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing \"self\" markers of MHC class 1.<ref name=Vivier2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vivier E, Raulet DH, Moretta A, Caligiuri MA, Zitvogel L, Lanier LL, Yokoyama WM, Ugolini S | title = Innate or adaptive immunity?

The MHC-independent receptors (described above) use an alternate pathway to induce apoptosis in infected cells.

They bind viral ligands such as hemagglutinins and hemagglutinin neuraminidases, some bacterial ligands and cellular ligands related with tumour growth such as [[PCNA]].\n*'''[[CD16]] ([[CD16|Fc&gamma;IIIA]])''' plays a role in [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]; in particular, they bind [[IgG]].\n\n===Inhibitory receptors===\n*[[Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor]]s (KIRs) belong to a multigene family of more recently [[evolution|evolved]] Ig-like extracellular domain receptors; they are present in nonhuman primates, and are the main receptors for both classical MHC I ([[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], [[HLA-C]]) and nonclassical Mamu-G ([[HLA-G]]) in primates. Some KIRs are specific for certain HLA subtypes. Most KIRs are inhibitory and dominant. Regular cells express MHC class 1, so are recognised by KIR receptors and NK cell killing is inhibited.<ref name=Lannello2008/>\n* '''[[CD94/NKG2]]''' (heterodimers), a C-type lectin family receptor, is conserved in both rodents and primates and identifies nonclassical (also nonpolymorphic) MHC I molecules such as [[HLA-E]]. Expression of HLA-E at the cell surface is dependent on the presence of nonamer peptide epitope derived from the signal sequence of classical MHC class I molecules, which is generated by the sequential action of [[signal peptide peptidase]] and the [[proteasome]]. Though indirect, this is a way to survey the levels of classical (polymorphic) HLA molecules.\n*'''ILT''' or '''LIR''' (immunoglobulin-like receptor) \u2014 are recently discovered members of the Ig receptor family.\t\n* '''Ly49''' (homodimers) have both activating and inhibitory isoforms. They are highly polymorphic on the population level; though they are structurally unrelated to KIRs, they are the functional homologues of KIRs in mice, including the expression pattern. Ly49s are receptor for classical (polymorphic) MHC I molecules.\n\n== Function ==\n\n===Cytolytic granule mediated cell apoptosis===\nNK cells are [[cytotoxic]]; small [[Granulocytes|granules]] in their [[cytoplasm]] contain proteins such as [[perforin]] and [[protease]]s known as [[granzyme]]s. Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the [[cell membrane]] of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either [[apoptosis]] or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell [[lysis]] is important in [[immunology]]: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially only release the [[virion]]s, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. [[Alpha defensin|&alpha;-defensins]], antimicrobial molecules, are also secreted by NK cells, and directly kill bacteria by disrupting their cell walls in a manner analogous to that of [[neutrophil]]s.<ref name=Lannello2008/>\n\n===Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity===\nInfected cells are routinely [[opsonized]] with antibodies for detection by immune cells.  Antibodies that bind to antigens can be recognised by Fc\u03d2RIII ([[CD16]]) receptors expressed on NK cells, resulting in NK activation, release of cytolytic granules and consequent cell [[apoptosis]]. This is a major killing mechanism of some [[monoclonal antibodies]] like [[rituximab | rituximab (Rituxan)]], [[ofatumumab | ofatumumab (Azzera)]], and others. The contribution of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cell killing can be measured with a specific test that uses [[NK-92]] that has been transfected with a high-affinity FcR. Results are compared to the \"wild type\" NK-92 that does not express the FcR.<ref name=Smyth2002>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smyth MJ, Hayakawa Y, Takeda K, Yagita H | title = New aspects of natural-killer-cell surveillance and therapy of cancer | journal = Nature Reviews.

As these are [[Stress (biology)|stress]] molecules released by cells upon viral infection, they serve to signal to the NK cell the presence of [[virus|viral pathogens]] in the affected area. Cytokines involved in NK activation include [[interleukin 12|IL-12]], [[interleukin 15|IL-15]], [[interleukin 18|IL-18]], [[interleukin 2|IL-2]], and [[CCL5]]. NK cells are activated in response to interferons or macrophage-derived cytokines. They serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific [[cytotoxic T cells]] that can clear the infection. NK cells work to control viral infections by secreting IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. IFN\u03b3 activates macrophages for phagocytosis and lysis, and TNF\u03b1 acts to promote direct NK tumor cell killing.  Patients deficient in NK cells prove to be highly susceptible to early phases of herpes virus infection.\n\n===Missing 'self' hypothesis===\n[[Image:Missingself.svg|thumb|right|400px| Schematic diagram indicating the complementary activities of [[cytotoxic T cells]] and NK cells]]\nFor NK cells to defend the body against [[viruses]] and other [[pathogens]], they require mechanisms that enable the determination of whether a cell is infected or not. The exact mechanisms remain the subject of current investigation, but recognition of an \"altered self\" state is thought to be involved. To control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells possess two types of surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:  activating receptors and inhibitory receptors, including [[killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors]]. Most of these receptors are not unique to NK cells and can be present in some [[T cell]] subsets, as well.\n\nThe inhibitory receptors recognize [[MHC class I]] [[allele]]s, which could explain why NK cells preferentially kill cells that possess low levels of MHC class I molecules. This mode of NK cell target interaction is known as \"missing-self recognition\", a term coined by [[Klas K\u00e4rre]] and co-workers in the late 90s. MHC class I molecules are the main mechanism by which cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this is seen in both intracellular [[microbes]] and tumors: the chronic down-regulation of MHC I molecules, which makes affected cells invisible to T cells, allowing them to evade T cell-mediated immunity. NK cells apparently evolved as an evolutionary response to this adaptation (the loss of the MHC eliminates CD4/CD8 action, so another immune cell evolved to fulfill the function).<ref name=Lodoen>{{Cite_journal| vauthors = Lodoen MB, Lanier LL| title = Viral modulation of NK cell immunity | journal=[[Nature Reviews Microbiology]] | volume=3 | issue = 1 | year=2005 | pages=59\u201369| doi=10.1038/nrmicro1066| pmid = 15608700 }}</ref>\n\n===Tumor cell surveillance===\nNatural killer cells often lack antigen-specific cell surface receptors, so are part of innate immunity, ''i.e.'' able to react immediately with no prior exposure to the pathogen.  In both mice and humans, NKs can be seen to play a role in tumor immunosurveillance by directly inducing the death of tumor cells (NKs act as cytolytic effector lymphocytes), even in the absence of surface adhesion molecules and antigenic peptides. This role of NK cells is critical to immune success particularly because T cells are unable to recognize pathogens in the absence of surface antigens.<ref name=Vivier2011/>  Tumor cell detection results in activation of NK cells and consequent cytokine production and release.\n\nIf tumor cells do not cause inflammation, they will also be regarded as self and will not induce a T cell response. A number of cytokines are produced by NKs, including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 ([[TNF&alpha;]]), [[IFN&gamma;]], and [[interleukin]] ([[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]). TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 act as proinflammatory and immunosuppressors, respectively. The activation of NK cells and subsequent production of cytolytic effector cells impacts [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cells]], and [[neutrophils]], which subsequently enables antigen-specific T and B cell responses. Instead of acting via antigen-specific receptors, lysis of tumor cells by NK cells is mediated by alternative receptors, including [[NKG2D]], NKp44, NKp46, NKp30, and DNAM.<ref name=Terunuma2008/> [[NKG2D]] is a [[disulfide bond|disulfide]]-linked [[homodimer]] which recognizes a number of ligands, including ULBP and [[MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A|MICA]], which are typically expressed on tumor cells. The role of dendritic cell\u2014NK cell interface in immunobiology have been studied and defined as critical for the comprehension of the complex immune system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nNK cells, along with [[macrophage]]s and several other cell types, express the Fc receptor (FcR) molecule (FC-gamma-RIII = CD16), an activating biochemical [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] that binds the [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc]] portion of IgG class [[Antibody|antibodies]]. This allows NK cells to target cells against which a [[Humoral immunity|humoral response]] has been gone through and to [[lysis|lyse]] cells through antibody-dependant cytotoxicity (ADCC). This response depends on the affinity of the Fc receptor expressed on NK cells, which can have high, intermediate, and low affinity for the Fc portion of the antibody. This affinity is determined by the amino acid in position 158 of the protein, which can be phenylalanine (F allele) or valine (V allele). Individuals with high-affinity FcRgammRIII (158 V/V allele) respond better to antibody therapy. This has been shown for lymphoma patients who received the antibody Rituxan. Patients who express the 158 V/V allele had a better antitumor response. Only 15\u201325% of the population expresses the 158 V/V allele. To determine the ADCC contribution of monoclonal antibodies, NK-92 cells (a \"pure\" NK cell line) has been transfected with the gene for the high-affinity FcR.\n\n===Adaptive features of NK cells\u2014\"memory-like\", \"adaptive\" and memory NK cells===\n{{Main|Adaptive NK cells}}\nThe ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role that T and B cells play in the adaptive immune response.  For many years, NK cells have been considered to be a part of the innate immune system. However, recently increasing evidence suggests that NK cells can display several features that are usually attributed to adaptive immune cells (e.g. T cell responses) such as dynamic expansion and contraction of subsets, increased longevity and a form of immunological memory, characterized by a more potent response upon secondary challenge with the same antigen.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = R\u00f6lle A, Pollmann J, Cerwenka A | title = Memory of infections: an emerging role for natural killer cells | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = e1003548 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24086127 | pmc = 3784484 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003548 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pyzik M, Vidal SM | title = Natural killer cells: NK cells stroll down the memory lane | journal = Immunology and Cell Biology | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 261\u20133 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19290015 | doi = 10.1038/icb.2009.10 }}</ref>\nIn mice, the majority of research was carried out with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and in models of hapten-hypersensitivity reactions.

The role of NK cells is analogous to that of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s in the vertebrate [[adaptive immune response]]. NK cells provide rapid responses to [[virus]]-infected cells, acting at around 3 days after [[infection]], and respond to [[tumor]] formation.  Typically, [[immune cells]] detect the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) presented on infected cell surfaces, triggering [[cytokine]] release, causing [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]]. NK cells are unique, however, as they have the ability to recognize stressed cells in the absence of [[antibodies]] and MHC, allowing for a much faster immune reaction.  They were named \"natural killers\" because of the initial notion that they do not require activation to kill cells that are missing \"self\" markers of MHC class 1.<ref name=Vivier2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vivier E, Raulet DH, Moretta A, Caligiuri MA, Zitvogel L, Lanier LL, Yokoyama WM, Ugolini S | title = Innate or adaptive immunity?

NK Cells are not a subset of the T lymphocyte family. Natural [[cytotoxicity]] receptors directly induce [[apoptosis]] (cell death) after binding to [[Fas ligand]] that directly indicate infection of a cell. The MHC-independent receptors (described above) use an alternate pathway to induce apoptosis in infected cells. Natural killer cell activation is determined by the balance of inhibitory and activating receptor stimulation. For example, if the inhibitory receptor signaling is more prominent, then NK cell activity will be inhibited; similarly, if the activating signal is dominant, then NK cell activation will result.<ref name=Terunuma2008>{{cite journal | vauthors = Terunuma H, Deng X, Dewan Z, Fujimoto S, Yamamoto N | title = Potential role of NK cells in the induction of immune responses: implications for NK cell-based immunotherapy for cancers and viral infections | journal = International Reviews of Immunology | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 93\u2013110 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18437601 | doi = 10.1080/08830180801911743 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:PDB 1hq8 EBI.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Protein structure of NKG2D]]\nNK cell receptor types (with inhibitory, as well as some activating members) are differentiated by structure, with a few examples to follow:\n[[File:PDB 1hkf EBI.jpg|150px|thumb|Protein structure of NKp44]]\n\n===Activating receptors===\n*'''[[Ly49]] '''(homodimers),  relatively ancient, C-type [[lectin]] family receptors, are of multigenic presence in mice, while humans have only one [[pseudogene|pseudogenic]] Ly49, the receptor for classical (polymorphic) [[MHC I]] molecules.\n*'''NCR''' (natural cytotoxicity receptors), a type of type 1 transmembrane proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily, upon stimulation, mediate NK killing and release of IFN\u03b3.

Some KIRs are specific for certain HLA subtypes. Most KIRs are inhibitory and dominant.

They are highly polymorphic on the population level; though they are structurally unrelated to KIRs, they are the functional homologues of KIRs in mice, including the expression pattern. Ly49s are receptor for classical (polymorphic) MHC I molecules.\n\n== Function ==\n\n===Cytolytic granule mediated cell apoptosis===\nNK cells are [[cytotoxic]]; small [[Granulocytes|granules]] in their [[cytoplasm]] contain proteins such as [[perforin]] and [[protease]]s known as [[granzyme]]s. Upon release in close proximity to a cell slated for killing, perforin forms pores in the [[cell membrane]] of the target cell, creating an aqueous channel through which the granzymes and associated molecules can enter, inducing either [[apoptosis]] or osmotic cell lysis. The distinction between apoptosis and cell [[lysis]] is important in [[immunology]]: lysing a virus-infected cell could potentially only release the [[virion]]s, whereas apoptosis leads to destruction of the virus inside. [[Alpha defensin|&alpha;-defensins]], antimicrobial molecules, are also secreted by NK cells, and directly kill bacteria by disrupting their cell walls in a manner analogous to that of [[neutrophil]]s.<ref name=Lannello2008/>\n\n===Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity===\nInfected cells are routinely [[opsonized]] with antibodies for detection by immune cells.  Antibodies that bind to antigens can be recognised by Fc\u03d2RIII ([[CD16]]) receptors expressed on NK cells, resulting in NK activation, release of cytolytic granules and consequent cell [[apoptosis]]. This is a major killing mechanism of some [[monoclonal antibodies]] like [[rituximab | rituximab (Rituxan)]], [[ofatumumab | ofatumumab (Azzera)]], and others. The contribution of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to tumor cell killing can be measured with a specific test that uses [[NK-92]] that has been transfected with a high-affinity FcR. Results are compared to the \"wild type\" NK-92 that does not express the FcR.<ref name=Smyth2002>{{cite journal | vauthors = Smyth MJ, Hayakawa Y, Takeda K, Yagita H | title = New aspects of natural-killer-cell surveillance and therapy of cancer | journal = Nature Reviews.

As these are [[Stress (biology)|stress]] molecules released by cells upon viral infection, they serve to signal to the NK cell the presence of [[virus|viral pathogens]] in the affected area. Cytokines involved in NK activation include [[interleukin 12|IL-12]], [[interleukin 15|IL-15]], [[interleukin 18|IL-18]], [[interleukin 2|IL-2]], and [[CCL5]]. NK cells are activated in response to interferons or macrophage-derived cytokines. They serve to contain viral infections while the adaptive immune response generates antigen-specific [[cytotoxic T cells]] that can clear the infection. NK cells work to control viral infections by secreting IFN\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1. IFN\u03b3 activates macrophages for phagocytosis and lysis, and TNF\u03b1 acts to promote direct NK tumor cell killing.  Patients deficient in NK cells prove to be highly susceptible to early phases of herpes virus infection.\n\n===Missing 'self' hypothesis===\n[[Image:Missingself.svg|thumb|right|400px| Schematic diagram indicating the complementary activities of [[cytotoxic T cells]] and NK cells]]\nFor NK cells to defend the body against [[viruses]] and other [[pathogens]], they require mechanisms that enable the determination of whether a cell is infected or not. The exact mechanisms remain the subject of current investigation, but recognition of an \"altered self\" state is thought to be involved. To control their cytotoxic activity, NK cells possess two types of surface [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s:  activating receptors and inhibitory receptors, including [[killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors]]. Most of these receptors are not unique to NK cells and can be present in some [[T cell]] subsets, as well.\n\nThe inhibitory receptors recognize [[MHC class I]] [[allele]]s, which could explain why NK cells preferentially kill cells that possess low levels of MHC class I molecules. This mode of NK cell target interaction is known as \"missing-self recognition\", a term coined by [[Klas K\u00e4rre]] and co-workers in the late 90s. MHC class I molecules are the main mechanism by which cells display viral or tumor antigens to cytotoxic T cells. A common evolutionary adaptation to this is seen in both intracellular [[microbes]] and tumors: the chronic down-regulation of MHC I molecules, which makes affected cells invisible to T cells, allowing them to evade T cell-mediated immunity. NK cells apparently evolved as an evolutionary response to this adaptation (the loss of the MHC eliminates CD4/CD8 action, so another immune cell evolved to fulfill the function).<ref name=Lodoen>{{Cite_journal| vauthors = Lodoen MB, Lanier LL| title = Viral modulation of NK cell immunity | journal=[[Nature Reviews Microbiology]] | volume=3 | issue = 1 | year=2005 | pages=59\u201369| doi=10.1038/nrmicro1066| pmid = 15608700 }}</ref>\n\n===Tumor cell surveillance===\nNatural killer cells often lack antigen-specific cell surface receptors, so are part of innate immunity, ''i.e.'' able to react immediately with no prior exposure to the pathogen.  In both mice and humans, NKs can be seen to play a role in tumor immunosurveillance by directly inducing the death of tumor cells (NKs act as cytolytic effector lymphocytes), even in the absence of surface adhesion molecules and antigenic peptides. This role of NK cells is critical to immune success particularly because T cells are unable to recognize pathogens in the absence of surface antigens.<ref name=Vivier2011/>  Tumor cell detection results in activation of NK cells and consequent cytokine production and release.\n\nIf tumor cells do not cause inflammation, they will also be regarded as self and will not induce a T cell response. A number of cytokines are produced by NKs, including tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 ([[TNF&alpha;]]), [[IFN&gamma;]], and [[interleukin]] ([[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]). TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 act as proinflammatory and immunosuppressors, respectively. The activation of NK cells and subsequent production of cytolytic effector cells impacts [[macrophages]], [[dendritic cells]], and [[neutrophils]], which subsequently enables antigen-specific T and B cell responses. Instead of acting via antigen-specific receptors, lysis of tumor cells by NK cells is mediated by alternative receptors, including [[NKG2D]], NKp44, NKp46, NKp30, and DNAM.<ref name=Terunuma2008/> [[NKG2D]] is a [[disulfide bond|disulfide]]-linked [[homodimer]] which recognizes a number of ligands, including ULBP and [[MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A|MICA]], which are typically expressed on tumor cells. The role of dendritic cell\u2014NK cell interface in immunobiology have been studied and defined as critical for the comprehension of the complex immune system.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}}\n\nNK cells, along with [[macrophage]]s and several other cell types, express the Fc receptor (FcR) molecule (FC-gamma-RIII = CD16), an activating biochemical [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] that binds the [[Fragment crystallizable region|Fc]] portion of IgG class [[Antibody|antibodies]]. This allows NK cells to target cells against which a [[Humoral immunity|humoral response]] has been gone through and to [[lysis|lyse]] cells through antibody-dependant cytotoxicity (ADCC). This response depends on the affinity of the Fc receptor expressed on NK cells, which can have high, intermediate, and low affinity for the Fc portion of the antibody. This affinity is determined by the amino acid in position 158 of the protein, which can be phenylalanine (F allele) or valine (V allele). Individuals with high-affinity FcRgammRIII (158 V/V allele) respond better to antibody therapy. This has been shown for lymphoma patients who received the antibody Rituxan. Patients who express the 158 V/V allele had a better antitumor response. Only 15\u201325% of the population expresses the 158 V/V allele. To determine the ADCC contribution of monoclonal antibodies, NK-92 cells (a \"pure\" NK cell line) has been transfected with the gene for the high-affinity FcR.\n\n===Adaptive features of NK cells\u2014\"memory-like\", \"adaptive\" and memory NK cells===\n{{Main|Adaptive NK cells}}\nThe ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role that T and B cells play in the adaptive immune response.  For many years, NK cells have been considered to be a part of the innate immune system. However, recently increasing evidence suggests that NK cells can display several features that are usually attributed to adaptive immune cells (e.g. T cell responses) such as dynamic expansion and contraction of subsets, increased longevity and a form of immunological memory, characterized by a more potent response upon secondary challenge with the same antigen.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = R\u00f6lle A, Pollmann J, Cerwenka A | title = Memory of infections: an emerging role for natural killer cells | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = e1003548 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24086127 | pmc = 3784484 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1003548 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pyzik M, Vidal SM | title = Natural killer cells: NK cells stroll down the memory lane | journal = Immunology and Cell Biology | volume = 87 | issue = 4 | pages = 261\u20133 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19290015 | doi = 10.1038/icb.2009.10 }}</ref>\nIn mice, the majority of research was carried out with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and in models of hapten-hypersensitivity reactions.

These soluble NKG2D ligands bind to NK cell NKG2D receptors, activating a false NK response and consequently creating competition for the receptor site.<ref name=Vivier2011/>  This method of evasion occurs in [[prostate cancer]].  In addition, prostate cancer tumors can evade CD8 cell recognition due to their ability to downregulate expression of MHC class 1 molecules. This example of immune evasion actually highlights NK cells' importance in tumor surveillance and response, as CD8 cells can consequently only act on tumor cells in response to NK-initiated cytokine production (adaptive immune response).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary JG, Goodarzi M, Drayton DL, von Andrian UH | title = T cell- and B cell-independent adaptive immunity mediated by natural killer cells | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 507\u201316 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16617337 | doi = 10.1038/ni1332 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn early experiments on cell-mediated cytotoxicity against tumor target cells, both in cancer patients and animal models, investigators consistently observed what was termed a \"natural\" reactivity; that is, a certain population of cells seemed to be able to lyse tumor cells without having been previously sensitized to them.

Instead, investigators are working on using allogeneic cells from peripheral blood, which requires that all T cells be removed before infusion into the patients to remove the risk of [[graft versus host disease]]<!-- (GvHD) -->, which can be fatal. This can be achieved using an immunomagnetic column (CliniMACS). In addition, because of the limited number of NK cells in blood (only 10% of lymphocytes are NK cells), their number needs to be expanded in culture. This can take a few weeks and the yield is donor-dependent.

This is evident because patients expressing these HLA alleles are observed to have lower viral loads and a more gradual decline in [[T helper cell|CD4<sup>+</sup> T]] cells numbers.  Despite considerable research and data collected measuring the genetic correlation of HLA alleles and KIR allotypes, a firm conclusion has not yet been drawn as to what combination provides decreased HIV and AIDS susceptibility. <!-- Future research will aim to pinpoint relevant KIR/HLA interactions, to develop a vaccine against HIV/AIDS. -->\n\nNK cells can impose immune pressure on HIV, which had previously been described only for T cells and antibodies.<ref name=\"Alter et al.\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Alter G, Heckerman D, Schneidewind A, Fadda L, Kadie CM, Carlson JM, Oniangue-Ndza C, Martin M, Li B, Khakoo SI, Carrington M, Allen TM, Altfeld M | title = HIV-1 adaptation to NK-cell-mediated immune pressure | journal = Nature | volume = 476 | issue = 7358 | pages = 96\u2013100 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21814282 | pmc = 3194000 | doi = 10.1038/nature10237 }}</ref> HIV mutates to avoid NK cell activity.<ref name=\"Alter et al.\"/>\n\n=== Tissue-resident NK cells ===\nMost of our current knowledge is derived from investigations of mouse splenic and human peripheral blood NK cells.

The act was passed in 1830, although dialogue had been ongoing since 1802 between Georgia and the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] concerning such an event. Ethan Davis states that \"the federal government had promised Georgia that it would extinguish Indian title within the state's borders by purchase 'as soon as such purchase could be made upon reasonable terms'\".<ref>{{cite journal | title=An Administrative Trail of Tears: Indian Removal | authorlink= | last= Davis | first= Ethan | journal= The American Journal of Legal History|volume=50|issue=1 | pages= 50\u201355}}</ref> As time passed, southern states began to speed up the process by posing the argument that the deal between Georgia and the federal government had no contract and that southern states could pass the law themselves. This scheme forced the national government to pass the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830, in which President Jackson agreed to divide the United States territory west of the Mississippi into districts for tribes to replace the land from which they were removed.\n\nIn the 1823 case of ''[[Johnson v.

He opposed Washington's policy of establishing treaties with Indian tribes as if they were foreign nations. Thus, the creation of Indian jurisdictions was a violation of state sovereignty under [[Article Four of the United States Constitution#New states|Article IV, Section 3]] of the Constitution. As Jackson saw it, either Indians comprised sovereign states (which violated the Constitution) or they were subject to the laws of existing states of the Union. Jackson urged Indians to assimilate and obey state laws. Further, he believed that he could only accommodate the desire for Indian self-rule in federal territories, which required resettlement west of the Mississippi River on federal lands.<ref>{{cite book | title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times| authorlink=H.W.

He argued that it was, \"more precious in your [Liliburne's] esteem than it deserveth\", dismissing it as a small set of concessions \"wrestled out of the pawes\" of Norman conquerors and describing it as, \"a messe of pottage\", and (in the following year), \"but a beggerly thing containing many marks of intollerable bondage\".

([[Canadian French]]: {{lang|fr|Bell M\u00e9dia}}) is the [[mass media]] subsidiary of [[BCE Inc.]] (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the parent company of the former telephone monopoly [[Bell Canada]]). Its operations include [[television]] broadcasting and production (including the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2]] television networks), radio broadcasting (through [[iHeartRadio Canada]]), [[digital media]] (including [[CraveTV]]) and [[Internet]] properties including [[Sympatico]].ca.\n\nBell Media is the successor-in-interest to '''Baton Broadcasting''' (later '''CTV Inc.'''), one of Canada's first private-sector television broadcasters. The company in its current form was originally established as '''Bell Globemedia''' by BCE and [[The Woodbridge Company|the Thomson family]] in 2001 combining CTV Inc., which Bell had acquired the previous year, and the operations of the Thomsons' ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Bell sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (at which point the company was renamed '''CTVglobemedia'''), but re-acquired the entire company, excluding the ''Globe'', in 2011.\n\n==History==\n===History before 2011===\n====Baton Broadcasting====\n{{Redirect|Baton Broadcasting|the defunct television system owned by Baton|Baton Broadcast System}}\nFor all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to '''Baton Broadcasting Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|e\u026a|t|\u0252|n}} {{respell|BAY|ton}}), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada's largest broadcasters.\n\nBaton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. was originally formed in 1960 to operate Toronto's first private TV station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]]. The original investors included the [[John Bassett|''Ba''ssett]] and [[Eaton family|Ea''ton'']] families, [[Joel Aldred]] and [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.|Ted Rogers]], and [[Foster Hewitt]] in a much smaller role. Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970. With the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s.\n\nCFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network's flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned [[cooperative]]. The [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative's bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station's shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] in [[Saskatoon]]. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners.  As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV.  It started this drive with a further expansion into [[Saskatchewan]], purchasing [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Yorkton]] [[twinstick]] [[CKOS-TV]]/[[CICC-TV]], and CBC affiliate [[CKBI-TV]] [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, [[CIPA-TV]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in [[Ottawa]] on channel 60. The licence was approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), appealed to [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review.<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html Order Referring back to the CRTC a Decision Respecting Nation's Capital Television Incorporated] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181627/http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, 28 April 1987</ref> However the licence was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]], from [[Allan Slaight]]'s [[Standard Broadcasting]].\n\nIn 1990, Baton purchased the [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]] system of [[twinstick]] operations in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Timmins]], and the [[Huron Broadcasting]] twinstick in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. In 1993, Baton purchased [[CFPL-DT|CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CKNX-TV]] in [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]] and received a licence for a new independent station, [[CHWI-DT|CHWI-TV]], in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\nIn 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton's CTV and [[independent station]]s in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the [[Baton Broadcast System]], or BBS, which included Baton's Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton's ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3 percent stake in the network. However, any ''future'' acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate's CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive [[Ivan Fecan]] joined the company.\n\n====Baton-Electrohome alliance====\nIn 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of [[CFCN-DT|CFCN-TV]] in [[Calgary]] from [[Rogers Communications]], which had recently purchased [[Maclean Hunter]]. Second, Baton and [[Electrohome]], owner of [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton]], formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN, Baton's stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario, and Electrohome's CKCO. The deals doubled Baton's own interest in CTV to 28.6%.  However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome's CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV's shares.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-251.htm Decision CRTC 96-251], June 21, 1996</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Baton-Electrohome's \"Vancouver Television\" proposal emerged as the CRTC's choice for the new independent station in [[Vancouver]], beating out four other competitors. The new station, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]], would compete directly with [[Western International Communications]]'s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-39.htm Decision CRTC 97-39], January 31, 1997</ref>\n\nOn February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and [[CHUM Limited]] announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM's [[CTV Atlantic|Atlantic Television System]] (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the [[Maritimes]], the [[CTV 2 Atlantic|Atlantic Satellite Network]] (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton's independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as [[CHRO-TV]] in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.\n\nShortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets \u2013 including CFRN its interest in the alliance and its CTV shares \u2013 to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-527.HTM Decision CRTC 97-527], August 28, 1997</ref> Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a [[put option]] that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and [[Moffat Communications]], which remained affiliates for the moment, that fall.\n\nThe BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons' remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton, were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).\n\n====NetStar Communications====\nNetStar Communications Inc. (previously Labatt Communications Inc., and currently CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was formed by [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to hold that firm's broadcasting assets, which included TSN, RDS, [[Viewers Choice]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]. In 1995, when the parent company was sold to the foreign brewing conglomerate [[Interbrew]], a consortium of four Canadian investors - [[Stephen Bronfman]] (22.5%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec|the Caisse]] (22.5%), [[Reitmans]] (16.5%), and senior management (6.5%) - along with [[ESPN]], with 32%, took over the company.<ref>[http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf Broadcast Dialogue newsletter, January 21, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304175349/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a takeover attempt by [[CanWest Global]] that was vetoed by ESPN, CTV announced a friendly bid to take over NetStar Communications in early 1999, with CRTC approval on March 24, 2000.\n\n====Under BCE ownership: Bell Globemedia (2000-2006)====\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, CTV (including the NetStar assets) was folded into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc. (abbreviated \"BGM\"). This was masterminded by former [[Bell Canada]] chief executive [[Jean Monty]], largely as a response to [[Canwest]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain as well as the trend of [[media convergence]], particularly the [[AOL]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Monty believed that, to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to [[satellite television]] provider [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]]<!-- As it was known at the time. --> and [[internet service provider]] [[Bell Sympatico]], BCE had to have control over content.\n\nThe transaction was structured as follows: In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.3 billion ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/02/25/bcectv000225.html BCE announces $2.3 billion bid for CTV], CBC.ca, February 25, 2000 (modified November 11, 2000); accessed August 9, 2006</ref> Soon after, Monty arranged to have [[Thomson Corporation]] transfer control of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the [[Toronto]]-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant (20%) interest in the merged CTV/''Globe'' entity. The Thomsons' family holding company, [[The Woodbridge Company|The Woodbridge Company Ltd.]], invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and later bought Thomson Corp.'s interests itself.\n\nThe resulting company, Bell Globemedia, consisted of CTV, ''The Globe and Mail'', and the [[internet]] portal then known as [[Sympatico]]-[[Lycos]] (Lycos was later replaced by [[MSN]]). Fecan was named the combined firm's president and CEO, a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM / CTVgm era. After Monty resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Sabia]] in 2002, it became clear that Monty's vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.\n\nThe following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM's assets. In 2001, CTV acquired [[CKY-DT|CKY-TV]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CFCF-DT|CFCF-TV]] in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital [[specialty channel]]s, including several owned by CTV.\n\nThe company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.\n\n====Reorganization and CHUM Limited merger (2006-2011)====\n{{see also|CHUM Limited}}\n\nOn December 2, 2005, [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] (BCE) announced it would sell an 8.5% interest to Woodbridge (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to [[Torstar]], and a 20% interest to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. BCE retained 20% of the group - a condition that ensured that Bell TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Globemedia content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.<ref>\"[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html BGM Ownership Deal Closes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033123/http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html |date=December 2, 2007 }}\", BGM press release, August 30, 2006</ref>\n\nThis deal put to rest any rumours about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar's involvement led to additional [[media concentration]] concerns, mainly from media [[trade union|union]]s. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the [[editorial independence]] of the ''Globe'' and its own ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.\n\n{{Wikinews|Canadian media company Bell Globemedia to acquire rival CHUM}}On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over [[CHUM Limited]] for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system ([[Citytv]]), other stations including [[CP24|CablePulse24]], [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Star!]], [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]], and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]], and all of CHUM's radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM's [[CTV 2|A-Channel]] stations, [[Access (TV channel)|Access]], [[CKX-TV]], [[MusiquePlus]], [[MusiMax]], [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[Cooking Channel (Canadian TV channel)|SexTV: The Channel]] and BGM's own [[OLN]] would not be retained.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers' ownership to 25%, while BCE's interest was reduced to 15%.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html Bell Globemedia Completes Financing to Pay for CHUM Limited Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222027/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, BGM press release, September 7, 2006</ref> As a result of BCE's reduced ownership, the company was renamed as CTVglobemedia as of January 1, 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, [[Rogers Communications]] announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. [[Astral Media]] made a similar deal for CHUM's 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.\n\nThat June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network's O&O stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. [[Rogers Communications]] was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.\n\nSince then, CTVglobemedia has sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers has purchased several of these assets, including CTV's 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations [[CHST-FM]] in [[London, Ontario]] and [[CHBN-FM]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm Canada's Rogers Radio acquires Edmonton top 40 station 91.7 The Bounce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032732/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm |date=2010-06-27 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario Canada's Rogers Radio acquires 102.3 Bob FM in London, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804172359/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario |date=2011-08-04 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref> [[Corus Entertainment]] would acquire [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[SexTV: The Channel]], and [[Drive-In Classics]] for a combined $113 million.

([[Canadian French]]: {{lang|fr|Bell M\u00e9dia}}) is the [[mass media]] subsidiary of [[BCE Inc.]] (also known as Bell Canada Enterprises, the parent company of the former telephone monopoly [[Bell Canada]]). Its operations include [[television]] broadcasting and production (including the [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CTV 2]] television networks), radio broadcasting (through [[iHeartRadio Canada]]), [[digital media]] (including [[CraveTV]]) and [[Internet]] properties including [[Sympatico]].ca.\n\nBell Media is the successor-in-interest to '''Baton Broadcasting''' (later '''CTV Inc.'''), one of Canada's first private-sector television broadcasters. The company in its current form was originally established as '''Bell Globemedia''' by BCE and [[The Woodbridge Company|the Thomson family]] in 2001 combining CTV Inc., which Bell had acquired the previous year, and the operations of the Thomsons' ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. Bell sold the majority of its interest in 2006 (at which point the company was renamed '''CTVglobemedia'''), but re-acquired the entire company, excluding the ''Globe'', in 2011.\n\n==History==\n===History before 2011===\n====Baton Broadcasting====\n{{Redirect|Baton Broadcasting|the defunct television system owned by Baton|Baton Broadcast System}}\nFor all practical purposes, Bell Media is the successor to '''Baton Broadcasting Inc.''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|b|e\u026a|t|\u0252|n}} {{respell|BAY|ton}}), which by the late 1990s had become one of Canada's largest broadcasters.\n\nBaton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting Ltd. was originally formed in 1960 to operate Toronto's first private TV station, [[CFTO-DT|CFTO-TV]]. The original investors included the [[John Bassett|''Ba''ssett]] and [[Eaton's|Ea''ton'']] families, [[Joel Aldred]] and [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]], and [[Foster Hewitt]] in a much smaller role. Aldred sold his shares in 1961, followed by Rogers by 1970; with the Bassett and Eaton families firmly in control, the company went public in the early 1970s. CFTO was one of the charter affiliates of CTV when that network formed in 1961, becoming the network's flagship. In 1966, Baton became a part-owner in the network when it was reorganized as a station-owned [[cooperative]].  The [[Board of Broadcast Governors]] was initially skeptical about the proposal to turn CTV into a cooperative. Since CFTO was by far the largest and richest station in the network, the BBG feared Baton would take advantage of this to dominate the network. However, it approved the deal after Baton and the other owners included a provision in the cooperative's bylaws stipulating that the eight station owners would each have a single vote regardless of audience share. Additionally, if one owner ever bought another station, the acquired station's shares would be redistributed among the remaining owners so that each owner would still have one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1972, Baton began purchasing other CTV affiliates, starting with [[CFQC-DT|CFQC-TV]] in [[Saskatoon]]. This did not, however, give Baton a substantially higher investment in CTV, since its shares were redistributed among the other owners.  As a result, Baton still had only one vote out of eight.\n\nIn 1987, Baton began a concerted effort to take over CTV.  It started this drive with a further expansion into [[Saskatchewan]], purchasing [[CKCK-DT|CKCK-TV]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Yorkton]] [[twinstick]] [[CKOS-TV]]/[[CICC-TV]], and CBC affiliate [[CKBI-TV]] [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]]. A twinstick CTV affiliate was soon launched in Prince Albert, [[CIPA-TV]].\n\nIn the late 1980s, Baton applied for a high-power station in [[Ottawa]] on channel 60. The licence was approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), appealed to [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] by rival broadcasters, and ultimately sent back to the CRTC for review.<ref>[http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html Order Referring back to the CRTC a Decision Respecting Nation's Capital Television Incorporated] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706181627/http://lois.justice.gc.ca/en/B-9.01/SI-87-91/text.html |date=2011-07-06 }}, 28 April 1987</ref> However the licence was surrendered when Baton was instead able to acquire the local CTV affiliate, [[CJOH-DT|CJOH-TV]], from [[Allan Slaight]]'s [[Standard Broadcasting]].\n\nIn 1990, Baton purchased the [[Mid-Canada Communications|MCTV]] system of [[twinstick]] operations in [[Pembroke, Ontario|Pembroke]], [[North Bay, Ontario|North Bay]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Timmins]], and the [[Huron Broadcasting]] twinstick in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]]. In 1993, Baton purchased [[CFPL-DT|CFPL-TV]] in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[CKNX-TV]] in [[Wingham, Ontario|Wingham]] and received a licence for a new independent station, [[CHWI-DT|CHWI-TV]], in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]].\n\nIn 1991, the company launched Ontario Network Television, a secondary affiliation carried by Baton's CTV and [[independent station]]s in Ontario. This was expanded in 1994 into the [[Baton Broadcast System]], or BBS, which included Baton's Saskatchewan stations. BBS was meant as a backup in case Baton's ongoing acquisitions did not translate into control of CTV itself. A year earlier, CTV had been recently restructured into a corporation, with each owner holding a 14.3 percent stake in the network. However, any ''future'' acquisitions by Baton would come with all of that affiliate's CTV shares. It was around this time that former CBC executive [[Ivan Fecan]] joined the company.\n\n====Baton-Electrohome alliance====\nIn 1996, the CRTC approved two major deals involving Baton. First was the acquisition of [[CFCN-DT|CFCN-TV]] in [[Calgary]] from [[Rogers Communications]], which had recently purchased [[Maclean Hunter]]. Second, Baton and [[Electrohome]], owner of [[CKCO-DT|CKCO-TV]] in [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] and [[CFRN-DT|CFRN-TV]] in [[Edmonton]], formed an alliance, under which the companies would share ownership of CFCN, Baton's stations in Saskatchewan and its independent stations in southwestern Ontario, and Electrohome's CKCO. The deals doubled Baton's own interest in CTV to 28.6%.  However, as part of the deal, Baton took control of Electrohome's CTV vote, allowing it to command 42.9% of CTV's shares.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1996/DB96-251.htm Decision CRTC 96-251], June 21, 1996</ref>\n\nIn January 1997, Baton-Electrohome's \"Vancouver Television\" proposal emerged as the CRTC's choice for the new independent station in [[Vancouver]], beating out four other competitors. The new station, [[CIVT-DT|CIVT-TV]], would compete directly with [[Western International Communications]]'s two CTV affiliates in the market when it was launched that fall.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-39.htm Decision CRTC 97-39], January 31, 1997</ref>\n\nOn February 25, 1997, the Baton-Electrohome alliance and [[CHUM Limited]] announced that several stations would be swapped between them. Baton-Electrohome would acquire CHUM's [[CTV Atlantic|Atlantic Television System]] (ATV), consisting of four CTV affiliates in the [[Maritimes]], the [[CTV 2 Atlantic|Atlantic Satellite Network]] (ASN), and a further 14.3% in CTV. CHUM would receive Baton's independent stations in southwestern Ontario, as well as [[CHRO-TV]] in Pembroke, which had recently disaffiliated from CTV. The Baton-Electrohome alliance now held 57.2% of CTV.\n\nShortly thereafter, Electrohome announced it would sell its broadcasting assets \u2013 including CFRN its interest in the alliance and its CTV shares \u2013 to Baton in exchange for cash and shares in Baton. These two deals were approved by the CRTC in August.<ref>[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/DB97-527.HTM Decision CRTC 97-527], August 28, 1997</ref> Baton now held controlling interest in CTV, triggering a [[put option]] that allowed the other owners to sell their stakes in the network while still keeping their stations. Accordingly, Baton acquired the remaining CTV shares from WIC and [[Moffat Communications]], which remained affiliates for the moment, that fall.\n\nThe BBS television system was merged into CTV, with the company itself being renamed CTV Inc. the following year. The Eatons' remaining shares, representing 41% of Baton, were sold off to the general public in early 1998. By the end of 2001, nearly all CTV stations were consolidated under network ownership (including one replacement).\n\n====NetStar Communications====\nNetStar Communications Inc. (previously Labatt Communications Inc., and currently CTV Specialty Television Inc.) was formed by [[Labatt Brewing Company]] to hold that firm's broadcasting assets, which included TSN, RDS, [[Viewers Choice]] and [[Discovery Channel (Canada)|Discovery Channel]]. In 1995, when the parent company was sold to the foreign brewing conglomerate [[Interbrew]], a consortium of four Canadian investors - [[Stephen Bronfman]] (22.5%), [[Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec|the Caisse]] (22.5%), [[Reitmans]] (16.5%), and senior management (6.5%) - along with [[ESPN]], with 32%, took over the company.<ref>[http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf Broadcast Dialogue newsletter, January 21, 1999] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304175349/http://www.broadcastdialogue.com/pdfs/newsletters/1999/nl19990121_6_32.pdf |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter a takeover attempt by [[CanWest Global]] that was vetoed by ESPN, CTV announced a friendly bid to take over NetStar Communications in early 1999, with CRTC approval on March 24, 2000.\n\n====Under BCE ownership: Bell Globemedia (2000-2006)====\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s, CTV (including the NetStar assets) was folded into a new media venture, Bell Globemedia Inc. (abbreviated \"BGM\"). This was masterminded by former [[Bell Canada]] chief executive [[Jean Monty]], largely as a response to [[Canwest]]'s purchase of the [[Southam Newspapers|Southam]] newspaper chain as well as the trend of [[media convergence]], particularly the [[AOL]]-[[Time Warner]] merger. Monty believed that, to survive in a changing technological landscape, and in particular to drive subscriptions to [[satellite television]] provider [[Bell TV|Bell ExpressVu]]<!-- As it was known at the time. --> and [[internet service provider]] [[Bell Sympatico]], BCE had to have control over content.\n\nThe transaction was structured as follows: In 2000, BCE acquired CTV Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at $2.3 billion ([[Canadian dollar|CAD]]).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2000/02/25/bcectv000225.html BCE announces $2.3 billion bid for CTV], CBC.ca, February 25, 2000 (modified November 11, 2000); accessed August 9, 2006</ref> Soon after, Monty arranged to have [[Thomson Corporation]] transfer control of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', the [[Toronto]]-based national newspaper, to BCE in exchange for a significant (20%) interest in the merged CTV/''Globe'' entity. The Thomsons' family holding company, [[The Woodbridge Company|The Woodbridge Company Ltd.]], invested in the company directly to obtain an additional 9.9% interest, and later bought Thomson Corp.'s interests itself.\n\nThe resulting company, Bell Globemedia, consisted of CTV, ''The Globe and Mail'', and the [[internet]] portal then known as [[Sympatico]]-[[Lycos]] (Lycos was later replaced by [[MSN]]). Fecan was named the combined firm's president and CEO, a role he remained in for the duration of the BGM / CTVgm era. After Monty resigned and was replaced by [[Michael Sabia]] in 2002, it became clear that Monty's vision was not producing anything near the desired results, notwithstanding the good results for the individual units, particularly the CTV network.\n\nThe following years provided a few cosmetic changes in BGM's assets. In 2001, CTV acquired [[CKY-DT|CKY-TV]] in [[Winnipeg]] and [[CFCF-DT|CFCF-TV]] in Montreal, and moved the CTV affiliation in British Columbia to CIVT, replacing two affiliates that had been purchased by Canwest. That fall also brought the launch of the first digital [[specialty channel]]s, including several owned by CTV.\n\nThe company acquired partial ownership in TQS in 2002, the Sympatico portal was sold back to Bell Canada, while a further investment from the Thomsons (whose ownership increased to 31.5%) funded the acquisition of 15% of [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment]]. However, beginning in 2003, BCE management began to refer to BGM as a non-core asset; as a result, much attention was given to the likely sale of the company, and potentially a breakup into several different pieces.\n\n====Reorganization and CHUM Limited merger (2006-2011)====\n{{see also|CHUM Limited}}\n\nOn December 2, 2005, [[Bell Canada|Bell Canada Enterprises]] (BCE) announced it would sell an 8.5% interest to Woodbridge (increasing their total ownership to 40%), a 20% interest to [[Torstar]], and a 20% interest to the [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]]. BCE retained 20% of the group - a condition that ensured that Bell TV, Sympatico, and other Bell units continued to have access to Globemedia content. The transaction closed on August 30, 2006.<ref>\"[http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html BGM Ownership Deal Closes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202033123/http://www.cnw.ca/en/releases/archive/August2006/30/c9716.html |date=December 2, 2007 }}\", BGM press release, August 30, 2006</ref>\n\nThis deal put to rest any rumours about a possible breakup of the company. However, Torstar's involvement led to additional [[media concentration]] concerns, mainly from media [[trade union|union]]s. Torstar insisted it was committed to maintaining the [[editorial independence]] of the ''Globe'' and its own ''[[Toronto Star]]'', and ultimately there were no major regulatory hurdles due to this.\n\n{{Wikinews|Canadian media company Bell Globemedia to acquire rival CHUM}}On July 12, 2006, BGM announced a friendly bid to take over [[CHUM Limited]] for an estimated $1.7 billion. The acquisition would bring the secondary broadcast system ([[Citytv]]), other stations including [[CP24|CablePulse24]], [[Much (TV channel)|MuchMusic]], [[E! (Canadian TV channel)|Star!]], [[Bravo (Canada)|Bravo!]], and [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]], and all of CHUM's radio stations, into the BGM fold. BGM originally announced that CHUM's [[CTV 2|A-Channel]] stations, [[Access (TV channel)|Access]], [[CKX-TV]], [[MusiquePlus]], [[MusiMax]], [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[Cooking Channel (Canadian TV channel)|SexTV: The Channel]] and BGM's own [[OLN]] would not be retained.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, in order to pay for the CHUM acquisition, BGM sold additional shares to its existing shareholders. BCE did not participate in the refinancing; the net effect was an increase in Teachers' ownership to 25%, while BCE's interest was reduced to 15%.<ref>[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html Bell Globemedia Completes Financing to Pay for CHUM Limited Shares] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930222027/http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2006/07/c3905.html |date=2007-09-30 }}, BGM press release, September 7, 2006</ref> As a result of BCE's reduced ownership, the company was renamed as CTVglobemedia as of January 1, 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, [[Rogers Communications]] announced a tentative deal to purchase A-Channel, CKX-TV, Access Alberta, Canadian Learning Television, and SexTV: The Channel from CTVglobemedia, if its purchase of CHUM was approved. [[Astral Media]] made a similar deal for CHUM's 50% interest in MusiMax and MusiquePlus.\n\nThat June, the CRTC approved the CHUM takeover, on condition that CTV sell off the Citytv stations, because of the CTV network's O&O stations serving the very same cities. CTV ultimately chose to keep the A-Channel stations along with the rest of CHUM assets it had previously said it would sell, except for MusiquePlus/MusiMax. [[Rogers Communications]] was announced as the buyer of the Citytv stations on June 11, 2007, and the CHUM acquisition was finalized on June 22.\n\nSince then, CTVglobemedia has sold off its interests in various non-core channels. Rogers has purchased several of these assets, including CTV's 33% interest in OLN in late 2007, as well as radio stations [[CHST-FM]] in [[London, Ontario]] and [[CHBN-FM]] in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm Canada's Rogers Radio acquires Edmonton top 40 station 91.7 The Bounce] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627032732/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-edmonton-chr-bounce-fm |date=2010-06-27 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref><ref>[http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario Canada's Rogers Radio acquires 102.3 Bob FM in London, Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804172359/http://www.radio-info.com/news/canadas-rogers-broadcasting-buys-bob-fm-in-london-ontario |date=2011-08-04 }} -- Retrieved 2010-06-22</ref> [[Corus Entertainment]] would acquire [[Canadian Learning Television]], [[SexTV: The Channel]], and [[Drive-In Classics]] for a combined $113 million.

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center. Its status as the honorary capital of Montenegro is due to its heritage as a long-serving former capital of Montenegro.\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], the town is known as  \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435 / ''Cetinje'' (archaically \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0463 / ''Cetin\u011b''); in [[Italian language|Italian]] as ''Cettigne''; in [[Greek language|Greek]] as \u039a\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03bd\u03b7 (''Ket\u00edgni''); in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''\u00c7etince''; and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Cetina''.\n\n== History ==\n\n===Founding===\nCetinje was founded in 1482, when [[Ivan Crnojevi\u0107]] moved his capital from Obod above the [[Crnojevi\u0107 River]] to deeper into the hills to a more easily defended location in a field at the foot of [[Mount Lov\u0107en]]. He had his court built at the new location that year and also founded [[Old Cetinje Monastery|a monastery]] (dedicated to the Mother of Christ) as a personal endowment in 1484. His court and the monastery are the first recorded [[renaissance]] buildings in Montenegro.<ref name=\"DomljanKrle\u017ea.\">{{cite book|author1=\u017darko Domljan|author2=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea.\"|author3=Jugoslavenski leksikografski zavod \"Miroslav Krle\u017ea\".|title=Likovna enciklopedija Jugoslavije|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYufAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 April 2013|year=1984|publisher=Zavod|page=245|quote=Ivan Crnojevi\u0107 podigao dvorac, kasnije i crkvu zetske mitropolije... to su prvi datirani spomenici renesanse u Crnoj Gori}}</ref> Crnojevi\u0107 was forced to move the seat of the Eparchy of Zeta from [[Vranjina]] to Cetinje due to the Ottoman invasions, in 1485.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49>{{cite book|title=Glasnik Srpskog istorijsko-kulturnog dru\u0161tva \"Njego\u0161\"|volume=61\u201362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNjlAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Njego\u0161|page=49|quote=\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0432\u043e \u0412\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0443 \u0421\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0408\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0443. \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 1485. \u043f\u043e\u0434 \u043d\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u045a\u0435, \u0433\u0434\u0435 \u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u043d\u0443\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0435. \u041e\u043d\u0430 \u045b\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0443 \u0443\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u043a\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e \u0438 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0436\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435.}}</ref> The town was named after the Cetina river.\n\nThe bishopric of Zeta was elevated to a metropolitanate in Cetinje.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> It was later to play an important part in both the religious and national life.<ref name=GSIKDN-89-49/> The [[Crnojevi\u0107 printing house]], the first printing house in southeastern Europe, was active between 1493 and 1496 in Cetinje.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frederick Bernard Singleton|title=A short history of the Yugoslav peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTLSZ3ucaZMC&pg=PA30|accessdate=24 July 2011|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27485-2|pages=30\u2013}}</ref> Zeta was first put under Ottoman rule in 1499, then annexed by the Ottomans in 1514, organized into the [[Sanjak of Montenegro]].<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0106orovi\u0107|first=Vladimir|title=Istorija Jugoslavije|authorlink=Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107|year=1933|publisher=Narodno Delo|location=Beograd|url=http://sr.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0_%D0%88%D1%83%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B5_(%D0%92._%D0%8B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%9B)_3.11|accessdate=27 April 2011|language=Serbian|quote=\u0413\u043e\u0434. 1499. \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0458\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0431\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0441\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443. \u0410\u043b\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0434. 1514. \u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0458\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0430\u043d \u043f\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043e \u0458\u043e\u0458 \u0437\u0430 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430, \u043a\u0430\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u045f\u0430\u043a-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0448\u0443, \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0440-\u0431\u0435\u0433\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0458\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430.}}</ref>\n\n===Early modern period===\n\nIn the next two centuries, the development of Cetinje stagnated. It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events.

The city rests on a small [[karst]] plain surrounded by limestone mountains, including [[Mount Lov\u0107en]], the legendary mountain in Montenegrin historiography.\n\nCetinje was founded in the 15th century and became a center of Montenegrin life and both a cradle of [[Culture of Montenegro|Montenegrin culture]] and an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] religious center.

It was very often subject to attack by [[Venice]] and the Ottomans. The city therefore endured many privations in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.  In this period the court and the monastery of the Crnojevi\u0107i dynasty were destroyed. It was only at the end of the 17th century, in 1697, that Cetinje began to flourish again under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]], refounded by [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]].\n\n===Modern period===\n [[File:Arrival_of_the_Post,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2610.png|thumb|right|Arrival of the Post Cetinje]]\n [[File:MACKENZIE(1877)_p2.235_AFTER_THE_BATTLE_OF_GRAHOVO.jpg|thumb|left|Mackenzie (1877) after the battle of Grahovo]]\nLeading the wars of liberation and strengthening the unity in the country occupied Danilo and his successors, so they were unable to devote enough effort to the further development of Cetinje. It was only during the rule of [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] that far greater progress was made. In 1838 his new royal residence called [[Biljarda]] (Billiard house) was built. Cetinje was enlarged by building new houses that gradually led to genuine urbanization.\n [[File:From_the_West,_Cetinje,_Montenegro_WDL2608.png|thumb|left|Cetinje]]\nMany modern buildings designed for foreign consulates were built due to the newly established relations with various European countries, including the [[France|French]], [[Russia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] consulates.{{fact|date=January 2016}}\n\nCetinje made great progress under the rule of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola I Petrovi\u0107]] when numerous public edifices were built. Those include the first hotel, called \u2018Lokanda\u2019, then the new Prince\u2019s palace, the Girls\u2019 Institute and the hospital. This period also saw the first tenancy houses. In the 1860 census Cetinje had 34 households. After initially holding off Ottoman incursions in [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1852\u201353)|1852 and 1853]], Cetinje was captured by Ottoman [[Omar Pasha]]'s forces during the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1861\u201362)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War of 1861\u201362]]. Ottoman rule over Montenegro did not last much more than a decade however, as 14 years later the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|\"Great War\"]], the third successive contest between the two nations, ended in Montenegrin victory, with most previously-Montenegrin territory returning to their control.\n\n[[File:MonasterioYPalacioDelObispoCetinje--balkansfromwithi00wyonuoft.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cetinje Monastery]]]]\nMontenegrin independence was recognized at the [[Berlin Congress|Congress of Berlin]] of 1878 and consequently Cetinje became the capital of a European country. Between 1878 and 1914 Cetinje flourished in every sense. Many renowned intellectuals from other South-Slavic parts came to stay there and made a contribution to the cultural, educational and every other aspect of life. Montenegro was proclaimed a kingdom in 1910. This had a great effect on Cetinje's development. At this time the Government House, the symbol of state power, was built. The population census from the same year recorded a massive growth in the world's smallest capital, registering 5,895 inhabitants.\n\nIn the [[Interwar period]], Cetinje expanded its territory, as it was now a centre of the Zeta region. But when it was decided by the Parliament of Montenegro that the administrative organs should be located in Titograd (previously and presently [[Podgorica]]),  Cetinje went through a harsh crisis. By building certain industrial sections and at the same time neglecting the development of the city's traditional and potential cultural and tourist capacities, the chance to create a strong basis for more solid prosperity was lost.\n\nWhen Communist forces captured Cetinje in November 1944 the only population that stayed in the town were people who believed they have no reason to fear or hide from anybody.<ref>{{harv|Fleming|2002|p=150}}: \"As Partisan units entered Cetinje, Podgorica, Niksic, and the Littoral in November 1944, the only remaining inhabitants were people who assumed that they had nothing to hide or nothing to fear.

However, these five centuries \u2013 the whole history of a people, who, through the development of city recorded moments of their origin, ascent, stagnation and downs.\n\nFor Cetinje as urban agglomeration, can be said to have formed suddenly, which makes it very specific. In fact, since the seventies of the nineteenth century, for almost fifty years, there was, in the urban context, designed and typological characteristic areas formed with urban type residential home ground floor and storey house with developed attic, created and developed in closed urban blocks, where line of life in them was street - house - garden.\n[[File:Russian embassy in Cetinje.jpg|thumb|left|Former Russian embassy in Cetinje]]\nAlong with the development of this type of urban city blocks and residential buildings, has developed substantial public architecture of the city, which was built under the great influence of foreign builders with the application of various architectural styles and which then and now, is a representative architectural backbone of the city.\n\nBetween the two world wars, which characterized by the loss of Montenegrin statehood and noticeable stagnation of the architectural development of the city, Cetinje continues the tradition of formed, then already traditional type of urban residential houses and closed urban blocks, but they build the first modern multi-storey residential buildings for collective housing, and modern public institutions necessary for the then social life.\n\nIn the fastest and most important period of the development of Cetinje, since the seventies of the nineteenth century until the First World War, which was then the smallest European old capital, was created and developed city on the principles the European metropolises of that time in whose architectural activity of the city was engaged many foreign architects, engineers, builders and craftsmen.\n[[File:\u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0439_\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0446_\u0432_\u0426\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435.jpg|thumb|The Blue Palace, where the President of Montenegro resides.]]\nThe development of Cetinje in this period was followed by many important historical and social events. So the second half of the nineteenth century in the development of Cetinje marked period of state power and its pursuit of the European culture and international recognition. Recognition of Montenegro as an independent state, at the Berlin Congress in 1878., on the basis of which greatly expanded, he began a period of rapid creation of a national, economic, social, cultural, societal and spatial superstructure which caused increasing of economic power and the reorganization and improvement of the state apparatus and the authorities.

In December 1989 work to construct this stage began as a [[Build-Operate-Transfer|Build-Own-Operate-Transfer]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/59/60/46/1c/aa/9a/44/c8/92/1a/59/ed/a1/12/f7/36/obj/RTA_1988_89.pdf|title=Department of Main Roads Annual Report 1988-89|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=Department of Main Roads|page=6, 31|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref> In return for funding construction StateWide Roads, the consortium awarded to build the stage, was given permission to toll the section between [[James Ruse Drive]] and [[A6 (Sydney)|Silverwater Road]] as traffic volumes on this section were significantly higher than between Mays Hill-Prospect and would allow a shorter toll period with lower tolls. The consortium would also widen the section between James Ruse Drive and the newly constructed [[A3 (Sydney)|Homebush Bay Drive]] to 6 lanes. The Mays Hill to Prospect section opened in May 1992 and an initial of a $1.50 toll was implemented. The concession held by StateWide Roads ended on 15 February 2010, with operation of the motorway returned to the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] and the toll removed.\n\nThe Motorway is mostly six or eight lanes wide, and carries constant heavy traffic during daylight hours, seven days a week. Built as a four lane motorway, it was widened to six lanes during 1998 to 2000, but this did little to ease the congestion.\n\nOriginally planned in the mid-1950s to start in the [[Sydney central business district]],<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/M4/constructioninfo.htm Western Motorway (M4) Construction], ''Ozroads: the Australian Roads Website''.

This would have bypassed the Lapstone Hill area and avoided the sharp bends as the road enters Glenbrook. In December 1989 the extension of the freeway from Russell Street, west to the Great Western Highway in the vicinity of Governors Drive would bypass the narrow and winding section of the Great Western Highway, including the historic Knapsack Bridge. In June 1993, the new section of freeway between Emu Plains and {{NSWcity|Lapstone}} was opened to traffic.\n\nOn the basis of a pre-election promise made by [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] Wran in 1976, all land reserved for the expressway between Pyrmont and the current eastern termination point at Strathfield was sold off to property developers or declassified as a freeway corridor in 1977 by the State Government.\n\nIn 2013, the state government announced the intention to implement a 'Managed Motorway' scheme on the M4 over the coming years to improve traffic flow.

Over the years a number of proposals have been made to extend the M4 east towards the city. One plan in the 1990s involved extending the M4 eastwards by approximately {{convert|5|km}} so that it would subsequently end in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]] and be continuous with the [[City West Link Road|City West Link]]. Further planned upgrades to the City West Link would mean commuters going west out of the city could get to [[Parramatta]] without passing through traffic lights. A subsequent plan outlined a $7 billion plan to link the M4, [[Victoria Road, Sydney|Victoria Road]], City West Link and [[Sydney Airport]] using a network of tunnels.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Both plans were subsequently shelved, with the NSW state government citing the need for an integrated plan for transport.\n\nIn the month prior to the [[2011 New South Wales state election|2011 state election]], the [[NRMA]] released a report in which it recommended building a tunnel to connect the end of the M4 at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]] and the start of the City West Link, relieving [[Parramatta Road]] of enough traffic to convert it into two lanes for slower-moving local traffic, two lanes of [[light rail]] and a [[cycleway]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/boulevard-of-dreams-comes-with-a-hidden-cost-20110214-1atqk.html Boulevard of dreams comes with a hidden cost] \u2013 ''Sydney Morning Herald''.

The [[County of Cumberland planning scheme]] provided for a modified route west, much of which was later built as the M4 Western Motorway. With the opening of the M4 East tunnel in 2019, the M4 extends as far east as Wattle Street, with provision for a future tunnel extension to the [[Anzac Bridge]] at [[Victoria Road (Sydney)|Victoria Road]] and the [[M5 Motorway (Sydney)|'new M5']] at St Peters. The future tunnel extensions, the M4-M5 Link and Rozelle Interchange, are currently under construction.\n\n===M4 Western Motorway===\n[[File:M4 Sydney Looking East.jpg|thumb|M4 Motorway looking East from the Olympic Park line]]\n\nThe M4 Western Motorway was originally constructed in several stages as the F4 Western Freeway between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s, however a lack of funding resulted in the [[Neville Wran|Wran]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government halting plans to construct the final stage between {{NSWcity|Mays Hill}} and {{NSWcity|Prospect}} in 1985. In December 1989 work to construct this stage began as a [[Build-Operate-Transfer|Build-Own-Operate-Transfer]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://media.opengov.nsw.gov.au/pairtree_root/59/60/46/1c/aa/9a/44/c8/92/1a/59/ed/a1/12/f7/36/obj/RTA_1988_89.pdf|title=Department of Main Roads Annual Report 1988-89|website=OpenGov NSW|publisher=Department of Main Roads|page=6, 31|accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref> In return for funding construction StateWide Roads, the consortium awarded to build the stage, was given permission to toll the section between [[James Ruse Drive]] and [[A6 (Sydney)|Silverwater Road]] as traffic volumes on this section were significantly higher than between Mays Hill-Prospect and would allow a shorter toll period with lower tolls. The consortium would also widen the section between James Ruse Drive and the newly constructed [[A3 (Sydney)|Homebush Bay Drive]] to 6 lanes. The Mays Hill to Prospect section opened in May 1992 and an initial of a $1.50 toll was implemented. The concession held by StateWide Roads ended on 15 February 2010, with operation of the motorway returned to the [[Roads and Traffic Authority]] and the toll removed.\n\nThe Motorway is mostly six or eight lanes wide, and carries constant heavy traffic during daylight hours, seven days a week. Built as a four lane motorway, it was widened to six lanes during 1998 to 2000, but this did little to ease the congestion.\n\nOriginally planned in the mid-1950s to start in the [[Sydney central business district]],<ref>[http://www.ozroads.com.au/NSW/Freeways/M4/constructioninfo.htm Western Motorway (M4) Construction], ''Ozroads: the Australian Roads Website''.

This would have bypassed the Lapstone Hill area and avoided the sharp bends as the road enters Glenbrook. In December 1989 the extension of the freeway from Russell Street, west to the Great Western Highway in the vicinity of Governors Drive would bypass the narrow and winding section of the Great Western Highway, including the historic Knapsack Bridge. In June 1993, the new section of freeway between Emu Plains and {{NSWcity|Lapstone}} was opened to traffic.\n\nOn the basis of a pre-election promise made by [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] Wran in 1976, all land reserved for the expressway between Pyrmont and the current eastern termination point at Strathfield was sold off to property developers or declassified as a freeway corridor in 1977 by the State Government.\n\nIn 2013, the state government announced the intention to implement a 'Managed Motorway' scheme on the M4 over the coming years to improve traffic flow. Mechanisms to be used include improved Variable Message Signs, [[Ramp meter|Ramp metering signals]], dynamic speed and incident management, and an upgrade of the Emergency Telephone System.<ref>[http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/roadprojects/projects/building_sydney_motorways/m4/m4_managed/tools_systems.html Benefits, Features and Tools of a Managed Motorway] \u2013 ''[[Roads and Traffic Authority]]''.

Construction commenced in March 2015. In November 2015, it was announced that toll points would be reinstated on this section from 2017 to cover costs of the [[WestConnex]] project (upgrading and M4 East).

Over the years a number of proposals have been made to extend the M4 east towards the city. One plan in the 1990s involved extending the M4 eastwards by approximately {{convert|5|km}} so that it would subsequently end in [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]] and be continuous with the [[City West Link Road|City West Link]]. Further planned upgrades to the City West Link would mean commuters going west out of the city could get to [[Parramatta]] without passing through traffic lights. A subsequent plan outlined a $7 billion plan to link the M4, [[Victoria Road, Sydney|Victoria Road]], City West Link and [[Sydney Airport]] using a network of tunnels.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}. Both plans were subsequently shelved, with the NSW state government citing the need for an integrated plan for transport.\n\nIn the month prior to the [[2011 New South Wales state election|2011 state election]], the [[NRMA]] released a report in which it recommended building a tunnel to connect the end of the M4 at [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]] and the start of the City West Link, relieving [[Parramatta Road]] of enough traffic to convert it into two lanes for slower-moving local traffic, two lanes of [[light rail]] and a [[cycleway]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/boulevard-of-dreams-comes-with-a-hidden-cost-20110214-1atqk.html Boulevard of dreams comes with a hidden cost] \u2013 ''Sydney Morning Herald''.

After an unsuccessful venture running a store, and assisting his father-in-law at [[Hanover Tavern]], Henry became a lawyer through self-study. Beginning his practice in 1760, he soon became prominent through his victory in the [[Parson's Cause]] against the Anglican clergy. Henry was elected to the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against the [[Stamp Act of 1765]].\n\nIn 1774 and 1775, Henry served as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress|First]] and [[Second Continental Congress]]es, but did not prove particularly influential. He gained further popularity among the people of Virginia, both through his oratory at the convention and by marching troops towards the colonial capital of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] after the [[Gunpowder Incident]] until the munitions seized by the royal government were paid for. Henry urged independence, and when the [[Fifth Virginia Convention]] endorsed this in 1776, served on the committee charged with drafting the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] and the original [[Virginia Constitution]]. Henry was promptly elected governor under the new charter, and served a total of five one-year terms.\n\nAfter leaving the governorship in 1779, Henry served in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] until he began his last two terms as governor in 1784. The actions of the national government under the [[Articles of Confederation]] made Henry fear a strong federal government and he declined appointment as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|1787 Constitutional Convention]]. He actively opposed the ratification of the Constitution. He returned to the practice of law in his final years, declining several offices under the federal government. A slaveholder throughout his adult life, he hoped to see the institution end, but had no plan for that beyond ending the importation of slaves. Henry is remembered for his oratory, and as an enthusiastic promoter of the fight for independence.\n\n==Early life and struggles (1736\u20131759)==\nHenry was born on the family farm, [[Birthplace of Patrick Henry|Studley]], in [[Hanover County, Virginia|Hanover County]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], on May 29, 1736.<ref name=a>{{cite web|first=Thad|last=Tate|title=Henry, Patrick|work=[[American National Biography Online]]|date=February 2000|url=\nhttp://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00396.html|accessdate=October 8, 2017|url-access=subscription }}</ref> His father was John Henry, an immigrant from [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, who had attended [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], University of Aberdeen, there before emigrating to Virginia in the 1720s.{{sfn|Meade|pp=13\u201318}} Settling in Hanover County in about 1732, John Henry married Sarah Winston Syme, a wealthy widow from a prominent local family of English ancestry.{{sfn|Meade|pp=21\u201324}}\n\nPatrick Henry shared his name with his uncle, an Anglican minister, and until the elder Patrick's death in 1777 often went as Patrick Henry Jr.{{sfn|Kukla|p=13}} Henry attended a local school until about the age of 10. There was then no academy in Hanover County, and he was tutored at home by his father.{{sfn|Kidd|p=9}} The young Henry engaged in the typical recreations of the times, such as music and dancing, and was particularly fond of hunting.{{sfn|Kidd|p=12}} Since the family's lands and slaves would for the most part pass to his older half-brother John Syme Jr., Henry needed to make his own way in the world.{{sfn|Mayer|p=32}} At the age of 15, he became a clerk for a local merchant, and a year later opened a store with his older brother William. The store was not successful.<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nThe religious revival known as the [[Great Awakening]] reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took him to hear Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as [[Samuel Davies (clergyman)|Samuel Davies]] taught him that it is not enough to save one's own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=13\u201323}} His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.{{sfn|Kidd|p=37}}\n\nReligion would play a key part in Henry's life; his father and namesake uncle were both devout and were both major influences in his life. Nevertheless, he was uncomfortable with the role of the Anglican Church as the established religion in Virginia, and fought for religious liberty throughout his career. Henry wrote to a group of Baptists who had sent a letter of congratulations following Henry's 1776 election as governor, \"My earnest wish is, that Christian charity, forbearance and love may unite all different persuasions as brethren.\"<ref name = \"henrychrist\" /> He criticized his state of Virginia, feeling that slavery and lack of religious toleration had retarded its development. He told the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] in 1788, \"That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men have an equal, natural and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others.\"<ref name = \"henrychrist\">{{cite web|last=Wells|first=James M.|title=The Christian Philosophy of Patrick Henry|url=http://www.christianhistorysociety.com/henrythesis1.html|accessdate=November 16, 2017|publisher=Christian History Society}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shelton House - Shenk.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Rural Plains]] near Totopotomoy Creek in Virginia.

(It also became known as Shelton House.) As a wedding gift, her father gave the couple six slaves and the {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Pine Slash|Pine Slash Farm]] near [[Mechanicsville, Virginia|Mechanicsville]]. Pine Slash was exhausted from earlier cultivations, and Henry worked with the slaves to clear fresh fields. The latter half of the 1750s were years of drought in Virginia, and after the main house burned down, Henry gave up and moved to the [[Hanover Tavern]], owned by Sarah's father.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=45\u201348}}\n\nHenry often served as host at Hanover Tavern as part of his duties, and entertained the guests by playing the fiddle. Among those who stayed there during this time was the young [[Thomas Jefferson]], aged 17, en route to his studies at the [[College of William and Mary]], and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with Henry then, despite their age difference of six years.{{sfn|Mayer|p=50}} Jefferson in 1824 told [[Daniel Webster]], \"Patrick Henry was originally a bar-keeper\", a characterization that Henry's biographers have found to be unfair; that his position was more general than that, and that the main business of Hanover Tavern was serving travelers, not alcohol. [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], Henry's earliest biographer, rejected Jefferson's suggestion that Henry's profession then was a bartender, but noted it would have been \"very natural in Mr. Henry's situation\" to do what was necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n== Revolutionary lawyer and politician (1760\u20131775) ==\n===Parson's Cause===\nWhile at Hanover Tavern, Henry found time to study the law. How long he did so is unclear; he later said it was as little as a month. On the advice of a local lawyer, Henry in 1760 applied for a lawyer's license, appearing before the examiners\u2014prominent attorneys in the colonial capital of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. The examiners were impressed by Henry's mind even though his knowledge of legal procedures was scant. He passed in April 1760, and he thereafter opened a practice, appearing in the courts of Hanover and nearby counties.<ref name = \"a\" />{{sfn|Kukla|pp=30\u201340}}\n\nThe droughts of the 1750s had led to a rise in the price of tobacco. Hard currency was scarce in Virginia, and salaries in the colony were often expressed in terms of pounds of tobacco. Prior to the drought, the price of tobacco had long been twopence per pound (0.45 kilograms) and in 1755 and 1758, the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], the elected lower house of the colonial legislature, passed [[Two Penny Act]]s, allowing debts expressed in tobacco to be paid at the rate of twopence per pound for a limited period.{{sfn|Campbell|p=28}} These payees included public officials, including Anglican clergy\u2014Anglicanism was then Virginia's [[established church]], and several ministers petitioned the [[Board of Trade]] in London to overrule the Burgesses, which it did. Five clergymen then brought suit for back pay, cases known as the [[Parson's Cause]]; of them, only the Reverend [[James Maury]] was successful, and a jury was to be empaneled in Hanover County on December 1, 1763 to fix damages. Henry was engaged as counsel by Maury's parish [[vestry]] for this hearing.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=39\u201341}} Patrick Henry's father, Colonel John Henry, was the presiding judge.{{sfn|McCants|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Parson's Cause by Cooke.jpg|thumb|left|''Patrick Henry Arguing the Parson's Cause'' by [[George Cooke (painter)|George Cooke]]]]\nAfter the evidence was presented proving the facts at issue, Maury's counsel gave a speech in praise of the clergy, many of whom were in attendance. Henry responded with a one-hour speech, ignoring the question of damages, but which focused on the unconstitutionality of the veto of the Two Penny Act by the king's government. Henry deemed any king who annulled good laws, such as the Two Penny Act, as a \"tyrant\" who \"forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience\", and the clergy, by challenging an impartial law designed to bring economic relief, had shown themselves to be \"enemies of the community\".{{sfn|McCants|pp=118\u2013119}} The opposing counsel accused Henry of treason, and some took up that cry, but Henry continued, and the judge did nothing to stop him.{{sfn|McCants|p=119}} Henry urged the jury to make an example of Maury, for the benefit of any who might seek to imitate him, and suggested the jury return damages of [[History of the British farthing|one farthing]].{{sfn|Kukla|p=45}} The jury was out for only moments, and fixed damages at one penny. Henry was hailed as a hero. According to biographer Henry Mayer, Henry had \"defined the prerogatives of the local elite by the unorthodox means of mobilizing the emotions of the lower ranks of religious and political outsiders.\"{{sfn|Mayer|p=66}} Henry's popularity greatly increased, and he added 164 new clients in the year after the Parson's Cause.{{sfn|Campbell|p=37}}\n\n===Stamp Act===\n[[File:Patrick Henry Rothermel.jpg|thumb|upright|Patrick Henry's \"Treason\" speech before the [[House of Burgesses]] in an 1851 painting by [[Peter F. Rothermel]]]]\n\nIn the wake of the Parson's Cause, Henry began to gain a following in backwoods Virginia, because of his oratory defending the liberties of the common people, and thanks to his friendly manner. He boosted his standing further in 1764 by representing Nathaniel West Dandridge, elected for Hanover County, in an election contest before the Burgesses. Dandridge was alleged to have bribed voters with drink, a practice common but illegal. Henry is said to have made a brilliant speech in defense of the rights of voters, but the text does not survive. Henry lost the case, but met influential members on the Committee of Privileges and Elections, such as [[Richard Henry Lee]], [[Peyton Randolph]] and [[George Wythe]].{{sfn|Kidd|pp=46\u201348}} In 1765, William Johnson, the brother of Thomas Johnson (who had been one of Henry's clients in the Parson's Cause), resigned as burgess for [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]]. As Henry owned land in the county (acquired from his father to settle a loan), he was eligible to be a candidate, and he won the seat in May 1765. He left immediately for Williamsburg as the session had already begun.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nThe expense of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763) had nearly doubled Britain's national debt, and as much of the war had taken place in and around North America, the British government looked for ways of directly taxing the American colonies. The 1765 [[Stamp Act]] was both a means of raising revenue and one of asserting authority over the colonies.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=53\u201358}} The Burgesses instructed their agent in London, Edward Montague, to oppose the measure, and other colonial legislatures similarly instructed their representatives. Considerable debate began over the proposed measure, and in Virginia pamphleteers developed arguments Henry had made in the Parson's Cause.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=49\u201356}}\n\nPatrick Henry was sworn into a sleepy session of the legislature on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the [[Virginia Resolves|Virginia Stamp Act Resolves]].{{sfn|Kidd|p=58}} The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one's representatives. The fifth was the most provocative, as it named the Virginia legislature, the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]], as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though their authorship is uncertain.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=53, 58\u201359}} Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggested that Henry acted as he saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians' rights, and an opportunity to advance himself politically.{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|p=305}}\n\nThere are no verbatim transcriptions of Henry's speech in opposition to the Stamp Act. Texts are reconstructions, for the most part based on recollections decades later by which time both the speech and Henry had become famous. For example, Jefferson, still in his studies at the nearby College of William and Mary, recalled the splendor of Henry's oratory.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=51\u201353}} No attempt was made to reconstruct Henry's words until 1790, when [[James Madison]] wrote to former burgess [[Edmund Pendleton]], but Madison learned that Pendleton had not been present; a second attempt did not occur until Wirt began work on his biography of Henry in 1805. A French traveler, whose name is not known, and whose journal was discovered in 1921,{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|p=94}} recorded at the time of Henry's speech that \"one of the members stood up and said that he had read that in former times [[Tarquin the Elder|Tarquin]] and [[Julius Caesar|Julius]] had their [[Brutus]], [[Charles I of England|Charles]] had his [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], and he did not doubt but some good American would stand up, in favour of his country\".{{sfn|Kidd|pp=51\u201353}} As Henry had seemingly called for the killing of [[King George III]], there were cries of \"Treason!\" in the chamber, including by the Speaker, [[John Robinson (Virginia)|John Robinson]]. [[John Tyler Sr.]] (father of the future president), who was standing with Jefferson as they watched the session, called this one of \"the trying moments which is decisive of character\", and both recalled that Henry did not waver: \"If this be treason, make the most of it!\".{{sfn|Kukla|p=71}}\n\nThe Burgesses adopted the first five resolutions\u2014the two others, which denied the right of any other body but the General Assembly to tax Virginians, and which branded anyone who stated that Parliament had that right an enemy of the colony, were not passed.{{sfn|Kidd|p=53}} According to the Morgans, the passed resolutions differed little from language in petitions sent by the Burgesses to London in 1764, and the opposition to Henry may have been in part because he was an upstart in Virginia politics.{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|p=97}} On May 31, with Henry absent and likely returning home, the Burgesses expunged the fifth resolution, and the Royal Governor, [[Francis Fauquier]], refused to allow any of them to be printed in the official newspaper, the ''[[The Virginia Gazette#Historical papers|Virginia Gazette]]''. With the official texts of the passed resolutions denied them, newspapers in the colonies and in Britain printed all seven resolutions, all of them presented as the resolves of the influential Colony of Virginia. The resolutions, more radical as a group than what was actually passed, reached Britain by mid-August, the first American reaction to the passage of the Stamp Act. In North America, they galvanized opposition to the Stamp Act, and made Virginia the leader in opposition to Parliament's action.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=73\u201379}} According to Thad Tate in Henry's ''American National Biography'' article, \"Not only in Virginia but across the mainland British colonies, Henry quickly established his reputation as an uncompromising opponent of imperial policy.\"<ref name = \"a\" /> The Morgans noted, \"In Virginia the Stamp Act provided the opportunity for Patrick Henry's spectacular entry into politics\".{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|pp=204\u2013305}}\n\n=== Lawyer and landowner (1766\u20131773)===\nFauquier dissolved the Burgesses on June 1, 1765, hoping new elections would purge the radicals, but this proved not to be the case, as conservative leaders were instead voted out. The governor did not call the Burgesses into session until November 1766, by which time the Stamp Act had been repealed by Parliament, preventing Virginia from sending delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in New York. Henry's role in the active resistance that took place in Virginia against the Stamp Act is uncertain. Although the lack of a legislative session sidelined Henry during the crisis, it also undermined the established leaders of the chamber, who remained scattered through the colony with little opportunity to confer, as the public rage for change grew hotter.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nWhen the Burgesses eventually convened, Henry sometimes opposed the colonial leaders, but united with them against British policies. In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Henry spent more time concentrating on his personal affairs,<ref name = \"a\" /> though he advanced in standing within the Burgesses, serving on powerful committees.{{sfn|Campbell|p=72}} The Henry family moved to a new house on his Louisa County property, probably in late 1765, and lived there until 1769, when he returned to Hanover County. His law practice remained strong until the courts under royal authority closed in 1774. Jefferson later complained that Henry was lazy and ignorant in the practice of the law, his sole talent trying cases before juries, and accused Henry of charging criminal defendants high fees to get them acquitted. Norine Dickson Campbell, in her biography of Henry, found Jefferson's comments unfounded; that Henry's rates were moderate for the time, and cited earlier historians as to Henry's competence.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=62\u201365}} Jefferson's comments came years after the two, once friends, quarreled.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=71\u201372}} In 1769, Henry was admitted to practice before the [[General Court of Virginia]] in Williamsburg, a venue more prestigious than the county courts.{{sfn|Kidd|p=71}}{{sfn|Campbell|p=xvii}}\n\nHenry invested some of his earnings in frontier lands, in what is now the western part of Virginia, as well as in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. He claimed ownership though many of them were controlled by the Native Americans, and sought to get the colonial (and, later, state) government to recognize his claims. This was common among Virginia's leading citizens, such as [[George Washington]]. Henry foresaw the potential of the [[Ohio Valley]] and was involved in schemes to found settlements. Income from land deals in 1771 enabled him to buy [[Scotchtown (plantation)|Scotchtown]], a large plantation in Hanover County, which he purchased from John Payne, the father of [[Dolley Madison]]\u2014she lived there for a brief time as a child. Scotchtown, with 16 rooms, was one of the largest mansions in Virginia.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nOwning estates such as Henry's meant owning slaves; Henry was a slaveholder from the time of his marriage at the age of 18.{{sfn|Kidd|p=15}} Despite this, Henry believed that slavery was wrong, and hoped for its abolition, but had no plan for doing so, nor for the multiracial society that would result, for he did not believe schemes to settle freed slaves in Africa were realistic, \"to re-export them is now impracticable, and sorry I am for it.\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=100\u2013102}} He wrote in 1773, \"I am the master of slaves of my own purchase. I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without them. I will not, I cannot justify it.\"{{sfn|Kukla|p=124}} But the number of slaves he owned increased over time, and as a result of his second marriage in 1777, so that at his death in 1799, he owned 67 slaves.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=15\u201316}} Henry and others sought to end their importation to Virginia, and succeeded in 1778. They assumed that in so doing, they were fighting slavery, but in the generation after independence, slave births greatly exceeded deaths, and Virginia became a source of slaves sold south in the [[coastwise slave trade]].{{sfn|Kukla|p=125}}\n\n===Renewed involvement and First Continental Congress (1773\u20131775)===\nIn 1773, Henry came into conflict with the royal governor, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]]. The governor, appointed in 1771, had sent British soldiers to [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia|Pittsylvania County]] to aid in apprehending a gang of counterfeiters. Once captured, they were immediately taken to Williamsburg for trial before the General Court, ignoring precedent that judicial proceedings should begin in the county where the offense took place, or where the suspect was captured. This was a sensitive matter especially because of the recent [[Gaspee affair|''Gaspee'' affair]] in Rhode Island, in which the British sought to capture and transport overseas for trial those who had burned a British ship. The Burgesses wanted to rebuke Dunmore for his actions, and Henry was part of a committee of eight members, that drafted a resolution thanking the governor for the capture of the gang, but affirming that using the \"usual mode\" of criminal procedure protected both the guilty and the innocent.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=152\u2013155}} They also penned a plan, adopted by the Burgesses, for [[Committees of correspondence|a committee of correspondence]] to communicate with leaders in other colonies, to inform and coordinate with each other. The members included Henry.{{sfn|Mayer|p=175}}\n\nAlthough Henry had by this time come to believe that conflict with Great Britain, and independence, was inevitable,{{sfn|Kukla|p=138}} he had no strategy for advancing this. The Burgesses were sitting when in 1774, word came that Parliament had voted to [[Boston Port Act|close the port of Boston]] in retaliation for the [[Boston Tea Party]], and several burgesses, including Henry, convened at the [[Raleigh Tavern]] to formulate a response. According to [[George Mason]], a former burgess from [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], who joined the committee in the work, Henry took the lead. Mason and Henry would form a close political relationship that would last until Mason's death in 1792. The resolution that Henry's committee produced set June 1, 1774, the date upon which the Port of Boston was to be closed, as a day of fasting and prayer. It passed the Burgesses, but Dunmore dissolved the body. Undeterred, the former legislators met at the Raleigh Tavern, and reconstituted themselves as [[First Virginia Convention|a convention]], to meet again in August, after there was time for county meetings to show local sentiment. They also called for a boycott of tea and other products.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=139\u2013141}}\n\nThe five [[Virginia Conventions]] (1774\u20131776) would guide the [[Colony of Virginia|Old Dominion]] to independence as royal authority came to an end. Their work was advanced by many resolutions of county meetings, denying the authority of Parliament over the colonies, and calling for a boycott of imports.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=141\u2013143}} The first convention met in Williamsburg in the chamber of the Burgesses beginning on August 1; Dunmore was absent from the capital [[Lord Dunmore's War|fighting the Native Americans]] and could not interfere. Divided between those who wanted separation from Britain and those who still hoped for some accommodation, it met for a week; one major decision was the election of delegates to [[First Continental Congress|a Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia. Henry was chosen as one of seven delegates, tying for second place with Washington, burgess for Fairfax County, both receiving three votes less than Randolph.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=198\u2013204}}\n\n[[File:Washington Pendleton Henry cropped.jpg|thumb|left|19th century engraving of Washington (center), Henry (right) and Pendleton riding to Philadelphia for the [[First Continental Congress]]]]\nAs Washington's estate, [[Mount Vernon]], lay on the way from Scotchtown to Philadelphia, he invited Henry to stop there and to ride to Philadelphia with him, and Henry did, also accompanied by Pendleton, another Virginia delegate to the Congress and a political rival of Henry's.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=205\u2013206}} Delegates and prominent Philadelphians took an intense interest in the Virginians, who had taken the lead in resistance to Britain, but whom few in the other colonies had met. This was Henry's first stay in the North, excepting a brief business trip to New York in 1770{{sfn|Kukla|p=145}} but he found that his actions were well known.<ref name = \"a\" /> The sessions began on September 5, 1774, at [[Carpenter's Hall]].{{sfn|Mayer|p=209}} [[Silas Deane]] of Connecticut described Henry as \"the compleatest speaker I ever heard&nbsp;... but in a Letter I can give You no Idea of the Music of his Voice, or the highwrought, yet Natural elegance of his Stile, or Manner\".{{sfn|Kukla|p=146}}{{sfn|Mayer|p=212}} The secretary of the Congress, [[Charles Thomson]], wrote that when Henry rose, he had expected little from a man dressed as plainly as a rural minister. \"But as he proceeded, [he] evinced such [an] unusual force of argument, and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified the whole house. Then the excited inquiry passed from man to man&nbsp;... 'Who is it? Who is it?' The answer from the few who knew him was, it is ''Patrick Henry''.\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nHenry was involved in the first dispute within the Congress, on whether each colony should have an equal vote, taking the position that there should be proportionate representation, with the larger colonies to have a greater voice. He argued that colonial borders must be swept away in the need for Americans to unify and create a government to fill the void left with the end of British authority, \"Fleets and armies and the present state of things shew that Government is dissolved. Where are your landmarks? your boundaries of colonies? The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.\"{{sfn|Mayer|pp=212\u2013213}} Henry lost the argument, and his theatrics made Congress's leaders afraid he would be unpredictable if placed on the lead committee, that charged with composing a statement regarding colonial rights. Instead, he was put on the next most important committee, one inquiring into commercial regulation. In the end, though, neither committee produced much of importance.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=214\u2013217}} Henry believed the purpose of the Congress should be to mobilize public opinion towards war. In this, he found common cause with [[John Adams]] and [[Samuel Adams]] of Massachusetts, but not all were of that opinion.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=218\u2013219}} According to Tate, Henry \"turned out not to be an especially influential member of the body\".<ref name = \"a\" /> The Congress decided on a petition to the King; Henry prepared two drafts but neither proved satisfactory. When Congress on October 26 approved a draft prepared by [[John Dickinson]] of Pennsylvania, who had consulted with Henry and also Richard Henry Lee, Henry had already departed for home, and Lee signed on his behalf. The petition was rejected in London.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nAfter the birth of their sixth child in 1771, Patrick's wife [[Sarah Shelton Henry]] began to exhibit symptoms of mental illness, and one reason for the move from Louisa County to Scotchtown was so they could be near family members. Henry's biographer, [[Jon Kukla]] believed her to be the victim of [[postpartum psychosis]], for which there was then no treatment. At times, she was restrained in a form of [[straitjacket]]. Although Virginia had opened the first public mental facility in North America in 1773, Henry decided that she was better off at Scotchtown, and prepared a large apartment for her there. She died in 1775, after which Henry avoided all objects that reminded him of her, and sold Scotchtown in 1777.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=158\u2013160}}\n\n===\"Liberty or Death\" (1775)===\n{{further| Give me liberty, or give me death!}}\n[[File:Patrick Henry speaking before the Virginia Assembly.tiff|thumb|right|[[Currier & Ives]] depiction of Henry giving his famous speech]]\n{{listen\n| filename = Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death - read by Bob Gonzalez for LibriVox's Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 026 (2012).ogg\n| title = <center>\"Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death\"<br><small>Read by Bob Gonzalez for LibriVox</small></center>\n| description = <center>Audio 00:08:51 ([https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Give_me_liberty_or_give_me_death full text])</center>\n| pos = right\n| type = speech\n| image = [[File:His Master's Voice (small).png|70px]]\n}}\nHanover County elected Henry as a delegate to the [[Second Virginia Convention]], which convened at [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in the town of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] on March 20, 1775. Richmond was selected as better protected from royal authority. The convention debated whether Virginia should adopt language from a petition by the planters of the [[Colony of Jamaica]]. This document contained complaints about British actions, but admitted the King could veto colonial legislation, and it urged reconciliation. Henry offered amendments to raise a militia independent of royal authority in terms that recognized that conflict with Britain was inevitable, sparking the opposition of moderates. He defended his amendments, concluding with the statement he is well known for:\n\n{{quote|If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.

Henry's speech carried the day, and the convention adopted his amendments.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=170\u2013172}} Still, they passed only narrowly, as many delegates were uncertain where the resistance urged by Henry and other radicals would lead, and few counties formed independent militia companies at the urging of the convention.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe text of Henry's speech first appeared in print in Wirt's 1817 biography, published 18 years after Patrick Henry's death.{{sfn|Raphael|p=147}} Wirt corresponded with men who had heard the speech and others who were acquainted with people who were there at the time. All agreed that the speech had produced a profound effect, but it seems that only one person attempted to render an actual text. Judge [[St. George Tucker]], who had been present for the speech, gave Wirt his recollections and Wirt wrote back stating that \"I have taken almost entirely Mr. Henry's speech in the Convention of '75 from you, as well as your description of its effect on your verbatim.\" The original letter with Tucker's remembrances has been lost.{{sfn|Raphael|p=148}}\n\nFor 160 years Wirt's account was taken at face value.

The gunpowder belonged to the government, to be issued in case of need, such as a slave uprising. Dunmore's actions outraged many Virginians. Henry had departed for Philadelphia, having been elected a delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]], but a messenger caught up with him before he left Hanover County, and he returned to take command of the local militia. Seeking the restoration of the powder, or that the colonists be compensated for it, on May 2, Henry led his troops towards Williamsburg with, as Dunmore wrote, \"all the Appearances of actual War\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=173\u2013180}} By this time, word of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] had arrived, and many Virginians believed that war with Britain had begun. With his troops reinforced by eager volunteers from nearby counties,{{sfn|McDonnell|p=64}} Henry likely had force enough to take Williamsburg and deal Dunmore a humiliating defeat, but increasingly prominent messengers urging caution slowed his advance, and in [[New Kent County, Virginia|New Kent County]], still some {{convert|16|mile}} from Williamsburg, three of Henry's fellow delegates to Congress helped persuade him to leave off his march. As Henry insisted the colonists be compensated, a member of the Governor's Council agreed to pay the value of the powder by [[bill of exchange]].{{sfn|Kukla|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\nAlthough Dunmore issued a proclamation against \"a certain ''Patrick Henry'', of the County of ''Hanover'', and a Number of his deluded Followers\", 15 county committees quickly approved Henry's action, and when he finally departed for Philadelphia, he was escorted to the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] by militia who lined the shore, cheering, as his ferry pulled away.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=183\u2013185}} Not all approved; Henry's march appalled some moderates, who feared he might provoke a conflict in which Virginia stood alone against Britain's might. They also saw him as a threat to the sanctity of property, for anyone's might be taken by Henry and his troops. As popular support for independence grew, opponents either joined in the movement, or decided it was wiser to remain silent.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=66\u201370}}\n\nHenry belatedly arrived at the Congress on May 18, 1775.{{sfn|Kukla|p=187}} Jefferson later stated that Henry played only a supporting role, and though there is not a complete record, the fact that he was not written of as having an impact appears to confirm that. The Congress appointed Washington as head of American forces, an appointment that Henry supported.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=106\u2013107}} At the end of the session, in August, Henry left Philadelphia for Virginia and would never again hold office outside its borders.<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nWhile Henry was returning, the [[Third Virginia Convention]] in August commissioned him as colonel of the [[1st Virginia Regiment]], and he took up the appointment later that month. Although Henry had little military experience, this was not considered a major drawback at the time, and he was held to have distinguished himself in the march on Williamsburg. General Washington, though, felt that the convention had \"made a Capital mistake when they took Henry out of the Senate to place him in the Field\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=189\u2013190}} In September, Virginia's [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] placed Henry in charge of all Virginia's forces.{{sfn|Kidd|p=109}} Despite the high title, Henry was placed under tight civilian control, and to an extent the willingness of moderates to go along with the appointment reflected a view that in that position, the volatile Henry would be contained.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=100\u2013102}}\n\nHenry moved to organize his regiment, and had no difficulty recruiting men.<ref name = \"a\" /> As commander, he organized [[Virginia State Navy#American Revolutionary War|a navy]].{{sfn|Kukla|pp=201\u2013202}} In November 1775, Dunmore, who though he had abandoned Williamsburg still held Norfolk, issued a proclamation offering freedom to any black slave or [[indentured servant]] willing and able to serve in his forces, which already included several hundred former slaves. Henry wrote to all [[Virginia militia#17th century|county lieutenants]], stating that the proclamation \"is fatal to the publick Safety\" and urging an \"unremitting Attention to the Government of the SLAVES may, I hope, counteract this dangerous Attempt. Constant, and well directed Patrols, seem indispensably necessary.\"{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=140, 148\u2013149}}<!-- quote on p. 149 -->\n\nHenry saw no action himself, and there were murmurs in the convention against his command; some feared he was too radical to be an effective military leader. In February 1776, Virginia's forces were reorganized as they were placed under Continental command. Henry was to retain his rank of colonel, but was placed under a former subordinate. Henry refused, and left the army; his troops were outraged by the slight to him, and considered leaving service, but he calmed the situation.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=201\u2013204}}\n\n== Independence and first time as governor ==\nHenry did not sit in the [[Fourth Virginia Convention]] which met in December 1775,{{sfn|Campbell|pp=172\u2013173}} as he was ineligible because of his military commission.{{sfn|Kukla|p=201}} Once he was again a civilian, the freeholders of Hanover County in April 1776 elected him to the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|fifth convention]], to meet the following month.{{sfn|Campbell|p=196}} Most delegates were for independence, but were divided on how to declare it, and over timing. Henry introduced a resolution declaring Virginia independent and urging the Congress to declare all the colonies free. When he at last spoke, according to clergyman [[Edmund Randolph]], Henry \"appeared in an element for which he was born. To cut the knot, which calm prudence was puzzled to untie, was worthy of the magnificence of his genius. He entered into no subtlety of reasoning but was roused by the now apparent spirit of the people as a pillar of fire, which notwithstanding the darkness of the prospect would conduct to the promised land.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=121\u2013122}} The eventual resolution was based in large part on Henry's, and passed unanimously on May 15, 1776. As well as declaring Virginia independent, the resolution instructed the state's delegates in Congress to press for American independence, which they would, with Lee introducing the motion, and Jefferson penning [[United States Declaration of Independence|the Declaration]].{{sfn|Kidd|p=122}}\n\nThe convention then proceeded to consider a constitution for Virginia's government. Henry was appointed to a committee under the leadership of [[Archibald Cary]].{{sfn|Campbell|pp=223\u2013224}} Much of the work fell to the final appointee to the committee, George Mason of Fairfax County, who did not arrive in Williamsburg until May 18, delayed by illness. Mason first drafted a [[Virginia Declaration of Rights|Declaration of Rights]]; it was discussed in the Cary Committee on May 25. Mason's draft, more than the final declaration, would be highly influential, used by Jefferson in writing the Declaration of Independence, and by writers of many 18th and 19th century state constitutions. When the draft was debated, Henry, at the request of a young delegate from [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]], [[James Madison]], produced an amendment changing Mason's call for religious tolerance to one requiring full [[freedom of worship]]. This was seen as a threat to Virginia's established religion, Anglicanism, and did not pass. Madison reworked it and had another delegate introduce it, likely Edmund Randolph, and it passed. Mason's draft called for a ban on [[bills of attainder]]. Henry got it removed by telling the delegates that some high offender might be reached by no other means.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=210\u2013213}} The convention approved the Declaration of Rights on June 12.{{sfn|Kidd|p=126}}\n\nVirginia's form of government, to be placed in its constitution, was a concern not only within its borders; Jefferson, in Philadelphia though he would have preferred to be in Williamsburg, sent a plan, and John Adams sent Henry a pamphlet containing his own views, to which Henry replied, \"your sentiments are precisely the same I have long since taken up, and they come recommended by you\".{{sfn|Campbell|pp=225\u2013226}} But it was Mason's plan for the government of Virginia which dominated, with much power given to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], the lower house of the legislature. The House of Delegates and the [[Senate of Virginia]] together formed the General Assembly, as the Virginia legislature is known. Under the 1776 constitution, the governor, elected by the two houses of the legislature, was not even given the power to veto legislation, and was required to act with the approval of the [[Governor's Council]] on important matters. Henry opposed the weakness of the governor, feeling it was risky at a time of war to have the executive so weak, but his views did not prevail. He had reason to rue the office's lack of power, as on June 29, 1776, the convention elected him as Virginia's first post-independence governor, by 60 votes to 45 for [[Thomas Nelson Jr.]]<ref name = \"a\" />{{sfn|Kukla|pp=214\u2013217}} The election of Henry, at that time Virginia's most popular politician, helped assure acceptance of the new authorities,{{sfn|Kidd|pp=129\u2013135}} but also placed him in a figurehead position, removed from the true power in the new government, the House of Delegates.{{sfn|McDonnell|p=244}}\n\nHenry was taken ill almost immediately upon being sworn in as governor on July 5, and recuperated at Scotchtown. He returned to Williamsburg in September, and corresponded with General Washington about the military situation. Washington, who was less effective because of the inadequacies of his troops, complained about the state militias, feeling a [[Continental Army]] committed for the duration of the war was needed. Henry helped recruit new troops for Washington, but his efforts were hampered by several issues, including the weakness of Henry's office. In December 1776, with the General Assembly alarmed at reports Washington's army was in retreat as the British occupied Philadelphia, legislators granted Henry temporary expanded powers, something that Jefferson was still unhappy about years later, feeling that Henry was trying to set himself up as dictator. In March 1777, Henry wrote to Washington seeking permission to recruit soldiers for terms of up to eight months. Washington's anger in his response that such troops were not useful caused Henry to drop the matter, stating that he deferred to Washington's experience in military matters. Recruiting remained a problem; many Virginians were willing to be members of the county militia, but did not want to join the Continental Army lest they be sent out of state or exposed to disease.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=129\u2013135}}{{sfn|McDonnell|p=258}} Desertion was also a problem Henry labored to solve with limited success; many Virginians had been induced to enlist with promises they would not be sent outside the state or local area, and left when orders came to march.{{sfn|McDonnell|p=266}}\n\nHenry was elected to a second one-year term without opposition, and took the oath on July 2, 1777. On October&nbsp;9 at Scotchtown, he married Dorothea Dandridge, daughter of his old client, Nathaniel West Dandridge of Hanover County. This made him closer kin to Washington, as Nathaniel Dandridge was [[Martha Washington]]'s uncle.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=247\u2013248}} To add to the six children he had by Sarah Henry, he would have eleven more by Dorothea, though two by the second marriage died very young. She brought 12 slaves with her, adding to the 30 Patrick Henry already had. He sold Scotchtown in 1777, and moved to [[Leatherwood Plantation]] in [[Henry County, Virginia|Henry County]], which the General Assembly had just created and named for him.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nWhen Washington and his troops encamped [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|at Valley Forge]] in the winter of 1777\u20131778, Henry arranged for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief. There was discontent against Washington, who was not seen by some as a successful general, and this resulted in the so-called [[Conway Cabal]]. Henry supported Washington when Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]] of Philadelphia, one of those unenthusiastic about Washington, sent the governor an unsigned letter, discussing machinations against the general. Henry immediately sent Washington the letter, and though it is uncertain if Henry recognized Rush's handwriting, Washington did, tipping him off to the conspiracy. President Washington wrote of Henry in 1794, \"I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against me at that time\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=233\u2013238}}\n\nIn an effort to secure Virginia's vast claims in the West (to the Mississippi River, and north to present-day Minnesota) against British and Native American forces, Henry in December 1777 sent [[George Rogers Clark]] on an expedition against [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], site of a British and French settlement. This part of Clark's mission was secret; his public orders merely stated he was to raise a militia and go to Kentucky (then part of Virginia). Clark captured Kaskaskia in July 1778, and remained north of the Ohio River for the remainder of Henry's governorship. Although the expedition did not turn out as well as hoped, Henry trumpeted its successes, but after he left the governorship in 1779 and was elected to the House of Delegates, he became a foe of Clark.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=139\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Patrick Henry estate marker Henry County Virginia 1922.JPG|thumb|Boulder and plaque marking former location of Leatherwood Plantation in [[Henry County, Virginia]]]]\nHenry was elected to a third term on May 29, 1778, again without opposition. Thomas Jefferson led the committee of notables sent to inform him of his election. In December 1778, Henry sent an urgent appeal to Congress for naval aid in protecting [[Chesapeake Bay]]. None was forthcoming,{{sfn|Campbell|pp=278\u2013281}} and on May 8, 1779, in the final days of Henry's governorship, British ships under Sir [[George Collier]] entered the bay, landed troops, and took [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], destroying valuable supplies. The British departed on May 24, and Henry, limited to three consecutive terms in office by the 1776 constitution, left office soon after, succeeded by Jefferson, and with his family returned to Leatherwood.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\n== Leatherwood and the House of Delegates (1779\u20131784)==\nAt Leatherwood, Henry devoted himself to local affairs in the thinly-populated county, and was given seats on the county court (the local governing body), as prominent landowners were, and on the parish vestry. He refused to be elected a delegate to Congress, stating that his personal business and past illness made that impossible. When Governor Jefferson sent a note to him in early 1780, Henry replied with gratitude, complaining of his isolation, and wrote of his many concerns about the state of affairs, as the war continued. The freeholders of Henry County soon thereafter sent its [[eponym]] to the House of Delegates. But within weeks, health problems recurred, causing his return to Leatherwood.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=341\u2013342}} While in Richmond (where the capital had been moved) Henry opposed a congressional plan to revalue [[Continental currency]] and impose certain taxes, feeling it would mostly benefit the North. He was successful in defeating it, but after he left Richmond, supporters got the legislature to pass it.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=153\u2013155}} Once he returned home, he was heavily involved in efforts to recruit local volunteers to suppress bands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who were conducting raids in the frontier area. Henry rode with the troops, though he did not lead them, and they were generally successful in suppressing the resistance. The volunteers were disbanded in September 1780.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=245\u2013247}}\n\nRichmond had been made the capital since it was believed to be less exposed to attack than Williamsburg, but in January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, [[Benedict Arnold]], sailed up the [[James River]] and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under [[Lord Cornwallis]] entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington's army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state, and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]].{{sfn|Kidd|pp=155\u2013158}} There is a story that Henry fled with other prominent leaders, and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville. But on learning Henry was with the group, she decided it must be all right, and offered them the best she had.{{sfn|Campbell|p=288}}\n\nJefferson did not go to Staunton: his term as governor had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in [[Bedford County, Virginia|Bedford County]], and Virginia had no governor for ten days. Several legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature thought better of it.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=289\u2013291}} Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nWith the war effectively ended by the American victory at the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Henry served as delegate from his county through 1784, when he was elected again as governor. Peace brought many adjustments, and Henry sponsored legislation to reform Virginia's currency and to adjust payments from contracts still outstanding from before periods of high inflation. Jefferson and others wanted to reopen contracts that had been already settled, but in depreciated currency; Henry thought that unjust, and because of his influence in the General Assembly, his version prevailed.<ref name = \"a\" />{{sfn|Campbell|pp=298\u2013299}} This had international implications, as some of the creditors were British, who sought payment in hard money rather than the depreciated currency that had been paid into escrow.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=355\u2013356}} At the May 1783 House of Delegates session, Henry successfully sponsored a resolution to repeal the trade embargo against Britain. That passed despite opposition from John Tyler Sr., the Speaker. Henry also introduced legislation to permit Loyalists to return to Virginia. There was considerable opposition to that, and the measure was held over until later in the year, by which time public sentiment had been gauged through meetings in each county. Henry spoke in the debate, asking \"shall we, who have laid the proud British lion at our feet, be frightened of its whelps?\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=265\u2013268}} Once it was amended (though in what way is not clear), the bill passed in November 1783.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=265\u2013268}}\n\nHenry worked together with James Madison, a delegate after three years in Congress, on a number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia's Protestant churches.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=356\u2013359}} Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation between church and state that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that taxpayers who were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was not alone in this belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, \"the general assessment plan is one of the main reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=167\u2013168}} The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons\u2014his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County\u2014but the cost was Henry's bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson's [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Statute for Religious Freedom]] through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=168\u2013171}}\n\n== Second period as governor (1784\u20131786) ==\nHenry's second time as governor was for two years, as the legislature re-elected him in 1785.{{sfn|Campbell|p=320}} It was, generally, more placid than his first. During this time, Henry and his family lived at \"[[Salisbury (Chesterfield County, Virginia)|Salisbury]]\", in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]], about {{convert|13|mi}} from Richmond{{sfn|Campbell|pp=320\u2013321}} in open country that he rented, though he had an official residence close to the [[Virginia Capitol]], which was then under construction. The General Assembly had passed legislation for new arms for the militia, and Henry worked with [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] to have them sent from France.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nEach county's militia was under firm local control, a state of affairs that had resulted in problems during the war as local militia refused orders from Henry and other governors when asked to serve out of state or conscript recruits into the Continental Army. In 1784, seeking to bring the militias under central control, the General Assembly passed an act terminating all militia officer commissions, and allowing Henry, with the consent of the Governor's Council, to appoint replacements. The Virginia Constitution required that there be a recommendation from the county court. Instead of asking the county court, Henry solicited recommendations from prominent citizens in each county whom he or his council members knew. The result was near-revolt in the counties, as citizens protested the act as unconstitutional, and counties refused to obey. The law went widely unenforced, and in October 1785, Henry requested the legislators to repeal it; they complied the following year.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=506\u2013513}}\n\nResidents of western North Carolina, what is today the state of Tennessee, sought to separate and become the [[State of Franklin]]. A former delegate, [[Arthur Campbell (Virginia)|Arthur Campbell]], wanted to join Virginia's adjacent [[Washington County, Virginia|Washington County]] as part of the scheme in 1785. Henry had Campbell removed as a militia officer and from his other county offices, as well as ousting Campbell's supporters, replacing them with residents of known loyalty.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=286\u2013287}} Although Henry urged leniency in his report to the General Assembly that October, stating that the Washington County separatists had been led astray by anxiety because of the poor economy,{{sfn|Mayer|p=366}} he had the legislature pass a Treason Act forbidding the setting-up of a rival government within Virginia territory.{{sfn|Kukla|p=287}}\n\nHenry also sought to advance Virginia's development, both as governor and through his personal investments. He backed schemes to open navigation on the upper Potomac and James rivers, envisioning canals to connect them to the [[Ohio River Valley]]. He also supported a scheme to have a canal across the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], believing that with it, the trade of Eastern North Carolina would flow through [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. He owned land along the proposed route, and sought to interest General Washington in the scheme, but was not successful. Despite Henry's support for internal improvements, he failed to notify Virgnia's representatives of their appointment to meet with Maryland over navigation on the Potomac, and only two, including George Mason, attended what became known as the [[Mount Vernon Conference]] (1785). Edmund Randolph, unable to attend because of lack of timely notification, hinted that the reason for Henry's neglect was not forgetfulness, but a growing hostility towards things federal. In 1786, Henry was more assiduous in notifying delegates to the [[Annapolis Conference]] called with the support of Madison, who was appointed a delegate.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=366\u2013367}} Henry stepped down at the end of his fifth term, stating he needed to devote time to his family and earn money to support it.{{sfn|Kidd|p=181}}\n\n== Opponent of the Constitution (1787\u20131790) ==\nDisinclined to return to distant Leatherwood after his time as governor ended in November 1786, Henry hoped to purchase land in Hanover County but bought property in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]] instead.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=370\u2013371}} [[Hampden-Sydney College]], which he had helped found in 1775, is located in that county, and Henry enrolled his sons there. The local freeholders elected Henry to the House of Delegates in early 1787, and he would serve there until the end of 1790. The new governor, Randolph, offered to make Henry a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], scheduled to meet in Philadelphia later that year to consider changes to the [[Articles of Confederation]], the document that had governed the loose union among the states since 1777.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=319\u2013320}} Henry refused the appointment, alleging it would be difficult financially.<ref name = \"a\" /> One legend is that when Henry was asked why he had not gone, he replied, \"I smelt a rat.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\nHenry's record of urging unity made him a potential supporter of a closer bond between the states, and as late as the end of 1786, Madison hoped for Henry as an ally in the fight. Several factors had eroded Henry's trust in the Northern states, including what he deemed Congress's failure to send adequate troops to protect Virginia settlers in the Ohio River Valley. Henry was outraged by the [[Jay\u2013Gardoqui Treaty]], which would have ceded exclusive navigation on the Mississippi River to Spain for 25 years.{{sfn|Kidd|p=177}} This was in exchange for commercial concessions that would benefit New England, where there was a growing separatist movement. Northern votes were sufficient to relax [[John Jay]]'s negotiating instructions, which had originally forbidden restricting American navigation on the Mississippi, to allow him to reach a deal; Southern votes were sufficient to block the treaty's ratification. These events caused Henry and some other Virginia leaders to feel betrayed, and to have little trust in the good faith of the North.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=300\u2013305}}\n\nWhen the Philadelphia convention adjourned in September 1787, its president, Washington, returned home and immediately sent a copy of the new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] to Henry, recommending he support it. Henry was in Richmond for the autumn legislative session as delegate for Prince Edward County. While thanking Washington for presiding in Philadelphia and for sending the document, he said of it, \"I have to lament that I cannot bring my Mind to accord with the proposed Constitution. The Concern I feel on this account is really greater than I am able to express.\"{{sfn|Kukla|p=307}} He hinted, though, that he was still open to changing his mind. This allowed Henry to remain noncommittal as opponents of the Constitution, such as Mason and Edmund Randolph (both delegates at Philadelphia) published their opinions, and to refine his views.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=307\u2013310}} In the initial Virginia battle over the Constitution, the call for a convention to decide whether the state should ratify it, Henry and Mason were among those who supported allowing the convention to ratify it conditional on amendments being made. The matter was compromised with language allowing the convention's members full rein in deciding what to do, and it was set for June 1788, with elections in March; both those who supported it and those who did not felt time would be to their advantage.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=381\u2013382}}\n\nHenry was elected to the convention from Prince Edward County without difficulty, though [[John Blair Smith]], president of Hampden-Sydney, caused him some annoyance by having students read at an assembly, in Henry's presence, a speech by Henry and Smith's own rebuttal.{{sfn|Mayer|p=391}} Henry opposed the Constitution because of its grant of a strong executive, the president; he had not fought to free Virginia from King George to surrender such powers to what might prove a despot. Henry accordingly deemed the Constitution a backwards step, and a betrayal of those who had died in the Revolutionary cause.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=191\u2013192}} At the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], which began on June 2, 1788,{{sfn|Kukla|p=321}} according to Kidd, Henry's \"personality blazed in all its power and glory.\"{{sfn|Kidd|p=194}} Henry suggested that the framers of the Constituition had no right to begin it \"We the People\" and ignore the powers of the states. He suggested that the document put too much power in the hands of too few.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=194\u2013195}} He noted that the Constitution, proposed without a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], did not protect individual rights, \n{{quote|Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend the security of your liberty? Liberty, the greatest of all earthly blessings\u2014give us that precious jewel and you may take everything else. But I fear I have lived long enough to become an old-fashioned fellow. Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man may, in these refined, enlightened days, be deemed old-fashioned: if so, I am contented to be so.{{sfn|Campbell|p=340}}}}\n\nMadison, the lead supporter of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill through most of the convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length{{sfn|Kidd|pp=200\u2013201}} and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates.{{sfn|Campbell|p=335}} Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks.{{sfn|Kidd|p=201}} Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 25<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/ratification-order-of-constitution-105416</ref>\u00b0 to ratify the Constitution, by the fact that the convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. (It is ironic that Virginia, a substantial leader in creating the 1787 Constitution was not among the 9 states required for ratification, lagging New Hampshire by 4 days.) George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratification, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\nHenry returned to the House of Delegates, where he successfully defeated Madison's effort to become federal senator from Virginia, for under the original Constitution, senators were elected by legislators, not the people. Although Henry made it clear he would not serve in office outside Virginia, he received a number of votes in the election. Madison gained election to the House of Representatives in a district where he was opposed by [[James Monroe]], though Madison's supporters complained that Henry's supporters in the legislature had unfairly placed Madison's county, Orange, in a district leaning anti-Federalist. Henry also saw to it that the requested amendments were incorporated in petitions from the legislature to the federal Congress. Despite his qualms, Henry served as one of Virginia's presidential electors, voting for Washington (elected President) and John Adams (elected Vice President).{{sfn|Campbell|pp=375\u2013377}} Henry was disappointed when the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] passed only amendments dealing with personal liberties, not those designed to weaken the government.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=378\u2013379}}\n\nA final cause Henry engaged in before leaving the House of Delegates at the end of 1790<ref name = \"a\" /> was over the [[Funding Act of 1790]], by which the federal government took over the debts of the states, much of which dated from the Revolutionary War. On November&nbsp;3 of that year, Henry introduced a resolution, which would be passed by the House of Delegates and by the [[Senate of Virginia|state Senate]], declaring the act \"repugnant to the constitution of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a power not granted to the general [federal] government\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=385\u2013366}} This would prove the first of many resolutions passed by Southern state legislatures in the decades to come, defending [[states' rights]] and strict interpretation of the Constitution.{{sfn|Kukla|p=368}}\n\n== Later years ==\nLeaving the House of Delegates after 1790, Henry found himself in debt, owing in part to expenses while governor, and sought to secure his family's fortune through land speculation and a return to the practice of law. Not fully reconciled to the federal government, Henry contemplated a new republic in the thinly-settled frontier lands, but his plans came to nothing.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=218\u2013221}} He did not travel as widely for cases as he had in the 1760s, confining his practice mostly to Prince Edward and Bedford counties, though in a compelling case, or for a large enough fee, he would travel to Richmond or over the mountains to [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]] (today in West Virginia).{{sfn|Mayer|p=463}}\n\nWhen the [[List of former United States district courts#Virginia|new federal court]] opened in Virginia in 1790, British creditors promptly filed over a hundred cases seeking to enforce claims from the Revolutionary War. Henry was part of the defense team in ''Jones v. Walker'' before the federal court in 1791; his co-counsel included [[John Marshall]], who prepared the written pleadings while Henry did much of the courtroom advocacy. Henry argued the case for three days; Marshall, looking back, called him \"a great orator&nbsp;... and much more, a learned lawyer, a most accurate thinker, and a profound reasoner\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=370\u2013372}} The case ended inconclusively after one of the judges died, but the legal teams reassembled for the case of ''[[Ware v. Hylton]]''. Argued before another three-judge panel that included [[Chief Justice of the United States]] John Jay and Associate Justice [[James Iredell]], Henry's argument provoked Justice Iredell to exclaim, \"Gracious God! He is an orator indeed.\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=372\u2013373}} Henry and Marshall were initially successful, but the plaintiffs appealed, and after Marshall argued his only case before the Supreme Court, that court in 1796 ruled for the British creditors.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nHenry's friendship with Washington had cooled somewhat amid the ratification debates, but by 1794, both men were looking to reconcile. Henry found himself more aligned with Washington than with Jefferson and Madison, and Washington still considered himself indebted to Henry for notifying him about the Conway Cabal. Washington offered Henry a seat on the Supreme Court in 1794, but he refused, feeling his family needed him. Washington also tried to get Henry to accept positions as Secretary of State and as minister to Spain, and Virginia Governor [[Henry Lee III|\"Light-Horse\" Harry Lee]] wanted to appoint him to the Senate. Henry refused each time. Henry's continuing popularity in Virginia made him an attractive ally, and even Jefferson tried to recruit him, sending word though a mutual friend that he bore no grudge.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=224\u2013229}} After Washington made it clear he would not seek a third term in 1796, Marshall and Harry Lee discussed a possible Henry run for president with him, but Henry was unwilling. The General Assembly elected him as governor again that year, but he declined, citing age and health. Henry's refusal to accept these offices increased his popularity as he was, like Washington, seen as a [[Cincinnatus]], giving up power to return to his farm and his plow.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=234\u2013236}}\n\n[[File:Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial - his fame his best epitaph.jpg|thumb|left|Graves of Patrick Henry and his wife Dorothea in the family burying ground at Red Hill.

In 1794 Henry purchased [[Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial|Red Hill]] near [[Brookneal, Virginia]] in [[Charlotte County, Virginia|Charlotte County]], where he and his family lived much of the year, though they moved to Long Island in the \"sickly season\".{{sfn|Campbell|p=388}} Henry was gratified at the election of his old friend John Adams as president in 1796 over his foe Jefferson, but Henry's commitment to the [[Federalist Party]] was tested by the repressive [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] of 1798. He chose to say nothing, but supported the campaign of Marshall, a moderate Federalist, for the House of Representatives; Marshall won narrowly. Henry was under considerable pressure from Virginia Federalists to return to politics, but it was not until former president Washington urged him to run for the legislature in early 1799 that Henry gave in.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=239\u2013239}} Turning down an offer from President Adams to make him an envoy to France, Henry was elected as delegate from Charlotte County on March 4, 1799. The legislature had no immediate session scheduled, so he returned to Red Hill, and never left again, dying there of stomach cancer at his home on June 6, 1799.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=392\u2013393}} He was buried at Red Hill.{{sfn|Campbell|p=418}}\n\nIn Henry's will, he left his estates and his 67 slaves to be divided between his wife and his six sons.

'Tis true he could talk\u2014Gods! how he ''could'' talk! but&nbsp;... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789&nbsp;... not one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory\".{{sfn|Beeman|p=301}} Beeman, for his part, concluded, \"the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history\".{{sfn|Beeman|p=301}} This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but who got to fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions.{{sfn|Beeman|pp=301\u2013302}} Wirt did not print many of Jefferson's criticisms of Henry, who had irritated Jefferson to such an extent he was still criticizing Henry to guests at [[Monticello]] in 1824.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=246\u2013247}} Jefferson's negative assessments of Henry, whether justified or not, have adversely affected Henry's historical reputation.{{sfn|Beeman|p=302}}\n\nHenry has always been acclaimed by Americans for the brilliance of his political oratory.{{sfn|Kidd|p=247}} Kukla wrote, \"Henry explained the Revolution to ordinary men and women through America in words they understood\u2014and inspired them to fight for liberty.\"{{sfn|Kukla|p=394}} Mayer argued, \"Henry had forged a popular and partisan political style whose democratic implications took another generation to realize fully and accept. His career pointed the transition from the political squirearchy of the eighteenth century to the mass politics of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s day\".{{sfn|Mayer|p=474}} In his study of Henry's oratory, David A. McCants suggested that Henry's position as great American orator of his day was not so much because of his \"heroism and eloquence\" but for adapting the clashing philosophies, religious and political, that met in Henry's Virginia, to create a new style of oratory that appealed to the masses.{{sfn|McCants|pp=3\u20135}} According to Tate, \"by his unmatched oratorical powers, by employing a certain common touch to win the unwavering loyalty of his constituents, and by closely identifying with their interests, he almost certainly contributed to making the Revolution a more widely popular movement than it might otherwise have become\".<ref name= \"a\" /> Kidd argued that the historical focus on the quality of Henry's oratory may result from a discomfort with the content of his speeches, especially his opposition to the Constitution.{{sfn|Kidd|p=247}}\n\nDuring the Civil War era, both sides claimed Henry as a partisan, [[abolitionist]]s citing his writings against slavery, and those sympathetic to the Southern cause pointing to his hostility to the Constitution. That opposition by Henry came to be seen by many writers, even those friendly to Henry, as a blot on an otherwise admirable career.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=247\u2013249}} Beeman, writing in 1986, just before the Constitution's bicentennial, predicted that during that anniversary, \"it will be hard to avoid depicting Henry as one of history's losers, as one too short-sighted to see beyond the bounds of his own native state to glimpse the promise of national greatness embodied in the federal Constitution.\"{{sfn|Beeman|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\nHenry has been cited as a hero to both Left and Right, but has become a particular favorite of the latter. He is especially attractive to Christian conservatives, who cite his deep religious beliefs, as well as his writings and speeches in favor of Christian virtue, and in defense of religious liberty. Because Henry was educated at home, by his father, he has become a symbol of the [[homeschooling]] movement. In 2000, [[Patrick Henry College]] was founded in [[Purcellville, Virginia]], in large part for those who had been homeschooled. Although Henry's most famous declaration has proved as adaptable as ever in the hands of the Right (one sign at a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally in 2010 read \"Give Me Liberty or Give Me Debt\"), according to Kidd, \"few Americans today, Tea Partiers or others, take seriously Henry's fundamental criticisms of the Constitution.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=249\u2013250}}\n\nTate wrote of Henry, \"Of the numerous leaders who were active largely at the state level and who generally opposed ratification of the Federal Constitution, Henry was one of the few who came to be ranked among the truly major figures of the American Revolution.\"<ref name = \"a\" /> Kukla concurred, noting that except for two years in the Continental Congress, Henry never held national office, \"and yet he was a founder of the republic\".{{sfn|Kukla|p=393}} Kidd noted the hazy view of Henry that Americans today have:\n\n{{quote|\nHenry's memory has taken on a vague, patriotic cast that fails to capture his fractious yet exemplary life. The \"real\" Henry was branded a traitor and apostate on multiple occasions by his many enemies, including Thomas Jefferson. His vision of the American republic was not a matter of sentiment and grand words and gestures; it was grounded in virtue, religious faith, and responsive local government. Standing against his fellow Founders James Madison and Thomas Jefferson at almost every turn in the 1780s and '90s, and steadfastly opposing the adoption of the Constitution, he was the boldest of patriots.{{sfn|Kidd|p=254}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gerrymandering in the United States]]\n*[[History of Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Source bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last=Beeman|first=Richard R.|authorlink=Richard Beeman|title=The Democratic Faith of Patrick Henry|journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|volume=95|issue=3 |date=July 1987|pages=301\u2013316|issn=0042-6636|ref={{sfnRef|Beeman}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Norine Dickson|title=Patrick Henry: Patriot and Statesman|url=https://archive.org/details/patrickhenrypatr0000camp|url-access=registration|year=1969|location=New York, NY|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|oclc=694997|ref={{sfnRef|Campbell}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Thomas S.|year=2011|title=Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots|location=New York, NY|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Patrick_Henry.html?id=5MCnzrset38C|isbn=978-0-465-00928-2|ref={{sfnRef|Kidd}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kukla|first=Jon|title=Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty|year=2017|location=New York, NY|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9081-4|ref={{sfnRef|Kukla}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Henry|title=A Son of Thunder: Patrick Henry and the American Republic|location=New York, NY|year=1986|publisher=Grove Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Son_of_Thunder.html?id=dPPT0miYV3QC|isbn=978-0-8021-3815-6|ref={{sfnRef|Mayer}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=McCants|first=David A.|title=Patrick Henry, the Orator|year=1990|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-26210-4|ref={{sfnRef|McCants}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=McDonnell|first=Michael A.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|title=The Politics of War: Race, Class and Conflict in Revolutionary Virginia|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4696-0107-6|ref={{sfnRef|McDonnell}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Meade|first=Robert D.|year=1957|title=Patrick Henry: Patriot in the Making|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=Lippincott|oclc= 964630|ref={{sfnRef|Meade}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Edmund S.|last2=Morgan|first2=Helen M.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|title=The Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution|year=1995|origyear=1953|isbn=978-0-8078-4513-4|ref={{sfnRef|Morgan and Morgan}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Raphael|first=Ray|year=2004|title=Founding Myths: Stories that Hide Our Patriotic Past|location=New York, NY|publisher=The New Press|isbn=978-1-56584-921-1|ref={{sfnRef|Raphael}}|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565849211}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beeman, Richard R.

Henry was elected to the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], where he quickly became notable for his inflammatory rhetoric against the [[Stamp Act of 1765]].\n\nIn 1774 and 1775, Henry served as a delegate to the [[First Continental Congress|First]] and [[Second Continental Congress]]es, but did not prove particularly influential. He gained further popularity among the people of Virginia, both through his oratory at the convention and by marching troops towards the colonial capital of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] after the [[Gunpowder Incident]] until the munitions seized by the royal government were paid for. Henry urged independence, and when the [[Fifth Virginia Convention]] endorsed this in 1776, served on the committee charged with drafting the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] and the original [[Virginia Constitution]]. Henry was promptly elected governor under the new charter, and served a total of five one-year terms.\n\nAfter leaving the governorship in 1779, Henry served in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] until he began his last two terms as governor in 1784. The actions of the national government under the [[Articles of Confederation]] made Henry fear a strong federal government and he declined appointment as a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|1787 Constitutional Convention]]. He actively opposed the ratification of the Constitution. He returned to the practice of law in his final years, declining several offices under the federal government. A slaveholder throughout his adult life, he hoped to see the institution end, but had no plan for that beyond ending the importation of slaves. Henry is remembered for his oratory, and as an enthusiastic promoter of the fight for independence.\n\n==Early life and struggles (1736\u20131759)==\nHenry was born on the family farm, [[Birthplace of Patrick Henry|Studley]], in [[Hanover County, Virginia|Hanover County]] in the [[Colony of Virginia]], on May 29, 1736.<ref name=a>{{cite web|first=Thad|last=Tate|title=Henry, Patrick|work=[[American National Biography Online]]|date=February 2000|url=\nhttp://www.anb.org/articles/01/01-00396.html|accessdate=October 8, 2017|url-access=subscription }}</ref> His father was John Henry, an immigrant from [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, who had attended [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], University of Aberdeen, there before emigrating to Virginia in the 1720s.{{sfn|Meade|pp=13\u201318}} Settling in Hanover County in about 1732, John Henry married Sarah Winston Syme, a wealthy widow from a prominent local family of English ancestry.{{sfn|Meade|pp=21\u201324}}\n\nPatrick Henry shared his name with his uncle, an Anglican minister, and until the elder Patrick's death in 1777 often went as Patrick Henry Jr.{{sfn|Kukla|p=13}} Henry attended a local school until about the age of 10. There was then no academy in Hanover County, and he was tutored at home by his father.{{sfn|Kidd|p=9}} The young Henry engaged in the typical recreations of the times, such as music and dancing, and was particularly fond of hunting.{{sfn|Kidd|p=12}} Since the family's lands and slaves would for the most part pass to his older half-brother John Syme Jr., Henry needed to make his own way in the world.{{sfn|Mayer|p=32}} At the age of 15, he became a clerk for a local merchant, and a year later opened a store with his older brother William. The store was not successful.<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nThe religious revival known as the [[Great Awakening]] reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took him to hear Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as [[Samuel Davies (clergyman)|Samuel Davies]] taught him that it is not enough to save one's own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=13\u201323}} His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.{{sfn|Kidd|p=37}}\n\nReligion would play a key part in Henry's life; his father and namesake uncle were both devout and were both major influences in his life. Nevertheless, he was uncomfortable with the role of the Anglican Church as the established religion in Virginia, and fought for religious liberty throughout his career. Henry wrote to a group of Baptists who had sent a letter of congratulations following Henry's 1776 election as governor, \"My earnest wish is, that Christian charity, forbearance and love may unite all different persuasions as brethren.\"<ref name = \"henrychrist\" /> He criticized his state of Virginia, feeling that slavery and lack of religious toleration had retarded its development. He told the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]] in 1788, \"That religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men have an equal, natural and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others.\"<ref name = \"henrychrist\">{{cite web|last=Wells|first=James M.|title=The Christian Philosophy of Patrick Henry|url=http://www.christianhistorysociety.com/henrythesis1.html|accessdate=November 16, 2017|publisher=Christian History Society}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shelton House - Shenk.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Rural Plains]] near Totopotomoy Creek in Virginia. Henry was reportedly married to Sarah Shelton in the parlor.]]\nIn 1754, Henry married Sarah Shelton, reportedly in the parlor of her family house, [[Rural Plains]]. (It also became known as Shelton House.) As a wedding gift, her father gave the couple six slaves and the {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Pine Slash|Pine Slash Farm]] near [[Mechanicsville, Virginia|Mechanicsville]]. Pine Slash was exhausted from earlier cultivations, and Henry worked with the slaves to clear fresh fields. The latter half of the 1750s were years of drought in Virginia, and after the main house burned down, Henry gave up and moved to the [[Hanover Tavern]], owned by Sarah's father.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=45\u201348}}\n\nHenry often served as host at Hanover Tavern as part of his duties, and entertained the guests by playing the fiddle. Among those who stayed there during this time was the young [[Thomas Jefferson]], aged 17, en route to his studies at the [[College of William and Mary]], and who later wrote that he became well acquainted with Henry then, despite their age difference of six years.{{sfn|Mayer|p=50}} Jefferson in 1824 told [[Daniel Webster]], \"Patrick Henry was originally a bar-keeper\", a characterization that Henry's biographers have found to be unfair; that his position was more general than that, and that the main business of Hanover Tavern was serving travelers, not alcohol. [[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]], Henry's earliest biographer, rejected Jefferson's suggestion that Henry's profession then was a bartender, but noted it would have been \"very natural in Mr. Henry's situation\" to do what was necessary to ensure that guests were properly seen to.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n== Revolutionary lawyer and politician (1760\u20131775) ==\n===Parson's Cause===\nWhile at Hanover Tavern, Henry found time to study the law. How long he did so is unclear; he later said it was as little as a month. On the advice of a local lawyer, Henry in 1760 applied for a lawyer's license, appearing before the examiners\u2014prominent attorneys in the colonial capital of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]]. The examiners were impressed by Henry's mind even though his knowledge of legal procedures was scant. He passed in April 1760, and he thereafter opened a practice, appearing in the courts of Hanover and nearby counties.<ref name = \"a\" />{{sfn|Kukla|pp=30\u201340}}\n\nThe droughts of the 1750s had led to a rise in the price of tobacco. Hard currency was scarce in Virginia, and salaries in the colony were often expressed in terms of pounds of tobacco. Prior to the drought, the price of tobacco had long been twopence per pound (0.45 kilograms) and in 1755 and 1758, the Virginia [[House of Burgesses]], the elected lower house of the colonial legislature, passed [[Two Penny Act]]s, allowing debts expressed in tobacco to be paid at the rate of twopence per pound for a limited period.{{sfn|Campbell|p=28}} These payees included public officials, including Anglican clergy\u2014Anglicanism was then Virginia's [[established church]], and several ministers petitioned the [[Board of Trade]] in London to overrule the Burgesses, which it did. Five clergymen then brought suit for back pay, cases known as the [[Parson's Cause]]; of them, only the Reverend [[James Maury]] was successful, and a jury was to be empaneled in Hanover County on December 1, 1763 to fix damages. Henry was engaged as counsel by Maury's parish [[vestry]] for this hearing.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=39\u201341}} Patrick Henry's father, Colonel John Henry, was the presiding judge.{{sfn|McCants|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Parson's Cause by Cooke.jpg|thumb|left|''Patrick Henry Arguing the Parson's Cause'' by [[George Cooke (painter)|George Cooke]]]]\nAfter the evidence was presented proving the facts at issue, Maury's counsel gave a speech in praise of the clergy, many of whom were in attendance. Henry responded with a one-hour speech, ignoring the question of damages, but which focused on the unconstitutionality of the veto of the Two Penny Act by the king's government. Henry deemed any king who annulled good laws, such as the Two Penny Act, as a \"tyrant\" who \"forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience\", and the clergy, by challenging an impartial law designed to bring economic relief, had shown themselves to be \"enemies of the community\".{{sfn|McCants|pp=118\u2013119}} The opposing counsel accused Henry of treason, and some took up that cry, but Henry continued, and the judge did nothing to stop him.{{sfn|McCants|p=119}} Henry urged the jury to make an example of Maury, for the benefit of any who might seek to imitate him, and suggested the jury return damages of [[History of the British farthing|one farthing]].{{sfn|Kukla|p=45}} The jury was out for only moments, and fixed damages at one penny. Henry was hailed as a hero. According to biographer Henry Mayer, Henry had \"defined the prerogatives of the local elite by the unorthodox means of mobilizing the emotions of the lower ranks of religious and political outsiders.\"{{sfn|Mayer|p=66}} Henry's popularity greatly increased, and he added 164 new clients in the year after the Parson's Cause.{{sfn|Campbell|p=37}}\n\n===Stamp Act===\n[[File:Patrick Henry Rothermel.jpg|thumb|upright|Patrick Henry's \"Treason\" speech before the [[House of Burgesses]] in an 1851 painting by [[Peter F. Rothermel]]]]\n\nIn the wake of the Parson's Cause, Henry began to gain a following in backwoods Virginia, because of his oratory defending the liberties of the common people, and thanks to his friendly manner. He boosted his standing further in 1764 by representing Nathaniel West Dandridge, elected for Hanover County, in an election contest before the Burgesses. Dandridge was alleged to have bribed voters with drink, a practice common but illegal. Henry is said to have made a brilliant speech in defense of the rights of voters, but the text does not survive. Henry lost the case, but met influential members on the Committee of Privileges and Elections, such as [[Richard Henry Lee]], [[Peyton Randolph]] and [[George Wythe]].{{sfn|Kidd|pp=46\u201348}} In 1765, William Johnson, the brother of Thomas Johnson (who had been one of Henry's clients in the Parson's Cause), resigned as burgess for [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]]. As Henry owned land in the county (acquired from his father to settle a loan), he was eligible to be a candidate, and he won the seat in May 1765. He left immediately for Williamsburg as the session had already begun.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nThe expense of the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u20131763) had nearly doubled Britain's national debt, and as much of the war had taken place in and around North America, the British government looked for ways of directly taxing the American colonies. The 1765 [[Stamp Act]] was both a means of raising revenue and one of asserting authority over the colonies.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=53\u201358}} The Burgesses instructed their agent in London, Edward Montague, to oppose the measure, and other colonial legislatures similarly instructed their representatives. Considerable debate began over the proposed measure, and in Virginia pamphleteers developed arguments Henry had made in the Parson's Cause.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=49\u201356}}\n\nPatrick Henry was sworn into a sleepy session of the legislature on May 20; many of the members had left town. On about May 28, a ship arrived with an urgent letter from Montague: the Stamp Act had passed. On May 29, Henry introduced the [[Virginia Resolves|Virginia Stamp Act Resolves]].{{sfn|Kidd|p=58}} The first two resolutions affirmed that the colonists had the same rights and privileges as Britons; the next two stated that taxation should be exacted only by one's representatives. The fifth was the most provocative, as it named the Virginia legislature, the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]], as the representatives of Virginia empowered to tax. Two other resolutions were offered, though their authorship is uncertain.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=53, 58\u201359}} Edmund and Helen Morgan, in their account of the Stamp Act crisis, suggested that Henry acted as he saw the Stamp Act as both a threat to Virginians' rights, and an opportunity to advance himself politically.{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|p=305}}\n\nThere are no verbatim transcriptions of Henry's speech in opposition to the Stamp Act. Texts are reconstructions, for the most part based on recollections decades later by which time both the speech and Henry had become famous. For example, Jefferson, still in his studies at the nearby College of William and Mary, recalled the splendor of Henry's oratory.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=51\u201353}} No attempt was made to reconstruct Henry's words until 1790, when [[James Madison]] wrote to former burgess [[Edmund Pendleton]], but Madison learned that Pendleton had not been present; a second attempt did not occur until Wirt began work on his biography of Henry in 1805. A French traveler, whose name is not known, and whose journal was discovered in 1921,{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|p=94}} recorded at the time of Henry's speech that \"one of the members stood up and said that he had read that in former times [[Tarquin the Elder|Tarquin]] and [[Julius Caesar|Julius]] had their [[Brutus]], [[Charles I of England|Charles]] had his [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], and he did not doubt but some good American would stand up, in favour of his country\".{{sfn|Kidd|pp=51\u201353}} As Henry had seemingly called for the killing of [[King George III]], there were cries of \"Treason!\" in the chamber, including by the Speaker, [[John Robinson (Virginia)|John Robinson]]. [[John Tyler Sr.]] (father of the future president), who was standing with Jefferson as they watched the session, called this one of \"the trying moments which is decisive of character\", and both recalled that Henry did not waver: \"If this be treason, make the most of it!\".{{sfn|Kukla|p=71}}\n\nThe Burgesses adopted the first five resolutions\u2014the two others, which denied the right of any other body but the General Assembly to tax Virginians, and which branded anyone who stated that Parliament had that right an enemy of the colony, were not passed.{{sfn|Kidd|p=53}} According to the Morgans, the passed resolutions differed little from language in petitions sent by the Burgesses to London in 1764, and the opposition to Henry may have been in part because he was an upstart in Virginia politics.{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|p=97}} On May 31, with Henry absent and likely returning home, the Burgesses expunged the fifth resolution, and the Royal Governor, [[Francis Fauquier]], refused to allow any of them to be printed in the official newspaper, the ''[[The Virginia Gazette#Historical papers|Virginia Gazette]]''. With the official texts of the passed resolutions denied them, newspapers in the colonies and in Britain printed all seven resolutions, all of them presented as the resolves of the influential Colony of Virginia. The resolutions, more radical as a group than what was actually passed, reached Britain by mid-August, the first American reaction to the passage of the Stamp Act. In North America, they galvanized opposition to the Stamp Act, and made Virginia the leader in opposition to Parliament's action.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=73\u201379}} According to Thad Tate in Henry's ''American National Biography'' article, \"Not only in Virginia but across the mainland British colonies, Henry quickly established his reputation as an uncompromising opponent of imperial policy.\"<ref name = \"a\" /> The Morgans noted, \"In Virginia the Stamp Act provided the opportunity for Patrick Henry's spectacular entry into politics\".{{sfn|Morgan and Morgan|pp=204\u2013305}}\n\n=== Lawyer and landowner (1766\u20131773)===\nFauquier dissolved the Burgesses on June 1, 1765, hoping new elections would purge the radicals, but this proved not to be the case, as conservative leaders were instead voted out. The governor did not call the Burgesses into session until November 1766, by which time the Stamp Act had been repealed by Parliament, preventing Virginia from sending delegates to the [[Stamp Act Congress]] in New York. Henry's role in the active resistance that took place in Virginia against the Stamp Act is uncertain. Although the lack of a legislative session sidelined Henry during the crisis, it also undermined the established leaders of the chamber, who remained scattered through the colony with little opportunity to confer, as the public rage for change grew hotter.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=80\u201382}}\n\nWhen the Burgesses eventually convened, Henry sometimes opposed the colonial leaders, but united with them against British policies. In the late 1760s and early 1770s, Henry spent more time concentrating on his personal affairs,<ref name = \"a\" /> though he advanced in standing within the Burgesses, serving on powerful committees.{{sfn|Campbell|p=72}} The Henry family moved to a new house on his Louisa County property, probably in late 1765, and lived there until 1769, when he returned to Hanover County. His law practice remained strong until the courts under royal authority closed in 1774. Jefferson later complained that Henry was lazy and ignorant in the practice of the law, his sole talent trying cases before juries, and accused Henry of charging criminal defendants high fees to get them acquitted. Norine Dickson Campbell, in her biography of Henry, found Jefferson's comments unfounded; that Henry's rates were moderate for the time, and cited earlier historians as to Henry's competence.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=62\u201365}} Jefferson's comments came years after the two, once friends, quarreled.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=71\u201372}} In 1769, Henry was admitted to practice before the [[General Court of Virginia]] in Williamsburg, a venue more prestigious than the county courts.{{sfn|Kidd|p=71}}{{sfn|Campbell|p=xvii}}\n\nHenry invested some of his earnings in frontier lands, in what is now the western part of Virginia, as well as in present-day West Virginia and Kentucky. He claimed ownership though many of them were controlled by the Native Americans, and sought to get the colonial (and, later, state) government to recognize his claims. This was common among Virginia's leading citizens, such as [[George Washington]]. Henry foresaw the potential of the [[Ohio Valley]] and was involved in schemes to found settlements. Income from land deals in 1771 enabled him to buy [[Scotchtown (plantation)|Scotchtown]], a large plantation in Hanover County, which he purchased from John Payne, the father of [[Dolley Madison]]\u2014she lived there for a brief time as a child. Scotchtown, with 16 rooms, was one of the largest mansions in Virginia.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nOwning estates such as Henry's meant owning slaves; Henry was a slaveholder from the time of his marriage at the age of 18.{{sfn|Kidd|p=15}} Despite this, Henry believed that slavery was wrong, and hoped for its abolition, but had no plan for doing so, nor for the multiracial society that would result, for he did not believe schemes to settle freed slaves in Africa were realistic, \"to re-export them is now impracticable, and sorry I am for it.\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=100\u2013102}} He wrote in 1773, \"I am the master of slaves of my own purchase. I am drawn along by the general inconvenience of living here without them. I will not, I cannot justify it.\"{{sfn|Kukla|p=124}} But the number of slaves he owned increased over time, and as a result of his second marriage in 1777, so that at his death in 1799, he owned 67 slaves.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=15\u201316}} Henry and others sought to end their importation to Virginia, and succeeded in 1778. They assumed that in so doing, they were fighting slavery, but in the generation after independence, slave births greatly exceeded deaths, and Virginia became a source of slaves sold south in the [[coastwise slave trade]].{{sfn|Kukla|p=125}}\n\n===Renewed involvement and First Continental Congress (1773\u20131775)===\nIn 1773, Henry came into conflict with the royal governor, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]]. The governor, appointed in 1771, had sent British soldiers to [[Pittsylvania County, Virginia|Pittsylvania County]] to aid in apprehending a gang of counterfeiters. Once captured, they were immediately taken to Williamsburg for trial before the General Court, ignoring precedent that judicial proceedings should begin in the county where the offense took place, or where the suspect was captured. This was a sensitive matter especially because of the recent [[Gaspee affair|''Gaspee'' affair]] in Rhode Island, in which the British sought to capture and transport overseas for trial those who had burned a British ship. The Burgesses wanted to rebuke Dunmore for his actions, and Henry was part of a committee of eight members, that drafted a resolution thanking the governor for the capture of the gang, but affirming that using the \"usual mode\" of criminal procedure protected both the guilty and the innocent.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=152\u2013155}} They also penned a plan, adopted by the Burgesses, for [[Committees of correspondence|a committee of correspondence]] to communicate with leaders in other colonies, to inform and coordinate with each other. The members included Henry.{{sfn|Mayer|p=175}}\n\nAlthough Henry had by this time come to believe that conflict with Great Britain, and independence, was inevitable,{{sfn|Kukla|p=138}} he had no strategy for advancing this. The Burgesses were sitting when in 1774, word came that Parliament had voted to [[Boston Port Act|close the port of Boston]] in retaliation for the [[Boston Tea Party]], and several burgesses, including Henry, convened at the [[Raleigh Tavern]] to formulate a response. According to [[George Mason]], a former burgess from [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], who joined the committee in the work, Henry took the lead. Mason and Henry would form a close political relationship that would last until Mason's death in 1792. The resolution that Henry's committee produced set June 1, 1774, the date upon which the Port of Boston was to be closed, as a day of fasting and prayer. It passed the Burgesses, but Dunmore dissolved the body. Undeterred, the former legislators met at the Raleigh Tavern, and reconstituted themselves as [[First Virginia Convention|a convention]], to meet again in August, after there was time for county meetings to show local sentiment. They also called for a boycott of tea and other products.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=139\u2013141}}\n\nThe five [[Virginia Conventions]] (1774\u20131776) would guide the [[Colony of Virginia|Old Dominion]] to independence as royal authority came to an end. Their work was advanced by many resolutions of county meetings, denying the authority of Parliament over the colonies, and calling for a boycott of imports.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=141\u2013143}} The first convention met in Williamsburg in the chamber of the Burgesses beginning on August 1; Dunmore was absent from the capital [[Lord Dunmore's War|fighting the Native Americans]] and could not interfere. Divided between those who wanted separation from Britain and those who still hoped for some accommodation, it met for a week; one major decision was the election of delegates to [[First Continental Congress|a Continental Congress]] in Philadelphia. Henry was chosen as one of seven delegates, tying for second place with Washington, burgess for Fairfax County, both receiving three votes less than Randolph.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=198\u2013204}}\n\n[[File:Washington Pendleton Henry cropped.jpg|thumb|left|19th century engraving of Washington (center), Henry (right) and Pendleton riding to Philadelphia for the [[First Continental Congress]]]]\nAs Washington's estate, [[Mount Vernon]], lay on the way from Scotchtown to Philadelphia, he invited Henry to stop there and to ride to Philadelphia with him, and Henry did, also accompanied by Pendleton, another Virginia delegate to the Congress and a political rival of Henry's.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=205\u2013206}} Delegates and prominent Philadelphians took an intense interest in the Virginians, who had taken the lead in resistance to Britain, but whom few in the other colonies had met. This was Henry's first stay in the North, excepting a brief business trip to New York in 1770{{sfn|Kukla|p=145}} but he found that his actions were well known.<ref name = \"a\" /> The sessions began on September 5, 1774, at [[Carpenter's Hall]].{{sfn|Mayer|p=209}} [[Silas Deane]] of Connecticut described Henry as \"the compleatest speaker I ever heard&nbsp;... but in a Letter I can give You no Idea of the Music of his Voice, or the highwrought, yet Natural elegance of his Stile, or Manner\".{{sfn|Kukla|p=146}}{{sfn|Mayer|p=212}} The secretary of the Congress, [[Charles Thomson]], wrote that when Henry rose, he had expected little from a man dressed as plainly as a rural minister. \"But as he proceeded, [he] evinced such [an] unusual force of argument, and such novel and impassioned eloquence as soon electrified the whole house. Then the excited inquiry passed from man to man&nbsp;... 'Who is it? Who is it?' The answer from the few who knew him was, it is ''Patrick Henry''.\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nHenry was involved in the first dispute within the Congress, on whether each colony should have an equal vote, taking the position that there should be proportionate representation, with the larger colonies to have a greater voice. He argued that colonial borders must be swept away in the need for Americans to unify and create a government to fill the void left with the end of British authority, \"Fleets and armies and the present state of things shew that Government is dissolved. Where are your landmarks? your boundaries of colonies? The distinctions between Virginians, Pennsylvanians, New Yorkers, and New Englanders are no more. I am not a Virginian, but an American.\"{{sfn|Mayer|pp=212\u2013213}} Henry lost the argument, and his theatrics made Congress's leaders afraid he would be unpredictable if placed on the lead committee, that charged with composing a statement regarding colonial rights. Instead, he was put on the next most important committee, one inquiring into commercial regulation. In the end, though, neither committee produced much of importance.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=214\u2013217}} Henry believed the purpose of the Congress should be to mobilize public opinion towards war. In this, he found common cause with [[John Adams]] and [[Samuel Adams]] of Massachusetts, but not all were of that opinion.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=218\u2013219}} According to Tate, Henry \"turned out not to be an especially influential member of the body\".<ref name = \"a\" /> The Congress decided on a petition to the King; Henry prepared two drafts but neither proved satisfactory. When Congress on October 26 approved a draft prepared by [[John Dickinson]] of Pennsylvania, who had consulted with Henry and also Richard Henry Lee, Henry had already departed for home, and Lee signed on his behalf. The petition was rejected in London.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nAfter the birth of their sixth child in 1771, Patrick's wife [[Sarah Shelton Henry]] began to exhibit symptoms of mental illness, and one reason for the move from Louisa County to Scotchtown was so they could be near family members. Henry's biographer, [[Jon Kukla]] believed her to be the victim of [[postpartum psychosis]], for which there was then no treatment. At times, she was restrained in a form of [[straitjacket]]. Although Virginia had opened the first public mental facility in North America in 1773, Henry decided that she was better off at Scotchtown, and prepared a large apartment for her there. She died in 1775, after which Henry avoided all objects that reminded him of her, and sold Scotchtown in 1777.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=158\u2013160}}\n\n===\"Liberty or Death\" (1775)===\n{{further| Give me liberty, or give me death!}}\n[[File:Patrick Henry speaking before the Virginia Assembly.tiff|thumb|right|[[Currier & Ives]] depiction of Henry giving his famous speech]]\n{{listen\n| filename = Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death - read by Bob Gonzalez for LibriVox's Short Nonfiction Collection Vol. 026 (2012).ogg\n| title = <center>\"Give Me Liberty or Give Me Death\"<br><small>Read by Bob Gonzalez for LibriVox</small></center>\n| description = <center>Audio 00:08:51 ([https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Give_me_liberty_or_give_me_death full text])</center>\n| pos = right\n| type = speech\n| image = [[File:His Master's Voice (small).png|70px]]\n}}\nHanover County elected Henry as a delegate to the [[Second Virginia Convention]], which convened at [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Richmond, Virginia)|St. John's Episcopal Church]] in the town of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] on March 20, 1775.

This document contained complaints about British actions, but admitted the King could veto colonial legislation, and it urged reconciliation. Henry offered amendments to raise a militia independent of royal authority in terms that recognized that conflict with Britain was inevitable, sparking the opposition of moderates. He defended his amendments, concluding with the statement he is well known for:\n\n{{quote|If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.

Henry's speech carried the day, and the convention adopted his amendments.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=170\u2013172}} Still, they passed only narrowly, as many delegates were uncertain where the resistance urged by Henry and other radicals would lead, and few counties formed independent militia companies at the urging of the convention.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe text of Henry's speech first appeared in print in Wirt's 1817 biography, published 18 years after Patrick Henry's death.{{sfn|Raphael|p=147}} Wirt corresponded with men who had heard the speech and others who were acquainted with people who were there at the time. All agreed that the speech had produced a profound effect, but it seems that only one person attempted to render an actual text. Judge [[St. George Tucker]], who had been present for the speech, gave Wirt his recollections and Wirt wrote back stating that \"I have taken almost entirely Mr. Henry's speech in the Convention of '75 from you, as well as your description of its effect on your verbatim.\" The original letter with Tucker's remembrances has been lost.{{sfn|Raphael|p=148}}\n\nFor 160 years Wirt's account was taken at face value.

The gunpowder belonged to the government, to be issued in case of need, such as a slave uprising. Dunmore's actions outraged many Virginians. Henry had departed for Philadelphia, having been elected a delegate to the [[Second Continental Congress]], but a messenger caught up with him before he left Hanover County, and he returned to take command of the local militia. Seeking the restoration of the powder, or that the colonists be compensated for it, on May 2, Henry led his troops towards Williamsburg with, as Dunmore wrote, \"all the Appearances of actual War\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=173\u2013180}} By this time, word of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]] had arrived, and many Virginians believed that war with Britain had begun. With his troops reinforced by eager volunteers from nearby counties,{{sfn|McDonnell|p=64}} Henry likely had force enough to take Williamsburg and deal Dunmore a humiliating defeat, but increasingly prominent messengers urging caution slowed his advance, and in [[New Kent County, Virginia|New Kent County]], still some {{convert|16|mile}} from Williamsburg, three of Henry's fellow delegates to Congress helped persuade him to leave off his march. As Henry insisted the colonists be compensated, a member of the Governor's Council agreed to pay the value of the powder by [[bill of exchange]].{{sfn|Kukla|pp=180\u2013182}}\n\nAlthough Dunmore issued a proclamation against \"a certain ''Patrick Henry'', of the County of ''Hanover'', and a Number of his deluded Followers\", 15 county committees quickly approved Henry's action, and when he finally departed for Philadelphia, he was escorted to the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] by militia who lined the shore, cheering, as his ferry pulled away.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=183\u2013185}} Not all approved; Henry's march appalled some moderates, who feared he might provoke a conflict in which Virginia stood alone against Britain's might. They also saw him as a threat to the sanctity of property, for anyone's might be taken by Henry and his troops. As popular support for independence grew, opponents either joined in the movement, or decided it was wiser to remain silent.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=66\u201370}}\n\nHenry belatedly arrived at the Congress on May 18, 1775.{{sfn|Kukla|p=187}} Jefferson later stated that Henry played only a supporting role, and though there is not a complete record, the fact that he was not written of as having an impact appears to confirm that. The Congress appointed Washington as head of American forces, an appointment that Henry supported.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=106\u2013107}} At the end of the session, in August, Henry left Philadelphia for Virginia and would never again hold office outside its borders.<ref name = \"a\" />\n\nWhile Henry was returning, the [[Third Virginia Convention]] in August commissioned him as colonel of the [[1st Virginia Regiment]], and he took up the appointment later that month. Although Henry had little military experience, this was not considered a major drawback at the time, and he was held to have distinguished himself in the march on Williamsburg. General Washington, though, felt that the convention had \"made a Capital mistake when they took Henry out of the Senate to place him in the Field\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=189\u2013190}} In September, Virginia's [[Committees of safety (American Revolution)|Committee of Safety]] placed Henry in charge of all Virginia's forces.{{sfn|Kidd|p=109}} Despite the high title, Henry was placed under tight civilian control, and to an extent the willingness of moderates to go along with the appointment reflected a view that in that position, the volatile Henry would be contained.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=100\u2013102}}\n\nHenry moved to organize his regiment, and had no difficulty recruiting men.<ref name = \"a\" /> As commander, he organized [[Virginia State Navy#American Revolutionary War|a navy]].{{sfn|Kukla|pp=201\u2013202}} In November 1775, Dunmore, who though he had abandoned Williamsburg still held Norfolk, issued a proclamation offering freedom to any black slave or [[indentured servant]] willing and able to serve in his forces, which already included several hundred former slaves. Henry wrote to all [[Virginia militia#17th century|county lieutenants]], stating that the proclamation \"is fatal to the publick Safety\" and urging an \"unremitting Attention to the Government of the SLAVES may, I hope, counteract this dangerous Attempt. Constant, and well directed Patrols, seem indispensably necessary.\"{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=140, 148\u2013149}}<!-- quote on p. 149 -->\n\nHenry saw no action himself, and there were murmurs in the convention against his command; some feared he was too radical to be an effective military leader. In February 1776, Virginia's forces were reorganized as they were placed under Continental command. Henry was to retain his rank of colonel, but was placed under a former subordinate. Henry refused, and left the army; his troops were outraged by the slight to him, and considered leaving service, but he calmed the situation.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=201\u2013204}}\n\n== Independence and first time as governor ==\nHenry did not sit in the [[Fourth Virginia Convention]] which met in December 1775,{{sfn|Campbell|pp=172\u2013173}} as he was ineligible because of his military commission.{{sfn|Kukla|p=201}} Once he was again a civilian, the freeholders of Hanover County in April 1776 elected him to the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|fifth convention]], to meet the following month.{{sfn|Campbell|p=196}} Most delegates were for independence, but were divided on how to declare it, and over timing. Henry introduced a resolution declaring Virginia independent and urging the Congress to declare all the colonies free. When he at last spoke, according to clergyman [[Edmund Randolph]], Henry \"appeared in an element for which he was born. To cut the knot, which calm prudence was puzzled to untie, was worthy of the magnificence of his genius. He entered into no subtlety of reasoning but was roused by the now apparent spirit of the people as a pillar of fire, which notwithstanding the darkness of the prospect would conduct to the promised land.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=121\u2013122}} The eventual resolution was based in large part on Henry's, and passed unanimously on May 15, 1776. As well as declaring Virginia independent, the resolution instructed the state's delegates in Congress to press for American independence, which they would, with Lee introducing the motion, and Jefferson penning [[United States Declaration of Independence|the Declaration]].{{sfn|Kidd|p=122}}\n\nThe convention then proceeded to consider a constitution for Virginia's government. Henry was appointed to a committee under the leadership of [[Archibald Cary]].{{sfn|Campbell|pp=223\u2013224}} Much of the work fell to the final appointee to the committee, George Mason of Fairfax County, who did not arrive in Williamsburg until May 18, delayed by illness. Mason first drafted a [[Virginia Declaration of Rights|Declaration of Rights]]; it was discussed in the Cary Committee on May 25. Mason's draft, more than the final declaration, would be highly influential, used by Jefferson in writing the Declaration of Independence, and by writers of many 18th and 19th century state constitutions. When the draft was debated, Henry, at the request of a young delegate from [[Orange County, Virginia|Orange County]], [[James Madison]], produced an amendment changing Mason's call for religious tolerance to one requiring full [[freedom of worship]]. This was seen as a threat to Virginia's established religion, Anglicanism, and did not pass. Madison reworked it and had another delegate introduce it, likely Edmund Randolph, and it passed. Mason's draft called for a ban on [[bills of attainder]]. Henry got it removed by telling the delegates that some high offender might be reached by no other means.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=210\u2013213}} The convention approved the Declaration of Rights on June 12.{{sfn|Kidd|p=126}}\n\nVirginia's form of government, to be placed in its constitution, was a concern not only within its borders; Jefferson, in Philadelphia though he would have preferred to be in Williamsburg, sent a plan, and John Adams sent Henry a pamphlet containing his own views, to which Henry replied, \"your sentiments are precisely the same I have long since taken up, and they come recommended by you\".{{sfn|Campbell|pp=225\u2013226}} But it was Mason's plan for the government of Virginia which dominated, with much power given to the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], the lower house of the legislature. The House of Delegates and the [[Senate of Virginia]] together formed the General Assembly, as the Virginia legislature is known. Under the 1776 constitution, the governor, elected by the two houses of the legislature, was not even given the power to veto legislation, and was required to act with the approval of the [[Governor's Council]] on important matters. Henry opposed the weakness of the governor, feeling it was risky at a time of war to have the executive so weak, but his views did not prevail. He had reason to rue the office's lack of power, as on June 29, 1776, the convention elected him as Virginia's first post-independence governor, by 60 votes to 45 for [[Thomas Nelson Jr.]]<ref name = \"a\" />{{sfn|Kukla|pp=214\u2013217}} The election of Henry, at that time Virginia's most popular politician, helped assure acceptance of the new authorities,{{sfn|Kidd|pp=129\u2013135}} but also placed him in a figurehead position, removed from the true power in the new government, the House of Delegates.{{sfn|McDonnell|p=244}}\n\nHenry was taken ill almost immediately upon being sworn in as governor on July 5, and recuperated at Scotchtown. He returned to Williamsburg in September, and corresponded with General Washington about the military situation. Washington, who was less effective because of the inadequacies of his troops, complained about the state militias, feeling a [[Continental Army]] committed for the duration of the war was needed. Henry helped recruit new troops for Washington, but his efforts were hampered by several issues, including the weakness of Henry's office. In December 1776, with the General Assembly alarmed at reports Washington's army was in retreat as the British occupied Philadelphia, legislators granted Henry temporary expanded powers, something that Jefferson was still unhappy about years later, feeling that Henry was trying to set himself up as dictator. In March 1777, Henry wrote to Washington seeking permission to recruit soldiers for terms of up to eight months. Washington's anger in his response that such troops were not useful caused Henry to drop the matter, stating that he deferred to Washington's experience in military matters. Recruiting remained a problem; many Virginians were willing to be members of the county militia, but did not want to join the Continental Army lest they be sent out of state or exposed to disease.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=129\u2013135}}{{sfn|McDonnell|p=258}} Desertion was also a problem Henry labored to solve with limited success; many Virginians had been induced to enlist with promises they would not be sent outside the state or local area, and left when orders came to march.{{sfn|McDonnell|p=266}}\n\nHenry was elected to a second one-year term without opposition, and took the oath on July 2, 1777. On October&nbsp;9 at Scotchtown, he married Dorothea Dandridge, daughter of his old client, Nathaniel West Dandridge of Hanover County. This made him closer kin to Washington, as Nathaniel Dandridge was [[Martha Washington]]'s uncle.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=247\u2013248}} To add to the six children he had by Sarah Henry, he would have eleven more by Dorothea, though two by the second marriage died very young. She brought 12 slaves with her, adding to the 30 Patrick Henry already had. He sold Scotchtown in 1777, and moved to [[Leatherwood Plantation]] in [[Henry County, Virginia|Henry County]], which the General Assembly had just created and named for him.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=138\u2013139}}\n\nWhen Washington and his troops encamped [[Valley Forge National Historical Park|at Valley Forge]] in the winter of 1777\u20131778, Henry arranged for livestock and other food to be sent to their relief. There was discontent against Washington, who was not seen by some as a successful general, and this resulted in the so-called [[Conway Cabal]]. Henry supported Washington when Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]] of Philadelphia, one of those unenthusiastic about Washington, sent the governor an unsigned letter, discussing machinations against the general. Henry immediately sent Washington the letter, and though it is uncertain if Henry recognized Rush's handwriting, Washington did, tipping him off to the conspiracy. President Washington wrote of Henry in 1794, \"I have always respected and esteemed him; nay more, I have conceived myself under obligation to him for the friendly manner in which he transmitted to me some insidious anonymous writings in the close of the year 1777 with a view to embark him in the opposition that was forming against me at that time\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=233\u2013238}}\n\nIn an effort to secure Virginia's vast claims in the West (to the Mississippi River, and north to present-day Minnesota) against British and Native American forces, Henry in December 1777 sent [[George Rogers Clark]] on an expedition against [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], site of a British and French settlement. This part of Clark's mission was secret; his public orders merely stated he was to raise a militia and go to Kentucky (then part of Virginia). Clark captured Kaskaskia in July 1778, and remained north of the Ohio River for the remainder of Henry's governorship. Although the expedition did not turn out as well as hoped, Henry trumpeted its successes, but after he left the governorship in 1779 and was elected to the House of Delegates, he became a foe of Clark.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=139\u2013141}}\n\n[[File:Patrick Henry estate marker Henry County Virginia 1922.JPG|thumb|Boulder and plaque marking former location of Leatherwood Plantation in [[Henry County, Virginia]]]]\nHenry was elected to a third term on May 29, 1778, again without opposition. Thomas Jefferson led the committee of notables sent to inform him of his election. In December 1778, Henry sent an urgent appeal to Congress for naval aid in protecting [[Chesapeake Bay]]. None was forthcoming,{{sfn|Campbell|pp=278\u2013281}} and on May 8, 1779, in the final days of Henry's governorship, British ships under Sir [[George Collier]] entered the bay, landed troops, and took [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] and [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], destroying valuable supplies. The British departed on May 24, and Henry, limited to three consecutive terms in office by the 1776 constitution, left office soon after, succeeded by Jefferson, and with his family returned to Leatherwood.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\n== Leatherwood and the House of Delegates (1779\u20131784)==\nAt Leatherwood, Henry devoted himself to local affairs in the thinly-populated county, and was given seats on the county court (the local governing body), as prominent landowners were, and on the parish vestry. He refused to be elected a delegate to Congress, stating that his personal business and past illness made that impossible. When Governor Jefferson sent a note to him in early 1780, Henry replied with gratitude, complaining of his isolation, and wrote of his many concerns about the state of affairs, as the war continued. The freeholders of Henry County soon thereafter sent its [[eponym]] to the House of Delegates. But within weeks, health problems recurred, causing his return to Leatherwood.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=341\u2013342}} While in Richmond (where the capital had been moved) Henry opposed a congressional plan to revalue [[Continental currency]] and impose certain taxes, feeling it would mostly benefit the North. He was successful in defeating it, but after he left Richmond, supporters got the legislature to pass it.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=153\u2013155}} Once he returned home, he was heavily involved in efforts to recruit local volunteers to suppress bands of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who were conducting raids in the frontier area. Henry rode with the troops, though he did not lead them, and they were generally successful in suppressing the resistance. The volunteers were disbanded in September 1780.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=245\u2013247}}\n\nRichmond had been made the capital since it was believed to be less exposed to attack than Williamsburg, but in January 1781, British forces under the renegade former American general, [[Benedict Arnold]], sailed up the [[James River]] and captured Richmond with little opposition as Henry joined the other legislators and Governor Jefferson in fleeing to [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. Although Arnold soon withdrew to Portsmouth, in February, troops under [[Lord Cornwallis]] entered the state from North Carolina; the war, which had for the most part been fought out of state, would have many of its final moves played in Virginia. With Washington's army near New York, Henry sought to recruit soldiers to defend the state, and in March helped draft an angry remonstrance from the House of Delegates to Congress, demanding help. Nevertheless, in May, British forces under Colonel [[Banastre Tarleton]] raided Charlottesville, nearly capturing the Virginia government, which fled to [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]].{{sfn|Kidd|pp=155\u2013158}} There is a story that Henry fled with other prominent leaders, and sought refuge at the home of a woman who initially spurned them as cowards for fleeing Charlottesville. But on learning Henry was with the group, she decided it must be all right, and offered them the best she had.{{sfn|Campbell|p=288}}\n\nJefferson did not go to Staunton: his term as governor had just expired, but the legislature had not met to hold an election. After the raid, he took refuge at his farm in [[Bedford County, Virginia|Bedford County]], and Virginia had no governor for ten days. Several legislators complained of Jefferson's actions and called for an inquiry into the conduct of the executive (Jefferson and his council), and Henry was among those who took the lead. The resolution passed, but the inquiry was set for the next session, and the legislature thought better of it.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=289\u2013291}} Jefferson was angered at Henry's actions, and held a grudge that did not abate until well after Henry's death in 1799.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=159\u2013160}}\n\nWith the war effectively ended by the American victory at the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Henry served as delegate from his county through 1784, when he was elected again as governor. Peace brought many adjustments, and Henry sponsored legislation to reform Virginia's currency and to adjust payments from contracts still outstanding from before periods of high inflation. Jefferson and others wanted to reopen contracts that had been already settled, but in depreciated currency; Henry thought that unjust, and because of his influence in the General Assembly, his version prevailed.<ref name = \"a\" />{{sfn|Campbell|pp=298\u2013299}} This had international implications, as some of the creditors were British, who sought payment in hard money rather than the depreciated currency that had been paid into escrow.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=355\u2013356}} At the May 1783 House of Delegates session, Henry successfully sponsored a resolution to repeal the trade embargo against Britain. That passed despite opposition from John Tyler Sr., the Speaker. Henry also introduced legislation to permit Loyalists to return to Virginia. There was considerable opposition to that, and the measure was held over until later in the year, by which time public sentiment had been gauged through meetings in each county. Henry spoke in the debate, asking \"shall we, who have laid the proud British lion at our feet, be frightened of its whelps?\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=265\u2013268}} Once it was amended (though in what way is not clear), the bill passed in November 1783.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=265\u2013268}}\n\nHenry worked together with James Madison, a delegate after three years in Congress, on a number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia's Protestant churches.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=356\u2013359}} Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation between church and state that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that taxpayers who were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was not alone in this belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, \"the general assessment plan is one of the main reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=167\u2013168}} The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons\u2014his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County\u2014but the cost was Henry's bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson's [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Statute for Religious Freedom]] through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=168\u2013171}}\n\n== Second period as governor (1784\u20131786) ==\nHenry's second time as governor was for two years, as the legislature re-elected him in 1785.{{sfn|Campbell|p=320}} It was, generally, more placid than his first. During this time, Henry and his family lived at \"[[Salisbury (Chesterfield County, Virginia)|Salisbury]]\", in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield County]], about {{convert|13|mi}} from Richmond{{sfn|Campbell|pp=320\u2013321}} in open country that he rented, though he had an official residence close to the [[Virginia Capitol]], which was then under construction. The General Assembly had passed legislation for new arms for the militia, and Henry worked with [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] to have them sent from France.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nEach county's militia was under firm local control, a state of affairs that had resulted in problems during the war as local militia refused orders from Henry and other governors when asked to serve out of state or conscript recruits into the Continental Army. In 1784, seeking to bring the militias under central control, the General Assembly passed an act terminating all militia officer commissions, and allowing Henry, with the consent of the Governor's Council, to appoint replacements. The Virginia Constitution required that there be a recommendation from the county court. Instead of asking the county court, Henry solicited recommendations from prominent citizens in each county whom he or his council members knew. The result was near-revolt in the counties, as citizens protested the act as unconstitutional, and counties refused to obey. The law went widely unenforced, and in October 1785, Henry requested the legislators to repeal it; they complied the following year.{{sfn|McDonnell|pp=506\u2013513}}\n\nResidents of western North Carolina, what is today the state of Tennessee, sought to separate and become the [[State of Franklin]]. A former delegate, [[Arthur Campbell (Virginia)|Arthur Campbell]], wanted to join Virginia's adjacent [[Washington County, Virginia|Washington County]] as part of the scheme in 1785. Henry had Campbell removed as a militia officer and from his other county offices, as well as ousting Campbell's supporters, replacing them with residents of known loyalty.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=286\u2013287}} Although Henry urged leniency in his report to the General Assembly that October, stating that the Washington County separatists had been led astray by anxiety because of the poor economy,{{sfn|Mayer|p=366}} he had the legislature pass a Treason Act forbidding the setting-up of a rival government within Virginia territory.{{sfn|Kukla|p=287}}\n\nHenry also sought to advance Virginia's development, both as governor and through his personal investments. He backed schemes to open navigation on the upper Potomac and James rivers, envisioning canals to connect them to the [[Ohio River Valley]]. He also supported a scheme to have a canal across the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], believing that with it, the trade of Eastern North Carolina would flow through [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. He owned land along the proposed route, and sought to interest General Washington in the scheme, but was not successful. Despite Henry's support for internal improvements, he failed to notify Virgnia's representatives of their appointment to meet with Maryland over navigation on the Potomac, and only two, including George Mason, attended what became known as the [[Mount Vernon Conference]] (1785). Edmund Randolph, unable to attend because of lack of timely notification, hinted that the reason for Henry's neglect was not forgetfulness, but a growing hostility towards things federal. In 1786, Henry was more assiduous in notifying delegates to the [[Annapolis Conference]] called with the support of Madison, who was appointed a delegate.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=366\u2013367}} Henry stepped down at the end of his fifth term, stating he needed to devote time to his family and earn money to support it.{{sfn|Kidd|p=181}}\n\n== Opponent of the Constitution (1787\u20131790) ==\nDisinclined to return to distant Leatherwood after his time as governor ended in November 1786, Henry hoped to purchase land in Hanover County but bought property in [[Prince Edward County, Virginia|Prince Edward County]] instead.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=370\u2013371}} [[Hampden-Sydney College]], which he had helped found in 1775, is located in that county, and Henry enrolled his sons there. The local freeholders elected Henry to the House of Delegates in early 1787, and he would serve there until the end of 1790. The new governor, Randolph, offered to make Henry a delegate to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], scheduled to meet in Philadelphia later that year to consider changes to the [[Articles of Confederation]], the document that had governed the loose union among the states since 1777.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=319\u2013320}} Henry refused the appointment, alleging it would be difficult financially.<ref name = \"a\" /> One legend is that when Henry was asked why he had not gone, he replied, \"I smelt a rat.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\nHenry's record of urging unity made him a potential supporter of a closer bond between the states, and as late as the end of 1786, Madison hoped for Henry as an ally in the fight. Several factors had eroded Henry's trust in the Northern states, including what he deemed Congress's failure to send adequate troops to protect Virginia settlers in the Ohio River Valley. Henry was outraged by the [[Jay\u2013Gardoqui Treaty]], which would have ceded exclusive navigation on the Mississippi River to Spain for 25 years.{{sfn|Kidd|p=177}} This was in exchange for commercial concessions that would benefit New England, where there was a growing separatist movement. Northern votes were sufficient to relax [[John Jay]]'s negotiating instructions, which had originally forbidden restricting American navigation on the Mississippi, to allow him to reach a deal; Southern votes were sufficient to block the treaty's ratification. These events caused Henry and some other Virginia leaders to feel betrayed, and to have little trust in the good faith of the North.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=300\u2013305}}\n\nWhen the Philadelphia convention adjourned in September 1787, its president, Washington, returned home and immediately sent a copy of the new [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]] to Henry, recommending he support it. Henry was in Richmond for the autumn legislative session as delegate for Prince Edward County. While thanking Washington for presiding in Philadelphia and for sending the document, he said of it, \"I have to lament that I cannot bring my Mind to accord with the proposed Constitution. The Concern I feel on this account is really greater than I am able to express.\"{{sfn|Kukla|p=307}} He hinted, though, that he was still open to changing his mind. This allowed Henry to remain noncommittal as opponents of the Constitution, such as Mason and Edmund Randolph (both delegates at Philadelphia) published their opinions, and to refine his views.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=307\u2013310}} In the initial Virginia battle over the Constitution, the call for a convention to decide whether the state should ratify it, Henry and Mason were among those who supported allowing the convention to ratify it conditional on amendments being made. The matter was compromised with language allowing the convention's members full rein in deciding what to do, and it was set for June 1788, with elections in March; both those who supported it and those who did not felt time would be to their advantage.{{sfn|Mayer|pp=381\u2013382}}\n\nHenry was elected to the convention from Prince Edward County without difficulty, though [[John Blair Smith]], president of Hampden-Sydney, caused him some annoyance by having students read at an assembly, in Henry's presence, a speech by Henry and Smith's own rebuttal.{{sfn|Mayer|p=391}} Henry opposed the Constitution because of its grant of a strong executive, the president; he had not fought to free Virginia from King George to surrender such powers to what might prove a despot. Henry accordingly deemed the Constitution a backwards step, and a betrayal of those who had died in the Revolutionary cause.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=191\u2013192}} At the [[Virginia Ratifying Convention]], which began on June 2, 1788,{{sfn|Kukla|p=321}} according to Kidd, Henry's \"personality blazed in all its power and glory.\"{{sfn|Kidd|p=194}} Henry suggested that the framers of the Constituition had no right to begin it \"We the People\" and ignore the powers of the states. He suggested that the document put too much power in the hands of too few.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=194\u2013195}} He noted that the Constitution, proposed without a [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], did not protect individual rights, \n{{quote|Will the abandonment of your most sacred rights tend the security of your liberty? Liberty, the greatest of all earthly blessings\u2014give us that precious jewel and you may take everything else. But I fear I have lived long enough to become an old-fashioned fellow. Perhaps an invincible attachment to the dearest rights of man may, in these refined, enlightened days, be deemed old-fashioned: if so, I am contented to be so.{{sfn|Campbell|p=340}}}}\n\nMadison, the lead supporter of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill through most of the convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting a losing battle as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length{{sfn|Kidd|pp=200\u2013201}} and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates.{{sfn|Campbell|p=335}} Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks.{{sfn|Kidd|p=201}} Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 25<ref>https://www.thoughtco.com/ratification-order-of-constitution-105416</ref>\u00b0 to ratify the Constitution, by the fact that the convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. (It is ironic that Virginia, a substantial leader in creating the 1787 Constitution was not among the 9 states required for ratification, lagging New Hampshire by 4 days.) George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratification, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=207\u2013208}}\n\nHenry returned to the House of Delegates, where he successfully defeated Madison's effort to become federal senator from Virginia, for under the original Constitution, senators were elected by legislators, not the people. Although Henry made it clear he would not serve in office outside Virginia, he received a number of votes in the election. Madison gained election to the House of Representatives in a district where he was opposed by [[James Monroe]], though Madison's supporters complained that Henry's supporters in the legislature had unfairly placed Madison's county, Orange, in a district leaning anti-Federalist. Henry also saw to it that the requested amendments were incorporated in petitions from the legislature to the federal Congress. Despite his qualms, Henry served as one of Virginia's presidential electors, voting for Washington (elected President) and John Adams (elected Vice President).{{sfn|Campbell|pp=375\u2013377}} Henry was disappointed when the [[1st United States Congress|First Congress]] passed only amendments dealing with personal liberties, not those designed to weaken the government.{{sfn|Campbell|pp=378\u2013379}}\n\nA final cause Henry engaged in before leaving the House of Delegates at the end of 1790<ref name = \"a\" /> was over the [[Funding Act of 1790]], by which the federal government took over the debts of the states, much of which dated from the Revolutionary War. On November&nbsp;3 of that year, Henry introduced a resolution, which would be passed by the House of Delegates and by the [[Senate of Virginia|state Senate]], declaring the act \"repugnant to the constitution of the United States, as it goes to the exercise of a power not granted to the general [federal] government\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=385\u2013366}} This would prove the first of many resolutions passed by Southern state legislatures in the decades to come, defending [[states' rights]] and strict interpretation of the Constitution.{{sfn|Kukla|p=368}}\n\n== Later years ==\nLeaving the House of Delegates after 1790, Henry found himself in debt, owing in part to expenses while governor, and sought to secure his family's fortune through land speculation and a return to the practice of law. Not fully reconciled to the federal government, Henry contemplated a new republic in the thinly-settled frontier lands, but his plans came to nothing.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=218\u2013221}} He did not travel as widely for cases as he had in the 1760s, confining his practice mostly to Prince Edward and Bedford counties, though in a compelling case, or for a large enough fee, he would travel to Richmond or over the mountains to [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]] (today in West Virginia).{{sfn|Mayer|p=463}}\n\nWhen the [[List of former United States district courts#Virginia|new federal court]] opened in Virginia in 1790, British creditors promptly filed over a hundred cases seeking to enforce claims from the Revolutionary War. Henry was part of the defense team in ''Jones v. Walker'' before the federal court in 1791; his co-counsel included [[John Marshall]], who prepared the written pleadings while Henry did much of the courtroom advocacy. Henry argued the case for three days; Marshall, looking back, called him \"a great orator&nbsp;... and much more, a learned lawyer, a most accurate thinker, and a profound reasoner\".{{sfn|Kukla|pp=370\u2013372}} The case ended inconclusively after one of the judges died, but the legal teams reassembled for the case of ''[[Ware v. Hylton]]''. Argued before another three-judge panel that included [[Chief Justice of the United States]] John Jay and Associate Justice [[James Iredell]], Henry's argument provoked Justice Iredell to exclaim, \"Gracious God! He is an orator indeed.\"{{sfn|Kukla|pp=372\u2013373}} Henry and Marshall were initially successful, but the plaintiffs appealed, and after Marshall argued his only case before the Supreme Court, that court in 1796 ruled for the British creditors.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nHenry's friendship with Washington had cooled somewhat amid the ratification debates, but by 1794, both men were looking to reconcile. Henry found himself more aligned with Washington than with Jefferson and Madison, and Washington still considered himself indebted to Henry for notifying him about the Conway Cabal. Washington offered Henry a seat on the Supreme Court in 1794, but he refused, feeling his family needed him. Washington also tried to get Henry to accept positions as Secretary of State and as minister to Spain, and Virginia Governor [[Henry Lee III|\"Light-Horse\" Harry Lee]] wanted to appoint him to the Senate. Henry refused each time. Henry's continuing popularity in Virginia made him an attractive ally, and even Jefferson tried to recruit him, sending word though a mutual friend that he bore no grudge.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=224\u2013229}} After Washington made it clear he would not seek a third term in 1796, Marshall and Harry Lee discussed a possible Henry run for president with him, but Henry was unwilling. The General Assembly elected him as governor again that year, but he declined, citing age and health. Henry's refusal to accept these offices increased his popularity as he was, like Washington, seen as a [[Cincinnatus]], giving up power to return to his farm and his plow.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=234\u2013236}}\n\n[[File:Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial - his fame his best epitaph.jpg|thumb|left|Graves of Patrick Henry and his wife Dorothea in the family burying ground at Red Hill.

In 1794 Henry purchased [[Red Hill Patrick Henry National Memorial|Red Hill]] near [[Brookneal, Virginia]] in [[Charlotte County, Virginia|Charlotte County]], where he and his family lived much of the year, though they moved to Long Island in the \"sickly season\".{{sfn|Campbell|p=388}} Henry was gratified at the election of his old friend John Adams as president in 1796 over his foe Jefferson, but Henry's commitment to the [[Federalist Party]] was tested by the repressive [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] of 1798. He chose to say nothing, but supported the campaign of Marshall, a moderate Federalist, for the House of Representatives; Marshall won narrowly. Henry was under considerable pressure from Virginia Federalists to return to politics, but it was not until former president Washington urged him to run for the legislature in early 1799 that Henry gave in.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=239\u2013239}} Turning down an offer from President Adams to make him an envoy to France, Henry was elected as delegate from Charlotte County on March 4, 1799. The legislature had no immediate session scheduled, so he returned to Red Hill, and never left again, dying there of stomach cancer at his home on June 6, 1799.{{sfn|Kukla|pp=392\u2013393}} He was buried at Red Hill.{{sfn|Campbell|p=418}}\n\nIn Henry's will, he left his estates and his 67 slaves to be divided between his wife and his six sons.

'Tis true he could talk\u2014Gods! how he ''could'' talk! but&nbsp;... to make the matter worse, from 1763 to 1789&nbsp;... not one of his speeches lives in print, writing or memory\".{{sfn|Beeman|p=301}} Beeman, for his part, concluded, \"the Revolutionary firebrand, whatever his achievements, possessed a miserable sense of history\".{{sfn|Beeman|p=301}} This was a deficiency not possessed by Jefferson, who not only survived Henry by a quarter century, but who got to fill the vacuum of information about Henry with his own recollections and opinions.{{sfn|Beeman|pp=301\u2013302}} Wirt did not print many of Jefferson's criticisms of Henry, who had irritated Jefferson to such an extent he was still criticizing Henry to guests at [[Monticello]] in 1824.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=246\u2013247}} Jefferson's negative assessments of Henry, whether justified or not, have adversely affected Henry's historical reputation.{{sfn|Beeman|p=302}}\n\nHenry has always been acclaimed by Americans for the brilliance of his political oratory.{{sfn|Kidd|p=247}} Kukla wrote, \"Henry explained the Revolution to ordinary men and women through America in words they understood\u2014and inspired them to fight for liberty.\"{{sfn|Kukla|p=394}} Mayer argued, \"Henry had forged a popular and partisan political style whose democratic implications took another generation to realize fully and accept. His career pointed the transition from the political squirearchy of the eighteenth century to the mass politics of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s day\".{{sfn|Mayer|p=474}} In his study of Henry's oratory, David A. McCants suggested that Henry's position as great American orator of his day was not so much because of his \"heroism and eloquence\" but for adapting the clashing philosophies, religious and political, that met in Henry's Virginia, to create a new style of oratory that appealed to the masses.{{sfn|McCants|pp=3\u20135}} According to Tate, \"by his unmatched oratorical powers, by employing a certain common touch to win the unwavering loyalty of his constituents, and by closely identifying with their interests, he almost certainly contributed to making the Revolution a more widely popular movement than it might otherwise have become\".<ref name= \"a\" /> Kidd argued that the historical focus on the quality of Henry's oratory may result from a discomfort with the content of his speeches, especially his opposition to the Constitution.{{sfn|Kidd|p=247}}\n\nDuring the Civil War era, both sides claimed Henry as a partisan, [[abolitionist]]s citing his writings against slavery, and those sympathetic to the Southern cause pointing to his hostility to the Constitution. That opposition by Henry came to be seen by many writers, even those friendly to Henry, as a blot on an otherwise admirable career.{{sfn|Kidd|pp=247\u2013249}} Beeman, writing in 1986, just before the Constitution's bicentennial, predicted that during that anniversary, \"it will be hard to avoid depicting Henry as one of history's losers, as one too short-sighted to see beyond the bounds of his own native state to glimpse the promise of national greatness embodied in the federal Constitution.\"{{sfn|Beeman|pp=302\u2013303}}\n\nHenry has been cited as a hero to both Left and Right, but has become a particular favorite of the latter. He is especially attractive to Christian conservatives, who cite his deep religious beliefs, as well as his writings and speeches in favor of Christian virtue, and in defense of religious liberty. Because Henry was educated at home, by his father, he has become a symbol of the [[homeschooling]] movement. In 2000, [[Patrick Henry College]] was founded in [[Purcellville, Virginia]], in large part for those who had been homeschooled. Although Henry's most famous declaration has proved as adaptable as ever in the hands of the Right (one sign at a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally in 2010 read \"Give Me Liberty or Give Me Debt\"), according to Kidd, \"few Americans today, Tea Partiers or others, take seriously Henry's fundamental criticisms of the Constitution.\"{{sfn|Kidd|pp=249\u2013250}}\n\nTate wrote of Henry, \"Of the numerous leaders who were active largely at the state level and who generally opposed ratification of the Federal Constitution, Henry was one of the few who came to be ranked among the truly major figures of the American Revolution.\"<ref name = \"a\" /> Kukla concurred, noting that except for two years in the Continental Congress, Henry never held national office, \"and yet he was a founder of the republic\".{{sfn|Kukla|p=393}} Kidd noted the hazy view of Henry that Americans today have:\n\n{{quote|\nHenry's memory has taken on a vague, patriotic cast that fails to capture his fractious yet exemplary life. The \"real\" Henry was branded a traitor and apostate on multiple occasions by his many enemies, including Thomas Jefferson. His vision of the American republic was not a matter of sentiment and grand words and gestures; it was grounded in virtue, religious faith, and responsive local government. Standing against his fellow Founders James Madison and Thomas Jefferson at almost every turn in the 1780s and '90s, and steadfastly opposing the adoption of the Constitution, he was the boldest of patriots.{{sfn|Kidd|p=254}}\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gerrymandering in the United States]]\n*[[History of Virginia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n===Source bibliography===\n*{{cite journal|last=Beeman|first=Richard R.|authorlink=Richard Beeman|title=The Democratic Faith of Patrick Henry|journal=The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography|volume=95|issue=3 |date=July 1987|pages=301\u2013316|issn=0042-6636|ref={{sfnRef|Beeman}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Norine Dickson|title=Patrick Henry: Patriot and Statesman|url=https://archive.org/details/patrickhenrypatr0000camp|url-access=registration|year=1969|location=New York, NY|publisher=The Devin-Adair Company|oclc=694997|ref={{sfnRef|Campbell}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kidd|first=Thomas S.|year=2011|title=Patrick Henry: First Among Patriots|location=New York, NY|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Patrick_Henry.html?id=5MCnzrset38C|isbn=978-0-465-00928-2|ref={{sfnRef|Kidd}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Kukla|first=Jon|title=Patrick Henry: Champion of Liberty|year=2017|location=New York, NY|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9081-4|ref={{sfnRef|Kukla}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Mayer|first=Henry|title=A Son of Thunder: Patrick Henry and the American Republic|location=New York, NY|year=1986|publisher=Grove Press|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Son_of_Thunder.html?id=dPPT0miYV3QC|isbn=978-0-8021-3815-6|ref={{sfnRef|Mayer}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=McCants|first=David A.|title=Patrick Henry, the Orator|year=1990|location=Westport, CT|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-26210-4|ref={{sfnRef|McCants}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=McDonnell|first=Michael A.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|title=The Politics of War: Race, Class and Conflict in Revolutionary Virginia|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4696-0107-6|ref={{sfnRef|McDonnell}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Meade|first=Robert D.|year=1957|title=Patrick Henry: Patriot in the Making|location=Philadelphia, PA|publisher=Lippincott|oclc= 964630|ref={{sfnRef|Meade}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Edmund S.|last2=Morgan|first2=Helen M.|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|title=The Stamp Act Crisis: Prologue to Revolution|year=1995|origyear=1953|isbn=978-0-8078-4513-4|ref={{sfnRef|Morgan and Morgan}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Raphael|first=Ray|year=2004|title=Founding Myths: Stories that Hide Our Patriotic Past|location=New York, NY|publisher=The New Press|isbn=978-1-56584-921-1|ref={{sfnRef|Raphael}}|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781565849211}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beeman, Richard R.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

He used as illustrated \"a synonym of delay\" which yielded only disastrous consequences for the participants. The estate's court case goes on for 12 years, for reasons no one understands, and the entire estate is itself dissipated in the battle. As one writer notes:\n<blockquote>In the Victorian era, the Court of Chancery was a synonym of delay. In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated, that no man alive knows what it means\" (BH1 16). As a consequence of this protraction, many characters involved in Jarndyce and Jarndyce are tortured by being held in painful anxiety\" one goes insand and another's mind is consumed with \u201ccorroding care, suspense, distrust, and doubt\u201d (BH 630).\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dickens.jp/archive/bh/bh-tsutsui.pdf|title=Delay and Suspense in Bleak House |last1=Mizuki |first1=Tsutsui |format=PDF |access-date=April 19, 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the preface to ''Bleak House'', Dickens cites two Chancery cases as especial inspirations, one of which was a \"[[friendly suit]]\":\n\n{{Quote|text=At the present moment (August, 1853) there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun. There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs.}}\n\nBased on an 1853 [[Letters of Charles Dickens|letter of Dickens]],<ref>15 Graham Storey, Kathleen Tillotson and Angus Easson (editors), ''The Letters of Charles Dickens, VII.'' 1993.\npages 128-129.</ref> the first of these cases has been identified<ref name=\"dunstan\">Dunstan, William. \"The Real Jarndyce and Jarndyce.\"\n ''The Dickensian'' 93.441 (Spring 1997): 27.</ref><ref name=\"katz\">Katz, Leslie, ''Bleak House'' in Australian Reasons for Judgment (July 21, 2017).
