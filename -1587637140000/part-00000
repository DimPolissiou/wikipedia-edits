Prabh\u0101kara in his book B\u1e5bhati quotes only [[Bhart\u1e5bhari]] (4-5 CE) and [[Bharavi]] (5-6 CE). Thus his probable time can be assigned to the latter half of the 6th century. \n\nHis views on [[\u015aabara]]\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, a commentary on [[Jaimini]]\u2019s P\u016brvam\u012bm\u0101ms\u0101 S\u016btras led to rise of Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school within M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and further developed as competent philosophical system along with the rival school of [[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]. \n\nThe Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school is alleged to be nastika<ref>[[%C4%80stika and n%C4%81stika]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} (atheistic) or [[Charvaka]]|Lok\u0101yata school. <blockquote>Kum\u0101rila said: For in practice the Mimamsa has been for the most part converted into a Lokayata system; But I have made this effort to bring it into a theistic path.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lok\u0101yata, a study in ancient Indian materialism|last=Debiprasad.|first=Chattopadhyaya|date=1992|publisher=People's|isbn=8170070066|edition= 7th|location=New Delhi|oclc=47093882}}</ref></blockquote>\nHere Kum\u0101rila refers to Bhartriprapancha<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bhartriprapancha</ref>, held by somebody as the forerunner of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara system. It is generally believed that the M\u012bm\u0101msakas and specially the Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas are atheists. But the source books of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School state in unequivocal terms that the inferential existence of God which is propounded by Naiyayikas and the like is denied by the denied by the Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas and that God is not denied: \u201c\u012b\u015bvar\u0113 par\u014dktmanum\u0101na\u1e41 nirastam, n\u0113\u015bvar\u014d nirasta\u1e25\u201d<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.328914/page/n6</ref> \n\n[[\u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha]] wrote \u1e5ajuvimal\u0101pa\u00f1cik\u0101 and D\u012bpa\u015bikh\u0101pa\u00f1cik\u0101 commentaries on Prabh\u0101kara in the 8th century.{{sfn|Paolo Visigalli|2014|p=47}}\n\n==Sentence vs word meaning==\nOne of the views of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas is that words do not directly designate meaning; any meaning that arises is because it is connected with other words (''anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na'', anvita = connected; abhidh\u0101na = denotation). We know or learn the meaning of a word only by considering the sentential context which it appears; we learn such word meanings together with their possible semantic connections with other words. Sentence meanings are grasped directly, from perceptual and contextual cues, skipping the stage of grasping singly the individual word meanings (Matilal 1990:108).\n\nThis is very similar to the modern view of linguistic [[underspecification]], and relates to the [[Semantics#Dynamic turn in semantics|Dynamic Turn in Semantics]], which opposes the purely compositional view of arriving at sentence meaning.\n\nThe Pr\u0101bh\u0101karakas were opposed by the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das, who argued for a [[Principle of compositionality|compositional]] view of semantics (called ''abhihit\u0101nvaya''). In this view, the meaning of a sentence was understood only after understanding first the meanings of individual words. Words were independent, complete objects, a view that is close to the [[Jerry Fodor|Fodorian]] view of language.\n\nOf the two principal schools of the P\u016brvam\u012bm\u0101ms\u0101 the Bhatta school has all along attracted greater attention than the Prabhakara school. The study of the works of the Prabhakara school has been neglected for a long time past. All the knowledge that our old Sanskrit scholars had of the tenets of this school was derived solely from the stray references found in the works of the other systems. At the wake of 20th century, Dr. [[Ganganath Jha]] has written a very learned thesis in which he has presented in a lucid form the main principles of the Prabhakara school as they have been dealt with in the Prakara\u1e47apancika of [[\u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha]].<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.311115/page/n1</ref> He has also given for the first time, much valuable information regarding the B\u1e5bhat\u012b of Prabh\u0101kara which is a commentary on \u015aabara\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya. \n\n==Tradition and research==\nTradition makes Prabh\u0101kara a pupil of Kum\u0101rila who nicknamed him as Guru on account of his great intellectual powers. But some scholars like Dr. Ganganatha Jha believe that the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School is older and seems to be nearer to the spirit of the original M\u012bm\u0101ms\u0101. [[Arthur Berriedale Keith|Dr. Keith]] (Karmamimamsa, 1921), who likewise rejects the current view in regard to the synchronism of the two authors and their mutual relation, assigns Prabh\u0101kara to 600-650 A.D. ([[Gopinath Kaviraj]] in Jha's Tantravarttika, 1924)<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.282920/page/n18</ref> According to the view of Dr. [[Ganganath Jha]], the Prabh\u0101kara is more faithful to the Bh\u0101\u1e63ya of \u015aabara than Kum\u0101rila. Also, according to Professor [[M. Hiriyanna]], the original teaching of the M\u012bm\u0101msa is better preserved in the writings of Prabh\u0101kara than in those of Kum\u0101rila. As rightly observed by Dr. G. P. Bhatt<ref>Jaini, P. (1964). Govardhan P. Bhatt: Epistemology of the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da school of P\u016brva-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. (The Chowkhamba Sanskrit Studies, Vol. XVII.) [xvi], 436 pp. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1962. Rs. 20. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 27(1), 230-231. doi:10.1017/S0041977X00101223</ref>, Prabh\u0101kara, however, was a more original thinker than Kum\u0101rila and he will always be remembered as the author of a peculiar theory of knowledge known as Theory of Triple perception Triput\u012bpratyak\u1e63av\u0101da) and a theory of error called the Akhy\u0101tiv\u0101da<ref>[[Khyativada]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} or the Vivek\u0101khy\u0101tiv\u0101da. In order to understand the system of M\u012bm\u0101msa fully and precisely, one must go through the works of the Prabhakara system. Pt. S. Subrahmanya S\u0101stri maintains the view that though many theories of this system are criticized in other systems particularly in the Nyaya the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school commands respect from and is actually made use of by reputed scholars.<ref>https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/64253</ref> The Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita School of philosophy follows the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School in matters regarding the categories of the world. It may be said that the study of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101msa is necessary for acquiring a clear knowledge of the Dharma \u015a\u0101stras and the S\u0101ya\u1e47abh\u0101\u1e63ya of the Vedas as well.\n\n==Flawless Logic from M\u012bm\u0101msa rules==\nThere is an old dispute about the \"\u015ayena sacrifice\", a sacrifice in the Vedas meant to kill one's enemies. How can this be reconciled with the rule not to harm any living being? As Agata Ciabattoni<ref>{{Citation|title=Agata Ciabattoni|date=2020-04-20|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Agata_Ciabattoni&oldid=952111317|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> says: \"For a Hindu, the Vedas are absolutely correct, so there cannot be any contradiction\".  Prabh\u0101kara resolved this problem by applying several rules from the Vedas in a logically rather complicated way. Various scholars did not believe that his reasoning was correct, and this dispute has been going on for centuries.

Prabh\u0101kara in his book B\u1e5bhati quotes only [[Bhart\u1e5bhari]] (4-5 CE) and [[Bharavi]] (5-6 CE). Thus his probable time can be assigned to the latter half of the 6th century. \n\nHis views on [[\u015aabara]]\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya, a commentary on [[Jaimini]]\u2019s P\u016brvam\u012bm\u0101ms\u0101 S\u016btras led to rise of Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school within M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and further developed as competent philosophical system along with the rival school of [[Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da]]. \n\nThe Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school is alleged to be nastika<ref>[[%C4%80stika and n%C4%81stika]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} (atheistic) or [[Charvaka]]|Lok\u0101yata school. <blockquote>Kum\u0101rila said: For in practice the Mimamsa has been for the most part converted into a Lokayata system; But I have made this effort to bring it into a theistic path.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Lok\u0101yata, a study in ancient Indian materialism|last=Debiprasad.|first=Chattopadhyaya|date=1992|publisher=People's|isbn=8170070066|edition= 7th|location=New Delhi|oclc=47093882}}</ref></blockquote>\nHere Kum\u0101rila refers to Bhartriprapancha<ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bhartriprapancha</ref>, held by somebody as the forerunner of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara system. It is generally believed that the M\u012bm\u0101msakas and specially the Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas are atheists. But the source books of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School state in unequivocal terms that the inferential existence of God which is propounded by Naiyayikas and the like is denied by the denied by the Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas and that God is not denied: \u201c\u012b\u015bvar\u0113 par\u014dktmanum\u0101na\u1e41 nirastam, n\u0113\u015bvar\u014d nirasta\u1e25\u201d<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.328914/page/n6</ref> \n\n[[\u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha]] wrote \u1e5ajuvimal\u0101pa\u00f1cik\u0101 and D\u012bpa\u015bikh\u0101pa\u00f1cik\u0101 commentaries on Prabh\u0101kara in the 8th century.{{sfn|Paolo Visigalli|2014|p=47}}\n\n==Sentence vs word meaning==\nOne of the views of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101karas is that words do not directly designate meaning; any meaning that arises is because it is connected with other words (''anvit\u0101bhidh\u0101na'', anvita = connected; abhidh\u0101na = denotation). We know or learn the meaning of a word only by considering the sentential context which it appears; we learn such word meanings together with their possible semantic connections with other words. Sentence meanings are grasped directly, from perceptual and contextual cues, skipping the stage of grasping singly the individual word meanings (Matilal 1990:108).\n\nThis is very similar to the modern view of linguistic [[underspecification]], and relates to the [[Semantics#Dynamic turn in semantics|Dynamic Turn in Semantics]], which opposes the purely compositional view of arriving at sentence meaning.\n\nThe Pr\u0101bh\u0101karakas were opposed by the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6das, who argued for a [[Principle of compositionality|compositional]] view of semantics (called ''abhihit\u0101nvaya''). In this view, the meaning of a sentence was understood only after understanding first the meanings of individual words. Words were independent, complete objects, a view that is close to the [[Jerry Fodor|Fodorian]] view of language.\n\nOf the two principal schools of the P\u016brvam\u012bm\u0101ms\u0101 the Bhatta school has all along attracted greater attention than the Prabhakara school. The study of the works of the Prabhakara school has been neglected for a long time past. All the knowledge that our old Sanskrit scholars had of the tenets of this school was derived solely from the stray references found in the works of the other systems. At the wake of 20th century, Dr. [[Ganganath Jha]] has written a very learned thesis in which he has presented in a lucid form the main principles of the Prabhakara school as they have been dealt with in the Prakara\u1e47apancika of [[\u015a\u0101likan\u0101tha]].<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.311115/page/n1</ref> He has also given for the first time, much valuable information regarding the B\u1e5bhat\u012b of Prabh\u0101kara which is a commentary on \u015aabara\u2019s Bh\u0101\u1e63ya. \n\n==Tradition and research==\nTradition makes Prabh\u0101kara a pupil of Kum\u0101rila who nicknamed him as Guru on account of his great intellectual powers. But some scholars like Dr. Ganganatha Jha believe that the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School is older and seems to be nearer to the spirit of the original M\u012bm\u0101ms\u0101. [[Arthur Berriedale Keith|Dr. Keith]] (Karmamimamsa, 1921), who likewise rejects the current view in regard to the synchronism of the two authors and their mutual relation, assigns Prabh\u0101kara to 600-650 A.D. ([[Gopinath Kaviraj]] in Jha's Tantravarttika, 1924)<ref>https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.282920/page/n18</ref> According to the view of Dr. [[Ganganath Jha]], the Prabh\u0101kara is more faithful to the Bh\u0101\u1e63ya of \u015aabara than Kum\u0101rila. Also, according to Professor [[M. Hiriyanna]], the original teaching of the M\u012bm\u0101msa is better preserved in the writings of Prabh\u0101kara than in those of Kum\u0101rila. As rightly observed by Dr. G. P. Bhatt<ref>Jaini, P. (1964). Govardhan P. Bhatt: Epistemology of the Bh\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6da school of P\u016brva-m\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101. (The Chowkhamba Sanskrit Studies, Vol. XVII.) [xvi], 436 pp. Varanasi: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series Office, 1962. Rs. 20. Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, 27(1), 230-231. doi:10.1017/S0041977X00101223</ref>, Prabh\u0101kara, however, was a more original thinker than Kum\u0101rila and he will always be remembered as the author of a peculiar theory of knowledge known as Theory of Triple perception Triput\u012bpratyak\u1e63av\u0101da) and a theory of error called the Akhy\u0101tiv\u0101da<ref>[[Khyativada]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} or the Vivek\u0101khy\u0101tiv\u0101da. In order to understand the system of M\u012bm\u0101msa fully and precisely, one must go through the works of the Prabhakara system. Pt. S. Subrahmanya S\u0101stri maintains the view that though many theories of this system are criticized in other systems particularly in the Nyaya the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara school commands respect from and is actually made use of by reputed scholars.<ref>https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/64253</ref> The Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita School of philosophy follows the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara School in matters regarding the categories of the world. It may be said that the study of the Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara M\u012bm\u0101msa is necessary for acquiring a clear knowledge of the Dharma \u015a\u0101stras and the S\u0101ya\u1e47abh\u0101\u1e63ya of the Vedas as well.\n\n==Flawless Logic from M\u012bm\u0101msa rules==\nThere is an old dispute about the \"\u015ayena sacrifice\", a sacrifice in the Vedas meant to kill one's enemies. How can this be reconciled with the rule not to harm any living being? As Agata Ciabattoni says: \"For a Hindu, the Vedas are absolutely correct, so there cannot be any contradiction\".  Prabh\u0101kara resolved this problem by applying several rules from the Vedas in a logically rather complicated way. Various scholars did not believe that his reasoning was correct, and this dispute has been going on for centuries. Agata Ciabattoni and her team closely collaborated with Sanskritists to translate the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 rules and the Vedic laws into mathematical formulae \u2013 and they could prove that Prabh\u0101kara had been right all along. Given the prescriptions of the Vedas, Prabh\u0101kara's logic was flawless, thus settling an old philosophical dispute with Mathematical logic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-01-indian-sacred-texts-logic-ethics.html|title=Indian sacred texts and the logic of computer ethics|website=phys.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n==See also==\n* [[Triputipratyaksavada]] (Prabhakara's Doctrine of Triple Perception)\n* [[Khyativada]]\n* [[Anubhava (Hindu thought)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Matilal|first=Bimal Krishna|authorlink=Bimal Krishna Matilal|title=The word and the world: India's contribution to the study of language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNNhAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|author1=Giovanni Ciotti|author2=Alastair Gornall|author3=Paolo Visigalli|title=Puspika: Tracing Ancient India Through Texts and Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJJABAAAQBAJ&pg=PT47|date=31 January 2014|publisher=Oxbow Books|isbn=978-1-78297-416-1}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Prabhakara}}\n[[Category:6th-century Indian philosophers]]\n[[Category:\u0100stika]]\n[[Category:Indian Medieval linguists]]\n[[Category:Indian Sanskrit scholars]]\n[[Category:Medieval Sanskrit grammarians]]\n", "name_user": "Argsvdv", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFlawless Logic from M\u012bm\u0101msa rules:Agata Ciabattoni", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabh%C4%81kara"}

In early 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment was also spun off in its own half-hour series from February 3 to March 3, 1979. The series was later aired in reruns on [[USA Cartoon Express]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe show featured [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Jabberjaw]] and several new characters as competitors in an outer space reworking of ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. Cameo guests included [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]], [[Godzilla (1978 TV series)|Godzilla]] and [[Jana of the Jungle]]; the supporting segments were ''[[Galaxy Goof-Ups]]'', ''The Buford Files'' and ''The Galloping Ghost''. The latter two were repackaged the following year as ''[[Buford and the Galloping Ghost]]''. When ''Galaxy Goof-Ups'' was given its own half-hour timeslot on November 4, 1978, ''Yogi's Space Race'' was reduced to 60 minutes. On February 3, 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment and ''Buford and the Galloping Ghost'' were also spun off in their own half-hour series.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Yogi Bear''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Scare Bear''' (voiced by [[Joe Besser]]): While Yogi remains unchanged save for the change in setting, his friend [[Boo Boo (Yogi Bear)|Boo Boo]] does not appear and was unable to participate in the race. Instead, his companion and partner is Scare Bear, a small fuzzy bear who is afraid of almost everything. Yogi and Scare are a racing team on \"Space Race\" and members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Huckleberry Hound''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Quack-Up''' (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]): Quack-Up is a duck who is the crazy and clumsy pilot of the team while Huck just rests at the top of their ship. They are also members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Jabberjaw and Buford''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Jabberjaw is still on his search for respect from his original series. His partner is Buford, from ''The Buford Files'', where he's the lazy pet dog of two kids, Cindy Mae and Woody who solve mysteries in Fenokee County. Their race ship contains a track on which Buford runs to increase speed, which is seldom used since it is hard to keep him awake. Jabberjaw was once seen running on it during the episode \"The Saturn 500\".\n* '''Nugget Nose''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), '''Wendy''' (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) and '''Rita''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]]): The only racing team in the race that's a trio. They all are characters from ''The Galloping Ghost'' where Wendy and Rita work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch and Nugget Nose is a gold-obsessed [[ghost]] who's jealous about the girls. His nose looks like a nugget (hence the name).\n* '''Captain Good/Phantom Phink and Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge''' (both voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): To the eyes of the other characters, Captain Good is the [[personification]] of good [[sportsmanship]] and fights for everything right. To the viewers, he's actually Phantom Phink, a space racer who uses all possible sorts of cheating like [[Dick Dastardly]], except that he actually wins some races, crossing the finish line either as Captain Good or as Phantom Phink. The duo can transform themselves, and their car, at the touch of a button. Captain Good looks like a handsome white-clad and blond-tressed muscleman while Phink is a skinny costumed creep with a big nose and bristly black beard. Although Good/Phink never tricks people into believing they are seeing both of them at the same time and Phink never shows up for the start of any race, nobody suspects they're one and the same, not even the narrator. Good/Phink usually tries to get help from people who live in the planets where the races take place, no matter which identity he must use. Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is Captain Good's/Phantom Phink's pet cat/dog. Clean Kat is a white and [[snobbish]] cat while Sinister Sludge is a sleazy brown dog who's usually told by Phink to shut up. Whenever Good/Phink morphs, Kat/Sludge morphs together (although he is capable of doing it separated from his master, such as in the Saturn 500, when Phink says dogs aren't allowed on [[Mars]] and he morphs, causing Phink to says cats aren't either and in the Mizar Marathon when Good said that cats aren't allowed in a castle, to which he morphs and Good says that goes for dogs too).\n* '''The Narrator''' (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]): This unseen character is the narrator of the Space Race and presenter of ''the Space Race Biography''. He sometimes talks to the characters of the series.\n* '''El Fabuloso''': The Space Race's official [[computer]] which often speaks in Spanish. It analyzes the races to catch any cheat practiced and often disqualifies Phantom Phink for cheating. Phink usually utilizes his [[alter-ego]] to proceed on the race because of that. In ''Franzia'', after Good/Phink tricks the local version of [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]] to stop the other racers, El Fabuloso finally discovers they're one and the same, but no one believes it and the narrator assumes El Fabuloso has a malfunction. To keep his secret identity, Phink has to convert into Captain Good to save the Space Racers.\n\n==Biography==\nThe series often introduces the biography of some Space Racers or their ancestors. Phantom Phink was once described as a \"descendant\" of [[Dr. Jekyll]], who was described looking like Captain Good while [[Mr. Hyde]] looks like Phink, giving us an idea of Good's/Phink's original look that [[contradiction|contradicts]] the idea believed by many fans that Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is originally a dog since this is his shape as Phantom Phink's pet and Sludge is the one to have a biography.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{No plot|section|date=October 2015}}\nThirteen episodes were broadcast in 1978. The winners of each race got a prize which ended up unfortunate, such as having to do the dishes after their meal at the Ritz.\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"background:#FFFFFF\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#000000; width:20px\"| {{abbr|N\u00ba|Episode number}}\n! style=\"background:#000000\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#000000; width:135px\"| Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = The Saturn 500\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Yogi Bear and Scare Bear. <br> '''Prize''': Vacation trip to Mars; '''Trouble''': They continue to be chased by the snow bear during the vacation on Mars.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 2\n| Title = The Neptune 9000\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|9|16}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Captain Good and Clean Kat. <br> '''Prize''': A car/ship that converts into a bag for easy keeping; '''Trouble''': The car/ship did it with Captain Good inside it.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 3\n| Title = The Pongo Tongo Classic\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|9|23}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Yogi Bear and Scare Bear. <br> '''Prize''': Dinner at Ritz; '''Trouble''': They dine at the kitchen and have to do the dishes.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 4\n| Title = Nebuloc\u2013The Prehistoric Planet\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|9|30}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Phantom Phink and Sinister Sludge. <br> '''Prize''': Being painted by a famous artist; '''Trouble''': They were literally painted. <br> '''Guest stars''': [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]], [[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]].\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 5\n| Title = The Spartikan Spectacular\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|10|7}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Captain Good and Clean Kat. <br> '''Prize''': A ride at a cruise boat; '''Trouble''': They had to travel with the cargo.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 6\n| Title = The Mizar Marathon\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|10|14}}\n| ShortSummary =  '''Winners''': Jabberjaw and Buford. <br> '''Prize''': A self massaging bed; '''Trouble''': The bed beats them up with its robot hands.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 7\n| Title = The Lost Planet of Atlantis\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|10|21}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Huckleberry Hound and Quack-Up. <br> '''Prize''': Tickets to an Amusement Park named Funkyland; '''Trouble''': They were the dunking clowns.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 8\n| Title = Race Through Oz\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|10|28}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Captain Good and Clean Kat. <br> '''Prize''': A date with a computer-chosen partner; '''Trouble''': He's got a date with the Wicked Witch of the West.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 9\n| Title = Race Through Wet Galoshes\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|11|4}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Captain Good and Clean Kat. <br> '''Prize''': Tickets to the Rolling Clones; '''Trouble''': They have to lay down at the floor with other viewers over them.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n {{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 10\n| Title = The Borealis Triangle\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|11|11}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Phantom Phink and Sinister Sludge. <br> '''Prize''': Vacation time at a ski lodge; '''Trouble''': They had to pull the sleigh.\n| LineColor = 151c14\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 11\n| Title = Race to the Center of the Universe\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|11|18}}\n| ShortSummary = '''Winners''': Nugget Nose, Wendy and Rita. <br> '''Prize''': Vacation time at a dude ranch; '''Trouble''': It's Fuddy's Dude Ranch.

In early 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment was also spun off in its own half-hour series from February 3 to March 3, 1979. The series was later aired in reruns on [[USA Cartoon Express]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe show featured [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[Jabberjaw]] and several new characters as competitors in an outer space reworking of ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]''. Cameo guests included [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]], [[Quick Draw McGraw]], [[The Great Grape Ape Show|Grape Ape]], [[Godzilla (1978 TV series)|Godzilla]] and [[Jana of the Jungle]]; the supporting segments were ''[[Galaxy Goof-Ups]]'', ''The Buford Files'' and ''The Galloping Ghost''. The latter two were repackaged the following year as ''[[Buford and the Galloping Ghost]]''. When ''Galaxy Goof-Ups'' was given its own half-hour timeslot on November 4, 1978, ''Yogi's Space Race'' was reduced to 60 minutes. On February 3, 1979, the ''Space Race'' segment and ''Buford and the Galloping Ghost'' were also spun off in their own half-hour series.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Yogi Bear''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Scare Bear''' (voiced by [[Joe Besser]]): While Yogi remains unchanged save for the change in setting, his friend [[Boo Boo (Yogi Bear)|Boo Boo]] does not appear and was unable to participate in the race. Instead, his companion and partner is Scare Bear, a small fuzzy bear who is afraid of almost everything. Yogi and Scare are a racing team on \"Space Race\" and members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Huckleberry Hound''' (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) and '''Quack-Up''' (voiced by [[Mel Blanc]]): Quack-Up is a duck who is the crazy and clumsy pilot of the team while Huck just rests at the top of their ship. They are also members of the \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\".\n* '''Jabberjaw and Buford''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): Jabberjaw is still on his search for respect from his original series. His partner is Buford, from ''The Buford Files'', where he's the lazy pet dog of two kids, Cindy Mae and Woody who solve mysteries in Fenokee County. Their race ship contains a track on which Buford runs to increase speed, which is seldom used since it is hard to keep him awake. Jabberjaw was once seen running on it during the episode \"The Saturn 500\".\n* '''Nugget Nose''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]), '''Wendy''' (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]) and '''Rita''' (voiced by [[Patricia Parris|Pat Parris]]): The only racing team in the race that's a trio. They all are characters from ''The Galloping Ghost'' where Wendy and Rita work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch and Nugget Nose is a gold-obsessed [[ghost]] who's jealous about the girls. His nose looks like a nugget (hence the name).\n* '''Captain Good/Phantom Phink and Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge''' (both voiced by [[Frank Welker]]): To the eyes of the other characters, Captain Good is the [[personification]] of good [[sportsmanship]] and fights for everything right. To the viewers, he's actually Phantom Phink, a space racer who uses all possible sorts of cheating like [[Dick Dastardly]], except that he actually wins some races, crossing the finish line either as Captain Good or as Phantom Phink. The duo can transform themselves, and their car, at the touch of a button. Captain Good looks like a handsome white-clad and blond-tressed muscleman while Phink is a skinny costumed creep with a big nose and bristly black beard. Although Good/Phink never tricks people into believing they are seeing both of them at the same time and Phink never shows up for the start of any race, nobody suspects they're one and the same, not even the narrator. Good/Phink usually tries to get help from people who live in the planets where the races take place, no matter which identity he must use. Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is Captain Good's/Phantom Phink's pet cat/dog. Clean Kat is a white and [[snobbish]] cat while Sinister Sludge is a sleazy brown dog who's usually told by Phink to shut up. Whenever Good/Phink morphs, Kat/Sludge morphs together (although he is capable of doing it separated from his master, such as in the Saturn 500, when Phink says dogs aren't allowed on [[Mars]] and he morphs, causing Phink to says cats aren't either and in the Mizar Marathon when Good said that cats aren't allowed in a castle, to which he morphs and Good says that goes for dogs too).\n* '''The Narrator''' (voiced by [[Gary Owens]]): This unseen character is the narrator of the Space Race and presenter of ''the Space Race Biography''. He sometimes talks to the characters of the series.\n* '''El Fabuloso''': The Space Race's official [[computer]] which often speaks in Spanish. It analyzes the races to catch any cheat practiced and often disqualifies Phantom Phink for cheating. Phink usually utilizes his [[alter-ego]] to proceed on the race because of that. In ''Franzia'', after Good/Phink tricks the local version of [[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]] to stop the other racers, El Fabuloso finally discovers they're one and the same, but no one believes it and the narrator assumes El Fabuloso has a malfunction. To keep his secret identity, Phink has to convert into Captain Good to save the Space Racers.\n\n==Biography==\nThe series often introduces the biography of some Space Racers or their ancestors. Phantom Phink was once described as a \"descendant\" of [[Dr. Jekyll]], who was described looking like Captain Good while [[Mr. Hyde]] looks like Phink, giving us an idea of Good's/Phink's original look that [[contradiction|contradicts]] the idea believed by many fans that Clean Kat/Sinister Sludge is originally a dog since this is his shape as Phantom Phink's pet and Sludge is the one to have a biography.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{No plot|section|date=October 2015}}\nThirteen episodes were broadcast in 1978.

{"title_page": "Music of Kazakhstan", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2018}}\n{{Music of Central Asia}}\n'''Music of Kazakhstan''' refers to a wide range of musical styles and genres deriving from Kazakhstan. [[Kazakhstan]] is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a well-known composer and [[dombra]] player from the 19th century.\n\n==Traditional music==\nTraditional music in Kazakhstan often refers to music of the following genres:\n\n* '''Instrumental music''', with the pieces (\"K\u00fcy\") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or \"program\") for the music, as a lot of K\u00fcy titles refer to stories.\n* '''Vocal music''', either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.\n\n==Russian and Soviet-era music==\n[[Image:Dombra.png|thumb|right|170px|Postage stamp depicting a ''dombra'', the most popular traditional musical instrument of Kazakhstan]]\n{{See also|Music of the Soviet Union}}\n\nThe Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres:\n* First, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories (where European music was performed and taught).\n* Second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.\n\nControlled by the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with [[ethnic Russian music]] and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research teams including [[composer]]s, [[music critic]]s and [[musicology|musicologist]]s. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear [[musical notation|notation]]. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [[European classical music]].\n\nKazakh musicians themselves, however, did not write their own music with notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, certain Kazakh folk culture was encouraged to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a derivative of Kazakh folk music. In 1920, [[Aleksandr Zatayevich]], a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements from Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles (such as increasing the number of [[fret]]s and [[strings (music)|strings]]). Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavors.<ref name=\"hokudai.ac.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html|title=From Folklore to Soviet National Culture- The Process of Formation of \"Kazak National Music\" (1920-1942)|website=Src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Musical institutions==\nThe Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music in Kazakhstan. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed<ref name=\"hokudai.ac.jp\"/> The Foundation Asyl Mura is archives and publishes historical recordings of Kazakh music both traditional and classical. The  Qurmanghazy Conservatoire is considered one of the leading conservatoires in Almaty.\n\n==Musical traditional instruments==\n{{main|Kazakh national musical instruments}}\n[[File:1990 CPA 6247.jpg|right|300 px|thumb| Traditional instruments of Kazakhstan]]\nThe most popular traditional instruments are string instruments. First of them is the dombra ([[wikt:\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0430|\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0430]]), the most popular and the oldest Kazakh music instrument. Some argue that nomads have used similar two-string instruments more than two thousand years ago.<ref name=\"nlrk\">{{cite web |url=http://musicheritage.nlrk.kz/index.php/ru/page/show/102 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814160658/http://musicheritage.nlrk.kz/index.php/ru/page/show/102 |archive-date=2009-08-14 |url-status=dead |title=\u041c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0435 \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0445\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430 &#124; Musical Heritage of Kazakhstan |accessdate=2015-11-29 }}</ref>  The dombra is a long-necked lute with two strings tuned in the interval of a fourth or sometimes a fifth. The strings are plucked or strummed by the right hand without a plectrum.\n\nThe other instrument playing an important role is the Qobyz, which is a bowed instrument held between the legs. It is made of carved wood for the body, animal skin for the resonator, and horse hair for the strings, and the bow. The Qobyz is said to have been invented by the legendary shaman Qorqyt, long before the medieval ages.\nThe \"Zhetigen\" (\"Seven strings\") could be seen as a member of the cither family, finding equivalents in China, with the strings being divided each in two parts of different lengths, the bridge being movable and consisting of small bone. There is also a plucked lute called sherter ([[wikt:\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440|\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440]]).\n\n=== List of Kazakh traditional instruments ===\n\n* [[Dombra]] (Kazakh: [[wikt: \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0430|\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0430]]) is a stringed instrument of the Turkic, which is widely spread among the Turks. Dombra is made of hollow wood, wooden parts and two strings. 19 (sometimes 22) keys are attached to the neck.

[[Kazakhstan]] is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a well-known composer and [[dombra]] player from the 19th century.\n\n==Traditional music==\nTraditional music in Kazakhstan often refers to music of the following genres:\n\n* '''Instrumental music''', with the pieces (\"K\u00fcy\") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or \"program\") for the music, as a lot of K\u00fcy titles refer to stories.\n* '''Vocal music''', either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.\n\n==Russian and Soviet-era music==\n[[Image:Dombra.png|thumb|right|170px|Postage stamp depicting a ''dombra'', the most popular traditional musical instrument of Kazakhstan]]\n{{See also|Music of the Soviet Union}}\n\nThe Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres:\n* First, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories (where European music was performed and taught).\n* Second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.\n\nControlled by the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with [[ethnic Russian music]] and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research teams including [[composer]]s, [[music critic]]s and [[musicology|musicologist]]s. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear [[musical notation|notation]]. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [[European classical music]].\n\nKazakh musicians themselves, however, did not write their own music with notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, certain Kazakh folk culture was encouraged to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a derivative of Kazakh folk music. In 1920, [[Aleksandr Zatayevich]], a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements from Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles (such as increasing the number of [[fret]]s and [[strings (music)|strings]]). Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavors.<ref name=\"hokudai.ac.jp\">{{cite web|url=http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html|title=From Folklore to Soviet National Culture- The Process of Formation of \"Kazak National Music\" (1920-1942)|website=Src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Musical institutions==\nThe Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music in Kazakhstan.

The strings are plucked or strummed by the right hand without a plectrum.\n\nThe other instrument playing an important role is the Qobyz, which is a bowed instrument held between the legs. It is made of carved wood for the body, animal skin for the resonator, and horse hair for the strings, and the bow. The Qobyz is said to have been invented by the legendary shaman Qorqyt, long before the medieval ages.\nThe \"Zhetigen\" (\"Seven strings\") could be seen as a member of the cither family, finding equivalents in China, with the strings being divided each in two parts of different lengths, the bridge being movable and consisting of small bone. There is also a plucked lute called sherter ([[wikt:\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440|\u0448\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0435\u0440]]).\n\n=== List of Kazakh traditional instruments ===\n\n* [[Dombra]] (Kazakh: [[wikt: \u0434\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0430|\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0431\u044b\u0440\u0430]]) is a stringed instrument of the Turkic, which is widely spread among the Turks.

Originally part of the [[Lordship of Meath]], it was then constituted as part of the historic [[County Dublin]]. Today, it lies in the modern [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of [[Fingal]]. The barony was originally also a feudal title, which became one of the subsidiary titles of the Viscounts Gormanston.\n\n==History==\nThe barony was created by [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath]] as his own feudal barony, to be held directly from himself ''[[in capite]]'' (his vassals were commonly called \"De Lacy's Barons\".)<ref>Vicissitudes of Families by Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, Longman Green Longman and Roberts, Paternoster Row, London, 1861 (pages 363-364)</ref> The first vassal was [[Hugh Tyrrel]] in [[1177 in Ireland|1177]]. It was held for three and a half knight's fees, owed to the superior Lord of [[Fingal]]. The title and lands of Castleknock were held by the Tyrell family until 1370 when Hugh Tyrell and his wife died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. It later passed to the [[Viscount Gormanston]].\n\n\n==Location==\nAt the heart of the barony is the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of the same name - [[Castleknock (civil parish)|Castleknock]] - which is one of eight civil parishes in the barony. In the [[townland]] of Castleknock itself is the location of the eponymous \"Cnucha's Castle\" - [[Castleknock Castle]]. The town with the biggest population in the barony is [[Blanchardstown]].  It is one of seven and a half baronies that used to comprise the old [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of Dublin.<ref>According to the \"Local Government Act, 2001\", section 10(2): \"The State continues to stand divided into local government areas to be known as counties and cities which are the areas set out in Parts 1 and 2, respectively, of Schedule 5.\" It is clear from SCHEDULE 5, Local Government Areas (Counties and Cities, PART 1, that \"Dublin\" is defined only as a city (as distinct from a county).</ref> It stretches from [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]] to [[Blanchardstown]] (from east to west) and from [[Finglas]] to [[Chapelizod]] (from north to south). \n\nThe Castleknock barony is located between the baronies of [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]] to the east, [[Nethercross]] to the north and [[Dublin (barony)|Dublin]] to the southwest. The [[River Liffey]] separates it from the remaining baronies of County Dublin. With the exception of the parish of Chapelizod, the remainder of the barony is contained within the modern [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of [[Fingal]] and it is subject to [[Fingal County Council]].\n\n==Legal context==\nBaronies were created after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] as subdivisions of counties and were used for administration. At the time of its creation, Castleknock was part of the [[Lordship of Meath]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. While they have been administratively obsolete since 1898, they continue to be used in land registration, and specification such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier [[Gaels|Gaelic]] t\u00faath which had submitted to the Crown. This is probably true in the case of  Castleknock.\n\n==Civil parishes==\n\n===Civil parish of Castleknock===\nWhat is now the parish of [[Castleknock (civil parish)|Castleknock]] was granted by the Lord of Meath to Hugh Tyrrell.
