When accessing the Internet via a captive portal, Firefox will alert users and open the portal login page in a new tab.\n* Enabled multi-process Firefox for Windows users with touch screens\n* Added user warnings for non-secure HTTP pages with logins. Firefox now displays a \u201cThis connection is not secure\u201d message when users click into the username and password fields on pages that don't use HTTPS.\n* Implemented the Strict Secure Cookies specification which forbids insecure HTTP sites from setting cookies with the \"secure\" attribute. In some cases, this will prevent an insecure site from setting a cookie with the same name as an existing \"secure\" cookie from the same base domain.\n* Enhanced Sync to allow users to send and open tabs from one device to another.\n* Improved text input for third-party keyboard layouts on Windows. This will address some keyboard layouts that:\n** have chained dead keys.\n** input two or more characters with a non-printable key or a dead key sequence.\n** input a character even when a dead key sequence failed to compose a character.\n* Removed support for Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI) plugins other than Flash. Silverlight, Java, Acrobat and the like are no longer supported.\n* Removed Battery Status API to reduce fingerprinting of users by trackers.\n* Improved experience for downloads:\n** Notification in the toolbar when a download fails.\n** Quick access to five most recent downloads rather than three.\n** Larger buttons for canceling and restarting downloads.\n* Displaying (but allowing users to override) an \u201cUntrusted Connection\u201d error when encountering SHA-1 certificates that chain up to a root certificate included in Mozilla's CA Certificate Program. (Note: Firefox continues to permit SHA-1 certificates that chain to manually imported root certificates.)\n* Migrated Firefox users on Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems to the extended support release (ESR) version of Firefox.\n* When not using Direct2D on Windows, Skia is used for content rendering.\n* Enabled CSS Grid Layout, opening up a world of new possibilities for graphic design.\n* Redesigned Responsive Design Mode to include device selection, network throttling, and more.\n* Improved security for screen sharing, which now shows a preview and no longer requires a whitelisted domain.\n'''Android'''\n* Reduced APK file size by more than 5 MB for faster download and installation.\n* Display of media controls to pause or resume playback on the Android notification bar. This gives users easy access to controls and allows them to see when audio or video is playing (and consuming mobile data) on Firefox.\n|-\n\n| 52.0.1\n| March 17, 2017\n| ''Off-cycle security

When accessing the Internet via a captive portal, Firefox will alert users and open the portal login page in a new tab.\n* Enabled multi-process Firefox for Windows users with touch screens\n* Added user warnings for non-secure HTTP pages with logins. Firefox now displays a \u201cThis connection is not secure\u201d message when users click into the username and password fields on pages that don't use HTTPS.\n* Implemented the Strict Secure Cookies specification which forbids insecure HTTP sites from setting cookies with the \"secure\" attribute. In some cases, this will prevent an insecure site from setting a cookie with the same name as an existing \"secure\" cookie from the same base domain.\n* Enhanced Sync to allow users to send and open tabs from one device to another.\n* Improved text input for third-party keyboard layouts on Windows. This will address some keyboard layouts that:\n** have chained dead keys.\n** input two or more characters with a non-printable key or a dead key sequence.\n** input a character even when a dead key sequence failed to compose a character.\n* Removed support for Netscape Plugin API (NPAPI) plugins other than Flash. Silverlight, Java, Acrobat and the like are no longer supported.\n* Removed Battery Status API to reduce fingerprinting of users by trackers.\n* Improved experience for downloads:\n** Notification in the toolbar when a download fails.\n** Quick access to five most recent downloads rather than three.\n** Larger buttons for canceling and restarting downloads.\n* Displaying (but allowing users to override) an \u201cUntrusted Connection\u201d error when encountering SHA-1 certificates that chain up to a root certificate included in Mozilla's CA Certificate Program. (Note: Firefox continues to permit SHA-1 certificates that chain to manually imported root certificates.)\n* Migrated Firefox users on Windows XP and Windows Vista operating systems to the extended support release (ESR) version of Firefox.\n* When not using Direct2D on Windows, Skia is used for content rendering.\n* Enabled CSS Grid Layout, opening up a world of new possibilities for graphic design.\n* Redesigned Responsive Design Mode to include device selection, network throttling, and more.\n* Improved security for screen sharing, which now shows a preview and no longer requires a whitelisted domain.\n'''Android'''\n* Reduced APK file size by more than 5 MB for faster download and installation.\n* Display of media controls to pause or resume playback on the Android notification bar. This gives users easy access to controls and allows them to see when audio or video is playing (and consuming mobile data) on Firefox.\n|-\n\n| 52.0.1\n| March 17, 2017\n| ''Off-cycle security

Manufactured products started with [[scythe]]s at the Winsted Manufacturing Company in 1792. The city is within the town of Winchester, and its name derives from the fact that it is the business center for the towns of Winchester and [[Barkhamsted, Connecticut|Barkhamsted]].\n\nWinsted, along with [[New Haven, Connecticut]], was a center for the production of [[clock#History of time-measuring devices|mechanical clocks]] in the 1900s. The Gilbert Clock Company, located along the Still River north of town, was founded in 1871 by William L. Gilbert (1806\u20131890) and became one of the largest clock companies in the world around the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe Winsted post office contains an oil on canvas [[mural]], ''Lincoln's Arbiter Settles the Winsted Post Office Controversy'', painted by muralist [[Amy Jones (artist)|Amy Jones]] in 1938.

The Mad River, which parallels Main Street, caused flooding up to {{convert|10|ft}} deep through the center of town. This damaged the buildings between Main Street and the river such that all buildings on that side of Main Street through the center of town were subsequently removed and Main Street widened to four lanes. The buildings on the north side of Main Street for the most part survived and were repaired. Further downstream, the Still River flowed between the buildings of the Gilbert Clock Company. The flooding caused extensive damage to their buildings, and this was the final blow to a company which was already in poor financial condition.\n\n[[Northwestern Connecticut Community College]] was founded in 1965 by Winsted residents, including [[Ralph Nader]]'s older brother, [[Shafeek Nader|Shafeek]].

Manufactured products started with [[scythe]]s at the Winsted Manufacturing Company in 1792. The city is within the town of Winchester, and its name derives from the fact that it is the business center for the towns of Winchester and [[Barkhamsted, Connecticut|Barkhamsted]].\n\nWinsted, along with [[New Haven, Connecticut]], was a center for the production of [[clock#History of time-measuring devices|mechanical clocks]] in the 1900s. The Gilbert Clock Company, located along the Still River north of town, was founded in 1871 by William L. Gilbert (1806\u20131890) and became one of the largest clock companies in the world around the start of the 20th century.\n\nThe Winsted post office contains an oil on canvas [[mural]], ''Lincoln's Arbiter Settles the Winsted Post Office Controversy'', painted by muralist [[Amy Jones (artist)|Amy Jones]] in 1938.

The Mad River, which parallels Main Street, caused flooding up to {{convert|10|ft}} deep through the center of town. This damaged the buildings between Main Street and the river such that all buildings on that side of Main Street through the center of town were subsequently removed and Main Street widened to four lanes. The buildings on the north side of Main Street for the most part survived and were repaired. Further downstream, the Still River flowed between the buildings of the Gilbert Clock Company. The flooding caused extensive damage to their buildings, and this was the final blow to a company which was already in poor financial condition.\n\n[[Northwestern Connecticut Community College]] was founded in 1965 by Winsted residents, including [[Ralph Nader]]'s older brother, [[Shafeek Nader|Shafeek]]. It occupies the original Gilbert School building. NCCC was one of the first four [[community college]]s in Connecticut, and is accredited by both the Connecticut Board of Governors for Higher Education and by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. The Northwestern Community College Foundation was incorporated in 1981 to support the mission of Northwestern Connecticut Community College. NCCF generates private funds for the purpose of benefiting the students attending NCCC and the community of Winsted.\n\nIn 2013, Henry Centrella, the former city finance director, was served a complaint which stated that over $2.2 million was misappropriated during his 30-year tenure.<ref>{{cite web|title=State of Connecticut Complaint|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/153013458/Centrella-Complaint|work=Web page|publisher=State of Connecticut|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Pictures==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:PostcardWinstedCTViewFromHubbardStreet1906.jpg|View from Hubbard Street, about 1906\nFile:PostcardEastWinstedCTBirdsEyeView1879.jpg|View from Highland Park, 1879\nFile:PostcardWinstedCTEastFrRockwellSt1876.jpg|View east from Rockwell Street, 1876\nFile:PostcardWinstedCTGilbertSchool1921.jpg|The Gilbert School, about 1921\nFile:PostcardLitchfieldCoHospWinsteadCTca1904.jpg|Litchfield County Hospital, about 1904\nFile:West Main Street, Looking East, Winsted, CT.jpg|West Main Street, about 1912\nFile:View of Meadow Street, Winsted, CT.jpg|Meadow Street, about 1906\nFile:PostcardWinstedCTGilbertSchool1908.jpg|The Gilbert School, about 1910\nFile:PostcardWinstedCTFirstDistrictSchoolNorthMainStreet1908.jpg|First District School, about 1908\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the CDP has a total area of {{convert|12.4|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|12.0|km2|order=flip}} are land and {{convert|0.5|km2|order=flip}}, or 3.73%, are water.<ref name=Gazetteer>{{cite web| url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2019_Gazetteer/2019_gaz_place_09.txt| title=U.S. Gazetteer Files: 2019: Places: Connecticut| website=U.S. Census Bureau Geography Division| accessdate=November 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWinsted sits in the eastern part of the town of Winchester at the confluence of the [[Still River (Connecticut)|Still River]] and Mad River.

The [[population density]] was 205.8 people per square mile (79.8/km\u00b2).  There were 180 housing units at an average density of 94.7 per square mile (36.7/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the city was 95.9% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 0.3% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.5% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 0.8% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 2.6% from two or more races.  2.0% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.\n\nThere were 146 households out of which 24.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.2% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 12.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.4% had a male householder with no wife present, and 28.1% were non-families. 24.0% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.15.\n\nThe distribution of age in Winslow reflects a change in the population that has occurred between 2000 and 2010 as the percentage of individuals under the age of 18 has dropped from 28.6% to 21.5% and individuals 24-44 dropped from 23.3% to 20.2%. All other age categories have in turn risen, those 18 to 24 have risen from 8.0% to 9.7%, those age 45 to 64 rose 25.8 to 33.5%, and those who were 65 years of age or older rose from 14.3% to 22.4%. This population shift is likely a result of the closure of the Winslow Public School district, as families with children left the area and new families have not replaced them. The median age was 43.6 years.  For every 100 females, there were 109.1 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $32,692, and the median income for a family was $45,000. Males had a median income of $31,389 versus $41,719 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $15,415.  About 11.5% of families and 23.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 30.9% of those under age 18 and 13.7% of those age 65 or over.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Winslow High School, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|right|This 1930 building formerly housed Winslow High School.

It served the city and nearby rural areas in the southern portion of Washington County.  By most counts, enrollment for grades K-12 was usually in the mid-20s per grade.\n\nThe district became part of the Greenland school district on July 1, 2004,<ref name=Consolfrom1983>\"[http://www.arkansased.gov/public/userfiles/Legal/ConsolidationAnnex_from_1983.xls ConsolidationAnnex_from_1983.xls].\" [[Arkansas Department of Education]]. Retrieved on June 4, 2018.</ref> after the Arkansas Legislature passed a state law that mandated districts with less than 350 students consolidate (Winslow had 273 students).  The high school, which actually served grades 7-12, closed at the end of the 2004\u20132005 school year.  The graduating class at the 2005 spring ceremony had 14 seniors.  Winslow Elementary for grades K-6 was retained for a time following the high school closure. However, in November 2006, the Greenland School Board voted to close that school at the end of the 2006\u20132007 school year after two years with an enrollment of about 90 students. The mascot of Winslow Public Schools was the Squirrels.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe majority of the student body did not go to Greenland. They instead opted to transfer to the West Fork school district. The voters of Winslow are currently petitioning the Arkansas Department of Education and Arkansas Legislature to change Winslow's former district from Greenland to West Fork.\n\nThe Winslow campus now houses the Winslow Public Library, Friends of the Library Bookstore, and Internet Cafe in the old High school building. The Elementary School and other buildings have been demolished, or boarded up with the doors, except the main doors, welded shut.\n\n==Trivia==\n*There have been two movies that have used the city of Winslow as a filming location; [[Frank and Jesse]] and [[Smoke in the Wind]].

By most counts, enrollment for grades K-12 was usually in the mid-20s per grade.\n\nThe district became part of the Greenland school district on July 1, 2004,<ref name=Consolfrom1983>\"[http://www.arkansased.gov/public/userfiles/Legal/ConsolidationAnnex_from_1983.xls ConsolidationAnnex_from_1983.xls].\" [[Arkansas Department of Education]]. Retrieved on June 4, 2018.</ref> after the Arkansas Legislature passed a state law that mandated districts with less than 350 students consolidate (Winslow had 273 students).  The high school, which actually served grades 7-12, closed at the end of the 2004-2005 school year.  The graduating class at the 2005 spring ceremony had 14 seniors.  Winslow Elementary for grades K-6 was retained for a time following the high school closure. However, in November 2006, the Greenland School Board voted to close that school at the end of the 2006-2007 school year after two years with an enrollment of about 90 students. The mascot of Winslow Public Schools was the Squirrels.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe majority of the student body did not go to Greenland. They instead opted to transfer to the West Fork school district. The voters of Winslow are currently petitioning the Arkansas Department of Education and Arkansas Legislature to change Winslow's former district from Greenland to West Fork.\n\nThe Winslow campus now houses the Winslow Public Library, Friends of the Library Bookstore, and Internet Cafe in the old High school building. The Elementary School and other buildings have been demolished, or boarded up with the doors, except the main doors, welded shut.\n\n==Trivia==\n*There have been two movies that have used the city of Winslow as a filming location; [[Frank and Jesse]] and [[Smoke in the Wind]].

In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.\n\nAt the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for \"a favor though\": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.<ref name=\"Intel-Report\" />{{Rp|8\u20139}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Republicans of the House Committees had released a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence does not support accusations. \"The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor,\" said the draft report.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/02/house-gop-draft-report-defends-president-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2590245001/ |title=House GOP report on impeachment inquiry defends Trump's dealings with Ukraine |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/12/02/784183484/read-republican-report-on-the-impeachment-inquiry |title=READ: Republican Report On The Impeachment Inquiry |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref> This report also painted the push to impeachment as solely politically motivated.

In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and endangered U.S. national security.\n\nAt the center of this investigation is the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of his political benefit over the national interest. In response to President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for \"a favor though\": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection efforts.<ref name=\"Intel-Report\" />{{Rp|8\u20139}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Republicans of the House Committees had released a countering report the previous day, saying in part that the evidence does not support accusations. \"The evidence presented does not prove any of these Democrat allegations, and none of the Democrats' witnesses testified to having evidence of bribery, extortion, or any high crime or misdemeanor,\" said the draft report.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/12/02/house-gop-draft-report-defends-president-trump-impeachment-inquiry/2590245001/ |title=House GOP report on impeachment inquiry defends Trump's dealings with Ukraine |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/12/02/784183484/read-republican-report-on-the-impeachment-inquiry |title=READ: Republican Report On The Impeachment Inquiry |date=December 2, 2019 |accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref> This report also painted the push to impeachment as solely politically motivated.

It was located just south of the land of the [[Illinois Confederation|Illiniwek]]. The western portion of the county in particular shows extensive archeological evidence of supporting extensive First Nations populations.\n\nAt the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]], three competing American colonies \u2014 Massachusetts, Virginia, and Connecticut \u2014 claimed part of what is today the state of Illinois. The matter was solved in 1778 when Virginia amalgamated lands in the region into a massive county called Illinois, borrowing the name of a native people. [[Indiana Territory]] was formed in 1800 with [[William Henry Harrison]] as Governor; the future Illinois was part of this territory. It was not until 1809 that [[Illinois Territory]] was formally established as an official territory of the United States of America. Statehood followed in December 1818.\n\nThe first organized Anglo settlements in the future Woodford County region appeared in the 1820s. First settlement in the county came at [[Spring Bay, Illinois|Spring Bay]], with pioneers managing to select the same ground occupied by an ancient Indian <!---I am intentionally using this word for flavor---> burial site which ran north-and-south through the entire settlement. The location was chosen due to its proximity to the [[Illinois River]].<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 10\u201318</ref>\n\n[[File:MesquakieIndians1857.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Meskwaki (Fox) were pushed from their historic homelands to Iowa and [[Indian Territory]] (part of today's Oklahoma).]]\n\nIn the 1870s, an early historian of Woodford County wrote:\n<blockquote>\nThere were a few Indians in the county at the time of settlement by the whites, but the two races did not come into conflict to any extent. The advancing wave of civilization seemed to follow up the retreating wave of barbarism. The first settlers encountered a few Indians...and in 1832 were involved to some extent in the [[Black Hawk War]], but the active operations were further north than Woodford County.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Woodford County: Giving a Brief Account of Its Settlement, Organization, Physical Characteristics and Progress|first=B.

The first [[government school|public school]] followed shortly thereafter.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 33.</ref> The first [[Sunday school]] was established in 1837 in the home of Parker Morse in [[Cazenovia Township, Woodford County, Illinois|Cazenovia]].<ref>Moore 1910, p. 94.</ref>\n\n===Pioneer life===\n[[File:Conner-prairie-log-cabin-interior.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Interior of a replica 1836 prairie log cabin, in [[Fishers, Indiana]]]]\nThe first settlers of Woodford County occupied crude [[log cabin]]s. Windows were covered with oiled papers; doors and floors were constructed of rough boards split from trees and held together with wooden pegs. Construction of the cabins was primitive, with the floor plan generally involving a single room heated with a fireplace.\n\nMeat was frequently roasted on a spit; cornbread was generally baked on the fireplace coals. A common staple of pioneer life was [[waffle]]s, baked from batter in a folding iron mold three or four feet long. Modern canning processes were unknown and the wintertime larder consisted primarily of bread and meat. Vegetables were consumed seasonally, with pumpkin, red peppers, corn, and venison dried for later use.\n\nClothing was made at home, generally of [[linen]] made from homegrown [[flax]]. In addition, other heavier compound fabrics known as \"[[linsey-woolsey|linsey]],\" made of linen or cotton with woolen filling, and \"jeans,\" made of an even heavier material and dyed brown with [[walnut]] bark, were also used.\n\nPrior to 1831 all preparation of [[wool]] had to be done by hand at home, with the raw fiber \"carded\" between pairs of thin, metal spiked boards about 4 inches wide and a foot long. The resulting rolls of wool were then spun into thread upon a [[spinning wheel]] and thereby prepared for the [[loom]].<ref>Radford 1877, pp. 29\u201334.</ref>\n\nA sexual division of labor was practiced, with women engaged in home manufactures and food preparation while men were occupied with agriculture, hunting, and construction. Since a great percentage of the land of Woodford County was tillable, farming was the principal occupation of the early settlers. Plowing was by means of wooden plows with iron shares; corn was planted by hand and covered using a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. [[Hay]], often using wild rather than cultivated grass, was cut with a [[scythe]] and taken up with rakes and [[pitchforks]].<ref>Radford 1877, pp. 40\u201345.</ref>\n\nWith the advent of timber milling in the area, frame houses became possible. Settlers cooperated in construction, helping one another raise houses and barns. The latter could be 30 feet in length and width with walls perhaps 16 feet high. \"It was heavy and dangerous work, and the raising of a large barn required the united energies of a whole community,\" one settler recalled. Other buildings commonly constructed included stables, corn-cribs, smokehouses, and ash-hoppers. Plank fences began to appear in the 1850s.<ref>Radford 1877, pp. 35\u201342.</ref>\n\nGovernance by the early settlers was not by secret ballot, but by voice vote.<ref>Radford 1877, p. 36</ref>\n\n===Antebellum years===\n[[File:Undergroundrailroadsmall2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Various routes of the underground railroad aiding the escape of slaves to Canada. One branch ran through Woodford County.]]\nBy 1850, Woodford County was well settled; county's population topped the 5,000 mark. Illinois settlers were overwhelmingly opposed to the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and with the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], popular discontent grew and opponents began to engage in acts of resistance, hiding escaped slaves seeking escape to [[Canada]]. One branch of the so-called [[underground railroad]] along which escaped slaves furtively avoided their potential captors ran directly through Woodford County.<ref name=Moore29>Moore 1910, p. 29.</ref>\n\nThe \"stations\" of the underground railroad were generally residences where escaping slaves could hide from their pursuers. These stations were located at convenient distances so that those escaping (and their \"conductor\" guides) could travel from one to the next in a single night.<ref>Radford 1877, p. 57</ref>\n\nThe journey was dangerous. Wanted posters offering rewards of $50, $100, and sometimes more for specific runaway slaves were placed by slaveowners, attracting bounty hunters. Moreover, those assisting escaping slaves were themselves violators of the Fugitive Slave Law, subject to prosecution and punishment.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 32</ref>\n\nLocal historian Roy L. Moore wrote:\n<blockquote>\nThere was bitter opposition to the enforcement of the fugitive slave law. This condition was not surprising, since the county had men who were strong opponents of slavery and likewise men who would make any sacrifice to have the institution stamped out. Over this branch of the underground road many a runaway slave passed on his way to freedom. There was such a strong sentiment against the [slave] traffic that conductors and stations were found in sufficient number to carry on the work successfully.<ref name=Moore29/></blockquote>\n\nChurch deacons named Mr. Dutton and Parker Morse were credited by Moore as leaders of the local anti-slavery effort. Despite the fact that these and other active conductors in the underground railroad were known to the community, popular sentiment against slavery was such that there was \"very little molestation for a long time\" in Woodford County. Only one instance of an arrest of a Woodford County conductor is recorded by Roy Moore in his 1910 history, and that ultimately resulted in the [[quash]]ing of the [[indictment]].<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\n===Early administrative structure===\n[[File:WOODFORDMAP.jpg|thumb|right|400px|This 1878 map shows the township structure of Woodford County.]]\nWhen it was first established in 1841, the county seat of Woodford County was placed in Versailles for a temporary two-year interval.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 103.</ref> Competition for the honor (and related business opportunities) was fierce leading up to the June 1843 decision of the county commissioners to tap [[Metamora, Illinois|Metamora]] (then known as Hanover) as the new seat.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 104.</ref> A county courthouse was begun in Metamora in 1844 and a county jail in March 1852.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\nIt was during the pre-Civil War years that Woodford County adopted townships \u2014 which was met with strong opposition. No fewer than four public elections were held between 1850 and 1854 before the township system gained a majority of votes.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 100</ref>\n\nFollowing the division of the county into townships in early 1855, the system of county government was likewise altered, with a county commission giving way to a board of supervisors. Early county officers, including the sheriff, coroner, school commissioner, surveyor, and treasurer were elected to two-year terms of office, later changed to four-year terms.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nOther claimants arose attempting to wrest the county seat from Metamora, including [[Eureka, Illinois|Eureka]], [[El Paso, Illinois|El Paso]], and [[Roanoke, Illinois|Roanoke]]. El Paso was nearly awarded the seat in 1867, when it sent a local attorney to make an offer of $30,000 to the town of Metamora to relinquish the county seat. A closely contested vote ended with the apparent result in favor of El Paso reversed by a bare 10 votes in a [[election recount|recount]].\n\nAnother vote in 1869 rejected an appeal to move the county seat to Eureka. A dubious recount in a third election held in November 1873 again overturned an apparent result to move the Woodford County seat to Roanoke. A fourth election in 1884, again proposing relocation to Roanoke, failed miserably. It was only in 1894 when a final election provided a decisive majority in favor of moving the county seat to Eureka that Metamora lost its status as county seat.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nAn impressive new courthouse building was quickly constructed in Eureka, cementing that town's status as legal and governmental center of Woodford County.\n\n===Civil War years===\n[[File:Battle of Corinth, Currier and Ives.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Fanciful rendition of the October 1862 Battle of Corinth, Mississippi by lithographers [[Currier and Ives]]. Woodford County members of the 47th Illinois Volunteers were part of the fighting, which resulted in combined losses of 828 killed and more than 3,800 wounded and missing.<ref>{{cite book|first=David J.|last=Eicher|title=The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War|url=https://archive.org/details/longestnightmili00eich|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/longestnightmili00eich/page/378 378]}}</ref>]]\nWoodford County's population continued to swell, standing at 13,281 when the [[American Civil War]] started in 1861. Support for the Union Cause was strong throughout the county; by war's end 1,643 county residents had enlisted in the Union forces \u2013 12.4% of the population.\n\nCalls for troops were translated into state quotas, which in Illinois was customarily apportioned to the various counties according to their population. Enlistment bonuses were paid. After 1862 when the number of volunteers ultimately failed to fulfill a state's enlistment quota, a [[conscription|draft]] was begun. Substitutes for those drafted could be sent, with prices paid by the draftee to his substitute generally ranging of $500 to $600, although prices of up to $1,000 were reportedly paid.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nWoodford County's volunteers \u2014 and later on conscripts \u2014 were dispersed among a wide range of units, making a universal summary of their wartime experience impossible. Some units composed largely of residents of Woodford County, including Company G of the [[17th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], mustered at Peoria May 25, 1861, and fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in [[Hardin County, Tennessee]] in April 1862. Several Woodford County men were among the 130 members of the 17th Infantry killed and wounded in the two-day battle. This unit also participated in the last phase of the 1863 [[Siege of Vicksburg]] in [[Warren County, Mississippi]], a protracted battle which led to the surrender of over 29,000 Confederate troops.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Frances H.|editor-last=Kennedy|title=The Civil War Battlefield Guide|edition=2nd|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.|year=1998|page=173}}</ref>\n\nAnother unit containing numerous Woodford County men was the [[47th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], especially Companies B and I. Mustered into service at Peoria on August 16, 1861, the unit lost 30 killed and 100 wounded in the [[Second Battle of Corinth|Battle of Corinth]], Mississippi, in October 1862. The unit also suffered casualties in a May 1863 charge during the [[Vicksburg Campaign]].

Serving under Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]], they participated in the initial phase of the Vicksburg Campaign. The 77th then participated in the [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi]] (May 1863), and taking the city. Disaster struck in April 1864 near [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], when the unit was isolated and crushed in a cavalry support operation at the [[Battle of Mansfield|Battle of Sabine Cross-roads]]. 176 men of the 77th Illinois were killed, wounded, or captured, leaving only 125 members of the regiment fit for duty. The unit was mustered out in July 1865, having participated in 16 battles.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 126</ref>\n\nWoodford County men served in numbers in Company A, [[86th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], suffering losses in Kentucky at the [[Battle of Perryville]] in October 1862, and participating in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]].

Its most noted alumnus is [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nEureka College traces its roots back to the summer of 1848, when a young collegian named A.S. Fisher appeared in Walnut Grove (original name of Eureka) and expressed his interest in conducting a school that would teach language, science, mathematics, and philosophy. Fisher was employed to teach school for 10 months, with a number of local worthies, including many active in the Church of Christ, guaranteeing payment of his salary. This school was formally launched in September 1848. Owing to the presence of a charismatic local religious leader, the Church of Christ showed great growth during this period, adding 100 adherents in 1848, with other supporters in neighboring counties. Demand grew for transformation of the school into a seminary with room and board for students from other localities, with instructional costs to be covered through collection of [[tuition]]. In September 1849, the school was rechristened Walnut Grove Seminary and relaunched with A.S. Fisher as principal, assisted by a young woman \"of superior ability and tact as a teacher.\" Fisher would ultimately spend 38 years associated with the college which would emerge.\n\nIn December 1849 the school was [[Incorporation (association)|incorporated]] as Walnut Grove Academy. Money was collected for an expansion of the facility and a new two story building constructed. The enterprise continued to expand and planning began for expansion of the academy into a college, with necessary buildings and a library. Appeals were made to the state Missionary Convention of the Church of Christ in 1851 and enthusiasm for establishment of a college within the church laity grew.<ref name=Dickinson19>{{cite book|first=Elmira J.|last=Dickinson|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofeurekac00eureuoft|title=A History of Eureka College: With Biographical Sketches and Reminiscences|location=St. Louis, Missouri|publisher=Christian Publishing Company|year=1894|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofeurekac00eureuoft/page/19 19]\u201328}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|543|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|528|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|15|sqmi}} (2.7%) is water.<ref name=CD/> Most of the area is [[prairie]] land, with some bluffs originally covered with timber.<ref>Radford 1877, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Eureka, Illinois]]\n|13|30|1.75\n|18|36|1.83\n|29|48|3.23\n|38|62|3.53\n|49|73|4.20\n|58|83|3.71\n|62|86|3.76\n|60|84|3.41\n|52|78|3.34\n|41|66|2.81\n|30|49|3.28\n|19|35|2.39\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=WX>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0388|title=Monthly Averages for Eureka IL|accessdate=January 27, 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Eureka have ranged from a low of {{convert|13|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|86|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-28|\u00b0F}} was recorded in February 1905 and a record high of {{convert|111|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1936.

It was located just south of the land of the [[Illinois Confederation|Illiniwek]]. The western portion of the county in particular shows extensive archeological evidence of supporting extensive First Nations populations.\n\nAt the time of the [[American Revolutionary War]], three competing American colonies \u2014 Massachusetts, Virginia, and Connecticut \u2014 claimed part of what is today the state of Illinois. The matter was solved in 1778 when Virginia amalgamated lands in the region into a massive county called Illinois, borrowing the name of a native people. [[Indiana Territory]] was formed in 1800 with [[William Henry Harrison]] as Governor; the future Illinois was part of this territory. It was not until 1809 that [[Illinois Territory]] was formally established as an official territory of the United States of America. Statehood followed in December 1818.\n\nThe first organized Anglo settlements in the future Woodford County region appeared in the 1820s. First settlement in the county came at [[Spring Bay, Illinois|Spring Bay]], with pioneers managing to select the same ground occupied by an ancient Indian <!---I am intentionally using this word for flavor---> burial site which ran north-and-south through the entire settlement. The location was chosen due to its proximity to the [[Illinois River]].<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 10\u201318</ref>\n\n[[File:MesquakieIndians1857.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Meskwaki (Fox) were pushed from their historic homelands to Iowa and [[Indian Territory]] (part of today's Oklahoma).]]\n\nIn the 1870s, an early historian of Woodford County wrote:\n<blockquote>\nThere were a few Indians in the county at the time of settlement by the whites, but the two races did not come into conflict to any extent. The advancing wave of civilization seemed to follow up the retreating wave of barbarism. The first settlers encountered a few Indians...and in 1832 were involved to some extent in the [[Black Hawk War]], but the active operations were further north than Woodford County.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of Woodford County: Giving a Brief Account of Its Settlement, Organization, Physical Characteristics and Progress|first=B.

Windows were covered with oiled papers; doors and floors were constructed of rough boards split from trees and held together with wooden pegs. Construction of the cabins was primitive, with the floor plan generally involving a single room heated with a fireplace.\n\nMeat was frequently roasted on a spit; cornbread was generally baked on the fireplace coals. A common staple of pioneer life was [[waffle]]s, baked from batter in a folding iron mold three or four feet long. Modern canning processes were unknown and the wintertime larder consisted primarily of bread and meat. Vegetables were consumed seasonally, with pumpkin, red peppers, corn, and venison dried for later use.\n\nClothing was made at home, generally of [[linen]] made from homegrown [[flax]]. In addition, other heavier compound fabrics known as \"[[linsey-woolsey|linsey]],\" made of linen or cotton with woolen filling, and \"jeans,\" made of an even heavier material and dyed brown with [[walnut]] bark, were also used.\n\nPrior to 1831 all preparation of [[wool]] had to be done by hand at home, with the raw fiber \"carded\" between pairs of thin, metal spiked boards about 4 inches wide and a foot long. The resulting rolls of wool were then spun into thread upon a [[spinning wheel]] and thereby prepared for the [[loom]].<ref>Radford 1877, pp. 29\u201334.</ref>\n\nA sexual division of labor was practiced, with women engaged in home manufactures and food preparation while men were occupied with agriculture, hunting, and construction. Since a great percentage of the land of Woodford County was tillable, farming was the principal occupation of the early settlers. Plowing was by means of wooden plows with iron shares; corn was planted by hand and covered using a [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. [[Hay]], often using wild rather than cultivated grass, was cut with a [[scythe]] and taken up with rakes and [[pitchforks]].<ref>Radford 1877, pp. 40\u201345.</ref>\n\nWith the advent of timber milling in the area, frame houses became possible. Settlers cooperated in construction, helping one another raise houses and barns. The latter could be 30 feet in length and width with walls perhaps 16 feet high. \"It was heavy and dangerous work, and the raising of a large barn required the united energies of a whole community,\" one settler recalled. Other buildings commonly constructed included stables, corn-cribs, smokehouses, and ash-hoppers. Plank fences began to appear in the 1850s.<ref>Radford 1877, pp. 35\u201342.</ref>\n\nGovernance by the early settlers was not by secret ballot, but by voice vote.<ref>Radford 1877, p. 36</ref>\n\n===Antebellum years===\n[[File:Undergroundrailroadsmall2.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Various routes of the underground railroad aiding the escape of slaves to Canada. One branch ran through Woodford County.]]\nBy 1850, Woodford County was well settled; county's population topped the 5,000 mark. Illinois settlers were overwhelmingly opposed to the institution of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], and with the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]], popular discontent grew and opponents began to engage in acts of resistance, hiding escaped slaves seeking escape to [[Canada]]. One branch of the so-called [[underground railroad]] along which escaped slaves furtively avoided their potential captors ran directly through Woodford County.<ref name=Moore29>Moore 1910, p. 29.</ref>\n\nThe \"stations\" of the underground railroad were generally residences where escaping slaves could hide from their pursuers. These stations were located at convenient distances so that those escaping (and their \"conductor\" guides) could travel from one to the next in a single night.<ref>Radford 1877, p. 57</ref>\n\nThe journey was dangerous. Wanted posters offering rewards of $50, $100, and sometimes more for specific runaway slaves were placed by slaveowners, attracting bounty hunters. Moreover, those assisting escaping slaves were themselves violators of the Fugitive Slave Law, subject to prosecution and punishment.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 32</ref>\n\nLocal historian Roy L. Moore wrote:\n<blockquote>\nThere was bitter opposition to the enforcement of the fugitive slave law. This condition was not surprising, since the county had men who were strong opponents of slavery and likewise men who would make any sacrifice to have the institution stamped out. Over this branch of the underground road many a runaway slave passed on his way to freedom. There was such a strong sentiment against the [slave] traffic that conductors and stations were found in sufficient number to carry on the work successfully.<ref name=Moore29/></blockquote>\n\nChurch deacons named Mr. Dutton and Parker Morse were credited by Moore as leaders of the local anti-slavery effort. Despite the fact that these and other active conductors in the underground railroad were known to the community, popular sentiment against slavery was such that there was \"very little molestation for a long time\" in Woodford County. Only one instance of an arrest of a Woodford County conductor is recorded by Roy Moore in his 1910 history, and that ultimately resulted in the [[quash]]ing of the [[indictment]].<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 32\u201333.</ref>\n\n===Early administrative structure===\n[[File:WOODFORDMAP.jpg|thumb|right|400px|This 1878 map shows the township structure of Woodford County.]]\nWhen it was first established in 1841, the county seat of Woodford County was placed in Versailles for a temporary two-year interval.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 103.</ref> Competition for the honor (and related business opportunities) was fierce leading up to the June 1843 decision of the county commissioners to tap [[Metamora, Illinois|Metamora]] (then known as Hanover) as the new seat.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 104.</ref> A county courthouse was begun in Metamora in 1844 and a county jail in March 1852.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 105\u2013106.</ref>\n\nIt was during the pre-Civil War years that Woodford County adopted townships \u2014 which was met with strong opposition. No fewer than four public elections were held between 1850 and 1854 before the township system gained a majority of votes.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 100</ref>\n\nFollowing the division of the county into townships in early 1855, the system of county government was likewise altered, with a county commission giving way to a board of supervisors. Early county officers, including the sheriff, coroner, school commissioner, surveyor, and treasurer were elected to two-year terms of office, later changed to four-year terms.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nOther claimants arose attempting to wrest the county seat from Metamora, including [[Eureka, Illinois|Eureka]], [[El Paso, Illinois|El Paso]], and [[Roanoke, Illinois|Roanoke]]. El Paso was nearly awarded the seat in 1867, when it sent a local attorney to make an offer of $30,000 to the town of Metamora to relinquish the county seat. A closely contested vote ended with the apparent result in favor of El Paso reversed by a bare 10 votes in a [[election recount|recount]].\n\nAnother vote in 1869 rejected an appeal to move the county seat to Eureka. A dubious recount in a third election held in November 1873 again overturned an apparent result to move the Woodford County seat to Roanoke. A fourth election in 1884, again proposing relocation to Roanoke, failed miserably. It was only in 1894 when a final election provided a decisive majority in favor of moving the county seat to Eureka that Metamora lost its status as county seat.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 107\u2013109.</ref>\n\nAn impressive new courthouse building was quickly constructed in Eureka, cementing that town's status as legal and governmental center of Woodford County.\n\n===Civil War years===\n[[File:Battle of Corinth, Currier and Ives.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Fanciful rendition of the October 1862 Battle of Corinth, Mississippi by lithographers [[Currier and Ives]].

Support for the Union Cause was strong throughout the county; by war's end 1,643 county residents had enlisted in the Union forces \u2013 12.4% of the population.\n\nCalls for troops were translated into state quotas, which in Illinois was customarily apportioned to the various counties according to their population. Enlistment bonuses were paid. After 1862 when the number of volunteers ultimately failed to fulfill a state's enlistment quota, a [[conscription|draft]] was begun. Substitutes for those drafted could be sent, with prices paid by the draftee to his substitute generally ranging of $500 to $600, although prices of up to $1,000 were reportedly paid.<ref>Moore 1910, pp. 122\u2013123</ref>\n\nWoodford County's volunteers \u2014 and later on conscripts \u2014 were dispersed among a wide range of units, making a universal summary of their wartime experience impossible. Some units composed largely of residents of Woodford County, including Company G of the [[17th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], mustered at Peoria May 25, 1861, and fought at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] in [[Hardin County, Tennessee]] in April 1862. Several Woodford County men were among the 130 members of the 17th Infantry killed and wounded in the two-day battle. This unit also participated in the last phase of the 1863 [[Siege of Vicksburg]] in [[Warren County, Mississippi]], a protracted battle which led to the surrender of over 29,000 Confederate troops.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Frances H.|editor-last=Kennedy|title=The Civil War Battlefield Guide|edition=2nd|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co.|year=1998|page=173}}</ref>\n\nAnother unit containing numerous Woodford County men was the [[47th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], especially Companies B and I. Mustered into service at Peoria on August 16, 1861, the unit lost 30 killed and 100 wounded in the [[Second Battle of Corinth|Battle of Corinth]], Mississippi, in October 1862. The unit also suffered casualties in a May 1863 charge during the [[Vicksburg Campaign]]. After the fall of Vicksburg in July 1863, the unit spent the duration guarding railroad lines, being discharged in October of that year.<ref>Moore 1910 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nThe [[77th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], Companies C, F and H, also had a substantial Woodford County contingent. Serving under Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]], they participated in the initial phase of the Vicksburg Campaign. The 77th then participated in the [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi]] (May 1863), and taking the city. Disaster struck in April 1864 near [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], when the unit was isolated and crushed in a cavalry support operation at the [[Battle of Mansfield|Battle of Sabine Cross-roads]]. 176 men of the 77th Illinois were killed, wounded, or captured, leaving only 125 members of the regiment fit for duty. The unit was mustered out in July 1865, having participated in 16 battles.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 126</ref>\n\nWoodford County men served in numbers in Company A, [[86th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], suffering losses in Kentucky at the [[Battle of Perryville]] in October 1862, and participating in [[Sherman's March to the Sea]]. Others were concentrated in Companies D and E of the [[108th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in which 205 of the 214 fatalities suffered by the regiment were due to disease rather than combat, 134 of whom died in February and March 1863 alone.<ref>Moore 1910, p. 127</ref><ref>[http://civilwar.illinoisgenweb.org/history/108.html \"108th Illinois Infantry Regiment History: Adjutant General's Report,\"] Susan Tortorelli, transcriptionist.

Its most noted alumnus is [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].\n\nEureka College traces its roots back to the summer of 1848, when a young collegian named A.S. Fisher appeared in Walnut Grove (original name of Eureka) and expressed his interest in conducting a school that would teach language, science, mathematics, and philosophy. Fisher was employed to teach school for 10 months, with a number of local worthies, including many active in the Church of Christ, guaranteeing payment of his salary. This school was formally launched in September 1848. Owing to the presence of a charismatic local religious leader, the Church of Christ showed great growth during this period, adding 100 adherents in 1848, with other supporters in neighboring counties. Demand grew for transformation of the school into a seminary with room and board for students from other localities, with instructional costs to be covered through collection of [[tuition]]. In September 1849, the school was rechristened Walnut Grove Seminary and relaunched with A.S. Fisher as principal, assisted by a young woman \"of superior ability and tact as a teacher.\" Fisher would ultimately spend 38 years associated with the college which would emerge.\n\nIn December 1849 the school was [[Incorporation (association)|incorporated]] as Walnut Grove Academy. Money was collected for an expansion of the facility and a new two story building constructed. The enterprise continued to expand and planning began for expansion of the academy into a college, with necessary buildings and a library. Appeals were made to the state Missionary Convention of the Church of Christ in 1851 and enthusiasm for establishment of a college within the church laity grew.<ref name=Dickinson19>{{cite book|first=Elmira J.|last=Dickinson|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofeurekac00eureuoft|title=A History of Eureka College: With Biographical Sketches and Reminiscences|location=St. Louis, Missouri|publisher=Christian Publishing Company|year=1894|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofeurekac00eureuoft/page/19 19]\u201328}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|543|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|528|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|15|sqmi}} (2.7%) is water.<ref name=CD/> Most of the area is [[prairie]] land, with some bluffs originally covered with timber.<ref>Radford 1877, p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Eureka, Illinois]]\n|13|30|1.75\n|18|36|1.83\n|29|48|3.23\n|38|62|3.53\n|49|73|4.20\n|58|83|3.71\n|62|86|3.76\n|60|84|3.41\n|52|78|3.34\n|41|66|2.81\n|30|49|3.28\n|19|35|2.39\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=WX>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0388|title=Monthly Averages for Eureka IL|accessdate=January 27, 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Eureka have ranged from a low of {{convert|13|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|86|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-28|\u00b0F}} was recorded in February 1905 and a record high of {{convert|111|\u00b0F}} was recorded in July 1936.
