Along with [[Weather Report]], [[The Headhunters]]  and [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], Return to Forever is often cited as one of the core groups of the jazz-fusion movement of the 1970s. Several musicians, including Clarke, [[Flora Purim]], [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Al Di Meola]], first came to prominence through their performances on Return to Forever albums.\n\nAfter playing on [[Miles Davis]]'s groundbreaking jazz-fusion albums ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' (1969) and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), Corea formed in 1970 an [[avant-garde jazz]] band called [[Circle (jazz band)|Circle]] with [[Dave Holland]], [[Anthony Braxton]] and [[Barry Altschul]]. However, in 1972, after having become a member of [[Scientology]], Corea decided that he wanted to better \"communicate\" with the audience. This essentially translated into his performing a more popularly accessible style of music, since avant-garde jazz enjoyed a relatively small audience.\n\n==First group (1972\u20131973)==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nThe first edition of Return to Forever performed primarily [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]-oriented music.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  This initial band consisted of singer and percussionist [[Flora Purim]], her husband [[Airto Moreira]] (both Brazilians) on [[drummer|drums]] and percussion, Corea's longtime musical co-worker [[Joe Farrell]] on [[saxophone]] and [[flute]], and the young [[Stanley Clarke]] on bass.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Within this first line-up in particular, Clarke played acoustic [[double bass]] in addition to [[bass guitar|electric bass]].  Corea's [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes electric piano]] formed the basis of this group's sound; he was yet to discover synthesizers, his trademark sound in the group's later years. Clarke and Farrell were given ample solo space themselves. While Purim's vocals lent some commercial appeal to the music, many of their compositions were also instrumental and somewhat experimental in nature.  The music was composed by Corea with the exception of the title track of the second album which was written by Stanley Clarke.  Lyrics were often written by Corea's friend Neville Potter, and were quite often Scientology-themed. Clarke himself became involved in Scientology through Corea, but eventually left the religion in the early 1980s.\n\nTheir first album, titled simply ''[[Return to Forever (album)|Return to Forever]]'', was recorded for [[ECM Records]] in 1972,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and was initially released only in [[Europe]].  This album featured Corea's now famous compositions \"Crystal Silence\" and \"La Fiesta\".  Shortly afterwards, Corea, Airto, Clarke and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] formed the band for [[Stan Getz]]'s album ''[[Captain Marvel (album)|Captain Marvel]]'' (1972), which featured Corea's compositions, including some from the first and second Return to Forever albums. Their second album, ''[[Light as a Feather]]'' (1973),<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> was released by [[Polydor]] and included the song \"[[Spain (composition)|Spain]]\", which also became quite well known.\n\n==Jazz rock era (1973\u20131976)==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Return to Forever 1974.jpg|thumb|270px|right|L to R: [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Chick Corea]] (drummer [[Lenny White]] not visible). Return to Forever performing in 1974 at [[Onondaga Community College]] in Syracuse, New York.]]\nAfter the second album, Farrell, Purim and Moreira left the group to form their own band, and guitarist [[Bill Connors]], drummer [[Steve Gadd]] and percussionist Mingo Lewis were added. However, Gadd was unwilling to tour with the band and risk his job as an in-demand session drummer. [[Lenny White]] (who had played with Corea in [[Miles Davis]]'s band) replaced Gadd and Lewis on drums and percussion, and the group's third album, ''[[Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy]]'' (1973), was then re-recorded (the first recording, featuring Gadd on drums, was never released and has since disappeared).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe nature of the group's music had by now completely changed into jazz-rock, and had evolved into a similar vein as to that the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], [[Weather Report]], and some [[progressive rock]] bands were also performing at the time. Their music was still relatively melodic, relying on strong themes, but the [[jazz]] element was by this time almost entirely absent,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> replaced by a more direct, rock oriented approach. Over-driven, distorted guitar had also become prominent in the band's new sound, and Clarke had by then switched almost completely to [[electric bass guitar]]. A replacement on vocals was not hired, and all the songs were now instrumentals. This change did not lead to a decrease in the band's commercial fortunes however, Return to Forever's [[jazz rock]] albums instead found their way onto [[Billboard 200|US pop album charts]].\n\nIn the September 1988 ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine interview with Chick Corea by Josef Woodward, Josef says (page 19), \"There is this general view ... that ... Miles [Davis] crystallized electric jazz fusion and that he sent his emissaries out.\" Chick responds, \"Nah, that's Disneyland. Miles is definitely a leader ... But there were other things that occurred that I thought were equally as important. What John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. ... John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair move.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/mclaughlin/art/sheppard.html|title=Pages of Fire: Articles: Notes by Jim Sheppard|website=Users.cs.cf.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nWhile their second jazz rock album, ''[[Where Have I Known You Before]]'' (1974) was similar in style to its immediate predecessor, Corea now played [[synthesizer]]s in addition to electric [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] (including [[piano]]), and Clarke's playing had evolved considerably- now using flange and fuzz-tone effects, and with his now signature style beginning to emerge.  After [[Bill Connors]] left the band to concentrate on his solo career, the group also hired new guitarists. Although [[Earl Klugh]] played guitar for some of the group's live performances, he was soon replaced by the then 19-year-old guitar prodigy [[Al Di Meola]], who had also played on the album recording sessions.\n\nTheir following album, ''[[No Mystery]]'' (1975), was recorded with the same line-up as ''Where Have I Known You Before'', but the style of music had become more varied. The first side of the record consisted primarily of jazz-funk, while the second side featured Corea's acoustic title track and a long composition with a strong [[Music of Spain|Spanish]] influence. On this and the following album, each member of the group composed at least one of the tracks. ''No Mystery'' went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group]].\n\nThe final album by this longest-lasting \"classic\" lineup of the group, which had by this time left Polydor for [[Columbia Records]], was ''[[Romantic Warrior]]'' (1976), the best selling of all Return to Forever's efforts,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> eventually reaching [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.  ''Romantic Warrior'' continued their experiments in the realms of jazz-rock and related musical genres, and was lauded by critics for both the technically demanding style of its compositions as well as for its accomplished musicianship.\n\nAfter the release of ''Romantic Warrior'' and Return to Forever's subsequent tour in support (as well as having in addition signed a multimillion-dollar contract with [[Sony Music|CBS]]), Corea shocked Clarke by deciding to change the lineup of the group and to not include either White or Di Meola.<ref name=\"religio.de\">{{cite web|url=http://www.religio.de/publik/arsreview/150996.html|title=Alt.religion.scientology Week in Review|website=Religio.de}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, this lineup did a short reunion tour of the U.S. and Japan, but did not record a new album, and rather recorded only one track that was issued on Corea's 1982 ''[[Touchstone (album)|Touchstone]]'' album entitled \"Compadres\". The repertoire for the tour included some new material by Corea, including one piece titled \"Overture\" that was later recorded by the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]] for the live various artists double album ''[[GRP Super Live in Concert]]'' (1992),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/grp-super-live-in-concert-mw0000195409|title=GRP Super Live in Concert - Various Artists &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> and another titled \"The Phantom\" that Di Meola later recorded on his album ''[[Kiss My Axe]]'' (1991).\n\n==Final album (1977)==\nThe final incarnation of Return to Forever featured Corea, Clarke and Joe Farrell as well as a four-piece horn section and Corea's wife [[Gayle Moran]] on vocals, but recorded only one studio album, ''[[Musicmagic]]'' (1977).\n\nIn 1978, after issuing a live album of the tour titled ''[[Live (Return to Forever album)|Return to Forever Live: The Complete Concert]]''<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (a four-LP set, also released in edited form as a single LP and later as a double CD), Chick Corea officially disbanded the group.<ref>''Jazz Rock - A History'', Stuart Nicholson, Schirmer Books, N.Y., 1998, p.375</ref>\n\n==Reunion (2008)==\nThe classic Return to Forever line-up of Corea, Clarke, White, and Di Meola reunited for a tour of the United States and Europe that began in the summer of 2008. A special Return to Forever anthology box-set, featuring remixed and digitally remastered tracks from the albums ''Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy'', ''Where Have I Known You Before'', ''No Mystery'', and ''Romantic Warrior'', was released to coincide with the tour.<ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/news/13376.html ''Return to Forever reunites for 2008 trek''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228151353/http://www.livedaily.com/news/13376.html |date=December 28, 2007 }}</ref>  To date, no new material from the group has been announced.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jim|first=Abbott|title=Concert review: Return to Forever IV at House of Blues|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2011/09/concert-review-return-to-forever-iv-at-house-of-blues.html|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=December 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926010108/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2011/09/concert-review-return-to-forever-iv-at-house-of-blues.html|archivedate=September 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==2011 tour==\nCorea, Clarke and White did an acoustic tour in 2009 and released a live CD in 2011 titled ''[[Forever (Corea, Clake & White album)|Forever]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Corea-Clarke-White-Forever/release/3559916|title=Corea*, Clarke* & White* - Forever|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>  It included guest appearances from Bill Connors, [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]].\n\nFrom February 2011, the group commenced a world tour in Australia.

Along with [[Weather Report]], [[The Headhunters]]  and [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], Return to Forever is often cited as one of the core groups of the jazz-fusion movement of the 1970s. Several musicians, including Clarke, [[Flora Purim]], [[Airto Moreira]] and [[Al Di Meola]], first came to prominence through their performances on Return to Forever albums.\n\nAfter playing on [[Miles Davis]]'s groundbreaking jazz-fusion albums ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' (1969) and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), Corea formed in 1970 an [[avant-garde jazz]] band called [[Circle (jazz band)|Circle]] with [[Dave Holland]], [[Anthony Braxton]] and [[Barry Altschul]]. However, in 1972, after having become a member of [[Scientology]], Corea decided that he wanted to better \"communicate\" with the audience. This essentially translated into his performing a more popularly accessible style of music, since avant-garde jazz enjoyed a relatively small audience.\n\n==First group (1972\u20131973)==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nThe first edition of Return to Forever performed primarily [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]-oriented music.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  This initial band consisted of singer and percussionist [[Flora Purim]], her husband [[Airto Moreira]] (both Brazilians) on [[drummer|drums]] and percussion, Corea's longtime musical co-worker [[Joe Farrell]] on [[saxophone]] and [[flute]], and the young [[Stanley Clarke]] on bass.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Within this first line-up in particular, Clarke played acoustic [[double bass]] in addition to [[bass guitar|electric bass]].  Corea's [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes electric piano]] formed the basis of this group's sound; he was yet to discover synthesizers, his trademark sound in the group's later years. Clarke and Farrell were given ample solo space themselves. While Purim's vocals lent some commercial appeal to the music, many of their compositions were also instrumental and somewhat experimental in nature.  The music was composed by Corea with the exception of the title track of the second album which was written by Stanley Clarke.  Lyrics were often written by Corea's friend Neville Potter, and were quite often Scientology-themed. Clarke himself became involved in Scientology through Corea, but eventually left the religion in the early 1980s.\n\nTheir first album, titled simply ''[[Return to Forever (album)|Return to Forever]]'', was recorded for [[ECM Records]] in 1972,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and was initially released only in [[Europe]].  This album featured Corea's now famous compositions \"Crystal Silence\" and \"La Fiesta\".  Shortly afterwards, Corea, Airto, Clarke and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] formed the band for [[Stan Getz]]'s album ''[[Captain Marvel (album)|Captain Marvel]]'' (1972), which featured Corea's compositions, including some from the first and second Return to Forever albums. Their second album, ''[[Light as a Feather]]'' (1973),<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> was released by [[Polydor]] and included the song \"[[Spain (composition)|Spain]]\", which also became quite well known.\n\n==Jazz rock era (1973\u20131976)==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Return to Forever 1974.jpg|thumb|270px|right|L to R: [[Stanley Clarke]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[Chick Corea]] (drummer [[Lenny White]] not visible). Return to Forever performing in 1974 at [[Onondaga Community College]] in Syracuse, New York.]]\nAfter the second album, Farrell, Purim and Moreira left the group to form their own band, and guitarist [[Bill Connors]], drummer [[Steve Gadd]] and percussionist Mingo Lewis were added. However, Gadd was unwilling to tour with the band and risk his job as an in-demand session drummer. [[Lenny White]] (who had played with Corea in [[Miles Davis]]'s band) replaced Gadd and Lewis on drums and percussion, and the group's third album, ''[[Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy]]'' (1973), was then re-recorded (the first recording, featuring Gadd on drums, was never released and has since disappeared).<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nThe nature of the group's music had by now completely changed into jazz-rock, and had evolved into a similar vein as to that the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], [[Weather Report]], and some [[progressive rock]] bands were also performing at the time. Their music was still relatively melodic, relying on strong themes, but the [[jazz]] element was by this time almost entirely absent,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> replaced by a more direct, rock oriented approach. Over-driven, distorted guitar had also become prominent in the band's new sound, and Clarke had by then switched almost completely to [[electric bass guitar]]. A replacement on vocals was not hired, and all the songs were now instrumentals. This change did not lead to a decrease in the band's commercial fortunes however, Return to Forever's [[jazz rock]] albums instead found their way onto [[Billboard 200|US pop album charts]].\n\nIn the September 1988 ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine interview with Chick Corea by Josef Woodward, Josef says (page 19), \"There is this general view ... that ... Miles [Davis] crystallized electric jazz fusion and that he sent his emissaries out.\" Chick responds, \"Nah, that's Disneyland. Miles is definitely a leader ... But there were other things that occurred that I thought were equally as important. What John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. ... John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair move.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/mclaughlin/art/sheppard.html|title=Pages of Fire: Articles: Notes by Jim Sheppard|website=Users.cs.cf.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nWhile their second jazz rock album, ''[[Where Have I Known You Before]]'' (1974) was similar in style to its immediate predecessor, Corea now played [[synthesizer]]s in addition to electric [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] (including [[piano]]), and Clarke's playing had evolved considerably- now using flange and fuzz-tone effects, and with his now signature style beginning to emerge.  After [[Bill Connors]] left the band to concentrate on his solo career, the group also hired new guitarists. Although [[Earl Klugh]] played guitar for some of the group's live performances, he was soon replaced by the then 19-year-old guitar prodigy [[Al Di Meola]], who had also played on the album recording sessions.\n\nTheir following album, ''[[No Mystery]]'' (1975), was recorded with the same line-up as ''Where Have I Known You Before'', but the style of music had become more varied. The first side of the record consisted primarily of jazz-funk, while the second side featured Corea's acoustic title track and a long composition with a strong [[Music of Spain|Spanish]] influence. On this and the following album, each member of the group composed at least one of the tracks. ''No Mystery'' went on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group]].\n\nThe final album by this longest-lasting \"classic\" lineup of the group, which had by this time left Polydor for [[Columbia Records]], was ''[[Romantic Warrior]]'' (1976), the best selling of all Return to Forever's efforts,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> eventually reaching [[Music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status.  ''Romantic Warrior'' continued their experiments in the realms of jazz-rock and related musical genres, and was lauded by critics for both the technically demanding style of its compositions as well as for its accomplished musicianship.\n\nAfter the release of ''Romantic Warrior'' and Return to Forever's subsequent tour in support (as well as having in addition signed a multimillion-dollar contract with [[Sony Music|CBS]]), Corea shocked Clarke by deciding to change the lineup of the group and to not include either White or Di Meola.<ref name=\"religio.de\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.religio.de/publik/arsreview/150996.html|title=Alt.religion.scientology Week in Review|website=Religio.de}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, this lineup did a short reunion tour of the U.S. and Japan, but did not record a new album, and rather recorded only one track that was issued on Corea's 1982 ''[[Touchstone (album)|Touchstone]]'' album entitled \"Compadres\". The repertoire for the tour included some new material by Corea, including one piece titled \"Overture\" that was later recorded by the [[Chick Corea Elektric Band]] for the live various artists double album ''[[GRP Super Live in Concert]]'' (1992),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/grp-super-live-in-concert-mw0000195409|title=GRP Super Live in Concert - Various Artists &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> and another titled \"The Phantom\" that Di Meola later recorded on his album ''[[Kiss My Axe]]'' (1991).\n\n==Final album (1977)==\nThe final incarnation of Return to Forever featured Corea, Clarke and Joe Farrell as well as a four-piece horn section and Corea's wife [[Gayle Moran]] on vocals, but recorded only one studio album, ''[[Musicmagic]]'' (1977).\n\nIn 1978, after issuing a live album of the tour titled ''[[Live (Return to Forever album)|Return to Forever Live: The Complete Concert]]''<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> (a four-LP set, also released in edited form as a single LP and later as a double CD), Chick Corea officially disbanded the group.<ref>''Jazz Rock - A History'', Stuart Nicholson, Schirmer Books, N.Y., 1998, p.375</ref>\n\n==Reunion (2008)==\nThe classic Return to Forever line-up of Corea, Clarke, White, and Di Meola reunited for a tour of the United States and Europe that began in the summer of 2008. A special Return to Forever anthology box-set, featuring remixed and digitally remastered tracks from the albums ''Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy'', ''Where Have I Known You Before'', ''No Mystery'', and ''Romantic Warrior'', was released to coincide with the tour.<ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/news/13376.html ''Return to Forever reunites for 2008 trek''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228151353/http://www.livedaily.com/news/13376.html |date=December 28, 2007 }}</ref>  To date, no new material from the group has been announced.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jim|first=Abbott|title=Concert review: Return to Forever IV at House of Blues|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2011/09/concert-review-return-to-forever-iv-at-house-of-blues.html|newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=December 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926010108/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2011/09/concert-review-return-to-forever-iv-at-house-of-blues.html|archivedate=September 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==2011 tour==\nCorea, Clarke and White did an acoustic tour in 2009 and released a live CD in 2011 titled ''[[Forever (Corea, Clake & White album)|Forever]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Corea-Clarke-White-Forever/release/3559916|title=Corea*, Clarke* & White* - Forever|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>  It included guest appearances from Bill Connors, [[Chaka Khan]] and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]].\n\nFrom February 2011, the group commenced a world tour in Australia.

It is thus an [[extracorporeal]] therapy.\n\nThe apheresis machine was invented by American medical technologist Herb Cullis in 1972.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Did you know? 10 Historical Facts about Blood Transfusion\n| first = | last = \n| website = \n| date = \n| accessdate = 2019-01-23\n| url = https://www.nzblood.co.nz/news/2015/did-you-know-10-historical-facts-about-blood-transfusion/\n| language =  \n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nOne of the uses of apheresis is for collecting stem cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official CPC Certification Study Guide|last=Katherine|first=Abel|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=128}}</ref> \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Method ==\n\nDepending on the substance that is being removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.  The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as 'Double Reds' or 'Double Red Cell Apheresis.'<ref>[http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm dtm double red cell<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705090407/http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Plateletpheresis]] (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) \u2013 [[platelet|blood platelets]]. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.\n* [[Leukapheresis]] \u2013 [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of [[Granulocyte|PMN]]s, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed.  There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte infusion.  The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Since the \"buffy coat\" layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection.  Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes).  Irradiation does not affect PMN function.  Since there is usually a small amount of RBCs collected, ABO compatibility should be employed when feasible.\n* Stem cell harvesting \u2013 circulating [[bone marrow]] cells are harvested to use in [[bone marrow transplantation]].\n\n==== Donor safety ====\n\n* Single use kits \u2013 Apheresis is done using single-use kits, so there is no risk of infection from blood-contaminated tubing or centrifuge.\n* Immune system effects \u2013 \"the immediate decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and serum immunoglobulin concentrations are of slight to moderate degree and are without known adverse effects. Less information is available regarding long-term alterations of the immune system\"<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jca.2920020112 |title=Apheresis donor safety \u2013 changes in humoral and cellular immunity |year=1984 |last1=Strauss |first1=Ronald G. |journal=Journal of Clinical Apheresis |volume=2 |pages=68\u201380 |pmid=6536660 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===== Kit problems =====\n\nTwo apheresis kit recalls were:\n* Baxter Healthcare Corporation (2005), in which \"pinhole leaks were observed at the two-omega end of the umbilicus (multilumen tubing), causing a blood leak.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/CbER/recalls/baxaphe013105.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117033956/https://www.fda.gov/cber/recalls/baxaphe013105.htm |archivedate=2009-01-17 }} \"Recall of Amicus Apheresis Kits, Baxter Healthcare Corporation\", US FDA, Jan 31 2005</ref>\n* Fenwal Incorporated (2007), in which there were \"two instances where the anticoagulant citrate dextrose (ACD) and saline lines were reversed in the assembly process.

If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the linguistic term|Apheresis (linguistics)}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|Pheresis|Phoresis}}\n{{More footnotes|article|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox interventions |\n  Name        = Apheresis |\n  Image       = Image:Apheresis.svg |\n  Caption     = Whole blood enters the centrifuge (1) and separates into plasma (2), leukocytes (3), and erythrocytes (4).

It is thus an [[extracorporeal]] therapy.\n\nThe apheresis machine was invented by American medical technologist Herb Cullis in 1972.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Did you know? 10 Historical Facts about Blood Transfusion\n| first = | last = \n| website = \n| date = \n| accessdate = 2019-01-23\n| url = https://www.nzblood.co.nz/news/2015/did-you-know-10-historical-facts-about-blood-transfusion/\n| language =  \n| quote = \n}}</ref>\n\nOne of the uses of apheresis is for collecting stem cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official CPC Certification Study Guide|last=Katherine|first=Abel|publisher=American Medical Association|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=128}}</ref> \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Method ==\n\nDepending on the substance that is being removed, different processes are employed in apheresis. If separation by [[density]] is required, [[centrifugation]] is the most common method. Other methods involve absorption onto beads coated with an absorbent material and filtration.\n\nThe centrifugation method can be divided into two basic categories:\n\n=== Continuous flow centrifugation ===\n\nContinuous flow centrifugation (CFC) historically required two [[venipunctures]] as the \"continuous\" means the blood is collected, spun, and returned simultaneously. Newer systems can use a single venipuncture. The main advantage of this system is the low extracorporeal volume (calculated by volume of the apheresis chamber, the donor's [[hematocrit]], and total blood volume of the donor) used in the procedure, which may be advantageous in the elderly and for children.\n\n=== Intermittent flow centrifugation ===\n\nIntermittent flow centrifugation works in cycles, taking blood, spinning/processing it and then giving back the unused parts to the donor in a [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]]. The main advantage is a single venipuncture site. To stop the blood from [[Coagulation|coagulating]], [[anticoagulant]] is automatically mixed with the blood as it is pumped from the body into the apheresis machine.\n\n=== Centrifugation variables ===\n\nThe centrifugation process itself has four variables that can be controlled to selectively remove desired components. The first is spin speed and bowl diameter, the second is \"sit time\" in centrifuge, the third is solutes added, and the fourth is not as easily controllable: plasma volume and cellular content of the donor. The end product in most cases is the classic sedimented blood sample with the [[Red blood cells|RBC's]] at the bottom, the [[buffy coat]] of platelets and [[White blood cells|WBC's]] ([[lymphocytes]]/[[granulocytes]], [[Polymorphonuclear leukocytes|PMN's]], [[basophils]], [[eosinophils]]/[[monocytes]]) in the middle and the plasma on top.\n\n== Types ==\n\n[[Image:Blood donation needle.jpg|thumb|480px|Disinfect, insert the cannula, pull out the cannula, dress the wound. The blue pressure cuff is controlled by the platelet apheresis machine in newer models.]]\n\nThere are numerous types of apheresis.\n\n=== Donation ===\n\nBlood taken from a healthy donor can be separated into its component parts during [[blood donation]], where the needed component is collected and the \"unused\" components are returned to the donor. [[Fluid replacement]] is usually not needed in this type of collection.  There are large categories of component collections:\n\n* [[Plasmapheresis]] \u2013 [[blood plasma]]. Plasmapheresis is useful in collecting FFP (fresh frozen plasma) of a particular ABO group.  Commercial uses aside from FFP for this procedure include immunoglobulin products, plasma derivatives, and collection of rare WBC and RBC antibodies.\n* [[Erythrocytapheresis]] \u2013 [[red blood cells]].  Erythrocytapheresis is the separation of [[erythrocytes]] from whole blood.  It is most commonly accomplished using the method of centrifugal sedimentation.  This process is used for red blood cell diseases such as sickle cell crises or severe malaria.  The automated red blood cell collection procedure for donating erythrocytes is referred to as 'Double Reds' or 'Double Red Cell Apheresis.'<ref>[http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm dtm double red cell<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705090407/http://www.cc.nih.gov/dtm/dtm_double_red_cell.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Plateletpheresis]] (thrombapheresis, thrombocytapheresis) \u2013 [[platelet|blood platelets]]. Plateletpheresis is the collection of platelets by apheresis while returning the RBCs, WBCs, and component plasma. The yield is normally the equivalent of between six and ten random platelet concentrates. Quality control demands the platelets from apheresis be equal to or greater than 3.0 \u00d7 10<sup>11</sup> in number and have a pH of equal to or greater than 6.2 in 90% of the products tested and must be used within five days.\n* [[Leukapheresis]] \u2013 [[leukocytes]] (white blood cells). Leukopheresis is the removal of [[Granulocyte|PMN]]s, basophils, eosinophils for transfusion into patients whose PMNs are ineffective or where traditional therapy has failed.  There is limited data to suggest the benefit of granulocyte infusion.  The complications of this procedure are the difficulty in collection and short shelf life (24 hours at 20 to 24&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Since the \"buffy coat\" layer sits directly atop the RBC layer, HES, a sedimenting agent, is employed to improve yield while minimizing RBC collection.  Quality control demands the resultant concentrate be 1.0 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> granulocytes in 75% of the units tested and that the product be irradiated to avoid graft-versus-host disease (inactivate lymphocytes).  Irradiation does not affect PMN function.  Since there is usually a small amount of RBCs collected, ABO compatibility should be employed when feasible.\n* Stem cell harvesting \u2013 circulating [[bone marrow]] cells are harvested to use in [[bone marrow transplantation]].\n\n==== Donor safety ====\n\n* Single use kits \u2013 Apheresis is done using single-use kits, so there is no risk of infection from blood-contaminated tubing or centrifuge.\n* Immune system effects \u2013 \"the immediate decreases in blood lymphocyte counts and serum immunoglobulin concentrations are of slight to moderate degree and are without known adverse effects.

That fluid must be replaced to keep correct intravascular volume. The fluid replaced is different at different institutions. If a [[Volume expander#Types|crystalloid]] like [[normal saline]] (NS) is used, the infusion amount should be triple what is removed as the 3:1 ratio of normal saline for plasma is needed to keep up [[oncotic pressure]]. Some institutions use [[normal serum albumin]], but it is costly and can be difficult to find. Some advocate using [[fresh frozen plasma]] (FFP) or a similar blood product, but there are dangers including citrate toxicity (from the anticoagulant), [[ABO incompatibility]], [[infection]], and cellular [[antigen]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Leukoreduction]]\n* [[Plasmapheresis]]\n* [[Venipuncture]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/red_cells.html NIH]\n* [http://www.apheresis.org American Society for Apheresis]\n* [http://stemcellthailand.org/pheresis-blood-platelet-donation-apheresis-hemapheresis Apheresis in Blood Platelet Donation]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408114722/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBAPHER.html WebPath] Apheresis page.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041205170749/http://medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/TUTORIAL/BLDBANK/BBPROC.html WebPath] Blood Donation and Processing\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103014400/http://www.thebloodconnection.org/blood_products.aspx#platelets Donating Platelet Apheresis: Facts and the FAQ]\n\n{{transfusion medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Hematology]]\n[[Category:Medical treatments]]\n[[Category:Nephrology procedures]]\n[[Category:Transfusion medicine]]\n", "name_user": "Mikael H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDiseases and disorders:WOrding", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apheresis"}
