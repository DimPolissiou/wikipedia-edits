Missionary activity had considerable social, cultural and political ramifications while the acceptance of Christianity marked a departure from the tradition religion of the Kuki peoples as well as both the Kuki peoples' ancestral customs and traditions. The spread of English education introduced the Kuki people to the \"modern era\". William Pettigrew, the first foreign missionary, came to Manipur on 6 February 1894 and was sponsored by the [[American Baptist Church|American Baptist Mission Union]]. He, together with Dr. Crozier, worked together in the North and the Northeast of Manipur.

During a period of religious unrest in the town, theological tensions within [[Anglicanism]] between [[High church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Low church]] Anglicans were inflamed by what the latter group saw as the church's \"idolatrous\" Roman Catholic-style fittings\u2014in particular, a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] which was seized upon by opponents as an example of a reversion to Catholic-style worship in the [[Church of England]].  The \"Worthing Madonna\" dispute<ref name=\"Hare158\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=158.}}</ref> delayed the consecration of the church by several years.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade C for its architectural and historical importance, and the adjacent [[vestry]] and [[vicarage]] are listed separately at Grade II.\n\n==History==\nWorthing experienced fitful but often rapid growth throughout the 19th century after it became established as a town and seaside resort at the start of the 19th century.  Between 1801, two years before an [[Act of Parliament]] gave it the status of a town, and 1881, the population increased from about 2,000 to 14,000.<ref name=\"WAPH-Intro\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=Introduction.}}</ref><ref name=\"VOB-Worthing\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056524&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Worthing through time: Population Statistics: Total Population|year=2009|work=Vision of Britain website|publisher=[[Great Britain Historical GIS]]|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>  The era coincided with a revival in Anglican Christian worship: this was especially marked in [[Brighton]], Worthing's larger and more illustrious rival resort further along the Sussex coast, whose vicar [[Arthur Wagner]] funded and built many churches across the town.<ref name=\"EncB150\">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=\u00a7150.}}</ref>\n\nSussex was a religiously conservative county,<ref name=\"Hare60\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=60.}}</ref> and by the middle of the 19th century\u2014after the [[Catholic Emancipation]]\u2014serious disputes arose between traditionalist [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Anglicans, who regarded Catholic-style worship with suspicion, and the newly emerging [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] practices of Anglicans who were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]] (Tractarianism) of practitioners such as [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] and [[John Keble]].  The disagreements were again focused on Brighton,<ref name=\"EncB150\"/> but ill-feeling had spread to Worthing by the 1850s.  The town had a long tradition of riotous bonfire parades,<ref name=\"Hare52\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=52.}}</ref> and the \"Bonfire Boys\" started to focus their attention on Roman Catholics and Tractarians.

George Wedd, the owner of Charmandean House (a large [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house, now demolished),<ref name=\"MEWH46\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|p=46.}}</ref> was the main promoter of the scheme, and he found and bought some land in 1881 in an area which had seen recent residential development.<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\"/>  He also provided much of the funding for the construction, and [[Arthur Blomfield]] was contracted to design and build the church.  Preparation work started in 1882, the [[foundation stone]] was laid on 13 June 1885,<ref name=\"Greenwood1\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=1.}}</ref> and building work continued until 1886.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"WAOC54\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1985|loc=\u00a754}}</ref><ref name=\"WAPH151\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=\u00a7151.}}</ref>  Disagreements had already begun in November 1882, when the Worthing Town Commissioners sought permission to take territory from the parishes of several other churches in the town\u2014[[St. Mary's Church, Broadwater|St Mary's]], [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]] and Holy Trinity\u2014and form a new parish for St Andrew's Church.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Account32\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=32.}}</ref>  The clergy of the three churches opposed the proposal, arguing that their parishes were not \"large in extent and population, and insufficiently supplied with ministers and church accommodation\" as stipulated in the terms of the proposal.<ref name=\"Account32\"/>  It was argued that the site for St Andrew's Church was in the part of Worthing where the highest concentration of churches already existed: it would be the ninth Anglican church or mission hall in an area of {{convert|1|sqmi|sqkm}} encompassing central Worthing and [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]].<ref name=\"Account35\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=35.}}</ref>\n\nAs debate over this issue continued, more controversy erupted when in late 1886, as the church was being completed, it was discovered that a [[Lady chapel]] with a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]] had been included in the design.<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  To opponents of Anglo-Catholic worship, the representation in statue form of [[Jesus]]'s mother symbolised a return to the practices that the [[English Reformation]] had sought to end: it was claimed that [[idolatry]] and [[ritualism]] would be encouraged and Anglican churches would start to be decorated in the same manner as [[Roman Catholic]] places of worship.<ref name=\"Hare158\u2013159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|pp=158\u2013159.}}</ref>  The statue was soon referred to as the \"Worthing [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]\",<ref name=\"Hare158\"/><ref name=\"Account36\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=36.}}</ref> and became the focus of the ill-feeling around the church: one writer, chronicling the day of the consecration, started his account by referring to the \"peculiarly obnoxious Madonna\".<ref name=\"Account36\"/>\n\nThe consecration of the church, set for 1886, was postponed because of the strength of feeling in Worthing (and possibly in an attempt to prevent religious riots similar to those of the [[Skeleton Army]] two years previously).<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  The vicar of the Holy Trinity, other Worthing vicars, a local army [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] and the local [[magistrate]] were among a group of people who presented a petition to the [[Bishop of Chichester]] asking for the consecration to be stopped,<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Hare159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=159.}}</ref> arguing that the Madonna was \"at variance with the spirit and teaching of our Reformed church\".<ref name=\"Hare159\"/>  The Bishop, [[Richard Durnford]], held out against the protests, cautioning against the disrespectful use of the term \"Madonna\" and recommending that the group's grievances be taken to a higher court.<ref name=\"Hare160\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=160.}}</ref>  The consecration was eventually scheduled for 1888, two years after the church was finished; a final appeal to the [[House of Lords]] was unsuccessful,<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/> and the ceremony was held on 1 August 1888 by Bishop Durnford.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/><ref name=\"Account36\"/>  The first public service had been held on 27 May 1888.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nThe ill-feeling between Anglo-Catholics and their opponents soon died down, apart from some brief controversy in the mid-1890s over some fittings in [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]].<ref name=\"Hare160\"/>  After [[World War I]], there was a further brief dispute over the design of a war memorial in St Andrew's Church, which took the form of a [[shrine]] depicting the [[Crucifixion]] designed by Charles Eamer Kempe.  It was installed in 1919.  The names of local war dead were inscribed on the a panel on the chancel wall.<ref name=\"MEWH138\u2013139\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|pp=138\u2013139.}}</ref>\n\nSince its opening, the exterior of St Andrew's Church has experienced little change, and there have been only gradual increases in the decoration of the interior.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>  A new marble altar was placed in the chancel in 1902, one year after a wooden altar was added in the Lady chapel.  A [[rood screen]], carved in oak, and walnut-wood [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]] were added in 1905 (the latter were replaced by oak stalls in 1932).  Another altar, this time in the south transept, was installed in 1922.  The red [[alabaster]] piece was designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]].  A green marble altar was donated to the church in 1950 and was placed in the north transept.<ref name=\"Greenwood3\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=3.}}</ref>  Work undertaken in the 1970s included the painting of the internal brickwork and the creation of a glass-walled memorial to a former vicar.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nLike many 19th-century churches in Worthing, St Andrew's established a mission hall as the population of Anglican worshippers grew.

Scenes portrayed include the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]], the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[John the Evangelist]], [[John the Baptist]] and several other saints, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] and the [[Apostle (Christian)|Twelve Apostles]].<ref name=\"Greenwood5\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=5.}}</ref>  In addition, one of Kempe's earliest known windows\u2014designed for All Souls Church in Brighton and depicting [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Martha]] and the [[Four Evangelists]]\u2014was retrieved from that church when it was demolished in the 1960s,<ref name=\"PoW6\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|2004|p=6.}}</ref> and was installed in the sacristy.<ref name=\"Greenwood5\"/>\n\n==Vestry and vicarage==\nThe former vestry was added to the church in a matching style in 1908\u20139 by T.R.

During a period of religious unrest in the town, theological tensions within [[Anglicanism]] between [[High church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholics]] and [[Low church]] Anglicans were inflamed by what the latter group saw as the church's \"idolatrous\" Roman Catholic-style fittings\u2014in particular, a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] which was seized upon by opponents as an example of a reversion to Catholic-style worship in the [[Church of England]].  The \"Worthing Madonna\" dispute<ref name=\"Hare158\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=158.}}</ref> delayed the consecration of the church by several years.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the building at Grade C for its architectural and historical importance, and the adjacent [[vestry]] and [[vicarage]] are listed separately at Grade II.\n\n==History==\nWorthing experienced fitful but often rapid growth throughout the 19th century after it became established as a town and seaside resort at the start of the 19th century.  Between 1801, two years before an [[Act of Parliament]] gave it the status of a town, and 1881, the population increased from about 2,000 to 14,000.<ref name=\"WAPH-Intro\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=Introduction.}}</ref><ref name=\"VOB-Worthing\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TOT_POP&u_id=10056524&c_id=10001043&add=N|title=Worthing through time: Population Statistics: Total Population|year=2009|work=Vision of Britain website|publisher=[[Great Britain Historical GIS]]|accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>  The era coincided with a revival in Anglican Christian worship: this was especially marked in [[Brighton]], Worthing's larger and more illustrious rival resort further along the Sussex coast, whose vicar [[Arthur Wagner]] funded and built many churches across the town.<ref name=\"EncB150\">{{Harvnb|Carder|1990|loc=\u00a7150.}}</ref>\n\nSussex was a religiously conservative county,<ref name=\"Hare60\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=60.}}</ref> and by the middle of the 19th century\u2014after the [[Catholic Emancipation]]\u2014serious disputes arose between traditionalist [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Anglicans, who regarded Catholic-style worship with suspicion, and the newly emerging [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] practices of Anglicans who were influenced by the [[Oxford Movement]] (Tractarianism) of practitioners such as [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]] and [[John Keble]].  The disagreements were again focused on Brighton,<ref name=\"EncB150\"/> but ill-feeling had spread to Worthing by the 1850s.  The town had a long tradition of riotous bonfire parades,<ref name=\"Hare52\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=52.}}</ref> and the \"Bonfire Boys\" started to focus their attention on Roman Catholics and Tractarians.

George Wedd, the owner of Charmandean House (a large [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] house, now demolished),<ref name=\"MEWH46\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|p=46.}}</ref> was the main promoter of the scheme, and he found and bought some land in 1881 in an area which had seen recent residential development.<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/><ref name=\"VCH18230\"/>  He also provided much of the funding for the construction, and [[Arthur Blomfield]] was contracted to design and build the church.  Preparation work started in 1882, the [[foundation stone]] was laid on 13 June 1885,<ref name=\"Greenwood1\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=1.}}</ref> and building work continued until 1886.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"WAOC54\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1985|loc=\u00a754}}</ref><ref name=\"WAPH151\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1977|loc=\u00a7151.}}</ref>  Disagreements had already begun in November 1882, when the Worthing Town Commissioners sought permission to take territory from the parishes of several other churches in the town\u2014[[St. Mary's Church, Broadwater|St Mary's]], [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]] and Holy Trinity\u2014and form a new parish for St Andrew's Church.<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Account32\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=32.}}</ref>  The clergy of the three churches opposed the proposal, arguing that their parishes were not \"large in extent and population, and insufficiently supplied with ministers and church accommodation\" as stipulated in the terms of the proposal.<ref name=\"Account32\"/>  It was argued that the site for St Andrew's Church was in the part of Worthing where the highest concentration of churches already existed: it would be the ninth Anglican church or mission hall in an area of {{convert|1|sqmi|sqkm}} encompassing central Worthing and [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]].<ref name=\"Account35\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=35.}}</ref>\n\nAs debate over this issue continued, more controversy erupted when in late 1886, as the church was being completed, it was discovered that a [[Lady chapel]] with a statue of the [[Virgin and Child]] had been included in the design.<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  To opponents of Anglo-Catholic worship, the representation in statue form of [[Jesus]]'s mother symbolised a return to the practices that the [[English Reformation]] had sought to end: it was claimed that [[idolatry]] and [[ritualism]] would be encouraged and Anglican churches would start to be decorated in the same manner as [[Roman Catholic]] places of worship.<ref name=\"Hare158\u2013159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|pp=158\u2013159.}}</ref>  The statue was soon referred to as the \"Worthing [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]]\",<ref name=\"Hare158\"/><ref name=\"Account36\">{{Harvnb|Anon.|1889|p=36.}}</ref> and became the focus of the ill-feeling around the church: one writer, chronicling the day of the consecration, started his account by referring to the \"peculiarly obnoxious Madonna\".<ref name=\"Account36\"/>\n\nThe consecration of the church, set for 1886, was postponed because of the strength of feeling in Worthing (and possibly in an attempt to prevent religious riots similar to those of the [[Skeleton Army]] two years previously).<ref name=\"Hare158\"/>  The vicar of the Holy Trinity, other Worthing vicars, a local army [[Major-General (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] and the local [[magistrate]] were among a group of people who presented a petition to the [[Bishop of Chichester]] asking for the consecration to be stopped,<ref name=\"VCH18230\"/><ref name=\"Hare159\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=159.}}</ref> arguing that the Madonna was \"at variance with the spirit and teaching of our Reformed church\".<ref name=\"Hare159\"/>  The Bishop, [[Richard Durnford]], held out against the protests, cautioning against the disrespectful use of the term \"Madonna\" and recommending that the group's grievances be taken to a higher court.<ref name=\"Hare160\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=160.}}</ref>  The consecration was eventually scheduled for 1888, two years after the church was finished; a final appeal to the [[House of Lords]] was unsuccessful,<ref name=\"MEWH48\"/> and the ceremony was held on 1 August 1888 by Bishop Durnford.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/><ref name=\"Account36\"/>  The first public service had been held on 27 May 1888.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nThe ill-feeling between Anglo-Catholics and their opponents soon died down, apart from some brief controversy in the mid-1890s over some fittings in [[Christ Church, Worthing|Christ Church]].<ref name=\"Hare160\"/>  After [[World War I]], there was a further brief dispute over the design of a war memorial in St Andrew's Church, which took the form of a [[shrine]] depicting the [[Crucifixion]] designed by Charles Eamer Kempe.  It was installed in 1919.  The names of local war dead were inscribed on the a panel on the chancel wall.<ref name=\"MEWH138\u2013139\">{{Harvnb|Elleray|1998|pp=138\u2013139.}}</ref>\n\nSince its opening, the exterior of St Andrew's Church has experienced little change, and there have been only gradual increases in the decoration of the interior.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>  A new marble altar was placed in the chancel in 1902, one year after a wooden altar was added in the Lady chapel.  A [[rood screen]], carved in oak, and walnut-wood [[Choir (architecture)|choir stalls]] were added in 1905 (the latter were replaced by oak stalls in 1932).  Another altar, this time in the south transept, was installed in 1922.  The red [[alabaster]] piece was designed by [[Charles Eamer Kempe]].  A green marble altar was donated to the church in 1950 and was placed in the north transept.<ref name=\"Greenwood3\">{{Harvnb|Greenwood|1988|p=3.}}</ref>  Work undertaken in the 1970s included the painting of the internal brickwork and the creation of a glass-walled memorial to a former vicar.<ref name=\"Greenwood1\"/>\n\nLike many 19th-century churches in Worthing, St Andrew's established a mission hall as the population of Anglican worshippers grew.

Discoveries as early as 1904 provide evidence that native peoples settled here <sup>[6]</sup>, burials, structural remains, and artifacts such as points, tools, and bones of discarded food <sup>[3]</sup>.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Port au Choix]] is located on the northwestern coast of the island of Newfoundland, the farthest eastern border of Canada. It protrudes from the island as a peninsula with another peninsula extending northeast from that. This unique geography provides a large amount of coastline for a small area making it excellent as a [[port city]].\n\n== History ==\nThe island of Newfoundland has an abundance of resources for [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples <sup>[10]</sup>. For thousands of years it was occupied by a variety of native people. Maritime Archaic Indians were the first people to occupy the island of Newfoundland. A Maritime Archaic Indian cemetery dates as far back as 4400 B.P. <sup>[4]</sup> was found in 1967 by [[James Tuck (archaeologist)|James Tuck]], of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], who excavated 56 graves, determined to be between 4400 and 3300 years old <sup>[3]</sup>. This discovery prompted Port au Choix to be designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic]] Site in 1970 <sup>[6]</sup>. No structural remains were found near the burial sites, leading archaeologists to assume the natives buried their dead far from their settlements <sup>[3]</sup>. In fact, there are no Maritime Archaic Indian dwelling sites yet discovered on Newfoundland <sup>[9]</sup>. Due to post-glacial sea level rise, there are potentially many Maritime Archaic Indian dwelling sites submerged in the ocean<sup>[9]</sup>. Sea level has risen approximately thirteen feet in the last 4400 years since the Port au Choix burial site was first used <sup>[13]</sup>.\n\nIn contrast, there have been many discoveries of [[Paleo-Eskimo|Dorset Paleo-Eskimo]] dwellings on Newfoundland, which have been radiocarbon dated to between 1990 and 1180 years B.P. <sup>[4]</sup>. After the Maritime Archaic Indians left the region, the Paleo-Eskimos began to expand their settlements further south into Newfoundland. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimo people relied heavily on maritime resources, especially seals, for subsistence <sup>[11]</sup>. The Dorset people occupied Port au Choix for approximately seven hundred years, constructing many dwellings. At the site of '''Phillip's Garden''', one of the richest archaeological sites on Port au Choix, there are 50 documented structural remains. It is thought these were wooden peaked roofed structures with hides over the top <sup>[8]</sup>.\n\nToday, these ruins are characterized by depressions in the ground as well as architectural elements of low walls, a central cooking area, and a platform to the rear of the house <sup>[8]</sup>. Excavation of these remains became known as the Port au Choix Archaeological Project, which began in 1984 and continues today <sup>[8]</sup>.\nIt is believed that the Dorset Paleo-Eskimos abandoned Port au Choix due to [[global warming]] of that time period, approximately 1200 B.P. <sup>[11]</sup>. This was a result of changing temperatures pushing the [[harp seal]]s away from Port au Choix. This was due to the changing food resources for harp seals. They were a crucial part of the Dorset diet <sup>[11]</sup>. After the departure of the Dorset Paleo-Eskimos, a group of people known as the Recent Indians moved into Port au Choix <sup>[14]</sup>. Little is known about this group. The Beothuk people had contact with European settlers as early as 1713. They, unfortunately, became extinct as a population by 1829. That ended the nearly five thousand years of native inhabitation of Port au Choix <sup>[10]</sup>.\n\n== Phillip\u2019s Garden==\nOne significant site of Dorset Paleo-Eskimo remains are located on the Port au Choix peninsula in the region known as '''Phillip's Garden'''. This archaeological dig has been divided into three sites, Phillip's Garden, Phillip's Garden East, and Phillip's Garden West. The Phillip's Garden sites are regarded as the most important discoveries in the Port au Choix area since the remains of structures were preserved from rising sea levels <sup>[8]</sup>. There have been discoveries of dwellings by Dorset Paleo-Eskimos dating back to approximately 2140 B.P. <big>[8]</big>. The first excavation of Phillip's Garden was [[William Wintemberg]] of the [[National Museum of Canada]] in 1929. At this time he discovered numerous sites of Newfoundland's Great North Peninsula, including Port au Choix. Phillip's Garden was the largest site found during the survey <sup>[6]</sup>.\n\nPhillip's Garden remained unexamined after its initial discovery by Wintemberg until 1949, when Elmer Harp Jr. began to excavate at Port au Choix and made many discoveries through the early 1960s. Harp, a distinguished archaeologist who specialized in the Arctic and Paleo-Eskimos, was the first to determine that some remains and artifacts discovered at Port au Choix were those of Paleo-Eskimos, not Indians <sup>[12]</sup>.\n\n== Artifacts ==\nA variety of tools, [[pottery]], and other artifacts have been discovered at Port au Choix. Along with human remains, artifacts were discovered in the burial sites. Tools such as woodworking implements were found in the graves. It is believed these were designed for building structures and watercraft <sup>[3]</sup>. \nPhillip's Garden produced a wealth of ancient tools used by its former inhabitants. Along with 50 house dwelling sites, thousands of individual artifacts have been discovered by excavators in the last half century <sup>[14]</sup>. Since both the Maritime Archaic Indians and Dorset Paleo-Eskimos were very dependent on the sea for sustenance [1], there is a lot of evidence showing evidence of seal hunting at this location <sup>[5]</sup>. Archaeologists M.A.P. Renouf and Trevor Bell studied the hunting and harvesting of harp seals by the Dorset Paleo-Eskimos at Phillip's Garden. They concluded that the Dorset people utilized the animals fully. Their meat was used for food, their fat for fuel, and their skin for making clothes and boots by the Dorset people <sup>[4]</sup>.\n\n== Management ==\nPort au Choix is a National Historic Site of Canada. The site is managed by a combination of native descendants, land owners, and Canada Parks staff as well as local community members <sup>[14]</sup>.\n\n== References ==\n# Renouf, M. A.

Discoveries as early as 1904 provide evidence that native peoples settled here <sup>[6]</sup>, burials, structural remains, and artifacts such as points, tools, and bones of discarded food <sup>[3]</sup>.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Port au Choix]] is located on the northwestern coast of the island of Newfoundland, the farthest eastern border of Canada. It protrudes from the island as a peninsula with another peninsula extending northeast from that. This unique geography provides a large amount of coastline for a small area making it excellent as a [[port city]].\n\n== History ==\nThe island of Newfoundland has an abundance of resources for [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples <sup>[10]</sup>. For thousands of years it was occupied by a variety of native people. Maritime Archaic Indians were the first people to occupy the island of Newfoundland. A Maritime Archaic Indian cemetery dates as far back as 4400 B.P. <sup>[4]</sup> was found in 1967 by [[James Tuck (archaeologist)|James Tuck]], of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], who excavated 56 graves, determined to be between 4400 and 3300 years old <sup>[3]</sup>. This discovery prompted Port au Choix to be designated a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic]] Site in 1970 <sup>[6]</sup>. No structural remains were found near the burial sites, leading archaeologists to assume the natives buried their dead far from their settlements <sup>[3]</sup>. In fact, there are no Maritime Archaic Indian dwelling sites yet discovered on Newfoundland <sup>[9]</sup>. Due to post-glacial sea level rise, there are potentially many Maritime Archaic Indian dwelling sites submerged in the ocean<sup>[9]</sup>. Sea level has risen approximately thirteen feet in the last 4400 years since the Port au Choix burial site was first used <sup>[13]</sup>.\n\nIn contrast, there have been many discoveries of [[Paleo-Eskimo|Dorset Paleo-Eskimo]] dwellings on Newfoundland, which have been radiocarbon dated to between 1990 and 1180 years B.P. <sup>[4]</sup>. After the Maritime Archaic Indians left the region, the Paleo-Eskimos began to expand their settlements further south into Newfoundland. The Dorset Paleo-Eskimo people relied heavily on maritime resources, especially seals, for subsistence <sup>[11]</sup>. The Dorset people occupied Port au Choix for approximately seven hundred years, constructing many dwellings. At the site of '''Phillip's Garden''', one of the richest archaeological sites on Port au Choix, there are 50 documented structural remains. It is thought these were wooden peaked roofed structures with hides over the top <sup>[8]</sup>.\n\nToday, these ruins are characterized by depressions in the ground as well as architectural elements of low walls, a central cooking area, and a platform to the rear of the house <sup>[8]</sup>.

The Posidonia Shale is considered to be the reference formation for the Lower Toarcian section.<ref>R\u00f6hl, H. J., & Schmid-R\u00f6hl, A. (2005).

[[Dormettingen]] shales have been calculated biochronologically and with isochron data, giving and approximate age of 183.0 million years old, being close to the [[Pliensbachian]] boundary based on the recent revisions of the Early Jurassic Subperiods.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>The Toarcian and the Pliensbachian are considered as strongly constrained in terms of chronology, although that doesn\u00b4t imply that all the formations labelled to one of the two periods have to be limited; for example Lithuanian [[Neringa Formation]] whose upper strata matches with the lowermost Toarcian (183.0).<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/> The rich Shale of the foreland area of the Swabian and Franconian Alb have been recovered as part of the Posidonia, with samples that expose an age between 183.0 to 181.1, thus recovering the Lower Toarcian strata. Although the east margin of the formation has yield strata with an age of 179.7 m.a, showing the presence of the depositional environment on Middle Toarcian times.<ref name=\"Acken2019\"/>\n\n== History ==\nThe Posidonia Shale has been a focus of scientific interest for the last 100 years. There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

It is the reference formation for this interval. The Posidonia Shale of [[Dotternhausen]] and [[Schesslitz]] is well dated on the basis of ammonite and microfossil biostratigraphy. The Lower Toarcian sections are subdivided into three ammonite biozones ([[Dactyloceras]] tenuicostatum, [[Harpoceras]] falciferum, and [[Hildoceras]] bifrons) and several subzones.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

Born in [[Venice]], the capital of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], he is regarded as one of the greatest [[Baroque composers]], and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental [[concerto]]s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty [[opera]]s. His best-known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]''.\n\nMany of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the ''[[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]'', a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi had worked there as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] for {{nowrap|1 1/2}} years and was employed there from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in [[Venice]], [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]]. After meeting the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Please help this child when you can!===\n[[File:Chiesa di San Giovanni in Bragora - Venezia.jpg|thumb|Church where Vivaldi was given the supplemental baptismal rites, [[San Giovanni in Bragora]], [[Castello, Venice|Sestiere di Castello]], Venice]]\n\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on 4 March 1678 in Venice,<ref name=\"TalbotGrove\" /> then the capital of the Venetian Republic. He was [[emergency baptism|baptized immediately after his birth]] at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though the reasons for the child's immediate baptism are not known for certain, it was done most likely due either to his poor health or to an [[earthquake]] that shook the city that day. In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 46.</ref> The ceremonies which had been omitted were supplied two months later.<ref name=autogenerated5>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M.

Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 37.</ref> Giovanni Battista, who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son. Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24, when he started working at the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0.<ref>Heller, p. 41</ref> Giovanni Battista was one of the founders of the ''Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia'', an association of musicians.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd., 1978), 36.</ref>\n\nThe president of the ''Sovvegno'' was [[Giovanni Legrenzi]], an early Baroque composer and the ''maestro di cappella'' at [[St Mark's Basilica]]. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedelt\u00e0 sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi\u2014the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.<ref>Heller, p. 40</ref>\n\nVivaldi's health was problematic. One of his symptoms, ''strettezza di petto'' (\"tightness of the chest\"), has been interpreted as a form of [[asthma]].<ref name=autogenerated5 /> This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing, or taking part in musical activities,<ref name=autogenerated5 /> although it did stop him from playing wind instruments. In 1693, at the age of fifteen, he began studying to become a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]].<ref>Landon, p. 16</ref> He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed ''il Prete Rosso'', \"The Red Priest\".<ref>Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1957), 16</ref> (''[[Wikt:rosso|Rosso]]'' is Italian for \"red\", and would have referred to the color of his hair, a family trait.)\n\nNot long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a dispensation from celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] most likely because of his ill health. Vivaldi said Mass as a priest only a few times, and appeared to have withdrawn from liturgical duties, though he remained a member of the priesthood. It is thought that this is also due to his habit of composing while performing mass. He may have remained committed to [[Catholicism]], though the entry in the Vienna death records for him reads, \"Antonio Vivaldi, Secular Priest\".<ref>Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'', translated by David Marinelli (AMADEUS PRESS, 1991)</ref> It is thought that he remained Catholic, though,{{Clarify|date=March 2020|reason=Why should constantly holding a rosary be thought of as evidence he had abandoned his Catholic faith?}} as in 1792, the [[Protestant]] composer [[Ernst Ludwig Gerber]], wrote of the aged Vivaldi that \"the rosary never left his hand except when he picked up the pen to write an opera\".<ref>Kolneder 1970, 29.</ref>\n\n===At the ''Conservatorio dell'Ospedale della Piet\u00e0''===\nIn September 1703, Vivaldi became ''maestro di violino'' (master of violin) at an [[orphanage]] called the Pio [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice.<ref name=\"TalbotGrove\">Michael Talbot, \"[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40120 Vivaldi, Antonio]\", ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription required}}</ref> While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as \"the famous composer and violinist\" and said that \"Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.\"<ref>Landon, p. 49</ref>\n\n[[File:8106 - Venezia - Calle della Piet\u00e0 - Lapide Vivaldi - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 8-Aug-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Commemorative plaque beside the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]\nVivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the orphanage. Over the next thirty years he composed most of his major works while working there.<ref>Heller, p. 51</ref> There were four similar institutions in Venice; their purpose was to give shelter and education to children who were abandoned or orphaned, or whose families could not support them.

The girls received a musical education, and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.\n\nShortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them.<ref>Heller, p. 77</ref> These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra.<ref>Heller, p. 78</ref> In 1704, the position of teacher of ''[[lyra viol|viola all'inglese]]'' was added to his duties as violin instructor.<ref name=Landon26>Landon, p. 26</ref> The position of ''maestro di coro'', which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work.

W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1957), 24.</ref>\n\nHis relationship with the board of directors of the Ospedale was often strained. The board had to take a vote every year on whether to keep a teacher. The vote on Vivaldi was seldom unanimous, and went 7 to 6 against him in 1709.<ref name=autogenerated3>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M.

Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 71.</ref>\n\nIn February 1711, Vivaldi and his father traveled to [[Brescia]], where his setting of the [[Stabat Mater]] ([[Stabat Mater (Vivaldi)|RV 621]]) was played as part of a religious festival. The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.\n\nDespite his frequent travels from 1718, the Ospedale paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The orphanage's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.\n\n===Opera impresario===\n[[File:Vivaldis first edition of Juditha triumphnas.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Juditha triumphans''<ref>[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html \"Vivaldi's Venice\"], baroquemusic.org. \"As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 perform his first great oratorio, ''Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric''. {{sic}} This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks in August 1716.\"</ref>]]\n\nIn early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.<ref>Heller, p. 98</ref> The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.\n\nDuring this period, the ''Piet\u00e0'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s. ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is now lost. The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|victory of the Republic of Venice]] against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage, both the female and male roles. Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments\u2014recorders, oboes, [[Viola d'amore|violas d'amore]], and mandolins\u2014that showcased the range of talents of the girls.<ref>Landon, p. 52</ref>\n\nAlso in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the years that followed, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.\n\n[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]\nHis progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing Vivaldi and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks the composer even as it does not mention him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure text under the engraving mentions non-existent places and names: for example, ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of \"A. Vivaldi\".\n\nIn a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his \"94 operas\". Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have been exaggerating, it is plausible that, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'', he may have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas\u2014given that his career had by then spanned almost 25 years.<ref>Heller, p. 97</ref> While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house.<ref name=Heller114>Heller, p. 114</ref>\n\n===Mantua and the'' Four Seasons''===\n{{Further|The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)}}\nIn 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]], in the northwest of Italy.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.</ref> He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Ges\u00f9'' (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.\n\nDuring this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera ''Il Giustino''. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le C\u00e8ne]] in 1725.\n\nDuring his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Gir\u00f2|Anna Tessieri Gir\u00f2]], who would become his student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and favorite ''[[prima donna]]''.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.</ref> Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, moved in with Vivaldi and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation as to the nature of Vivaldi's and Gir\u00f2's relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Vivaldi, in fact, adamantly denied any romantic relationship with Gir\u00f2 in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 67.</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\nAt the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The ''serenata'' (cantata) ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French [[ambassador]] to Venice in celebration of the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La cetra (Vivaldi)|La cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.\n\nAccompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented;<ref>Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E. Freeman, ''The Opera Theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).</ref> it garnered six revivals.<ref name=\"Heller114\" /> Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. ''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna. ''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].\n\nLike many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once had been in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]].<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179.</ref> The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Gir\u00f2.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180.</ref>\n\n[[File:Vivaldi caricature.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Caricature]] by P.

Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished<ref>Landon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of Vivaldi's death which reached Venice in the ''Commemorali Gradenigo'': \"Abbe Lord Antonio Vivaldi, incomparable virtuoso of the violin, known as the Red Priest, much esteemed for his compositions and concertos, who earned more than 50,000 ducats in his life, but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in Vienna.\" Landon, p. 166</ref><ref>Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W.

On 28 July, Vivaldi was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund. His funeral took place at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]]. Contrary to popular legend, the young [[Joseph Haydn]] had nothing to do with his burial, since no music was performed on that occasion.<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2014/06/haydn-singing-at-vivaldis-exequies.html \"Haydn Singing at Vivaldi's Exequies: An Ineradicable Myth\"] (Vienna 2014)</ref> The cost of his funeral with a 'Kleingel\u00e4ut' was 19 Gulden 45 Kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nVivaldi was buried next to [[Karlskirche]], a baroque church in an area which is now part of the site of the [[TU Wien]]. The house where he lived in Vienna has since been destroyed; the [[Hotel Sacher]] is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi \"star\" in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.\n\nOnly two, possibly three original portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced later by other artists, was made in 1725 by [[Fran\u00e7ois Morellon de La Cave]] for the first edition of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 147\u201348.</ref> The ink sketch, a [[caricature]], was done by [[Pier Leone Ghezzi|Ghezzi]] in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile.

He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes. Many of his compositions are flamboyantly exuberant.<!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? -->{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]]). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard: three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 580).<!-- That's four; what were the other two? --><ref name=\"TalbotGrove\" /><ref>Wolff and Emery.</ref>\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nDuring his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries throughout Europe, including France, but after his death his popularity dwindled. After the end of the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown, and were largely ignored. Even his most famous work, ''The Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods.\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar [[Marc Pincherle]] to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the [[Turin National University Library]] as a result of the generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]] and [[Louis Kaufman]], all of whom were instrumental in the revival of Vivaldi throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn 1926, in a monastery in [[Piedmont]], researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.<ref>Antonio Vivaldi biography by Alexander Kuznetsov and Louise Thomas, a booklet attached to the CD \"The best of Vivaldi\", published and recorded by Madacy Entertainment Group Inc, St. Laurent Quebec Canada</ref>\n\nThe resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]] (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since [[World War II]], Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. [[Historically informed performance]]s, often on \"original instruments\", have increased Vivaldi's fame still further.\n\nRecent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and [[Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi)|Dixit Dominus]] (RV 807, in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] described RV 807 as \"arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since [\u2026] the 1920s\".<ref>Michael Talbot, liner notes to the CD ''Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus'', K\u00f6rnerscher Sing-Verein Dresden (Dresdner Instrumental-Concert), Peter Kopp, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] 2006, catalogue number 4776145</ref> Vivaldi's 1730 opera ''[[Argippo]]'' (RV 697), which had been considered lost, was rediscovered in 2006 by the [[harpsichordist]] and conductor Ond\u0159ej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at [[Prague Castle]] on 3 May 2008\u2014its first performance since 1730.\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi|List of operas by Antonio Vivaldi}}\n\nA composition by Vivaldi is identified by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], which refers to its place in the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\", a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist [[Peter Ryom]].\n\n[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work. Part of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'' (\"The Contest between Harmony and Invention\"), it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th century [[program music]].<ref>Gerard Schwarz, ''Musically Speaking \u2013 The Great Works Collection: Vivaldi'' (CVP, Inc., 1995), 13.</ref>\n\nVivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos. About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[viola d'amore]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[lute]], or [[mandolin]]. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings, and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.\n\nAs well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music, such as [[Magnificat (Vivaldi)|Magnificat]]. Other works include [[sinfonia]]s, about 90 [[sonata]]s and chamber music.\n\nSome sonatas for flute, published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Ch\u00e9deville]].\n\n==Catalogs of Vivaldi works==\nVivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|here]]).\n\nBecause the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, numbers assigned by Antonio Fanna were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B{{music|flat}} major, \"La Notte\" RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1\n\nDespite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older [[Marc Pincherle|Pincherle]] numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.\n\nThis cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] was both the director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.\n\nCompositions by Vivaldi are identified today by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], the number assigned by Danish musicologist [[Peter Ryom]] in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\". Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to \"adjacent\" works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works.{{Efn|These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at [http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php classical.net].}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe movie ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vivaldi, a Prince in Venice|fr|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}'' was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Guillermou|fr|Jean-Louis Guillermou}}.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0463283|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}</ref> In 2005, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] commissioned a [[radio play]] about Vivaldi, which was written by [[Sean Riley (playwright)|Sean Riley]].

Born in [[Venice]], the capital of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], he is regarded as one of the greatest [[Baroque composers]], and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental [[concerto]]s, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty [[opera]]s. His best-known work is a series of [[violin concerto]]s known as the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]''.\n\nMany of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the ''[[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]'', a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi had worked there as a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic priest]] for {{nowrap|1 1/2}} years and was employed there from 1703 to 1715 and from 1723 to 1740. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in [[Venice]], [[Mantua]] and [[Vienna]]. After meeting the [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Chiesa di San Giovanni in Bragora - Venezia.jpg|thumb|Church where Vivaldi was given the supplemental baptismal rites, [[San Giovanni in Bragora]], [[Castello, Venice|Sestiere di Castello]], Venice]]\n\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi was born on 4 March 1678 in Venice,<ref name=\"TalbotGrove\" /> then the capital of the Venetian Republic. He was [[emergency baptism|baptized immediately after his birth]] at his home by the midwife, which led to a belief that his life was somehow in danger. Though the reasons for the child's immediate baptism are not known for certain, it was done most likely due either to his poor health or to an [[earthquake]] that shook the city that day. In the trauma of the earthquake, Vivaldi's mother may have dedicated him to the priesthood.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 46.</ref> The ceremonies which had been omitted were supplied two months later.<ref name=autogenerated5>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M.

Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 37.</ref> Giovanni Battista, who was a barber before becoming a professional violinist, taught Antonio to play the violin and then toured Venice playing the violin with his young son. Antonio was probably taught at an early age, judging by the extensive musical knowledge he had acquired by the age of 24, when he started working at the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0.<ref>Heller, p. 41</ref> Giovanni Battista was one of the founders of the ''Sovvegno dei musicisti di Santa Cecilia'', an association of musicians.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd., 1978), 36.</ref>\n\nThe president of the ''Sovvegno'' was [[Giovanni Legrenzi]], an early Baroque composer and the ''maestro di cappella'' at [[St Mark's Basilica]]. It is possible that Legrenzi gave the young Antonio his first lessons in composition. The Luxembourg scholar Walter Kolneder has discerned the influence of Legrenzi's style in Vivaldi's early liturgical work ''Laetatus sum'' ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] Anh 31), written in 1691 at the age of thirteen. Vivaldi's father may have been a composer himself: in 1689, an opera titled ''La Fedelt\u00e0 sfortunata'' was composed by a Giovanni Battista Rossi\u2014the name under which Vivaldi's father had joined the Sovvegno di Santa Cecilia.<ref>Heller, p. 40</ref>\n\nVivaldi's health was problematic. One of his symptoms, ''strettezza di petto'' (\"tightness of the chest\"), has been interpreted as a form of [[asthma]].<ref name=autogenerated5 /> This did not prevent him from learning to play the violin, composing, or taking part in musical activities,<ref name=autogenerated5 /> although it did stop him from playing wind instruments. In 1693, at the age of fifteen, he began studying to become a [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]].<ref>Landon, p. 16</ref> He was ordained in 1703, aged 25, and was soon nicknamed ''il Prete Rosso'', \"The Red Priest\".<ref>Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W. W. Norton & Company, Inc., 1957), 16</ref> (''[[Wikt:rosso|Rosso]]'' is Italian for \"red\", and would have referred to the color of his hair, a family trait.)\n\nNot long after his ordination, in 1704, he was given a dispensation from celebrating [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] most likely because of his ill health. Vivaldi said Mass as a priest only a few times, and appeared to have withdrawn from liturgical duties, though he remained a member of the priesthood. It is thought that this is also due to his habit of composing while performing mass. He may have remained committed to [[Catholicism]], though the entry in the Vienna death records for him reads, \"Antonio Vivaldi, Secular Priest\".<ref>Karl Heller, ''Antonio Vivaldi: The Red Priest of Venice'', translated by David Marinelli (AMADEUS PRESS, 1991)</ref> It is thought that he remained Catholic, though,{{Clarify|date=March 2020|reason=Why should constantly holding a rosary be thought of as evidence he had abandoned his Catholic faith?}} as in 1792, the [[Protestant]] composer [[Ernst Ludwig Gerber]], wrote of the aged Vivaldi that \"the rosary never left his hand except when he picked up the pen to write an opera\".<ref>Kolneder 1970, 29.</ref>\n\n===At the ''Conservatorio dell'Ospedale della Piet\u00e0''===\nIn September 1703, Vivaldi became ''maestro di violino'' (master of violin) at an [[orphanage]] called the Pio [[Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]] (Devout Hospital of Mercy) in Venice.<ref name=\"TalbotGrove\">Michael Talbot, \"[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/40120 Vivaldi, Antonio]\", ''[[Grove Music Online]]'' {{Subscription required}}</ref> While Vivaldi is most famous as a composer, he was regarded as an exceptional technical violinist as well. The German architect Johann Friedrich Armand von Uffenbach referred to Vivaldi as \"the famous composer and violinist\" and said that \"Vivaldi played a solo accompaniment excellently, and at the conclusion he added a free fantasy [an improvised cadenza] which absolutely astounded me, for it is hardly possible that anyone has ever played, or ever will play, in such a fashion.\"<ref>Landon, p. 49</ref>\n\n[[File:8106 - Venezia - Calle della Piet\u00e0 - Lapide Vivaldi - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 8-Aug-2007.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Commemorative plaque beside the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0]]\nVivaldi was only 25 when he started working at the orphanage.

The girls received a musical education, and the most talented among them stayed and became members of the Ospedale's renowned orchestra and choir.\n\nShortly after Vivaldi's appointment, the orphans began to gain appreciation and esteem abroad, too. Vivaldi wrote concertos, cantatas and sacred vocal music for them.<ref>Heller, p. 77</ref> These sacred works, which number over 60, are varied: they included solo motets and large-scale choral works for soloists, double chorus, and orchestra.<ref>Heller, p. 78</ref> In 1704, the position of teacher of ''[[lyra viol|viola all'inglese]]'' was added to his duties as violin instructor.<ref name=Landon26>Landon, p. 26</ref> The position of ''maestro di coro'', which was at one time filled by Vivaldi, required a lot of time and work.

The work seems to have been written in haste: the string parts are simple, the music of the first three movements is repeated in the next three, and not all the text is set. Nevertheless, perhaps in part because of the forced essentiality of the music, the work is considered to be one of his early masterpieces.\n\nDespite his frequent travels from 1718, the Ospedale paid him 2 [[sequin (coin)|sequins]] to write two concerti a month for the orchestra and to rehearse with them at least five times when in Venice. The orphanage's records show that he was paid for 140 concerti between 1723 and 1733.\n\n===Opera impresario===\n[[File:Vivaldis first edition of Juditha triumphnas.jpg|thumb|upright|First edition of ''Juditha triumphans''<ref>[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html \"Vivaldi's Venice\"], baroquemusic.org. \"As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Piet\u00e0 perform his first great oratorio, ''Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric''. {{sic}} This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians over the Turks in August 1716.\"</ref>]]\n\nIn early 18th-century Venice, opera was the most popular musical entertainment. It proved most profitable for Vivaldi. There were several theaters competing for the public's attention. Vivaldi started his career as an opera composer as a sideline: his first opera, ''[[Ottone in villa]]'' (RV 729) was performed not in Venice, but at the Garzerie Theater in [[Vicenza]] in 1713.<ref>Heller, p. 98</ref> The following year, Vivaldi became the [[impresario]] of the [[Teatro San Angelo]] in Venice, where his opera ''[[Orlando finto pazzo]]'' (RV 727) was performed. The work was not to the public's taste, and it closed after a couple of weeks, being replaced with a repeat of a different work already given the previous year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1715, he presented ''[[Nerone fatto Cesare]]'' (RV 724, now lost), with music by seven different composers, of which he was the leader. The opera contained eleven [[aria]]s, and was a success. In the late season, Vivaldi planned to put on an opera entirely of his own creation, ''[[Arsilda, regina di Ponto]]'' (RV 700), but the state censor blocked the performance. The main character, Arsilda, falls in love with another woman, Lisea, who is pretending to be a man.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Vivaldi got the censor to accept the opera the following year, and it was a resounding success.\n\nDuring this period, the ''Piet\u00e0'' commissioned several liturgical works. The most important were two [[oratorio]]s. ''Moyses Deus Pharaonis'', (RV 643) is now lost. The second, ''[[Juditha triumphans]]'' (RV 644), celebrates the [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|victory of the Republic of Venice]] against the Turks and the recapture of the island of [[Corfu]]. Composed in 1716, it is one of his sacred masterpieces. All eleven singing parts were performed by girls of the orphanage, both the female and male roles. Many of the [[aria]]s include parts for solo instruments\u2014recorders, oboes, [[Viola d'amore|violas d'amore]], and mandolins\u2014that showcased the range of talents of the girls.<ref>Landon, p. 52</ref>\n\nAlso in 1716, Vivaldi wrote and produced two more operas, ''[[L'incoronazione di Dario]]'' (RV 719) and ''La costanza trionfante degli amori e degli odi'' (RV 706). The latter was so popular that it performed two years later, re-edited and retitled ''Artabano re dei Parti'' (RV 701, now lost). It was also performed in Prague in 1732. In the years that followed, Vivaldi wrote several operas that were performed all over Italy.\n\n[[File:Teatro alla moda.jpg|thumb|Frontispiece of ''Il teatro alla moda'']]\nHis progressive operatic style caused him some trouble with more conservative musicians such as [[Benedetto Marcello]], a magistrate and amateur musician who wrote a [[pamphlet]] denouncing Vivaldi and his operas. The pamphlet, ''[[Il teatro alla moda]]'', attacks the composer even as it does not mention him directly. The cover drawing shows a boat (the Sant'Angelo), on the left end of which stands a little angel wearing a priest's hat and playing the violin. The Marcello family claimed ownership of the Teatro Sant'Angelo, and a long legal battle had been fought with the management for its restitution, without success. The obscure text under the engraving mentions non-existent places and names: for example, ''ALDIVIVA'' is an anagram of \"A. Vivaldi\".\n\nIn a letter written by Vivaldi to his patron Marchese Bentivoglio in 1737, he makes reference to his \"94 operas\". Only around 50 operas by Vivaldi have been discovered, and no other documentation of the remaining operas exists. Although Vivaldi may have been exaggerating, it is plausible that, in his dual role of composer and ''impresario'', he may have either written or been responsible for the production of as many as 94 operas\u2014given that his career had by then spanned almost 25 years.<ref>Heller, p. 97</ref> While Vivaldi certainly composed many operas in his time, he never attained the prominence of other great composers such as [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Johann Adolph Hasse]], [[Leonardo Leo]], and [[Baldassare Galuppi]], as evidenced by his inability to keep a production running for an extended period of time in any major opera house.<ref name=Heller114>Heller, p. 114</ref>\n\n===Mantua and the'' Four Seasons''===\n{{Further|The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)}}\nIn 1717 or 1718, Vivaldi was offered a prestigious new position as ''Maestro di Cappella'' of the court of prince [[Philip of Hesse-Darmstadt]], governor of [[Mantua]], in the northwest of Italy.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 64.</ref> He moved there for three years and produced several operas, among them ''[[Tito Manlio]]'' (RV 738). In 1721, he was in Milan, where he presented the pastoral drama ''[[La Silvia]]'' (RV 734); nine arias from it survive. He visited Milan again the following year with the oratorio ''L'adorazione delli tre re magi al bambino Ges\u00f9'' (RV 645, now lost). In 1722 he moved to Rome, where he introduced his operas' new style. The new [[pope Benedict XIII]] invited Vivaldi to play for him. In 1725, Vivaldi returned to Venice, where he produced four operas in the same year.\n\nDuring this period Vivaldi wrote the ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', four violin concertos that give musical expression to the seasons of the year. Though three of the concerti are wholly original, the first, \"Spring\", borrows motifs from a Sinfonia in the first act of Vivaldi's contemporaneous opera ''Il Giustino''. The inspiration for the concertos was probably the countryside around Mantua. They were a revolution in musical conception: in them Vivaldi represented flowing creeks, singing birds (of different species, each specifically characterized), barking dogs, buzzing mosquitoes, crying shepherds, storms, drunken dancers, silent nights, hunting parties from both the hunters' and the prey's point of view, frozen landscapes, ice-skating children, and warming winter fires. Each concerto is associated with a [[sonnet]], possibly by Vivaldi, describing the scenes depicted in the music. They were published as the first four concertos in a collection of twelve, ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', Opus 8, published in Amsterdam by [[Michel-Charles Le C\u00e8ne]] in 1725.\n\nDuring his time in Mantua, Vivaldi became acquainted with an aspiring young singer [[Anna Gir\u00f2|Anna Tessieri Gir\u00f2]], who would become his student, prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, and favorite ''[[prima donna]]''.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J. M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 66.</ref> Anna, along with her older half-sister Paolina, moved in with Vivaldi and regularly accompanied him on his many travels. There was speculation as to the nature of Vivaldi's and Gir\u00f2's relationship, but no evidence exists to indicate anything beyond friendship and professional collaboration. Vivaldi, in fact, adamantly denied any romantic relationship with Gir\u00f2 in a letter to his patron Bentivoglio dated 16 November 1737.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''Vivaldi'' (London: J.M. Dent & Sons, Ltd, 1978), 67.</ref>\n\n===Later life and death===\nAt the height of his career, Vivaldi received commissions from European nobility and royalty. The ''serenata'' (cantata) ''Gloria e Imeneo'' (RV 687) was commissioned in 1725 by the French [[ambassador]] to Venice in celebration of the marriage of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The following year, another ''serenata'', ''La Sena festeggiante'' (RV 694), was written for and premiered at the French embassy as well, celebrating the birth of the French royal princesses, [[Princess Henriette of France|Henriette]] and [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France|Louise \u00c9lisabeth]]. Vivaldi's Opus 9, ''[[La cetra (Vivaldi)|La cetra]]'', was dedicated to [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. In 1728, Vivaldi met the emperor while the emperor was visiting [[Trieste]] to oversee the construction of a new port. Charles admired the music of the Red Priest so much that he is said to have spoken more with the composer during their one meeting than he spoke to his ministers in over two years. He gave Vivaldi the title of [[knight]], a gold medal and an invitation to Vienna. Vivaldi gave Charles a manuscript copy of ''La cetra'', a set of concerti almost completely different from the set of the same title published as Opus 9. The printing was probably delayed, forcing Vivaldi to gather an improvised collection for the emperor.\n\nAccompanied by his father, Vivaldi traveled to Vienna and Prague in 1730, where his opera ''[[Farnace]]'' (RV 711) was presented;<ref>Vivaldi's connections with musical life in Prague and his association with [[Antonio Denzio]], the impresario of the [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Sporck theater in Prague]] are detailed in Daniel E. Freeman, ''The Opera Theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' (Stuyvesant, N.Y.: Pendragon Press, 1992).</ref> it garnered six revivals.<ref name=\"Heller114\" /> Some of his later operas were created in collaboration with two of Italy's major writers of the time. ''[[L'Olimpiade]]'' and ''[[Catone in Utica]]'' were written by [[Pietro Metastasio]], the major representative of the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadian]] movement and court poet in Vienna. ''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|La Griselda]]'' was rewritten by the young [[Carlo Goldoni]] from an earlier libretto by [[Apostolo Zeno]].\n\nLike many composers of the time, Vivaldi faced financial difficulties in his later years. His compositions were no longer held in such high esteem as they once had been in Venice; changing musical tastes quickly made them outmoded. In response, Vivaldi chose to sell off sizeable numbers of his manuscripts at paltry prices to finance his migration to [[Vienna]].<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 179.</ref> The reasons for Vivaldi's departure from Venice are unclear, but it seems likely that, after the success of his meeting with Emperor Charles VI, he wished to take up the position of a composer in the imperial court. On his way to Vienna, Vivaldi may have stopped in Graz to see Anna Gir\u00f2.<ref>Walter Kolneder, ''Antonio Vivaldi: Documents of his life and works'' (Amsterdam: Heinrichshofen's Verlag, Wilhelmshaven, Locarno, 1982), 180.</ref>\n\n[[File:Vivaldi caricature.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Caricature]] by P.

Shortly after his arrival in Vienna, Charles VI died, which left the composer without any royal protection or a steady source of income. Soon afterwards, Vivaldi became impoverished<ref>Landon supplies this assertion and furthermore quotes the report of Vivaldi's death which reached Venice in the ''Commemorali Gradenigo'': \"Abbe Lord Antonio Vivaldi, incomparable virtuoso of the violin, known as the Red Priest, much esteemed for his compositions and concertos, who earned more than 50,000 ducats in his life, but his disorderly prodigality caused him to die a pauper in Vienna.\" Landon, p. 166</ref><ref>Marc Pincherle, ''Vivaldi: Genius of the Baroque'' (Paris: W.

Heller (p. 263) states: \"The composer's death is noted in the official coroner's report and in the burial account book of St. Stephen's Cathedral Parish as having occurred on 28 July 1741\". But the so-called ''Totenbeschauprotokoll'' is not a reliable source, since the date can refer to when the entry was made, not to the actual time of death.</ref> of \"internal [[infection]]\", in a house owned by the widow of a Viennese saddlemaker. On 28 July, Vivaldi was buried in a simple grave in a burial ground that was owned by the public hospital fund. His funeral took place at [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]]. Contrary to popular legend, the young [[Joseph Haydn]] had nothing to do with his burial, since no music was performed on that occasion.<ref>[[Michael Lorenz (musicologist)|Michael Lorenz]], [http://michaelorenz.blogspot.co.at/2014/06/haydn-singing-at-vivaldis-exequies.html \"Haydn Singing at Vivaldi's Exequies: An Ineradicable Myth\"] (Vienna 2014)</ref> The cost of his funeral with a 'Kleingel\u00e4ut' was 19 Gulden 45 Kreuzer which was rather expensive for the lowest class of peal of bells.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nVivaldi was buried next to [[Karlskirche]], a baroque church in an area which is now part of the site of the [[TU Wien]]. The house where he lived in Vienna has since been destroyed; the [[Hotel Sacher]] is built on part of the site. Memorial plaques have been placed at both locations, as well as a Vivaldi \"star\" in the Viennese Musikmeile and a monument at the Rooseveltplatz.\n\nOnly two, possibly three original portraits of Vivaldi are known to survive: an engraving, an ink sketch and an oil painting. The engraving, which was the basis of several copies produced later by other artists, was made in 1725 by [[Fran\u00e7ois Morellon de La Cave]] for the first edition of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'', and shows Vivaldi holding a sheet of music.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 147\u201348.</ref> The ink sketch, a [[caricature]], was done by [[Pier Leone Ghezzi|Ghezzi]] in 1723 and shows Vivaldi's head and shoulders in profile. It exists in two versions: a first jotting kept at the [[Vatican Library]], and a much lesser-known, slightly more detailed copy recently discovered in Moscow.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 87.</ref> The oil painting, which can be seen in the [[International Museum and Library of Music of Bologna]], is anonymous and is thought to depict Vivaldi due to its strong resemblance to the La Cave engraving.<ref>Michael Talbot, ''The Vivaldi Compendium'' (Woodbridge: The Boydell Press, 2011), 148.</ref>\n\n==Style and influence==\n{{listen|type=music\n| filename     = 01 - Vivaldi Spring mvt 1 Allegro - John Harrison violin.ogg\n| title        = \"La primavera\" (Spring) \u2013 Movement 1: Allegro from the ''Four Seasons''\n| description  = A 2000 live performance by [[Wichita State University]] Chamber Players.\n}}\nVivaldi's music was innovative. He brightened the formal and rhythmic structure of the concerto, in which he looked for harmonic contrasts and innovative melodies and themes. Many of his compositions are flamboyantly exuberant.<!-- some compositions before Vivaldi were flamboyantly and playfully exuberant, what does this tell us? -->{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his ''[[St John Passion]]'', ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'', and [[Bach cantata|cantatas]]). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard: three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo (BWV 1065) based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo ([[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV]] 580).<!-- That's four; what were the other two? --><ref name=\"TalbotGrove\" /><ref>Wolff and Emery.</ref>\n\n==Posthumous reputation==\nDuring his lifetime, Vivaldi was popular in many countries throughout Europe, including France, but after his death his popularity dwindled. After the end of the Baroque period, Vivaldi's published concerti became relatively unknown, and were largely ignored. Even his most famous work, ''The Four Seasons'', was unknown in its original edition during the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods.\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Fritz Kreisler]]'s Concerto in C, in the Style of Vivaldi (which he passed off as an original Vivaldi work) helped revive Vivaldi's reputation. This spurred the French scholar [[Marc Pincherle]] to begin an academic study of Vivaldi's oeuvre. Many Vivaldi manuscripts were rediscovered, which were acquired by the [[Turin National University Library]] as a result of the generous sponsorship of Turinese businessmen Roberto Foa and Filippo Giordano, in memory of their sons. This led to a renewed interest in Vivaldi by, among others, Mario Rinaldi, [[Alfredo Casella]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Olga Rudge]], [[Desmond Chute]], [[Arturo Toscanini]], [[Arnold Schering]] and [[Louis Kaufman]], all of whom were instrumental in the revival of Vivaldi throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn 1926, in a monastery in [[Piedmont]], researchers discovered fourteen folios of Vivaldi's work that were previously thought to have been lost during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Some missing volumes in the numbered set were discovered in the collections of the descendants of the Grand Duke Durazzo, who had acquired the monastery complex in the 18th century. The volumes contained 300 concertos, 19 operas and over 100 vocal-instrumental works.<ref>Antonio Vivaldi biography by Alexander Kuznetsov and Louise Thomas, a booklet attached to the CD \"The best of Vivaldi\", published and recorded by Madacy Entertainment Group Inc, St. Laurent Quebec Canada</ref>\n\nThe resurrection of Vivaldi's unpublished works in the 20th century is mostly due to the efforts of [[Alfredo Casella]], who in 1939 organized the historic Vivaldi Week, in which the rediscovered [[Gloria (Vivaldi)|Gloria]] (RV 589) and l'Olimpiade were revived. Since [[World War II]], Vivaldi's compositions have enjoyed wide success. [[Historically informed performance]]s, often on \"original instruments\", have increased Vivaldi's fame still further.\n\nRecent rediscoveries of works by Vivaldi include two [[psalm]] settings of ''Nisi Dominus'' (RV 803, in eight movements) and [[Dixit Dominus (Vivaldi)|Dixit Dominus]] (RV 807, in eleven movements). These were identified in 2003 and 2005 respectively, by the Australian scholar Janice Stockigt. The Vivaldi scholar [[Michael Talbot (musicologist)|Michael Talbot]] described RV 807 as \"arguably the best nonoperatic work from Vivaldi's pen to come to light since [\u2026] the 1920s\".<ref>Michael Talbot, liner notes to the CD ''Vivaldi: Dixit Dominus'', K\u00f6rnerscher Sing-Verein Dresden (Dresdner Instrumental-Concert), Peter Kopp, [[Deutsche Grammophon]] 2006, catalogue number 4776145</ref> Vivaldi's 1730 opera ''[[Argippo]]'' (RV 697), which had been considered lost, was rediscovered in 2006 by the [[harpsichordist]] and conductor Ond\u0159ej Macek, whose Hofmusici orchestra performed the work at [[Prague Castle]] on 3 May 2008\u2014its first performance since 1730.\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|List of compositions by Antonio Vivaldi|List of operas by Antonio Vivaldi}}\n\nA composition by Vivaldi is identified by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], which refers to its place in the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\", a catalog created in the 20th century by the musicologist [[Peter Ryom]].\n\n[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|''Le quattro stagioni'' (The Four Seasons)]] of 1723 is his most famous work. Part of ''[[Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione]]'' (\"The Contest between Harmony and Invention\"), it depicts moods and scenes from each of the four seasons. This work has been described as an outstanding instance of pre-19th century [[program music]].<ref>Gerard Schwarz, ''Musically Speaking \u2013 The Great Works Collection: Vivaldi'' (CVP, Inc., 1995), 13.</ref>\n\nVivaldi wrote more than 500 other concertos. About 350 of these are for solo instrument and strings, of which 230 are for violin, the others being for [[bassoon]], [[cello]], [[oboe]], [[flute]], [[viola d'amore]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[lute]], or [[mandolin]]. About forty concertos are for two instruments and strings, and about thirty are for three or more instruments and strings.\n\nAs well as about 46 operas, Vivaldi composed a large body of sacred choral music, such as [[Magnificat (Vivaldi)|Magnificat]]. Other works include [[sinfonia]]s, about 90 [[sonata]]s and chamber music.\n\nSome sonatas for flute, published as ''Il Pastor Fido'', have been erroneously attributed to Vivaldi, but were composed by [[Nicolas Ch\u00e9deville]].\n\n==Catalogs of Vivaldi works==\nVivaldi's works attracted cataloging efforts befitting a major composer. Scholarly work intended to increase the accuracy and variety of Vivaldi performances also supported new discoveries which made old catalogs incomplete. Works still in circulation today may be numbered under several different systems (some earlier catalogs are mentioned [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|here]]).\n\nBecause the simply consecutive Complete Edition (CE) numbers did not reflect the individual works (Opus numbers) into which compositions were grouped, numbers assigned by Antonio Fanna were often used in conjunction with CE numbers. Combined Complete Edition (CE)/Fanna numbering was especially common in the work of Italian groups driving the mid-20th century revival of Vivaldi, such as Gli Accademici di Milano under Piero Santi. For example, the Bassoon Concerto in B{{music|flat}} major, \"La Notte\" RV 501, became CE 12, F. VIII,1\n\nDespite the awkwardness of having to overlay Fanna numbers onto the Complete Edition number for meaningful grouping of Vivaldi's oeuvre, these numbers displaced the older [[Marc Pincherle|Pincherle]] numbers as the (re-)discovery of more manuscripts had rendered older catalogs obsolete.\n\nThis cataloging work was led by the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, where [[Gian Francesco Malipiero]] was both the director and the editor of the published scores (Edizioni G. Ricordi). His work built on that of Antonio Fanna, a Venetian businessman and the Institute's founder, and thus formed a bridge to the scholarly catalog dominant today.\n\nCompositions by Vivaldi are identified today by [[Ryom-Verzeichnis|RV number]], the number assigned by Danish musicologist [[Peter Ryom]] in works published mostly in the 1970s, such as the \"Ryom-Verzeichnis\" or \"R\u00e9pertoire des oeuvres d'Antonio Vivaldi\". Like the Complete Edition before it, the RV does not typically assign its single, consecutive numbers to \"adjacent\" works that occupy one of the composer's single opus numbers. Its goal as a modern catalog is to index the manuscripts and sources that establish the existence and nature of all known works.{{Efn|These several numbering systems are cross-referenced at [http://www.classical.net/music/composer/works/vivaldi/index.php classical.net].}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe movie ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Vivaldi, a Prince in Venice|fr|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}'' was completed in 2005 as an Italian-French co-production under the direction of {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Louis Guillermou|fr|Jean-Louis Guillermou}}.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0463283|Antonio Vivaldi, un prince \u00e0 Venise}}</ref> In 2005, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] [[Radio National]] commissioned a [[radio play]] about Vivaldi, which was written by [[Sean Riley (playwright)|Sean Riley]].

It was founded in the 12th century in the most northerly of the three settlements in Lancing parish, which has Saxon origins.  The present building is mostly 13th-century in appearance, and structural work has been carried out several times since\u2014particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, when the church was restored from a ruinous condition.  [[English Heritage]] has [[Listed building|listed]] the church at Grade I for its architectural and historical importance.\n\n==History==\nThe name ''Lancing'' suggests [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] influence (the ''-ing'' suffix implied, in Saxon terms, a temporary settlement),<ref name=\"Hare6\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=6.}}</ref> and remains dating from the 6th century have been found nearby.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  At the time of the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] in 1086, the [[Lord of the Manor]] of nearby [[Broadwater, West Sussex|Broadwater]], Robert le Savage, held the [[Manorialism|manor]] of Lancing.  The land in the parish, which extended from the [[South Downs]] to the [[English Channel]] coast, was chiefly agricultural.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>\n\nAround this time, the large manor was divided into several smaller ones, of which North Lancing and South Lancing (as they became known) were the most important.<ref name=\"Jones5\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=5.}}</ref>  Gradually, three settlements developed: North Lancing, closest to the Downs; South Lancing, near the coast; and the nearby Pende (now vanished), on the coast and briefly a successful port.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  No church existed in the area at that time, but one was established in North Lancing in the 12th century:<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/> a date of around 1120 has been suggested from analysis of surviving masonry at the ends of the [[chancel]].<ref name=\"Jones5\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner255\">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=255.}}</ref>  In about 1180,<ref name=\"Jones5\"/><ref name=\"Wales134\">{{Harvnb|Wales|1999|p=134.}}</ref> an arched doorway, now forming part of the porch on the south side, was added.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>\n\nThe whole structure was rebuilt between about 1280 and 1300, giving the church its present layout.<ref name=\"Jones5\"/><ref name=\"Wales134\"/>  It presents a consistent and harmonious architectural impression, despite the long period of time needed to complete the work.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>  A stair turret leading up to the tower was built in the 15th century; part of the north aisle had to be blocked to accommodate this.<ref name=\"Coppin105\">{{Harvnb|Coppin|206|p=105.}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century\u2014especially after the [[English Restoration|Restoration of 1660]]\u2014Anglican religious worship declined and many churches in England fell into disrepair.<ref name=\"Hare28\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=28.}}</ref>  This attitude was common among the people of Sussex, where church attendances declined dramatically in many villages, including North Lancing.<ref name=\"Hare28\"/><ref name=\"Hare29\">{{Harvnb|Hare|1991|p=29.}}</ref>  The first sign of structural decay at St James the Less Church came in 1618, when the upper part of the tower collapsed.<ref name=\"Jones6\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=6.}}</ref>  By 1621 it had been repaired by cutting it down in size and topping it with a \"Sussex cap\"-style roof.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The rest of the building quickly fell into ruins, however: birds were found to be nesting inside,<ref name=\"Hare29\"/> pigeons bred there and the [[Baptismal font|font]] was empty.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  By 1662, the church could no longer be used.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>\n\nThe situation improved in the late 18th century, when some restoration work was carried out.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  More substantial rebuilding in 1827 added extra pews and altered several windows.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones6\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\">{{Harvnb|Nairn|Pevsner|1965|p=256.}}</ref>  The most recent addition was a [[vestry]] in 1934.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Wales134\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe church is built of [[flint]] [[cobblestone]]s.  Areas of [[Roughcast|pebbledashing]] remain,<ref name=\"IoE297263\"/> although some was removed in the mid-20th century.<ref name=\"Jones7\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=7.}}</ref>  [[Ashlar]] has been used as well.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/>  Architecturally, the timing and completeness of the late 13th-century rebuilding has resulted in the church presenting an unusually complete example of the transition from the [[English Gothic architecture#Early English Gothic|Early English Gothic style]] to the [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic style]].<ref name=\"Jones6\"/>\n\nThe church has, from west to east, a three-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] [[nave]] with aisles on the north and south sides, a short tower and a [[chancel]] with a lower roofline than the nave.  There is a porch with an entrance doorway on the south side, another door at the west end and a vestry at the northeast corner as well.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones6\"/>\n\nUntil its collapse in 1618, the tower was much taller and ended in a [[parapet]].  The reconstruction shortened it (making the upper windows smaller) and added a Sussex cap\u2014a shallow pyramid-shaped [[slate]] roof common in Sussex.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The date was commemorated by an inscription on the north wall.<ref name=\"IoE297263\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The church's original entrance doorway has been retained in the south porch: it has a round arch carried on [[chamfer]]ed shafts with [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The detail on the stonework, although characteristic of the Norman period, is more intricate than usual.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The arch has a [[hood mould]], which sits clear of the [[Abacus (architecture)|abaci]] at the top of the shafts.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Inside the doorway is an ancient [[Holy water font|stoup]] for [[holy water]], which is now in poor condition.<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Jones11\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=11.}}</ref>  The other doorway, in the west face, is similar to its south-face counterpart, but is more likely to be 15th-century than 12th-century.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  [[Buttress]]es seem to have been added around the tower at some point during the 17th century,<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/> and a large buttress remains on the south side of the chancel.  This was thought to be hollow until it was analysed properly in 1948 when pebbledashing was removed from the exterior.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>\n\nMost of the windows are either one- or two-light [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]], although some later examples are in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic style]].<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Some of the chancel windows are larger, with three lights.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>  [[Stained glass]], by an unknown designer, was installed in three windows in 1866.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInside the church, remnants of the original Norman building can be seen at opposite ends: in the west wall of the nave and the east end of the chancel.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The chancel, nave and aisles were rebuilt (to the same dimensions as the original building) when English Gothic architecture was at its height, and the [[chamfer]]ed arches, octagonal pillars, chancel arch, blind arches and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] are considered good examples of their kind.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=9.}}</ref>  The [[king post]] roof of the nave has also been praised.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInterior fittings include a 14th-century [[Easter sepulchre]] with an [[ogee]]-arched roof,<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> part of a [[sedilia]], some Norman [[frieze]]work,<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> and a 12th-century square [[Baptismal font|font]] in good condition.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/>\n\n==Today==\nSt James the Less Church was [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade I by [[English Heritage]] on 12 October 1954.<ref name=\"IoE297263\">{{NHLE|num=1192533|desc= The Parish Church of St James, Manor Road, Lancing, Adur, West Sussex|year=2007|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  Such buildings are defined as being of \"exceptional interest\" and greater than national importance.<ref name=\"EH2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |title=Listed Buildings |year=2010 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DEarkz4v?url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |archive-date=27 December 2012 |df= }}</ref>  As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and [[Listed buildings in Adur|119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district]].<ref name=\"IoEStats-WSx\">{{Cite web|title=Images of England \u2014 Statistics by County (West Sussex) |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |work=[[Images of England]] |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |year=2007 |access-date=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DNVqdtdK?url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |archive-date=2 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe style of worship in the church is Traditional Catholic.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/|title=St James the Less, Lancing|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  [[Holy Communion|Eucharistic]] services take place every Wednesday and Sunday: there are evening prayer services everyday, and Family Eucharist on the third Sunday each month.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames-Services\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/page/2593/|title=Services|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/135 parish], in its present form, covers {{convert|2236|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"VCH18216\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt1/pp34-53|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1 \u2013 Bramber Rape (Southern Part).

The reconstruction shortened it (making the upper windows smaller) and added a Sussex cap\u2014a shallow pyramid-shaped [[slate]] roof common in Sussex.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The date was commemorated by an inscription on the north wall.<ref name=\"IoE297263\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The church's original entrance doorway has been retained in the south porch: it has a round arch carried on [[chamfer]]ed shafts with [[Norman architecture|Norman]]-style [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]].<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  The detail on the stonework, although characteristic of the Norman period, is more intricate than usual.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The arch has a [[hood mould]], which sits clear of the [[Abacus (architecture)|abaci]] at the top of the shafts.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Inside the doorway is an ancient [[Holy water font|stoup]] for [[holy water]], which is now in poor condition.<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Jones11\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=11.}}</ref>  The other doorway, in the west face, is similar to its south-face counterpart, but is more likely to be 15th-century than 12th-century.<ref name=\"VCH18216\"/><ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  [[Buttress]]es seem to have been added around the tower at some point during the 17th century,<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/> and a large buttress remains on the south side of the chancel.  This was thought to be hollow until it was analysed properly in 1948 when pebbledashing was removed from the exterior.<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>\n\nMost of the windows are either one- or two-light [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]], although some later examples are in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic style]].<ref name=\"Jones7\"/>  Some of the chancel windows are larger, with three lights.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/>  [[Stained glass]], by an unknown designer, was installed in three windows in 1866.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInside the church, remnants of the original Norman building can be seen at opposite ends: in the west wall of the nave and the east end of the chancel.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/>  The chancel, nave and aisles were rebuilt (to the same dimensions as the original building) when English Gothic architecture was at its height, and the [[chamfer]]ed arches, octagonal pillars, chancel arch, blind arches and [[Molding (decorative)|mouldings]] are considered good examples of their kind.<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\">{{Harvnb|Jones|1948|p=9.}}</ref>  The [[king post]] roof of the nave has also been praised.<ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/>\n\nInterior fittings include a 14th-century [[Easter sepulchre]] with an [[ogee]]-arched roof,<ref name=\"Wales134\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> part of a [[sedilia]], some Norman [[frieze]]work,<ref name=\"Pevsner255\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/> and a 12th-century square [[Baptismal font|font]] in good condition.<ref name=\"Coppin105\"/><ref name=\"Pevsner256\"/><ref name=\"Jones9\"/>\n\n==Today==\nSt James the Less Church was [[Listed building|listed]] at Grade I by [[English Heritage]] on 12 October 1954.<ref name=\"IoE297263\">{{NHLE|num=1192533|desc= The Parish Church of St James, Manor Road, Lancing, Adur, West Sussex|year=2007|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  Such buildings are defined as being of \"exceptional interest\" and greater than national importance.<ref name=\"EH2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |title=Listed Buildings |year=2010 |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |access-date=19 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DEarkz4v?url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/caring/listing/listed-buildings/ |archive-date=27 December 2012 |df= }}</ref>  As of February 2001, it was one of seven Grade I listed buildings, and [[Listed buildings in Adur|119 listed buildings of all grades, in Adur district]].<ref name=\"IoEStats-WSx\">{{Cite web|title=Images of England \u2014 Statistics by County (West Sussex) |url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |work=[[Images of England]] |publisher=[[English Heritage]] |year=2007 |access-date=2 January 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DNVqdtdK?url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/StatisticsPage/default.aspx?StatsCounty=WEST%20SUSSEX |archive-date=2 January 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe style of worship in the church is Traditional Catholic.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/|title=St James the Less, Lancing|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>  [[Holy Communion|Eucharistic]] services take place every Wednesday and Sunday: there are evening prayer services everyday, and Family Eucharist on the third Sunday each month.<ref name=\"ACNY-StJames-Services\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/saint-james-the-less/page/2593/|title=Services|year=2009|work=A Church Near You website|publisher=[[Archbishops' Council]]|accessdate=2009-10-02}}</ref>\n\nThe [http://www.achurchnearyou.com/parish.php?p=10/135 parish], in its present form, covers {{convert|2236|acre|ha}}.<ref name=\"VCH18216\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/Sussex/vol6/pt1/pp34-53|title=A History of the County of Sussex: Volume 6 Part 1 \u2013 Bramber Rape (Southern Part).
