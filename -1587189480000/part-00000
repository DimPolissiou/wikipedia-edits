Taking a degree in [[history of architecture|architectural history]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in [[London|London\u2019s]] [[Covent Garden]] that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

The first [[Oxbridge]] commission, of dining hall furniture for [[Corpus Christi College Cambridge]], came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>.

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the [[architecture]] is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the [[architect]] who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as [[New College Oxford]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid [[hardwoods]] from suppliers who derive their raw material from [[forests]] managed to the standards of [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)]], [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification)]], [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative|SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative)]] or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan.

Taking a degree in [[history of architecture|architectural history]] from [[Cambridge University]] in 1978, he moved directly into working as a carpenter on building sites and set up a small workshop, trading as Bloomsbury Joinery, in [[London|London\u2019s]] [[Covent Garden]] that year<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. In 1981 he bought a former vegetable warehouse in the same district at a much reduced price because it was earmarked by the [[Greater London Council]] for compulsory purchase, demolition and redevelopment. (The Council was abolished<ref>{{cite report |author=Hansard|date=1803-2005 |title=Streamlining the Cities |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1984/may/22/streamlining-the-cities |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> before the plans could be realized.)\n\nIn the early 1980s the workshop\u2019s output consisted of high quality furniture for the residential market. Exposure to an increasing number of institutional clients came from a chance encounter with Colonel David Gordon-Lennox, commanding officer of the [[Grenadier Guards]], whose own kitchen shelving led to a commission for the regiment\u2019s archive library, and from there a series of bookcases for Inns of Court lawyers<ref>{{cite news |last=Steiner |first=Rupert |date=29 June 1997 |title=Carpenter carved out success by going against the grain | work=The Sunday Times}}</ref>. Many subsequent library commissions have included high-profile installations such as the library of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom (2009)<ref>{{Cite book |title=A visit to the Supreme Court Library |date=2011 |publisher=Inner Temple Newsletter|}}</ref>.\n\nThe mid-1980s also saw the company\u2019s short-lived and ultimately ill-fated engagement with design for the retail market in the form of its robust but modestly priced \u2018Ovolo\u2019 range of bedroom furniture, sold through upmarket outlets such as [[Heal\u2019s]], [[Liberty\u2019s]] and [[John Lewis]]. [[Venture capital]] was raised and significant investment made in a factory in [[Wiltshire]] which opened in 1990. Copyright infringement and the deep UK recession of the late 1980s, which forced the factory\u2019s eventual closure in 1994, prompted a decision to target recession-proof clients with long-term needs to furnish their buildings of architectural quality \u2013\u00a0namely the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. Much was owed in this strategic shift to Ray Leigh<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GRDM-Newsletter-22.pdf|title=22nd e-newsletter of the Gordon Russell Design Museum|website=www.gordonrusselldesignmuseum.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>, appointed chairman of the limited company in 1990, and an architect whose own background included work on the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951 and a long career, first as design director then managing director, of iconic [[Cotswold]] furniture manufacturer [[Gordon Russell (designer)|Gordon Russell]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Leigh | first=Ray | title=Advance the Product |date=2015 |publisher=Gordon Russell Trust|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Myerson | first=Jeremy | title=Gordon Russell, Designer of Furniture |date=1992 |publisher=The Design Council of Great Britain|}}</ref>.

The first [[Oxbridge]] commission, of dining hall furniture for [[Corpus Christi College Cambridge]], came in 1991, a job which also marked the company\u2019s first use of computer-aided design<ref>{{Cite book | title=Timeline: The Story So Far |date=2012 |publisher=Luke Hughes and Company}}</ref>. The first commission for the Foreign Office \u2013 the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Buenos Aires|British Embassy in Buenos Aires]] \u2013 and the first order over \u00a3250,000, for [[Merton College Oxford]], followed in 1992. 1997 saw a high-profile commission at the height of the \u2018[[Cool Britannia]]\u2019 years for the idiosyncratic new [[British Embassy in Moscow]], designed by [[Ahrends Burton Koralek]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Melvin | first=Jeremy | title=British Embassy in Moscow |date=1999 |publisher=Foreign & Commonwealth Office}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Powell | first=Kenneth | title=From Russia with love - the Moscow embassy |date=2000 |publisher=Royal Academy Journal|}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Taylor | first=David | title=ABK's Moscow Embassy - Britain at its best |date=2000 |publisher=Architect's Journal|}}</ref>, and in 1998 came the first order of over \u00a3500,000, for [[St Hugh\u2019s College, Oxford|St Hugh's College Oxford]].

Although the company had been working expressly on those lines since the early 1990s, it was in 2013 \u2013 with the help of Craig Allen, former creative director at Linley Furniture and a senior buyer at the Conran Shop \u2013 that its brand messages were rationalised. \n\nThe greater part of Luke Hughes & Company furniture is designed for existing or historic buildings. Response to the [[architecture]] is key; an understanding of architecture and the design process, and sympathy for the [[architect]] who designed it, are central to its work. The pivotal idea behind Luke Hughes & Company\u2019s approach is that in any quality building, the connection between architecture and furniture should be seamless, creating a sense of \u201crightness\u201d, both functionally and aesthetically. Most buildings cannot function without the furniture, yet inappropriate furniture can grossly undermine great architecture<ref>{{cite news | last=Lim | first=Candice | date=2012 |title=In conversation with Luke Hughes | work=Futurarc: the Voice of Green Architecture in Asia | edition=vol 27 }}</ref>.  \n\nThe company\u2019s design practice is focused not only on responding to the aesthetic and functional qualities of the buildings that house its furniture, but also the economic outcomes. Analysis and re-arrangement of the leg positions on the tables in a dining hall such as [[New College Oxford]]<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=236}}</ref> or an overhaul of the seating geometry in a small historic theatre<ref>{{Cite book | last=Walker | first=Aidan | title=Furniture in Architecture: The Work of Luke Hughes |date=2020 |publisher=Thames & Hudson| page=150}}</ref> add capacity, improving the efficiency and profitability of the building.

Luke Hughes furniture is designed for long life, 30 \u2013 50 years minimum.  The strict company policy is to buy solid [[hardwoods]] from suppliers who derive their raw material from [[forests]] managed to the standards of [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC (Forest Stewardship Council)]], [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification)]], [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative|SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative)]] or equivalent, where replanting and controlled felling are part of the overall plan.

It was patronized by wealthy Americans and others from around the world as well. It was the largest hotel in the [[Adirondacks]] at the end of the nineteenth century. The hotel had the most modern state-of-the-art luxury conveniences for its guests, including the world's first installed incandescent electric lighting in all the guest rooms. [[Thomas Edison]] oversaw the electrical engineer on all the electrical items for the hotel during its construction, including the installation of two dynamo electric generators at the premises. It had a short operating season and high overhead costs that ultimately caused it to go out of business by 1903.\n== Background history ==\n[[File:Prospect House veranda 1882.png|thumb|upright 1.4|Prospect House veranda, circa 1882]]\n[[File:Edison dynamo 1882.png|thumb|upright 0.8| Edison 1882 dynamo used]]\n\nProspect House was a hotel construction project where the guest lodging of Ordway House stood, named after the prospector James Ordway and his wife Mary. Ordways' guest house was built in 1877 on a peninsula point protruding out into Blue Mountain Lake called Prospect Point. It was a two and a half story wood frame structure and was just west of the village of Indian Lake. It could accommodate thirty guests. It received a new name of American House in 1879 and was sold to Frederick C. Durant, associated with a sugar-refining business in New York City. Durant's uncle was railroad financier [[Thomas C. Durant]] who had an interest in Adirondack developments. The younger Durant thought that concept was most interesting, so  planned a 300-room luxury hotel on the tract of land he purchased from the Ordways.{{sfn|Tolles|2003|p=77}}{{sfn|Kaiser|1982|p=47}}\n\nThe foundation construction started for the new hotel in the autumn of 1880. In the spring of 1881 Durant set up a saw mill at the construction site for the boards needed for the new hotel. The design of the new hotel was a T-shaped building, with the top part 255 feet long as the front of the hotel facing the lake. The leg of the \"T\" was 158 feet long connected at the rear to Ordway's original guest house. A veranda porch twenty feet wide and 370 feet long ran along the front and sides of the building. The general architecture resembled the [[Grand Union Hotel (Saratoga Springs, New York)|Grand Union Hotel]] at Saratoga Springs, New York.{{sfn|Hochschild|1952|p=208}}\n\nThe six story Queen Anne style hotel opened in the summer of 1882. The largest suites of the new hotel were on the main floor. The hotel had a restaurant, bowling alley, billiard room, shooting gallery, golf, and lawn tennis for guest amusements. For convenience the hotel facilities were a barber shop, a mail room, a telegraph office, and a library. The hotel had a physician's office and a pharmacy for medical issues. There was an orchestra that performed daily to the 500 guests at the hotel.{{sfn|Tolles|2003|pp=78\u201381}}\n\nThe hotel's outside appearance was not considered good looking, but the inside was posh and luxurious.{{sfn|Donaldson|1921|p=103}} It was the largest hotel in the Adirondacks at the time.

There were no radiators nor valves involved with the steam heat. It came from the steam pipes that ran through the guest room. The pipe was encased in a wooden box with hinged covers. The guest would open the box cover when the room was cold and close it when the room got warm.{{sfn|Hochschild|1952|p=208}} The hotel also came with a steam elevator, a bowling-alley, a shooting gallery, a billiard room, a telegraph office, a deer corral, a windmill, a water tower, and a boathouse.{{sfn|Hochschild|1962|p=28}}\n\nThomas Edison oversaw the electrical system put in the hotel.

One was from high overhead costs of running such a luxurious hotel for a short season in the summer months. Another cause was from the lack of easy access to the hotel, as the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] withdrew its sleeper service from New York City to [[North Creek, New York]], which had saved several hours in travel time. Competition of additional hotels in the Adirondacks took away many of the former guests, when they went to these newer hotels that were easier to get to. There was a couple of cases of [[typhoid fever]] in the area that stopped many guests from coming. Another factor was [[Panic of 1893|the recession of 1893]], when Durant borrowed two large amounts from his brother Howard to stay in business. Ultimately his brother took over the management of the hotel in 1897 to cover the mortgages he furnished. Howard renamed it Hotel Utowana. Due to the overhead costs, lack of easy transportation, and poor management the hotel declined in business and finally went out of business in 1903. The furnishings were sold off and it was torn down in 1915.{{sfn|Hochschild|1952|pp=342\u2013348}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Crabbe|first=Richard E. |title=The Empire of Shadows|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca7R5MgsmZUC&pg=PA42&dq=%22The+Prospect+House+was+unique+in+a+lot+of+ways,+but+first+among+those+was+that+it+had+electric+lights+in+every+room.+It+was+the+first+hotel+in+the+world+to+boast+of+it.%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir6dCetcPYAhXH2lMKHcY8Dk4Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Prospect%20House%20was%20unique%20in%20a%20lot%20of%20ways%2C%20but%20first%20among%20those%20was%20that%20it%20had%20electric%20lights%20in%20every%20room.%20It%20was%20the%20first%20hotel%20in%20the%20world%20to%20boast%20of%20it.%22&f=false |date=April 2005|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-33610-3|quote=The Prospect House was unique in a lot of ways, but first among those was that it had electric lights in every room.

Prince [[Hiranyakasipu]] refused to worship the god Vishnu. The prince's son, [[Prahlada]], loved and was devoted to Vishnu greatly and criticized his father's lack of faith. Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then relented and allowed him to come home. Father and son quickly began to argue about Vishnu's nature. When Prahlada stated that Vishnu was present everywhere, including in the walls of their home, his father kicked a pillar. Vishnu emerged from the pillar in the form of a man with a lion's head, and killed Hiranyakasipu. Prahlada eventually became the king, and had a grandson named [[Mahabali|Bali]]. Bali founded Mahabalipuram on this site.\n\nMyths also mention that Gods were jealous of the architectural elegance of the monuments of Mahablipuram, and as a result they caused floods to occur, which submerged most parts of the city, except for a few structures that are seen now.<ref>{{cite book|author=National Geographic|title=Sacred Places of a Lifetime: 500 of the World's Most Peaceful and Powerful Destinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNqDFSxR8-MC&pg=PA154|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=21 October 2008|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0336-7|pages=154\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram}}\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:Shore temple, mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Shore temple, Mahabalipuram, India.]]\n\n[[File:Seashore temple Mamallapuram.jpg|thumb|SeaShore temple, Mahabalipuram,Tamil Nadu, India.]]\n\nAll the three Temples of the Shore Temple complex are built on the same platform.

A ''[[kalasa]]'' and [[finial]] are fitted above the ''shikhara.'' ''[[gavaksha|kudus]]'' (horseshoe-arch dormer like projections) and small shrines are part of the cornices at both levels of the structure. A Somaskanda panel decorates the back wall of the inner shrine. There is no ''mantapa'' (hall) in front of this shrine (probably damaged). The external walls display two panels.

The circular wall and superstructure are of structural type. There are lions depicted on the pilasters.

The shikhara is erected on a circular ''griva'', which has ''kudus'' and ''maha-nasikas'' on its four sides and each ''nasika'' has an image of [[Ganesha]]. The [[kalasa]] above the shikara is missing.<ref name=Tatva/> The carving of the Bhuvaraha depicts [[Varaha]] as the [[boar]] incarnation of Vishnu. This image is in unusual form, unlike another Varaha depictions in other regions of the country, as there is no [[Bhudevi]] shown nor an ocean.

The pulp treatment absorbs the saline water. In addition, chemical treatment is also given the monument to prevent water seepage into the rock. This kind of treatment is also reported to take out water stored inside the rock thus allowing the stone to breathe and preserve its strength. The area around the Shore Temple, has been beautified. The horticulture wing of the ASI has created a green lawn of 11 acres (4.4 hectares) around the Shore Temple. Fixing of signages with information on the monuments and creating fountains was also part of the beautification programme planned by ASI.<ref name=Front/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram]]\n*[http://undividedtravel.com/a-visit-to-the-grandeurs-of-pallavas-shore-temple/ A visit to the grandeurs of pallavas- Shore temple, Mahabalipuram]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Shore temple ariel.jpg|Aerial view of the Shore Temple\nFile:Shore_temple_2.JPG|Shore Temple, left side\nFile:Shore_temple_3.JPG|Shore Temple, right side\nFile:View of Shore Temple.jpg|Shore Temple, View of Shore Temple\nFile:Shore temple at Mammallapuram.jpg|Shore Temple, Temple Vimanam\nFile:Mahabali006.jpg|Shore Temple, circa 1914.

Prince [[Hiranyakasipu]] refused to worship the god Vishnu. The prince's son, [[Prahlada]], loved and was devoted to Vishnu greatly and criticized his father's lack of faith. Hiranyakasipu banished Prahlada but then relented and allowed him to come home. Father and son quickly began to argue about Vishnu's nature. When Prahlada stated that Vishnu was present everywhere, including in the walls of their home, his father kicked a pillar. Vishnu emerged from the pillar in the form of a man with a lion's head, and killed Hiranyakasipu. Prahlada eventually became the king, and had a grandson named [[Mahabali|Bali]]. Bali founded Mahabalipuram on this site.\n\nMyths also mention that Gods were jealous of the architectural elegance of the monuments of Mahablipuram, and as a result they caused floods to occur, which submerged most parts of the city, except for a few structures that are seen now.<ref>{{cite book|author=National Geographic|title=Sacred Places of a Lifetime: 500 of the World's Most Peaceful and Powerful Destinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNqDFSxR8-MC&pg=PA154|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=21 October 2008|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4262-0336-7|pages=154\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{Main|Group of Monuments at Mahabalipuram}}\n\n===Layout===\n[[File:Shore temple, mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|Shore temple, Mahabalipuram, India.]]\n\n[[File:Seashore temple Mamallapuram.jpg|thumb|SeaShore temple, Mahabalipuram,Tamil Nadu, India.]]\n\nAll the three Temples of the Shore Temple complex are built on the same platform.

The pulp treatment absorbs the saline water. In addition, chemical treatment is also given the monument to prevent water seepage into the rock. This kind of treatment is also reported to take out water stored inside the rock thus allowing the stone to breathe and preserve its strength. The area around the Shore Temple, has been beautified. The horticulture wing of the ASI has created a green lawn of 11 acres (4.4 hectares) around the Shore Temple. Fixing of signages with information on the monuments and creating fountains was also part of the beautification programme planned by ASI.<ref name=Front/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram]]\n*[http://undividedtravel.com/a-visit-to-the-grandeurs-of-pallavas-shore-temple/ A visit to the grandeurs of pallavas- Shore temple, Mahabalipuram]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Shore temple ariel.jpg|Aerial view of the Shore Temple\nFile:Shore_temple_2.JPG|Shore Temple, left side\nFile:Shore_temple_3.JPG|Shore Temple, right side\nFile:View of Shore Temple.jpg|Shore Temple, View of Shore Temple\nFile:Shore temple at Mammallapuram.jpg|Shore Temple, Temple Vimanam\nFile:Mahabali006.jpg|Shore Temple, circa 1914.
