The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.

Development started in 2002 by Andrew Spearin after real-life experiences in the [[Canadian Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/andrew-spearin/|title=Rise Up: Andrew Spearin on Insurgency\u2019s victory|last=Gillen|first=Kieron|publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|date=June 8, 2008}}</ref> Jeremy Blum, [[Red Orchestra (mod)|Red Orchestra Mod]] founder, joined the team along with other developers from the Red Orchestra development team to work on the full Insurgency Mod.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valvetime.net/threads/insurgency.155875/|title=Insurgency Interview with Project Lead Jeremy Blum|publisher=ValveTime.net|date=May 23, 2007}}</ref> The company was founded in 2010, and the Insurgency mod was published under the new company.\n\nAfter the major success of Insurgency, NWI started development on Day of Infamy, another Hardcore Tactical FPS. Taking the Insurgency skeleton, Day of Infamy was set in the European theatre during WWll, featuring locations such as Sicily, Germany, France, United Kingdom and many more. On top of the already impressive number of maps, weapons and gadgets the game also featured a 'Fire Support' option. This new addition allowed for defensive, offensive and supportive assets to be called in such as: strafing runs, artillery barrages, supply crates and more.

Because it was heavily damaged by bombing by the allies, the Japanese occupation in 1944 to build a new runway parallel to the northern side of the runway being used now.\n\nIn 1948 the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration|Dutch government (NICA)]] to continue the construction of the runway with a 10&nbsp;cm thick stone hardening. At the time of the recognition of the sovereignty of [[Republik Indonesia Serikat|RIS]], airfield management ironwood conducted by the Local Government / Public Works Department. Furthermore, the Indonesian government in 1961, management is delegated to the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]], Bureau of Civil Aviation. In 1970, Airports Ulin renamed Airports Syamsudin Noor after an Indonesian aviation hero from [[South Kalimantan|south kalimantan]], Syamsudin Noor<small>([[:id:Syamsudin Noor|id]])</small>. and in 1974 enhanced the ability of its runway constructed to accommodate other aircraft [[Fokker F28 Fellowship|Fokker-28]].\n\nFrom 1975 until 1977 built a new runway being used now, which is able to accommodate aircraft type [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]] is limited.\n\nBased on the Joint Decree of Minister of Defense and Security / Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Transportation and Minister of Finance with No. KEP/30/IX/1975, No. KM/598/5/Phb-75 and No.KEP.927.A/MK/8/1975, concerning set Airports Syamsudin Noor as a civilian airfield fully occupied by the Department of Transportation.\n\nBy virtue of Decree No. KM.213 / HK207 / the un-85, dated 4 November 1985 on the term airport Syamsudin Noor converted into SYAMSUDIN NOOR AIRPORT.\n\nBased on Government Regulation No. 48 of 1992 of 12 April 1992 on the Handover Operations Management Forum Syamsudin Noor Airport to the [[Angkasa Pura|Angkasa Pura I]] and officially Syamsudin Noor Airport Banjarmasin become one of the branches of Perum Angkasa Pura I. Then, based on Government Regulation No. 5 of 1993 dated 2 January 1993, the form of companies Angkasa Pura I changed from Perum Angkasa Pura I became PT. (Persero) Angkasa Pura I.\n\nThrough the development of upgrading the runway in 1994 Syamsudin Noor Airport has been able to accommodate aircraft [[Boeing 737|B-737/300]] at full capacity and the Year 2003 has completed development Syamsudin Noor Airport by the government of South Kalimantan to build a facility extension of Runway to accommodate planes [[Boeing 767|B-767/300 ER]] but its capacity is limited and the construction of apron that can accommodate seven wide-body aircraft B-737 and other supporting facilities.

Historically, Boeing 767-300ER is the first wide-body aircraft which landed on this airport in 2004.\n\nAs the airport was running overcapacity, further development and expansion was required. In early 2013, this airport served 5.5 million passengers, whereas the capacity was only for 4.0 million passengers. In August 2012, about 58 hectares of 102 hectares (57%) of the land needed for the expansion had been acquired.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antaranews.com/en/news/83918/land-cleared-for-s-kalimantan-airport-expansion |title=Land cleared for S.

The ProPulse system fitted uses a modular series-[[Hybrid power|hybrid]] arrangement to simplify the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] of power to the wheels. The [[diesel engine]] powers an [[electric generator]], which provides direct power to the wheels, eliminating the [[torque converter]], [[automatic transmission]], [[transfer case]], and [[drive shaft]]s. A dedicated motor controlled from its own power converters drives each axle independently. ProPulse technology, it is claimed, can increase fuel economy by up to 40% over conventional power trains. The [[diesel engine]] is optimized to run at the most efficient speed based on power demand, and transient loads to the engine are eliminated using stored energy. This eliminates the inefficiency associated with changing [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] levels during [[acceleration]] and [[deceleration]], and also reduces [[emission standard|emissions]]. In stopping operations, the [[electric motor]]s operate as generators, and energy is stored for use in the next [[acceleration]]. Other stated advantages of the system include the system acting as an on-board generator, providing enough [[electricity]] (up to 200 [[kW]] of [[Alternating current|AC]] power) to power a small [[airfield]], hospital, or military command center. Since the system uses no [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], they never need to be replaced, and the amount of fuel needed to supply ProPulse-equipped trucks will be less.<ref name=\"Jane's

The ProPulse system fitted uses a modular series-[[Hybrid power|hybrid]] arrangement to simplify the [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] of power to the wheels. The [[diesel engine]] powers an [[electric generator]], which provides direct power to the wheels, eliminating the [[torque converter]], [[automatic transmission]], [[transfer case]], and [[drive shaft]]s. A dedicated motor controlled from its own power converters drives each axle independently. ProPulse technology, it is claimed, can increase fuel economy by up to 40% over conventional power trains. The [[diesel engine]] is optimized to run at the most efficient speed based on power demand, and transient loads to the engine are eliminated using stored energy. This eliminates the inefficiency associated with changing [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] levels during [[acceleration]] and [[deceleration]], and also reduces [[emission standard|emissions]]. In stopping operations, the [[electric motor]]s operate as generators, and energy is stored for use in the next [[acceleration]]. Other stated advantages of the system include the system acting as an on-board generator, providing enough [[electricity]] (up to 200 [[kW]] of [[Alternating current|AC]] power) to power a small [[airfield]], hospital, or military command center. Since the system uses no [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], they never need to be replaced, and the amount of fuel needed to supply ProPulse-equipped trucks will be less.<ref name=\"Jane's

Roadmasters produced between 1936 and 1958 were built on Buick's longest non-limousine wheelbase and shared their basic structure with entry-level [[Cadillac]] and, after 1940, senior [[Oldsmobile]]s. Between 1946 and 1957 the Roadmaster served as Buick's flagship.\n\nWhen it was resurrected for the 1991 through 1996 model years, it became the marque's largest vehicle. The Roadmaster sedan, a [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the [[GM B platform|B-body]] for the first time in its history. It was a full {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer with a {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} greater wheelbase than the [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] [[Buick Park Avenue]].  It was also larger both in wheelbase ({{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) and overall length ({{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) than the [[GM K platform (1980)|K-body]] [[Cadillac_de_Ville_series#Seventh_generation_(1994\u20131999)|Cadillac DeVille]].\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==1931-1933==\n[[File:Buick 87 4-D\u00f6rrars Sedan 1932.jpg|thumb|right|1932 Buick Series 80 Sedan]]\nThe Series 80, which belonged to an upper category trim package, had a {{convert|5650|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} straight eight engine developing {{convert|104|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 2,800 rpm. The next year  a new high performance engine was introduced developing {{convert|113|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1933, the model was completely revised. At the end of 1933 the 80 series was discontinued after 24,117 units produced. In 1936 the model was re-introduced and changed its name to \"Series 80 Roadmaster\".\n\n==1936\u20131937==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image= 1936BuickSedan.jpg\n|model_years=1936\u20131937\n|assembly= [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout = \n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style=4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1936_Buick/1936_Buick_Brochure_1/1936%20Buick-14.html |title=1936 Buick brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n|transmission =3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|wheelbase ={{convert|131.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1937\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1937_Buick/1937_Buick_Brochure/1937%20Buick-33.html |title=1937 Buick brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>\n|length ={{convert|210.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width ={{convert|75.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height =1936: {{convert|69.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1937: {{convert|68.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4300|-|4500|lb|kg|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac V-12|Cadillac Series 80]]<br />[[Cadillac Series 70]]<br>[[Cadillac Series 65]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\nThe origins of the Roadmaster name date to 1936 when Buick added names to its entire model lineup to celebrate the engineering improvements and design advancements over their 1935 models. Buick's Series 40 was named the [[Buick Special|Special]], the Series 50 became the [[Buick Super|Super]], the Series 60 was named the [[Buick Century|Century]] and the Series 90 \u2014 Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicle \u2014 was named the [[Buick Limited|Limited]]. The Series 50 was retired, but new for the model year was the Series 80 Roadmaster. The implications of the name were clear, for as the 1936 Buick sales catalogue said, \"It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway.\"\n\nThe Roadmaster was introduced in a year when Buick's [[Overhead valve|valve-in-head]] straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick's larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1937\"/>\n\nThe Roadmaster was a big car, in sedan form tipping the scales at 4,098 pounds, some 88 pounds heavier than Cadillac's new [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]]. But pricewise, the Roadmaster was a tremendous bargain. The sedan sold for $1,255, $440 less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style available was a four-door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 (of which only 1064 were produced), at a time when a Cadillac in the same body style sold at prices ranging from $2,745 to $7,850. Buick's new engineering and styling was a big hit, with model year sales more than tripling from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000, and with the all new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing a total of 16,049 units to that number.\n\n[[File:1937 Buick Roadmaster Series 80 sedan, front right side.jpg|thumb|left|1937 Buick Roadmaster sedan]]\nWith the Roadmaster being a completely new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, one might have expected only modest changes for 1937. But that was not the case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up with the rest of the GM marques. For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==1938\u20131939==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}[[File:Buick Roadmaster Series 80 4-Dorrars Touring Sedan 1938.jpg|thumb|left|1938 Roadmaster]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Buick 80C Roadmaster 4-Dorrars Convertible Sedan 1938 3.jpg\n|model_years=1938\u20131939\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style =4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]\n|transmission =3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|wheelbase ={{convert|133.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length ={{convert|213.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width ={{convert|75.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height ={{convert|68.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight ={{convert|4200|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related =[[Cadillac Series 65]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n[[File:The spring and shock absorber hook-up on the rear wheel of the 1938 Buick chassis.jpg|left|thumb|Spring and shock absorber mechanism on the rear wheels of the 1938 Buicks]]\nStyling changes for 1938 were modest, with a longer hood extending to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, but the effect was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four times the size of any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new \"turbulator\" pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141.\n\nThe 4-door convertible phaeton traded its built-in trunk look for a fastback appearance, and a new fastback sedan was added to the line with 466 being sold. The Roadmaster's price was increased, but not as swiftly as the previous year, going to $1,645 for the sedan. Although Buick's overall market share increased in an off year, Roadmaster sales plummeted to 5,568, falling from 7.3 percent to 3.3 percent of Buick's total output.\n\nStyling for 1939 featured a new two-piece \u201cwaterfall\u201d grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. Window area increased substantially with the rear window changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to in front of the driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the latter were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1,545) sales only rose to 6,097, with Roadmaster's share of Buick's total sales falling to 2.9 percent.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1940\u20131941==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Third generation\n|image = 1941 Buick sedan.JPG\n|model_years = 1940\u20131941\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>2-door [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]\n|transmission = 3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1940: {{convert|214.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1941: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = 1940: {{convert|75.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1941: {{convert|76.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|66.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4200|-|4600|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle Series 52]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 90/96/98]]<br/>[[Pontiac Torpedo]]\n| esigner = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\nIn 1940 the Series 80 was renamed Limited. The Roadmaster name was transferred to the new Series 70, which was introduced at the same time as a brand new Series 50 [[Buick Super|Super]]. The Roadmaster featured a cutting-edge \"torpedo\" [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]. The new C-body that the 1940 Buick Roadmaster shared with the Super, the [[Cadillac Series 62]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]], and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5\" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3\" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].\n\nThe 1940 Roadmaster had a shorter wheelbase, was lighter, and was less expensive than the previous year's model. The formal and fastback sedans were gone, but for the first time a 2-door coupe was available, which sold a respectable 3,991 units. Also new for this year, the coach-building firm of [[Brunn & Company|Brunn]] was asked to design several custom-bodied Buicks for the Series 70, 80 and 90. Only one Roadmaster example is known to have actually been produced in 1940, an open-front town car not surprisingly called the Townmaster. Overall sales more than tripled to 18,345.\n\nThe styling changes for 1941 were modest, but the changes under the hood were major. The compression ratio was raised from 6.6:1 to 7.0:1, the \"turbulator\" pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were substituted for the previous type and \u201cCompound Carburetion\u201d was introduced. Compound Carburetion was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor, and consisted of twin two-barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine delivered 165 horsepower. With five more horsepower than a senior [[Packard]], 15 more than any Cadillac, and 25 more than the largest [[Chrysler]]s, it was the most powerful engine available that year on an American car.\n\nA new bodystyle for this year was a 2-door convertible, which sold 1,845 units. There was also one Brunn designed convertible produced, but priced at $3,500 actual orders for the vehicle failed to appear. Overall sales remained respectable at 15,372.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1942\u20131948==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}[[File:'47 Buick Eight (Auto classique VACM mardis '11).JPG|thumb|left|1947 Buick Roadmaster]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fourth generation\n|image = Buick Roadmaster Convertible 1947.jpg\n|model_years = 1942\u20131948\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Kansas City, Kansas]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>2-door Sedanet [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>4-door [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]\n|transmission = 3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>2-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|129.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1942: {{convert|217.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1946\u201347: {{convert|217.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1948: {{convert|217.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|78.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height ={{convert|66.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4200|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\nThe 1942 Roadmaster was longer, lower, wider, and roomier than before (a [[Harley Earl]] trademark), thanks in part to a longer wheelbase. There was also a new vertical-bar grille and \"Airfoil\" fenders that swept back all the way to the rear fenders, which in subsequent generations became the chromed \"[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]\". Both features became a Buick icon exhibited in one way or another for years to come, and were influenced by the [[concept car]] called the [[Buick Y-Job]]. The 4-door phaeton was dropped and would never return. Coupes adopted the appealing Sedanet [[fastback]] style that had been the sensation of 1941 on the [[Buick Century|Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]].\n\nEffective at the beginning of 1942, new automobiles were available only to those in occupations deemed essential to the war effort. By mid-January, cars with no exterior chrome trim apart from the bumpers were being produced. By February passenger car production was shut down completely. Despite the abbreviated model year a total of about 8,400 were sold.\n\nWhen postwar automobile production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome was more sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans as well as coupes, and a war-inspired \"bombsight\" hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the bumper guard front and rear. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. As a consequence the 1946 Roadmaster's horsepower fell from 165 to 144. Torque on the other hand was hardly affected. Nevertheless, Roadmaster's I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top of the line Chrysler's. Owing to wartime inflation, prices were substantially higher than those of pre-war models. The biggest change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from four percent in 1941 to 20 percent in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold.\n\nIn 1947 a new stamped grille with a separate upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front and rear. All new was an [[Buick Estate|Estate]] wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became the top of the line in the station wagon market.\n\nIn 1948 a series script appeared on the front fenders and the white Tenite steering wheel that had been used previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels trimmed in leatherette. Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of [[Dynaflow]], the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year,<ref>https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1936-1992-buick-roadmaster4.htm</ref> it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1949\u20131953==\n[[File:1949 buick roadmaster.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Buick Roadmaster]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fifth generation\n|image = 1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera Coup\u00e9 - Flickr - exfordy.jpg\n|model_years = 1949\u20131953\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Wilmington, Delaware]], U.S.<br>[[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Kansas City, Kansas]], U.S.<br>[[Framingham, Massachusetts]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>2-door Sedanet [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>4-door [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]]<br>2-door [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]<br>{{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#322|''Nailhead'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 2-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = 1949: {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1949_Buick/1949%20Buick%20Brochure/1949%20Buick%20Brochure-13.html |title=1949 Buick brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref><br>1950-52 Riviera sedans: {{convert|130.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1950\u201352 others: {{convert|126.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 Riviera sedans: {{convert|125.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 others: {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1949: {{convert|214.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1950 Riviera sedans: {{convert|214.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1950 others: {{convert|210.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1951\u201352 Riviera sedans: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1951-52 others: {{convert|211.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 Riviera sedans: {{convert|211.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 others: {{convert|207.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|63.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4200|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Cadillac Series 61]]<br/>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Buick Convertible 1949.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible]]\n[[File:1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate wagon]]\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster 2-Dorrars HT 1951.jpg|thumb|left|1951 Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe]]\n[[File:1953 Buick Roadmaster Riviera sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Buick Roadmaster Riviera Sedan]]\n[[File:Buick Skylark Convertible Coupe 1953.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Buick Roadmaster Skylark convertible]]\nThe Roadmaster received its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased. The biggest change was a much larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an \u201c[[observation car]].\u201d It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]].\" Four were displayed on each of the Roadmaster's front fenders,<ref>{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}</ref> with three on the fenders of the Super, Century, and Special. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car's hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief [[Harlow Curtice]] was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the relative displacement of the [[straight-eight engine]] installed.\n\nDynaflow was now standard equipment, and engine horsepower was increased to 150 through a slight increase in the compression ratio. This contributed in conjunction with the now standard Dynaflow in giving the new Buicks a top speed of {{convert|110|mph|0|abbr=on}}. In the middle of the year the Riviera, joined the body style lineup selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the 2-door Buick Roadmaster [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], along with the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac De Ville|Coupe de Ville]] and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, was among the first [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced. The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional \"[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]\" chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the tail-light. The \"Riviera trim\", as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the model year. With a total of 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27 percent of all Buick sales, a remarkably high proportion in light of its price, which was only slightly less than a [[Cadillac Series 61]].\n\nThe 1950 restyling featured a grille so toothy that ''Consumer Reports'' commented that \"a toothbrush for the dentures comes extra.\" The Sweepspear had proved so popular in its first year that it was made standard on most body styles at the beginning of the 1950 model year, and on the station wagon and the new long wheelbase sedan mid-year. The long wheelbase sedan was stretched an extra four inches (102&nbsp;mm). Like the convertibles, the Riviera and the extra plush long wheelbase sedan came with both power windows and power seats as standard equipment. Overall Roadmaster sales fell to 75,034, with Roadmaster's share of total Buick output plummeting to 12 percent, thanks mainly to the surging popularity of the Special.\n\nIn 1951 the long wheelbase sedan was also called a Riviera although it was not a hardtop. The Sedanet and regular wheelbase sedan were cancelled.\n\nStyling changes were minimal in 1951 and 1952. Power steering was added as an option in 1952 and horsepower climbed to 170 thanks primarily to a new four-barrel carburetor. Sales continued to slide falling to about 66,000 in 1951 and to 51,000 in 1952.\n\nBy 1953 the Roadmaster straight-eight was 16 years old and had become seriously dated. All of Roadmaster's major competitors had shifted to short-stroke V-8 engines, and if Buick wanted to continue to be the paragon of longer, lower and wider, it needed one of its own. The new engine was ready in time for 1953, Buick's Golden Anniversary year. Although the [[Buick V8 engine#322|Nailhead]] (as it was popularly called) was nearly identical in displacement to the straight eight [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] (322 versus 320 cubic inches), it was {{convert|13.5|in|mm}} shorter, four inches (102&nbsp;mm) lower, and {{convert|180|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter, but with {{convert|188|hp|0|abbr=on}}, it was 11 percent more powerful. The compression ratio increased from 7.50:1 to 8.50:1 and torque increased from {{convert|280 to 300|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe compact dimensions of the V-8 engine enabled Buick to reduce Roadmaster's wheelbase by {{convert|4.75|in|mm}} across the line, although styling differences behind the engine cowl, apart from new V-8 emblem hubcaps, were largely nonexistent. Buick also introduced a new \"Twin-Turbine\" Dynaflow as a companion for the V-8 engine. Estimated to increase torque at the wheels by 10 percent, the new transmission provided faster and quieter acceleration at reduced engine speeds. Both power steering and power brakes were made standard. Air conditioning was a new option and, years before many other makes, a 12-volt electrical system was adopted.\n\nA new body style for 1953 was the [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta and the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. The Skylark featured open wheel wells, a drastically lowered belt line, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster's windshield, the absence of VentiPorts and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick's 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At $5,000 only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become its own series built on a Century body. This was the last year for the Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-bodied station wagon]] mass-produced in the [[United States]]. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at $4,031, the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall Roadmaster sales bounced back up to 79,137.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1954\u20131956==\n[[File:1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible rear.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible rear]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Sixth generation\n|image = 1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible front.jpg\n|model_years = 1954\u20131956\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Wilmington, Delaware]], U.S.<br>[[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Kansas City, Kansas]], U.S.<br>[[Framingham, Massachusetts]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.<br>[[Arlington, Texas]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[sedan (car)|hardtop]]<br>2-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#322|''Nailhead'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 2-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1954: {{convert|216.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1955: {{convert|216.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956: {{convert|213.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|62.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4400|-|4600|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br/>[[Buick Super]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster 1957.jpg|thumb|left|1955 Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe]]\nIn 1954 Buick Roadmaster and [[Buick Super|Super]] shared with [[Cadillac]] and [[Oldsmobile 98]] the new General Motors [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]], adopting the new \"[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]\" appearance, and the addition of \"[[Dagmar bumpers]]\" to the front. These were large, roomy cars, as much as five and a half inches longer in wheelbase and more than nine inches (229&nbsp;mm) longer overall than in 1953.

Overall sales dropped to 50,571 (which is 11.37 percent of model year production)<ref>https://www.hometownbuick.com/1954-buick/1954-buick-production/</ref>.\n\nIn 1955 broad lower rear fender bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck script and hood ornament, bars on the hubcaps and gold-accented grille were added to distinguish Roadmaster. Horsepower jumped to 236, and a new variable-pitch [[Dynaflow]], in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back up lights were now standard.

Front hip room was 65.3-in.<ref>{{cite news |title=Compare the 1957 cars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181&dq=Buick+Roadmaster&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiL4JLB2c7nAhUPHzQIHY2HDBQQ6AEwA3oECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=Buick%20Roadmaster&f=false |accessdate=13 February 2020 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=February 1957}}</ref> There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]] proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this \"sales plunge\" was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which effected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.\n\nFor 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/|title= Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo|publisher= gmphotostore.com|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/|archivedate= 2015-10-17}}</ref> The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.\n\nIn 1958 the Roadmaster could only be ordered as the well equipped Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new \"drawer pull\" grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For the first time since 1948 there were no distinguishing [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.\n\nThere was a complete restyling for 1959, but this time the names of the various series were changed. Not until 1991 would there again be a big Buick known as the Roadmaster; the largest Buick models were renamed the [[Buick Electra|Electra]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==1991\u20131996==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Eighth generation\n| image = Buick-Roadmaster-Sedan.jpg\n| aka =\n| model_years = 1991\u20131996\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>5-door [[station wagon]]\n| platform = [[GM B platform]]\n| designer = Wayne Kady (1989)\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|115.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 5.0 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#L03|''L03'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>5.7 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#L05|''L05'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>5.7 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#LT1|''LT1'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|4L60]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed [[GM 4L60-E transmission|4L60-E]] automatic\n| length = {{convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br> {{convert|217.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1991\u201393 wagon)<br>{{convert|217.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1994\u201396 wagon)\n| width = {{convert|78.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br> {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| height = {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br> {{convert|60.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| weight = {{convert|4400|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| assembly = [[Arlington, Texas]], U.S.\n| related = [[Buick Estate]]<br>[[Chevrolet Caprice#Fourth generation (1991\u20131996)|Chevrolet Caprice]]<br>[[Chevrolet Impala#Seventh generation (Impala SS, 1994\u20131996)|Chevrolet Impala SS]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser#Third generation (1991\u20131992)|Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br>\n| predecessor = [[Buick LeSabre#Fifth generation (1977-1985)|Buick LeSabre]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1995 Buick Roadmaster Limited rvl.jpg|thumb|left|1995 Buick Roadmaster Limited sedan]]\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster wagon.jpg|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster estate wagon rear.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon]]\n[[File:1993-Buick-Roadmaster-Estate-i.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Estate Wagon interior]]\n\nThe ''Roadmaster'' name returned to the Buick line for the 1991 model year after a 33-year absence, with the third generation [[Buick Estate Wagon#1977-1990|Buick Estate]] wagon becoming the [[Buick_Estate#1991-1996|Roadmaster Estate]]. A four-door sedan was added to the Roadmaster line for the 1992 model year, the first rear-wheel drive Buick sedan since 1985. Combined sales showed an over ''tenfold'' increase over '91 thanks in part to an extended production run which had 1992 models going on sale in March 1991.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Chassis ===\nAs with its precursor, the new Roadmaster Estate wagon was based on GM's [[full-size car|full-size]] [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM B platform|B platform]], which was closely related to the GM [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] and [[GM D platform|D-body]] chassis reserved for top of the line Buicks and Cadillacs. It rode on the same 115.9-inch wheelbase in use since the wagon series was downsized from the C-body in 1977, yet was three inches shorter than the 1990 model. \n\nThe Roadmaster sedan, a C-body vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the B-body for the first time in its history. Nonetheless, it stood not only as the largest Buick, a full 10\" longer with a 5\" greater wheelbase than the apparent top-of-the-line C-bodied [[Buick_Park_Avenue#First_generation|Buick Park Avenue]], but larger both in wheelbase (2\") and overall length (6\") than the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] [[Cadillac_de_Ville_series#Seventh_generation|Cadillac Sedan de Ville]].\n\n=== Powertrain ===\nThe standard engine for the 1991 wagon was a {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.0-L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L03|Chevrolet small-block]] V8. It was replaced a year later with a {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.7-L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L05|Chevrolet small-block]] V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994 both received a modified version of the advanced 5.7-L [[Fuel injection#Multipoint fuel injection|sequential point fuel-injection]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#LT1|LT1]] V8, increasing output to {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and substantially improved performance.\n\nDerived from the 300&nbsp;hp LT1 debuted in the 1992 Chevrolet Corvette, the Roadmaster version was shared both with other B-and D platform luxury and performance cars such as the [[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|Chevrolet Caprice Police Package]] and [[Cadillac_Fleetwood#1993-1996|Cadillac Fleetwood]] and GM's specialty [[GM F platform|F-bodied]] [[Chevrolet_Camaro#Fourth generation (1993\u20132002)|Chevrolet Camaro Z28]] and [[Pontiac Firebird#Fourth generation (1993\u20132002)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]. It differed in the use of iron heads for durability, camshafts tuned for increased low-end torque, and intake silencers to decrease drive-by noise (only in engines used in luxury-brand cars).\n\nWhile installed in part to better comply with emissions and fuel-economy standards, the LT1 V8 not only offered an 80hp power increase but raised rated fuel economy by 1 mpg, to 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway. As a result of this significantly boosted engine output General Motors limited the softer-riding Roadmaster (which ran on lower [[Speed rating|speed-rated]] tires than used on the Corvette) to a top speed of {{convert|108|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. For 1996, the LT1 became OBD-II compliant.\n\nAll three V-8s were paired to a four-speed automatic transmission. In 1994, the hydraulically-controlled 4L60 (700R4) transmission was replaced by the electronically-controlled 4L60E.\n\nWhen ordered with the factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to {{convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. For the station wagon, this could be raised to 7000 pounds with the use of a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire pressure to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control.<ref>{{cite book|title=1995 Buick Roadmaster Owner's Manual|publisher=General Motors Corporation|year=1994|edition=First|pages=4\u201334|chapter=4}}</ref> The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.\n\n=== Body ===\nThe Roadmaster Estate wagon shared its body with the Caprice Estate and [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]; common styling features included the Caprice's headlights and the Custom Cruiser's 2nd-row \"Vista Roof\" with sunroof. [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|Simulated woodgrain]] sides were standard, though the treatment could be deleted for credit. All three wagons offered an optional rear-facing third-row seat, bringing seating capacity to eight. The Roadmaster sedan had a distinct fascia, featuring its own grille and headlights stacked above running lights and turn signals. It shared a formal sedan roofline with the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]], but rode on a wheelbase nearly six inches shorter.\n\nThe interior received a redesign for the 1994 model year which included new dual airbags, moving some instrument panel gauges closer to the steering wheel, and revisions to the radio and climate controls. Folding sideview mirrors moved forward from their previous location in 1995\u201396. The '95 Roadmaster retained its skirted rear wheels (deleted from the Caprice/Impala SS), while the sedan was updated with new bodyside moldings. Station wagons saw a shade for the Vista Roof along with a cargo cover. In 1996 automatic climate control became standard, and the rear seatbelts were redesigned with a \"cinching\" feature.\n\n=== Discontinuation ===\nA combination of overcrowding among Buick's high-end sedans and pressure from [[full-size SUV]]s on the Estate wagon led to both Roadmasters being discontinued after the 1996 model year; the final vehicle was produced on December 13, 1996.<ref name=\"Wards97\">{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1997}}</ref> With Ford having eliminated its Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons in 1991, the passing of the Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate marked the end of the full-size station wagon in North America until the introduction of the [[ Dodge Magnum#Chrysler LX platform 2005\u20132008|Dodge Magnum]] in 2005.\n\nAnother factor behind the discontinuation of the GM B-body line was the growth of the [[full-size SUV]] segment, which impacted both sedan and wagon sales. Additionally, a strong upswing in the longstanding body-on-frame [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevrolet/GMC Suburban]] offered truck-based durability, four-wheel drive, and much higher profit margins. In 1996, the [[Arlington Assembly]] facility in Texas was converted to assemble SUVs and pickup trucks, leaving the B-platform without an assembly line. It would be an entire decade before GMC capitalized on the full-sized [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] evolution with the introduction of the [[GMC Acadia]] and its derivatives sold by Buick, Chevrolet, and Saturn.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+'''Production Figures<ref>The Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition</ref>'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Units\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1991 || 7,291 (wagon only)\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1992 || 85,309\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1993 || 40,449\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1994 || 38,909\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1995 || 30,508\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1996 || 22,989\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:silver;\"| Total production = 225,455\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://consumerguide.com/used/1991-96-buick-roadmaster/ Consumer guide to the 1991-96 Buick Roadmaster]\n{{Buick Vehicles}}\n{{Buick postwar timeline}}\n{{Buick}}\n\n[[Category:Buick vehicles|Roadmaster]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:1950s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Flagship vehicles]]\n[[Category:Luxury vehicles]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=May 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n|image=Buick Roadmaster -- 04-22-2010.jpg\n|name=Buick Roadmaster\n|manufacturer=[[General Motors]]\n|production=1935\u20131958<br>1990\u20131996\n|model_years=1936\u20131958<br>1991\u20131996\n|class=[[Full-size car]]\n|layout = [[FR layout]]\n}}\n\nThe '''Buick Roadmaster''' is an automobile that was built by [[Buick]] from 1936 to 1958, and again from 1991 to 1996. Roadmasters produced between 1936 and 1958 were built on Buick's longest non-limousine wheelbase and shared their basic structure with entry-level [[Cadillac]] and, after 1940, senior [[Oldsmobile]]s. Between 1946 and 1957 the Roadmaster served as Buick's flagship.\n\nWhen it was resurrected for the 1991 through 1996 model years, it became the marque's largest vehicle. The Roadmaster sedan, a [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the [[GM B platform|B-body]] for the first time in its history. It was a full {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} longer with a {{convert|5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} greater wheelbase than the [[GM C platform (FWD)|C-body]] [[Buick Park Avenue]].  It was also larger both in wheelbase ({{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) and overall length ({{convert|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) than the [[GM K platform (1980)|K-body]] [[Cadillac_de_Ville_series#Seventh_generation_(1994\u20131999)|Cadillac DeVille]].\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==1931-1933==\n[[File:Buick 87 4-D\u00f6rrars Sedan 1932.jpg|thumb|right|1932 Buick Series 80 Sedan]]\nThe Series 80, which belonged to an upper category trim package, had a {{convert|5650|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on|disp=flip}} straight eight engine developing {{convert|104|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 2,800 rpm. The next year  a new high performance engine was introduced developing {{convert|113|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. In 1933, the model was completely revised. At the end of 1933 the 80 series was discontinued after 24,117 units produced.

Buick's Series 40 was named the [[Buick Special|Special]], the Series 50 became the [[Buick Super|Super]], the Series 60 was named the [[Buick Century|Century]] and the Series 90 \u2014 Buick's largest and most luxurious vehicle \u2014 was named the [[Buick Limited|Limited]]. The Series 50 was retired, but new for the model year was the Series 80 Roadmaster. The implications of the name were clear, for as the 1936 Buick sales catalogue said, \"It literally named itself the first time a test model leveled out on the open highway.\"\n\nThe Roadmaster was introduced in a year when Buick's [[Overhead valve|valve-in-head]] straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buick\u2019s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic brakes. Coil springs were in the front.<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1937\"/>\n\nThe Roadmaster was a big car, in sedan form tipping the scales at 4,098 pounds, some 88 pounds heavier than Cadillac's new [[Cadillac Series 60|Series 60]]. But pricewise, the Roadmaster was a tremendous bargain. The sedan sold for $1,255, $440 less than the least expensive Cadillac. The only other body style available was a four-door convertible phaeton, priced at $1,565 (of which only 1064 were produced), at a time when a Cadillac in the same body style sold at prices ranging from $2,745 to $7,850. Buick\u2019s new engineering and styling was a big hit, with model year sales more than tripling from just over 48,000 to nearly 158,000, and with the all new Series 80 Roadmaster contributing a total of 16,049 units to that number.\n\n[[File:1937 Buick Roadmaster Series 80 sedan, front right side.jpg|thumb|left|1937 Buick Roadmaster sedan]]\nWith the Roadmaster being a completely new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, one might have expected only modest changes for 1937. But that was not the case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up with the rest of the GM marques. For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by {{convert|1.5|in|mm}} without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake manifold, oil pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==1938\u20131939==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}[[File:Buick Roadmaster Series 80 4-Dorrars Touring Sedan 1938.jpg|thumb|left|1938 Roadmaster]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Buick 80C Roadmaster 4-Dorrars Convertible Sedan 1938 3.jpg\n|model_years=1938\u20131939\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style =4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]\n|transmission =3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|wheelbase ={{convert|133.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length ={{convert|213.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width ={{convert|75.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height ={{convert|68.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight ={{convert|4200|-|5100|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related =[[Cadillac Series 65]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n[[File:The spring and shock absorber hook-up on the rear wheel of the 1938 Buick chassis.jpg|left|thumb|Spring and shock absorber mechanism on the rear wheels of the 1938 Buicks]]\nStyling changes for 1938 were modest, with a longer hood extending to a now nearly vertical grill, taller bumper guards and redesigned hubcaps, but the effect was striking. Important changes were made to both engine and chassis. The ride was improved by replacing the rear leaf springs with coil springs, supported by double-acting shock absorbers that were some four times the size of any others on the market. The frame X-member was changed from I-beam to channel construction and all wood structural elements were replaced with steel. The engine combustion chambers were redesigned and new \"turbulator\" pistons raised the compression ratio from 5.9 to 6.5:1, resulting in an increase in horsepower to 141.\n\nThe 4-door convertible phaeton traded its built-in trunk look for a fastback appearance, and a new fastback sedan was added to the line with 466 being sold. The Roadmaster's price was increased, but not as swiftly as the previous year, going to $1,645 for the sedan. Although Buick\u2019s overall market share increased in an off year, Roadmaster sales plummeted to 5,568, falling from 7.3 percent to 3.3 percent of Buick's total output.\n\nStyling for 1939 featured a new two-piece \u201cwaterfall\u201d grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. Window area increased substantially with the rear window changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to in front of the driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the latter were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1,545) sales only rose to 6,097, with Roadmaster\u2019s share of Buick\u2019s total sales falling to 2.9 percent.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1940\u20131941==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Third generation\n|image = 1941 Buick sedan.JPG\n|model_years = 1940\u20131941\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>2-door [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]\n|transmission = 3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1940: {{convert|214.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1941: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = 1940: {{convert|75.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1941: {{convert|76.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|66.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4200|-|4600|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[LaSalle (automobile)|LaSalle Series 52]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile 90/96/98]]<br/>[[Pontiac Torpedo]]\n| esigner = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\nIn 1940 the Series 80 was renamed Limited. The Roadmaster name was transferred to the new Series 70, which was introduced at the same time as a brand new Series 50 [[Buick Super|Super]]. The Roadmaster featured a cutting-edge \"torpedo\" [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]. The new C-body that the 1940 Buick Roadmaster shared with the Super, the [[Cadillac Series 62]], the [[Oldsmobile 98|Oldsmobile Series 90]], and the [[Pontiac Torpedo]] featured shoulder and hip room that was over 5\" wider, the elimination of running boards and exterior styling that was streamlined and 2-3\" lower. When combined with a column mounted shift lever the cars offered true six passenger comfort. These changes had clearly been influenced by the [[Cadillac Sixty Special]].\n\nThe 1940 Roadmaster had a shorter wheelbase, was lighter, and was less expensive than the previous year\u2019s model. The formal and fastback sedans were gone, but for the first time a 2-door coupe was available, which sold a respectable 3,991 units. Also new for this year, the coach-building firm of [[Brunn & Company|Brunn]] was asked to design several custom-bodied Buicks for the Series 70, 80 and 90. Only one Roadmaster example is known to have actually been produced in 1940, an open-front town car not surprisingly called the Townmaster. Overall sales more than tripled to 18,345.\n\nThe styling changes for 1941 were modest, but the changes under the hood were major. The compression ratio was raised from 6.6:1 to 7.0:1, the \"turbulator\" pistons were redesigned, smaller spark plugs were substituted for the previous type and \u201cCompound Carburetion\u201d was introduced. Compound Carburetion was the forerunner of the modern four-barrel carburetor, and consisted of twin two-barrel carburetors. One unit operated all of the time, while the other operated only under hard acceleration. The new engine delivered 165 horsepower. With five more horsepower than a senior [[Packard]], 15 more than any Cadillac, and 25 more than the largest [[Chrysler]]s, it was the most powerful engine available that year on an American car.\n\nA new bodystyle for this year was a 2-door convertible, which sold 1,845 units. There was also one Brunn designed convertible produced, but priced at $3,500 actual orders for the vehicle failed to appear. Overall sales remained respectable at 15,372.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1942\u20131948==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}[[File:'47 Buick Eight (Auto classique VACM mardis '11).JPG|thumb|left|1947 Buick Roadmaster]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fourth generation\n|image = Buick Roadmaster Convertible 1947.jpg\n|model_years = 1942\u20131948\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Kansas City, Kansas]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>2-door Sedanet [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>4-door [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]\n|transmission = 3-speed sliding shift [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>2-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|129.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1942: {{convert|217.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1946\u201347: {{convert|217.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1948: {{convert|217.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|78.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height ={{convert|66.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4200|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\nThe 1942 Roadmaster was longer, lower, wider, and roomier than before (a [[Harley Earl]] trademark), thanks in part to a longer wheelbase. There was also a new vertical-bar grille and \"Airfoil\" fenders that swept back all the way to the rear fenders, which in subsequent generations became the chromed \"[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]\". Both features became a Buick icon exhibited in one way or another for years to come, and were influenced by the [[concept car]] called the [[Buick Y-Job]]. The 4-door phaeton was dropped and would never return. Coupes adopted the appealing Sedanet [[fastback]] style that had been the sensation of 1941 on the [[Buick Century|Century]] and [[Buick Special|Special]].\n\nEffective at the beginning of 1942, new automobiles were available only to those in occupations deemed essential to the war effort. By mid-January, cars with no exterior chrome trim apart from the bumpers were being produced. By February passenger car production was shut down completely. Despite the abbreviated model year a total of about 8,400 were sold.\n\nWhen postwar automobile production resumed in the 1946 model year, chrome was more sparingly applied, swept-back fenders were fitted to sedans as well as coupes, and a war-inspired \"bombsight\" hood ornament was adopted. The instrument panel was two-toned with woodgrain facings except on convertibles which used body-colored panels. Series identification was found on cloisonne emblems centered in the bumper guard front and rear. Compound Carburetion was eliminated and the compression ratio was reduced to 6.60:1. As a consequence the 1946 Roadmaster's horsepower fell from 165 to 144. Torque on the other hand was hardly affected. Nevertheless, Roadmaster\u2019s I-8 still produced more horsepower than a top of the line Chrysler's. Owing to wartime inflation, prices were substantially higher than those of pre-war models. The biggest change was in sales proportions. Roadmaster increased its share of Buick sales from four percent in 1941 to 20 percent in 1946, with a total of about 31,400 sold.\n\nIn 1947 a new stamped grille with a separate upper bar was used. The Roadmaster name appeared in red-filled script on a chrome button within the bumper guard crossbars, front and rear. All new was an [[Buick Estate|Estate]] wagon body style. It sold 300 units and instantly became the top of the line in the station wagon market.\n\nIn 1948 a series script appeared on the front fenders and the white Tenite steering wheel that had been used previously was traded in for a black one, in order match the change from a two-tone woodgrain instrument panel to a two-tone gray instrument panel, with silver tone instruments. A new optional custom trim option was offered, consisting of cloth upholstery with leather bolsters with the robe cord cover and lower door panels trimmed in leatherette. Convertibles acquired power windows, seat and top as standard equipment. But the biggest advancement was the introduction of [[Dynaflow]], the first passenger car torque converter transmission. Optional on Roadmaster in its first year,<ref>https://auto.howstuffworks.com/1936-1992-buick-roadmaster4.htm</ref> it was so popular that by the following it was standard equipment. Overall sales were just under 80,000 in both 1947 and 1948, over four times greater than in any prewar year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1949\u20131953==\n[[File:1949 buick roadmaster.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Buick Roadmaster]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Fifth generation\n|image = 1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera Coup\u00e9 - Flickr - exfordy.jpg\n|model_years = 1949\u20131953\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Wilmington, Delaware]], U.S.<br>[[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Kansas City, Kansas]], U.S.<br>[[Framingham, Massachusetts]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>2-door Sedanet [[coupe]]<br>2-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br>4-door [[Buick Estate|Estate]] [[station wagon|wagon]]<br>2-door [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|320|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick Straight-8 engine|''Fireball'']] [[Straight-eight engine|I8]]<br>{{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#322|''Nailhead'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 2-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = 1949: {{convert|126.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Buick/1949_Buick/1949%20Buick%20Brochure/1949%20Buick%20Brochure-13.html |title=1949 Buick brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref><br>1950-52 Riviera sedans: {{convert|130.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1950\u201352 others: {{convert|126.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 Riviera sedans: {{convert|125.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 others: {{convert|121.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1949: {{convert|214.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1950 Riviera sedans: {{convert|214.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1950 others: {{convert|210.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1951\u201352 Riviera sedans: {{convert|215.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1951-52 others: {{convert|211.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 Riviera sedans: {{convert|211.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1953 others: {{convert|207.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|63.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4200|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br>[[Cadillac Series 61]]<br/>[[Buick Super]]<br>[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Buick Convertible 1949.jpg|thumb|left|1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible]]\n[[File:1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|1950 Buick Roadmaster Estate wagon]]\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster 2-Dorrars HT 1951.jpg|thumb|left|1951 Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe]]\n[[File:1953 Buick Roadmaster Riviera sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Buick Roadmaster Riviera Sedan]]\n[[File:Buick Skylark Convertible Coupe 1953.jpg|thumb|left|1953 Buick Roadmaster Skylark convertible]]\nThe Roadmaster received its first major postwar restyling in 1949. Its wheelbase and overall length were reduced but its weight was actually marginally increased. The biggest change was a much larger two-piece, curved glass windshield that the sales brochure described as like an \u201c[[observation car]].\u201d It was also in 1949 that Buick introduced \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]].\" Four were displayed on each of the Roadmaster's front fenders,<ref>{{cite book|title=Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946-1975|publisher=Krause publications|isbn=0-87341-027-0|editor=Gunnell, John A.}}</ref> with three on the fenders of the Super, Century, and Special. The sales brochure noted that VentiPorts helped ventilate the engine compartment, and possibly that was true in early 1949, but sometime during the model year they became plugged. The idea for VentiPorts grew out of a modification Buick styling chief Ned Nickles had added to his own 1948 Roadmaster. He had installed four amber lights on each side of his car\u2019s hood wired to the distributor so as to flash on and off as each piston fired simulating the flames from the exhaust stack of a fighter airplane. Combined with the bombsight mascot, VentiPorts put the driver at the controls of an imaginary fighter airplane. Upon seeing this, Buick chief [[Harlow Curtice]] was so delighted that he ordered that (non-lighting) VentiPorts be installed on all 1949 Buicks, with the number of VentiPorts (three or four) corresponding to the relative displacement of the [[straight-eight engine]] installed.\n\nDynaflow was now standard equipment, and engine horsepower was increased to 150 through a slight increase in the compression ratio. This contributed in conjunction with the now standard Dynaflow in giving the new Buicks a top speed of {{convert|110|mph|0|abbr=on}}. In the middle of the year the Riviera, joined the body style lineup selling 4,314 units. Featuring power windows as standard equipment, the 2-door Buick Roadmaster [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], along with the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac De Ville|Coupe de Ville]] and the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Holiday, was among the first [[hardtop]] coupes ever produced. The Riviera was also notable for its popular optional \"[[Buick#Sweepspear|Sweepspear]]\" chrome body side molding, which would soon become a Buick trademark. This chrome-plated strip started above the front wheel, after which it gently curved down nearly to the rocker panel just before the rear wheel, and then curved around the rear wheel in a quarter of a circle to go straight back to the tail-light. The \"Riviera trim\", as it was initially called, was also made available on the Roadmaster convertible very late in the model year. With a total of 88,130 sold, the all-time annual record for Roadmaster, the model accounted for 27 percent of all Buick sales, a remarkably high proportion in light of its price, which was only slightly less than a [[Cadillac Series 61]].\n\nThe 1950 restyling featured a grille so toothy that ''Consumer Reports'' commented that \"a toothbrush for the dentures comes extra.\" The Sweepspear had proved so popular in its first year that it was made standard on most body styles at the beginning of the 1950 model year, and on the station wagon and the new long wheelbase sedan mid-year. The long wheelbase sedan was stretched an extra four inches (102&nbsp;mm). Like the convertibles, the Riviera and the extra plush long wheelbase sedan came with both power windows and power seats as standard equipment. Overall Roadmaster sales fell to 75,034, with Roadmaster\u2019s share of total Buick output plummeting to 12 percent, thanks mainly to the surging popularity of the Special.\n\nIn 1951 the long wheelbase sedan was also called a Riviera although it was not a hardtop. The Sedanet and regular wheelbase sedan were cancelled.\n\nStyling changes were minimal in 1951 and 1952. Power steering was added as an option in 1952 and horsepower climbed to 170 thanks primarily to a new four-barrel carburetor. Sales continued to slide falling to about 66,000 in 1951 and to 51,000 in 1952.\n\nBy 1953 the Roadmaster straight-eight was 16 years old and had become seriously dated. All of Roadmaster\u2019s major competitors had shifted to short-stroke V-8 engines, and if Buick wanted to continue to be the paragon of longer, lower and wider, it needed one of its own. The new engine was ready in time for 1953, Buick\u2019s Golden Anniversary year. Although the [[Buick V8 engine#322|Nailhead]] (as it was popularly called) was nearly identical in displacement to the straight eight [[Buick Straight-8 engine|Fireball]] (322 versus 320 cubic inches), it was {{convert|13.5|in|mm}} shorter, four inches (102&nbsp;mm) lower, and {{convert|180|lb|0|abbr=on}} lighter, but with {{convert|188|hp|0|abbr=on}}, it was 11 percent more powerful. The compression ratio increased from 7.50:1 to 8.50:1 and torque increased from {{convert|280 to 300|lbft|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe compact dimensions of the V-8 engine enabled Buick to reduce Roadmaster\u2019s wheelbase by {{convert|4.75|in|mm}} across the line, although styling differences behind the engine cowl, apart from new V-8 emblem hubcaps, were largely nonexistent. Buick also introduced a new \"Twin-Turbine\" Dynaflow as a companion for the V-8 engine. Estimated to increase torque at the wheels by 10 percent, the new transmission provided faster and quieter acceleration at reduced engine speeds. Both power steering and power brakes were made standard. Air conditioning was a new option and, years before many other makes, a 12-volt electrical system was adopted.\n\nA new body style for 1953 was the [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]] convertible. The Buick Roadmaster Skylark was one of three specialty convertibles produced in 1953 by General Motors, the other two being the [[Oldsmobile 98]] Fiesta and the [[Cadillac Series 62]] [[Cadillac Eldorado|Eldorado]]. The Skylark featured open wheel wells, a drastically lowered belt line, a four-inch-chop from the standard Roadmaster's windshield, the absence of VentiPorts and a new Sweepspear that anticipated Buick\u2019s 1954 styling. Kelsey-Hayes wire wheels and a solid boot cover were standard. At $5,000 only 1,690 units were produced. The following year, and for one year only, it would become its own series built on a Century body. This was the last year for the Roadmaster Estate, and it was the last [[Woodie (car body style)|wood-bodied station wagon]] mass-produced in the [[United States]]. Its body was a product of Ionia Manufacturing which built all Buick station wagon bodies between 1946 and 1964. Priced at $4,031, the Estate was second in price only to the Skylark, with 670 being sold. Overall Roadmaster sales bounced back up to 79,137.\n{{clear}}\n\n==1954\u20131956==\n[[File:1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible rear.jpg|thumb|left|1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible rear]]\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name = Sixth generation\n|image = 1954 Buick Roadmaster convertible front.jpg\n|model_years = 1954\u20131956\n|assembly = [[South Gate, California]], U.S.<br>[[Wilmington, Delaware]], U.S.<br>[[Atlanta, Georgia]], U.S.<br>[[Kansas City, Kansas]], U.S.<br>[[Framingham, Massachusetts]], U.S.<br>[[Flint, Michigan]], U.S.<br>[[Linden, New Jersey]], U.S.<br>[[Arlington, Texas]], U.S.\n|layout =\n|platform = [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]]\n|body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[sedan (car)|hardtop]]<br>2-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]]<br>2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n|engine = {{convert|322|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#322|''Nailhead'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|transmission = 2-speed [[Dynaflow]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase = {{convert|127.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length = 1954: {{convert|216.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1955: {{convert|216.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br>1956: {{convert|213.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width = {{convert|79.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height = {{convert|62.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|weight = {{convert|4400|-|4600|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n|related = [[Cadillac Series 62]]<br/>[[Buick Super]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 98]]\n|designer = [[Harley Earl]]\n}}\n\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster 1957.jpg|thumb|left|1955 Buick Roadmaster Riviera coupe]]\nIn 1954 Buick Roadmaster and [[Buick Super|Super]] shared with [[Cadillac]] and [[Oldsmobile 98]] the new General Motors [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]], adopting the new \"[[Ponton (automobile)|ponton]]\" appearance, and the addition of \"[[Dagmar bumpers]]\" to the front.

Overall sales dropped to 50,571 (which is 11.37 percent of model year production)<ref>https://www.hometownbuick.com/1954-buick/1954-buick-production/</ref>.\n\nIn 1955 broad lower rear fender bands, gold-colored Roadmaster deck script and hood ornament, bars on the hubcaps and gold-accented grille were added to distinguish Roadmaster. Horsepower jumped to 236, and a new variable-pitch [[Dynaflow]], in which the stator blades changed pitch under hard acceleration, provided quicker off-the-line getaway. Back up lights were now standard.

Front hip room was 65.3-in.<ref>{{cite news |title=Compare the 1957 cars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cuEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA181&dq=Buick+Roadmaster&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiL4JLB2c7nAhUPHzQIHY2HDBQQ6AEwA3oECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=Buick%20Roadmaster&f=false |accessdate=13 February 2020 |work=Popular Mechanics |date=February 1957}}</ref> There was a new 364-cubic-inch engine, developing 300 horsepower. A new ball-joint suspension system improved handling. Evidently the 4-door [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] [[hardtop]] proved so popular on its introduction the previous year that the pillared sedan was dropped entirely from the model lineup. Also, new was a mid-year production ( March 1957) Roadmaster designated as Model 75 which was distinguished by standard power seats and windows, carpeted lower doors, a one piece rear window (instead of a three piece which were a steadfast design feature found only on the smaller Jr model lines of the Special and Century), Deluxe hubcaps and a Series 75 script found on the rear quarter body panel of the R.M. Coupes and the rear door panels on the R.M. 4-door sedans, thus replacing the standard 3 chevrons found in the same location on the standard full model year Roadmaster model lines. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales plunged to about 33,000. However, this \"sales plunge\" was not an isolated occurrence found only at GM but was one shared by all manufacturers to one extent or another due to a capital market recession which effected the overall economy starting in late 1956 and extending into 1958.\n\nFor 1958, GM was promoting their fiftieth year of production, and introduced Anniversary models for each brand; Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Chevrolet.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/|title= Image of 50th Anniversary promotional photo|publisher= gmphotostore.com|url-status= dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151017224216/http://www.gmphotostore.com/1958-Chevrolet-Impala-50th-Anniversary-Art-Poster/productinfo/P8367/|archivedate= 2015-10-17}}</ref> The 1958 models shared a common appearance on the top models for each brand; Cadillac Eldorado Seville, Buick Roadmaster Riviera, Oldsmobile Holiday 88, Pontiac Bonneville Catalina, and the all-new Chevrolet Bel-Air Impala.\n\nIn 1958 the Roadmaster could only be ordered as the well equipped Roadmaster 75, and its body was adorned with bulkier more heavily chromed styling. A new \"drawer pull\" grille was used, made up of rectangular chrome squares. For the first time since 1948 there were no distinguishing [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] on the front fenders. On the rear deck the Roadmaster name was spelled out in block lettering beneath a Buick emblem housing the trunk lock keyway. Wheelhouses had bright moldings, rocker panels had an ebbed molding and a large rear fender bright flash with ribbed inserts replaced the previous year's chromed rear fender lower panel. Four headlamps were standard. New brakes, with cast iron liners in aluminum drums, proved to be the best in the industry. But sales fell further to about 14,000.\n\nThere was a complete restyling for 1959, but this time the names of the various series were changed. Not until 1991 would there again be a big Buick known as the Roadmaster; the largest Buick models were renamed the [[Buick Electra|Electra]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==1991\u20131996==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Eighth generation\n| image = Buick-Roadmaster-Sedan.jpg\n| aka =\n| model_years = 1991\u20131996\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>5-door [[station wagon]]\n| platform = [[GM B platform]]\n| designer = Wayne Kady (1989)\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|115.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = 5.0 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#L03|''L03'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>5.7 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#L05|''L05'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]<br>5.7 L [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#LT1|''LT1'']] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 .2F 4L60 .2F 4L60E .2F 4L65E|4L60]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />4-speed [[GM 4L60-E transmission|4L60-E]] automatic\n| length = {{convert|215.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br> {{convert|217.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1991\u201393 wagon)<br>{{convert|217.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1994\u201396 wagon)\n| width = {{convert|78.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br> {{convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| height = {{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (sedan)<br> {{convert|60.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (wagon)\n| weight = {{convert|4400|-|4700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}\n| assembly = [[Arlington, Texas]], U.S.\n| related = [[Buick Estate]]<br>[[Chevrolet Caprice#Fourth generation (1991\u20131996)|Chevrolet Caprice]]<br>[[Chevrolet Impala#Seventh generation (Impala SS, 1994\u20131996)|Chevrolet Impala SS]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser#Third generation (1991\u20131992)|Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br>\n| predecessor = [[Buick LeSabre#Fifth generation (1977-1985)|Buick LeSabre]]\n}}\n\n[[File:1995 Buick Roadmaster Limited rvl.jpg|thumb|left|1995 Buick Roadmaster Limited sedan]]\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster wagon.jpg|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Buick Roadmaster estate wagon rear.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon]]\n[[File:1993-Buick-Roadmaster-Estate-i.jpg|thumb|left|1993 Estate Wagon interior]]\n\nThe ''Roadmaster'' name returned to the Buick line for the 1991 model year after a 33-year absence, with the third generation [[Buick Estate Wagon#1977-1990|Buick Estate]] wagon becoming the [[Buick_Estate#1991-1996|Roadmaster Estate]]. A four-door sedan was added to the Roadmaster line for the 1992 model year, the first rear-wheel drive Buick sedan since 1985. Combined sales showed an over ''tenfold'' increase over '91 thanks in part to an extended production run which had 1992 models going on sale in March 1991.{{cn|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Chassis ===\nAs with its precursor, the new Roadmaster Estate wagon was based on GM's [[full-size car|full-size]] [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM B platform|B platform]], which was closely related to the GM [[GM C platform (RWD)|C-body]] and [[GM D platform|D-body]] chassis reserved for top of the line Buicks and Cadillacs. It rode on the same 115.9-inch wheelbase in use since the wagon series was downsized from the C-body in 1977, yet was three inches shorter than the 1990 model. \n\nThe Roadmaster sedan, a C-body vehicle over its eight previous generations, shared the B-body for the first time in its history. Nonetheless, it stood not only as the largest Buick, a full 10\" longer with a 5\" greater wheelbase than the apparent top-of-the-line C-bodied [[Buick_Park_Avenue#First_generation|Buick Park Avenue]], but larger both in wheelbase (2\") and overall length (6\") than the [[GM K platform (FWD)|K-body]] [[Cadillac_de_Ville_series#Seventh_generation|Cadillac Sedan de Ville]].\n\n=== Powertrain ===\nThe standard engine for the 1991 wagon was a {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.0-L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L03|Chevrolet small-block]] V8. It was replaced a year later with a {{convert|180|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 5.7-L [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L05|Chevrolet small-block]] V8 shared by both wagon and sedan. In 1994 both received a modified version of the advanced 5.7-L [[Fuel injection#Multipoint fuel injection|sequential point fuel-injection]] [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#LT1|LT1]] V8, increasing output to {{convert|260|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and substantially improved performance.\n\nDerived from the 300&nbsp;hp LT1 debuted in the 1992 Chevrolet Corvette, the Roadmaster version was shared both with other B-and D platform luxury and performance cars such as the [[9C1 (Chevrolet Police package)|Chevrolet Caprice Police Package]] and [[Cadillac_Fleetwood#1993-1996|Cadillac Fleetwood]] and GM's specialty [[GM F platform|F-bodied]] [[Chevrolet_Camaro#Fourth generation (1993\u20132002)|Chevrolet Camaro Z28]] and [[Pontiac Firebird#Fourth generation (1993\u20132002)|Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]]. It differed in the use of iron heads for durability, camshafts tuned for increased low-end torque, and intake silencers to decrease drive-by noise (only in engines used in luxury-brand cars).\n\nWhile installed in part to better comply with emissions and fuel-economy standards, the LT1 V8 not only offered an 80hp power increase but raised rated fuel economy by 1 mpg, to 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway. As a result of this significantly boosted engine output General Motors limited the softer-riding Roadmaster (which ran on lower [[Speed rating|speed-rated]] tires than used on the Corvette) to a top speed of {{convert|108|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. For 1996, the LT1 became OBD-II compliant.\n\nAll three V-8s were paired to a four-speed automatic transmission. In 1994, the hydraulically-controlled 4L60 (700R4) transmission was replaced by the electronically-controlled 4L60E.\n\nWhen ordered with the factory towing package, the 1994-1996 Roadmaster was rated to tow up to {{convert|5000|lb|kg|abbr=out}}. For the station wagon, this could be raised to 7000 pounds with the use of a weight-distributing hitch, dual sway controls, setting rear tire pressure to 35 PSI, and disabling the Electronic Level Control.<ref>{{cite book|title=1995 Buick Roadmaster Owner's Manual|publisher=General Motors Corporation|year=1994|edition=First|pages=4\u201334|chapter=4}}</ref> The towing package added 2.93 rear-axle gears and a limited slip differential, heavy duty cooling system including oil and transmission coolers, and a factory installed self leveling rear suspension consisting of air shocks, a height sensor between the rear axle and body and an on-board air compressor. Most visibly, a pair of electric fans offset to the left under the hood was replaced by the combination of one conventional fan driven mechanically from the engine alongside one electric fan.\n\n=== Body ===\nThe Roadmaster Estate wagon shared its body with the Caprice Estate and [[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]; common styling features included the Caprice's headlights and the Custom Cruiser's 2nd-row \"Vista Roof\" with sunroof. [[Woodie (car body style)#Simulated woodgrain|Simulated woodgrain]] sides were standard, though the treatment could be deleted for credit. All three wagons offered an optional rear-facing third-row seat, bringing seating capacity to eight. The Roadmaster sedan had a distinct fascia, featuring its own grille and headlights stacked above running lights and turn signals. It shared a formal sedan roofline with the [[Cadillac Fleetwood]], but rode on a wheelbase nearly six inches shorter.\n\nThe interior received a redesign for the 1994 model year which included new dual airbags, moving some instrument panel gauges closer to the steering wheel, and revisions to the radio and climate controls. Folding sideview mirrors moved forward from their previous location in 1995-96. The '95 Roadmaster retained its skirted rear wheels (deleted from the Caprice/Impala SS), while the sedan was updated with new bodyside moldings. Station wagons saw a shade for the Vista Roof along with a cargo cover. In 1996 automatic climate control became standard, and the rear seatbelts were redesigned with a \"cinching\" feature.\n\n=== Discontinuation ===\nA combination of overcrowding among Buick's high-end sedans and pressure from [[full-size SUV]]s on the Estate wagon led to both Roadmasters being discontinued after the 1996 model year; the final vehicle was produced on December 13, 1996.<ref name=\"Wards97\">{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 1997 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=1997}}</ref> With Ford having eliminated its Country Squire and Colony Park station wagons in 1991, the passing of the Roadmaster Estate and Chevrolet Caprice Estate marked the end of the full-size station wagon in North America until the introduction of the [[ Dodge Magnum#Chrysler LX platform 2005\u20132008|Dodge Magnum]] in 2005.\n\nAnother factor behind the discontinuation of the GM B-body line was the growth of the [[full-size SUV]] segment, which impacted both sedan and wagon sales. Additionally, a strong upswing in the longstanding body-on-frame [[Chevrolet Suburban|Chevrolet/GMC Suburban]] offered truck-based durability, four-wheel drive, and much higher profit margins. In 1996, the [[Arlington Assembly]] facility in Texas was converted to assemble SUVs and pickup trucks, leaving the B-platform without an assembly line. It would be an entire decade before GMC capitalized on the full-sized [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover]] evolution with the introduction of the [[GMC Acadia]] and its derivatives sold by Buick, Chevrolet, and Saturn.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+'''Production Figures<ref>The Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition</ref>'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Year\n! style=\"background:silver;\"| Units\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1991 || 7,291 (wagon only)\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1992 || 85,309\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1993 || 40,449\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1994 || 38,909\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1995 || 30,508\n|-\n! align=\"centered\"| 1996 || 22,989\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:silver;\"| Total production = 225,455\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://consumerguide.com/used/1991-96-buick-roadmaster/ Consumer guide to the 1991-96 Buick Roadmaster]\n{{Buick Vehicles}}\n{{Buick postwar timeline}}\n{{Buick}}\n\n[[Category:Buick vehicles|Roadmaster]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Station wagons]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:1950s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Flagship vehicles]]\n[[Category:Luxury vehicles]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (13), 1995-96 \u2192 1995\u201396", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Roadmaster"}

Pakistan}}\n[[Pakistan]] has several official '''national symbols''' including a flag, an emblem, an anthem, a memorial tower as well as several national heroes. The symbols were adopted at various stages in the existence of Pakistan and there are various rules and regulations governing their definition or use. The oldest symbol is the [[Lahore Resolution]], adopted by the [[All-India Muslim League|All India Muslim League]] on 23 March 1940, and which presented the official demand for the creation of a separate country for the Muslims of [[British Raj|India]]. The Minar-e-Pakistan memorial tower which was built in 1968 on the site where the Lahore Resolution was passed. The national flag was adopted just before independence was achieved on 14 August 1947. The national anthem and the state emblem were each adopted in 1954. There are also several other symbols including the national animal, bird, flower and tree.\n\n== Minar-e-Pakistan ==\n[[File:Working Committee.jpg|thumb|The Muslim League Working Committee in Lahore, 1940]]\n{{Main|Lahore Resolution|Minar-e-Pakistan}}\nThe Lahore Resolution (''Qarardad-e-Lahore'')) ({{lang-ur|{{nastaliq|\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0644\u0627\u06be\u0648\u0631}}}}), also known as the Pakistan Resolution,<ref name=\"robinson\">{{Cite journal\n| last       = Robinson\n| first      = Francis\n| title      = The Muslims and Partition\n| journal    = History Today\n| volume     = 47\n| issue      = 9\n| pages      = 40\u201346\n| publisher  = History Today Ltd\n| location   = London\n| date       = September 1997\n| url        = http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=10381&amid=10381\n| accessdate = 29 November 2007\n}}</ref> was a formal political statement adopted by the [[All India Muslim League]] at the occasion of its three-day general session on 22\u201324 March 1940 at Minto Park (now [[Iqbal Park]]), Lahore.

{"title_page": "Gershgorin circle theorem", "text_new": "{{short description|Mathematical theorem about eigenvalues}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Gershgorin circle theorem''' may be used to bound the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|spectrum]] of a square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. It was first published by the Soviet mathematician [[Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin]] in 1931.  Gershgorin's name has been transliterated in several different ways, including Ger\u0161gorin, Gerschgorin, Gershgorin, Hershhorn, and Hirschhorn.\n\n==Statement and proof==\nLet <math>A</math> be a [[complex number|complex]] <math>n\\times n</math> matrix, with entries <math>a_{ij}</math>. For <math>i \\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}</math> let <math>R_i = \\sum_{j\\neq{i}} \\left|a_{ij}\\right|</math> be the sum of the [[absolute value]]s of the non-diagonal entries in the <math>i</math>-th row.  Let <math>D(a_{ii}, R_i ) \\subseteq \\C</math> be a closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]] centered at <math>a_{ii}</math> with radius <math>R_i</math>. Such a disc is called a '''Gershgorin disc'''.\n\n'''Theorem''': Every [[eigenvalue]] of <math> A </math> lies within at least one of the Gershgorin discs \n<math> D(a_{ii},R_i). </math>\n\n''Proof'': Let <math>\\lambda</math> be an eigenvalue of <math>A</math>. Choose a corresponding eigenvector <math>x = (x_j)</math> so that one component <math>x_i</math> is equal to <math>1</math> and the others are of absolute value less than or equal to <math>1</math>: <math>x_i = 1</math> and <math>|x_j|\\le 1</math> for <math>j\\ne i</math>. There is always such an <math>x</math>, which can be obtained simply by dividing any eigenvector by its component with largest modulus. Since <math>Ax=\\lambda x</math>, in particular\n\n: <math> \\sum_j a_{ij} x_j = \\lambda x_i = \\lambda. </math>\n\nSo, splitting the sum and taking into account once again that <math>x_i = 1</math>, we get\n\n: <math> \\sum_{j \\ne i} a_{ij} x_j + a_{ii}= \\lambda. </math>\n\nTherefore, applying the [[triangle inequality]],\n\n: <math> |\\lambda - a_{ii}| = \\left|\\sum_{j \\ne i} a_{ij} x_j\\right| \\le \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}| |x_j| \\le \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}| = R_i. </math>\n\n'''Corollary''': The eigenvalues of ''A'' must also lie within the Gershgorin discs ''C''<sub>''j''</sub> corresponding to the columns of ''A''.\n\n''Proof'': Apply the Theorem to ''A''<sup>T</sup>.\n\n'''Example''' For a [[diagonal matrix]], the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum. Conversely, if the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum, the matrix is diagonal.\n\nSince ''A'' and its transpose have the same eigenvalues, we can use the off-diagonal column sums instead of the row sums.  The eigenvalues must be in both sets, so we can strengthen the result to say the eigenvalues must be in the intersection of each set of disks.\n\n==Discussion==\nOne way to interpret this theorem is that if the off-diagonal entries of a square matrix over the complex numbers have small [[Norm_(mathematics)|norms]], the eigenvalues of the matrix cannot be \"far from\" the diagonal entries of the matrix. Therefore, by reducing the norms of off-diagonal entries one can attempt to approximate the eigenvalues of the matrix. Of course, diagonal entries may change in the process of minimizing off-diagonal entries.\n\nThe theorem does ''not'' claim that there is one disc for each eigenvalue; if anything, the discs rather correspond to the ''axes'' in <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, and each expresses a bound on precisely those eigenvalues whose eigenspaces are closest to one particular axis. In the matrix\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3a+2b+2c & 6a-2b-4c & 6a-4b-2c \\\\ b-a & a+(a-b) & 2(a-b) \\\\ c-a & 2(a-c) & a+(a-c) \\end{pmatrix} </math>\n\u2014 which by construction has eigenvalues <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> with eigenvectors <math> \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) </math>, <math> \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) </math>, and <math> \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) </math> \u2014 it is easy to see that the disc for row 2 covers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> while the disc for row 3 covers <math>a</math> and <math>c</math>. This is however just a happy coincidence; if working through the steps of the proof one finds that it in each eigenvector is the first element that is the largest (every eigenspace is closer to the first axis than to any other axis), so the theorem only promises that the disc for row 1 (whose radius can be twice the ''sum'' of the other two radii) covers all three eigenvalues.\n\n==Strengthening of the theorem==\nIf one of the discs is disjoint from the others then it contains exactly one eigenvalue. If however it meets another disc it is possible that it contains no eigenvalue (for example, <math> A=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\4&0\\end{pmatrix} </math> or <math> A=\\begin{pmatrix}1&-2\\\\1&-1\\end{pmatrix} </math>). In the general case the theorem can be strengthened as follows:\n\n'''Theorem''': If the union of ''k'' discs is disjoint from the union of the other ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' discs then the former union contains exactly ''k'' and the latter ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' eigenvalues of ''A''.\n\n''Proof'': Let ''D'' be the diagonal matrix with entries equal to the diagonal entries of ''A'' and let\n\n: <math>B(t)=(1-t)D + tA.</math>\n\nWe will use the fact that the eigenvalues are continuous in <math>t</math>, and show that if any eigenvalue moves from one of the unions to the other, then it must be outside all the discs for some <math>t</math>, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe statement is true for <math>D = B(0)</math>. The diagonal entries of <math>B(t)</math> are equal to that of ''A'', thus the centers of the Gershgorin circles are the same, however their radii are ''t'' times that of A. Therefore, the union of the corresponding ''k'' discs of <math>B(t)</math> is disjoint from the union of the remaining ''n-k'' for all <math>t \\in [0,1]</math>. The discs are closed, so the distance of the two unions for ''A'' is <math>d>0</math>. The distance for <math>B(t)</math> is a decreasing function of ''t'', so it is always at least ''d''. ''Since the eigenvalues of <math>B(t)</math> are a continuous function of ''t'', for any eigenvalue <math>\\lambda(t)</math> of <math>B(t)</math> in the union of the ''k'' discs its distance <math>d(t)</math> from the union of the other ''n-k'' discs is also continuous.'' Obviously <math>d(0)\\ge d</math>, and assume <math>\\lambda(1)</math> lies in the union of the ''n-k'' discs. Then <math>d(1)=0</math>, so there exists <math>0<t_0<1</math> such that <math>0<d(t_0)<d</math>. But this means <math>\\lambda(t_0)</math> lies outside the Gershgorin discs, which is impossible. Therefore <math>\\lambda(1)</math> lies in the union of the ''k'' discs, and the theorem is proven.\n\nRemarks:\n* The continuity of <math>\\lambda(t)</math> should be understand in the sense of [[Topology#Continuous_functions_and_homeomorphisms|topology]]. It is sufficient to show that the roots (as a point in space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>) is continuous function of its coefficients. Note that the inverse map that maps roots to coefficients is described by [[Vieta's formulas]] (note for [[Characteristic polynomial]] <math>a_n\\equiv1</math>) which can be proved a [[open map]]. This proves the roots as a whole is a continuous function of its coefficients. Since composition of continuous functions is again continuous, the <math>\\lambda(t)</math> as a composition of roots solver and <math>B(t)</math> is also continuous.\n\n* Individual eigenvalue <math>\\lambda(t)</math> could merge with other eigenvalue(s) or appeared from a splitting of previous eigenvalue. This may confuse people and questioning the concept of continuous. However, when viewing from the space of eigenvalue set <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, the trajectory is still a continuous curve although not necessarily smooth everywhere.\n\n* The proof given above is arguably (in)correct......  There are two types of continuity concerning eigenvalues: (1) each individual eigenvalue is a usual continuous function (such a representation does exist on a real interval but may not exist on a complex domain), (2) eigenvalues are continuous as a whole in the topological sense (a mapping from the matrix space with metric induced by a norm to unordered tuples, i.e., the quotient space of C^n under permutation equivalence with induced metric). Whichever continuity is used in a proof of the Gerschgorin disk theorem, it should be justified that the sum of algebraic multiplicities of eigenvalues remains unchanged on each connected region. A proof using the [[argument principle]] of [[complex analysis]] requires no eigenvalue continuity of any kind.<ref>Roger A. Horn & Charles R.  Johnson (2012) ''Matrix Analysis'', second edition, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|9780521548236}} [https://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/mathematics/algebra/matrix-analysis-2nd-edition?format=PB Publisher\u2019s blurb]</ref>\n\n==Application==\nThe Gershgorin circle theorem is useful in solving matrix equations of the form ''Ax'' = ''b'' for ''x'' where ''b'' is a vector and ''A'' is a matrix with a large [[condition number]].\n\nIn this kind of problem, the error in the final result is usually of the same [[order of magnitude]] as the error in the initial data multiplied by the condition number of ''A''. For instance, if ''b'' is known to six decimal places and the condition number of ''A'' is 1000 then we can only be confident that ''x'' is accurate to three decimal places. For very high condition numbers, even very small errors due to rounding can be magnified to such an extent that the result is meaningless.\n\nIt would be good to reduce the condition number of ''A''. This can be done by [[preconditioning]]: A matrix ''P'' such that ''P'' \u2248 ''A''<sup>&minus;1</sup> is constructed, and then the equation ''PAx'' = ''Pb'' is solved for ''x''. Using the ''exact'' [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of ''A'' would be nice but finding the inverse of a matrix is something we want to avoid because of the computational expense. \n\nNow, since ''PA'' \u2248 ''I'' where ''I'' is the identity matrix, the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''PA'' should all be close to 1. By the Gershgorin circle theorem, every eigenvalue of ''PA'' lies within a known area and so we can form a rough estimate of how good our choice of ''P'' was.\n\n== Example ==\nUse the Gershgorin circle theorem to estimate the eigenvalues of:\n[[File:Gershgorin Disk Theorem Example.svg|thumb|400px|right|This diagram shows the discs in yellow derived for the eigenvalues.\nThe first two disks overlap and their union contains two eigenvalues.

We then take the remaining elements in the row and apply the formula:\n\n: <math> \\sum_{j\\ne i} |a_{ij}| = R_i</math>\n\nto obtain the following four discs:\n: <math> D(10,2), \\; D(8,0.6), \\; D(2,3), \\; \\text{and} \\; D(-11,3). </math>\n\nNote that we can improve the accuracy of the last two discs by applying the formula to the corresponding columns of the matrix, obtaining <math> D(2,1.2) </math> and <math> D(-11,2.2) </math>.\n\nThe eigenvalues are  9.8218,  8.1478,  1.8995, -10.86\n\n==See also==\n* For matrices with non-negative entries, see [[Perron\u2013Frobenius theorem]].\n* [[Doubly stochastic matrix]]\n* [[Hurwitz matrix]]\n* [[Joel Lee Brenner]]\n* [[Metzler matrix]]\n* [[Muirhead's inequality]]\n* [[Schur\u2013Horn theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{citation|last=Gerschgorin|first=S.|authorlink=Semyon Aranovich Gershgorin|title=\u00dcber die Abgrenzung der Eigenwerte einer Matrix|journal=Izv.

It was first published by the Soviet mathematician [[Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin]] in 1931.  Gershgorin's name has been transliterated in several different ways, including Ger\u0161gorin, Gerschgorin, Gershgorin, Hershhorn, and Hirschhorn.\n\n==Statement and proof==\nLet <math>A</math> be a [[complex number|complex]] <math>n\\times n</math> matrix, with entries <math>a_{ij}</math>. For <math>i \\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}</math> let <math>R_i = \\sum_{j\\neq{i}} \\left|a_{ij}\\right|</math> be the sum of the [[absolute value]]s of the non-diagonal entries in the <math>i</math>-th row.  Let <math>D(a_{ii}, R_i ) \\subseteq \\C</math> be a closed [[disc (mathematics)|disc]] centered at <math>a_{ii}</math> with radius <math>R_i</math>. Such a disc is called a '''Gershgorin disc'''.\n\n'''Theorem''': Every [[eigenvalue]] of <math> A </math> lies within at least one of the Gershgorin discs \n<math> D(a_{ii},R_i). </math>\n\n''Proof'': Let <math>\\lambda</math> be an eigenvalue of <math>A</math>. Choose a corresponding eigenvector <math>x = (x_j)</math> so that one component <math>x_i</math> is equal to <math>1</math> and the others are of absolute value less than or equal to <math>1</math>: <math>x_i = 1</math> and <math>|x_j|\\le 1</math> for <math>j\\ne i</math>. There is always such an <math>x</math>, which can be obtained simply by dividing any eigenvector by its component with largest modulus. Since <math>Ax=\\lambda x</math>, in particular\n\n: <math> \\sum_j a_{ij} x_j = \\lambda x_i = \\lambda. </math>\n\nSo, splitting the sum and taking into account once again that <math>x_i = 1</math>, we get\n\n: <math> \\sum_{j \\ne i} a_{ij} x_j + a_{ii}= \\lambda. </math>\n\nTherefore, applying the [[triangle inequality]],\n\n: <math> |\\lambda - a_{ii}| = \\left|\\sum_{j \\ne i} a_{ij} x_j\\right| \\le \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}| |x_j| \\le \\sum_{j \\ne i} |a_{ij}| = R_i. </math>\n\n'''Corollary''': The eigenvalues of ''A'' must also lie within the Gershgorin discs ''C''<sub>''j''</sub> corresponding to the columns of ''A''.\n\n''Proof'': Apply the Theorem to ''A''<sup>T</sup>.\n\n'''Example''' For a [[diagonal matrix]], the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum. Conversely, if the Gershgorin discs coincide with the spectrum, the matrix is diagonal.\n\n==Discussion==\nOne way to interpret this theorem is that if the off-diagonal entries of a square matrix over the complex numbers have small [[Norm_(mathematics)|norms]], the eigenvalues of the matrix cannot be \"far from\" the diagonal entries of the matrix. Therefore, by reducing the norms of off-diagonal entries one can attempt to approximate the eigenvalues of the matrix. Of course, diagonal entries may change in the process of minimizing off-diagonal entries.\n\nThe theorem does ''not'' claim that there is one disc for each eigenvalue; if anything, the discs rather correspond to the ''axes'' in <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, and each expresses a bound on precisely those eigenvalues whose eigenspaces are closest to one particular axis. In the matrix\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 2 & 2 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -3a+2b+2c & 6a-2b-4c & 6a-4b-2c \\\\ b-a & a+(a-b) & 2(a-b) \\\\ c-a & 2(a-c) & a+(a-c) \\end{pmatrix} </math>\n\u2014 which by construction has eigenvalues <math>a</math>, <math>b</math>, and <math>c</math> with eigenvectors <math> \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) </math>, <math> \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) </math>, and <math> \\left(\\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{smallmatrix}\\right) </math> \u2014 it is easy to see that the disc for row 2 covers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> while the disc for row 3 covers <math>a</math> and <math>c</math>. This is however just a happy coincidence; if working through the steps of the proof one finds that it in each eigenvector is the first element that is the largest (every eigenspace is closer to the first axis than to any other axis), so the theorem only promises that the disc for row 1 (whose radius can be twice the ''sum'' of the other two radii) covers all three eigenvalues.\n\n==Strengthening of the theorem==\nIf one of the discs is disjoint from the others then it contains exactly one eigenvalue. If however it meets another disc it is possible that it contains no eigenvalue (for example, <math> A=\\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\\\4&0\\end{pmatrix} </math> or <math> A=\\begin{pmatrix}1&-2\\\\1&-1\\end{pmatrix} </math>). In the general case the theorem can be strengthened as follows:\n\n'''Theorem''': If the union of ''k'' discs is disjoint from the union of the other ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' discs then the former union contains exactly ''k'' and the latter ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k'' eigenvalues of ''A''.\n\n''Proof'': Let ''D'' be the diagonal matrix with entries equal to the diagonal entries of ''A'' and let\n\n: <math>B(t)=(1-t)D + tA.</math>\n\nWe will use the fact that the eigenvalues are continuous in <math>t</math>, and show that if any eigenvalue moves from one of the unions to the other, then it must be outside all the discs for some <math>t</math>, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe statement is true for <math>D = B(0)</math>. The diagonal entries of <math>B(t)</math> are equal to that of ''A'', thus the centers of the Gershgorin circles are the same, however their radii are ''t'' times that of A. Therefore, the union of the corresponding ''k'' discs of <math>B(t)</math> is disjoint from the union of the remaining ''n-k'' for all <math>t \\in [0,1]</math>. The discs are closed, so the distance of the two unions for ''A'' is <math>d>0</math>. The distance for <math>B(t)</math> is a decreasing function of ''t'', so it is always at least ''d''. ''Since the eigenvalues of <math>B(t)</math> are a continuous function of ''t'', for any eigenvalue <math>\\lambda(t)</math> of <math>B(t)</math> in the union of the ''k'' discs its distance <math>d(t)</math> from the union of the other ''n-k'' discs is also continuous.'' Obviously <math>d(0)\\ge d</math>, and assume <math>\\lambda(1)</math> lies in the union of the ''n-k'' discs. Then <math>d(1)=0</math>, so there exists <math>0<t_0<1</math> such that <math>0<d(t_0)<d</math>. But this means <math>\\lambda(t_0)</math> lies outside the Gershgorin discs, which is impossible. Therefore <math>\\lambda(1)</math> lies in the union of the ''k'' discs, and the theorem is proven.\n\nRemarks:\n* The continuity of <math>\\lambda(t)</math> should be understand in the sense of [[Topology#Continuous_functions_and_homeomorphisms|topology]]. It is sufficient to show that the roots (as a point in space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>) is continuous function of its coefficients. Note that the inverse map that maps roots to coefficients is described by [[Vieta's formulas]] (note for [[Characteristic polynomial]] <math>a_n\\equiv1</math>) which can be proved a [[open map]]. This proves the roots as a whole is a continuous function of its coefficients. Since composition of continuous functions is again continuous, the <math>\\lambda(t)</math> as a composition of roots solver and <math>B(t)</math> is also continuous.\n\n* Individual eigenvalue <math>\\lambda(t)</math> could merge with other eigenvalue(s) or appeared from a splitting of previous eigenvalue. This may confuse people and questioning the concept of continuous. However, when viewing from the space of eigenvalue set <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, the trajectory is still a continuous curve although not necessarily smooth everywhere.\n\n* The proof given above is arguably (in)correct......  There are two types of continuity concerning eigenvalues: (1) each individual eigenvalue is a usual continuous function (such a representation does exist on a real interval but may not exist on a complex domain), (2) eigenvalues are continuous as a whole in the topological sense (a mapping from the matrix space with metric induced by a norm to unordered tuples, i.e., the quotient space of C^n under permutation equivalence with induced metric). Whichever continuity is used in a proof of the Gerschgorin disk theorem, it should be justified that the sum of algebraic multiplicities of eigenvalues remains unchanged on each connected region. A proof using the [[argument principle]] of [[complex analysis]] requires no eigenvalue continuity of any kind.<ref>Roger A. Horn & Charles R.  Johnson (2012) ''Matrix Analysis'', second edition, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|9780521548236}} [https://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/mathematics/algebra/matrix-analysis-2nd-edition?format=PB Publisher\u2019s blurb]</ref>\n\n==Application==\nThe Gershgorin circle theorem is useful in solving matrix equations of the form ''Ax'' = ''b'' for ''x'' where ''b'' is a vector and ''A'' is a matrix with a large [[condition number]].\n\nIn this kind of problem, the error in the final result is usually of the same [[order of magnitude]] as the error in the initial data multiplied by the condition number of ''A''. For instance, if ''b'' is known to six decimal places and the condition number of ''A'' is 1000 then we can only be confident that ''x'' is accurate to three decimal places. For very high condition numbers, even very small errors due to rounding can be magnified to such an extent that the result is meaningless.\n\nIt would be good to reduce the condition number of ''A''. This can be done by [[preconditioning]]: A matrix ''P'' such that ''P'' \u2248 ''A''<sup>&minus;1</sup> is constructed, and then the equation ''PAx'' = ''Pb'' is solved for ''x''. Using the ''exact'' [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of ''A'' would be nice but finding the inverse of a matrix is something we want to avoid because of the computational expense. \n\nNow, since ''PA'' \u2248 ''I'' where ''I'' is the identity matrix, the [[eigenvalue]]s of ''PA'' should all be close to 1. By the Gershgorin circle theorem, every eigenvalue of ''PA'' lies within a known area and so we can form a rough estimate of how good our choice of ''P'' was.\n\n== Example ==\nUse the Gershgorin circle theorem to estimate the eigenvalues of:\n[[File:Gershgorin Disk Theorem Example.svg|thumb|400px|right|This diagram shows the discs in yellow derived for the eigenvalues.\nThe first two disks overlap and their union contains two eigenvalues.
