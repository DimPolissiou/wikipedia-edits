His career began, and ended with [[Minimalist]] constructions, using the same finished metal surface that he started out using.\n\n==Education and early life==\nSmith was born in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] to a [[water supply|waterworks]] manufacturing family started by his grandfather and namesake, A. P. Smith. Tony contracted [[tuberculosis]] around 1916, which lasted through much of elementary school.<ref name=\"About\" /> In an effort to speed his recovery, protect his immune system, and protect his siblings, his family constructed a one-room prefabricated house in the backyard. He had a full-time nurse and had tutors to keep up with his school work; he sporadically attended Sacred Heart Elementary School in Newark. His medicine came in little boxes which he used to form cardboard constructions. Sometimes he visited the waterworks factory, marveling at the industrial production, machines and fabrication processes.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith commuted to [[St. Francis Xavier High School (New York City)|St. Francis Xavier High School]], a [[Jesuit]] high school in New York City.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tonysmithestate.com/about/chronology | title=About - Tony Smith | publisher=Tony Smith Estate/Artists Rights Society | accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> In the spring and summer of 1931 he attended [[Fordham University]], and in the fall enrolled at [[Georgetown University]].<ref name=\"About\" /> Smith was disillusioned with formal education, and returned to New Jersey in January 1932, where, during the Great Depression, he opened a second-hand bookstore in Newark on Broad Street.<ref name=\"About\"/> From 1934 to 1936, he worked days at the family factory and attended evening courses at the [[Art Students League of New York]] where he studied anatomy with [[George Bridgman]], drawing and watercolor with [[George Grosz]], and painting with [[Vaclav Vytlacil]].<ref name=\"About\" /> In 1937, he moved to [[Chicago]] intending to study architecture at the [[New Bauhaus]], where he readily absorbed the interdisciplinary curriculum but was ultimately disillusioned. The following year, Smith began working for [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s [[Suntop Homes|Ardmore Project]] near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he began as a carpenter helper and bricklayer, and eventually was named Clerk-of-the-Works. After a brief period with Wright in Taliesin, Wisconsin, Smith worked building the Armstrong house in [[Ogden Dunes, Indiana]]. This period ended when his mother fell ill in 1940 and Smith returned to New Jersey. His father died suddenly on December 1 of that year.\n\n==Career==\n{{Main|List of Tony Smith sculptures}}\n[[Image:LightUpbyTonySmithForbesCourtyard.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Light Up (sculpture)|Light Up]]'', 1974, outside the [[Hillman Library]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]]]\nIn 1940, Smith began his career as an independent architectural designer, which lasted until the early 1960s. He built approximately twenty private homes and envisioned many unrealized projects, such as the 1950 Model Roman Catholic Church, with paintings on glass by Jackson Pollock (1950).  His work included homes for many in the art community, including Fritz Bultman (1945),  [[Theodoros Stamos]] [[Fred Olsen]] (1951), and [[Betty Parsons]] (1959-60).<ref name=\"HOUSE PROUD\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/08/garden/house-proud-built-just-as-the-sculptor-dreamed-it.html | title=HOUSE PROUD; Built Just as the Sculptor Dreamed It | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 8, 2004 | accessdate=February 4, 2018 | author=Steinberg, Claudia }}</ref><ref name=\"Virtual Globetrotting\">{{cite web | url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/olsen-house-by-tony-smith/ | title='Olsen House' by Tony Smith in Guilford, CT | publisher=Virtual Globetrotting | date=May 11, 2010 | accessdate=February 4, 2018 | author=pmoore66}}</ref><ref name=\"About\"/> Despite these successes, the architect-client relationship frustrated Smith enough that he gravitated toward his artwork.<ref name=\"HOUSE PROUD\"/>\n\nSmith returned to the East Coast after two years in Hollywood, California (1943\u201345) and began teaching, while developing architectural projects, at the same time as developing various theoretical ideas and painting abstractly.  He became a central member of the New York School community, with ties ranging from Gerald Kamrowski to Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko.\n\nHe lived in Germany and traveled extensively in Europe from 1953\u20131955, accompanying his wife Jane who was there as an opera singer. There he developed a new group of architectural projects and painted extensively, including the landmark group of Louisenberg paintings (1953\u20131955). Chiara (Kiki) Smith was born in 1954, when they were living in Nuremberg. Twins Beatrice (Bebe) and Seton were born after the family returned to South Orange, in 1955.\n\nSmith taught architecture and design-related classes at the Delahanty Institute (1956\u201357) and Pratt Institute (1957\u20131959), where he developed ''Throne'' (1956). This critical early work developed from a class assignment for students at Pratt to determine the simplest possible three-dimensional joint that could be stacked for more than two levels.  Smith enhanced the geometrical solution of four triangular prisms by adding another joint, resulting in a new form with seven triangular prisms enclosing two tetrahedra.  After some time passed, he decided that the resulting form was something other than a design exercise, so titled it ''Throne'' because the symmetrical abstraction reminded him of the dense volume of an African beaded throne.\n\nSmith joined the faculty at Bennington College, Vermont. In 1960 a class project investigating close-packed cells based on D'Arcy Thompson's book ''Growth & Form'' (1918) sparked Smith's search for artistic inspiration in the natural world. The resulting agglomeration of 14-sided tetrakaidecahedrons, the ideally efficient soap-bubble cell, is known as the Bennington Structure. This was the first time Smith saw the impact that enlarged geometric shapes could have as independent but architecturally scaled forms - as sculpture.\n\nWhile recovering from an automobile accident at home in 1961, Smith started to create small sculptural maquettes using agglomerations of tetrahedrons and octahedrons. By 1962 he was teaching at Hunter College.  In this year he created ''Black Box'', his first fabricated steel sculpture.  The dense rectangular prism, less than two feet high, developed from a mundane object, a 3 x 5\" file card box that Smith saw on the desk of his Eugene Goossen, his colleague and friend.  Smith enlarged the proportions of the box five times, like a recent class assignment. He phoned a local fabricator, Industrial Welding, whose billboard he had seen while driving on the New Jersey Turnpike and asked them to deliver it to his suburban home. Although the welders assumed he was crazed, they treated the project with the utmost workmanship and the result was a stunning form to Smith. With this piece, entitled ''Black Box'', Smith had discovered a sculpting process that he continued to hone. Where others saw a pure geometric shape, Smith saw it as a mysterious form.  The title alluded to the corrupt administration of New York mayor Jimmy Walker (1926\u201332), when contractors would drop bribes into a slot in a \"black\"box.<ref>James Shepperd, written comments to Joan Pachner, March 13, 1991, p.4.  This accords with Smith's own note relating the ''Black Box'' to an object \"For bribes or graft.\"</ref> is ''Black Box'' was set on the site of the black wood-burning stove in the little house he had lived in as a small child, so it functioned as a kind of gravestone. It was deliberately placed on a thin base of two-by-four inch plywood pieces to call attention to its status as a work of art.\n\nIn 1962, he made ''Die'', a 6' [[steel]] cube that established his reputation as one of the most influential and important artists of his time. ''The Elevens Are Up'' (1963) follows formally on ''Die''. Inspired by the two veins on the back of the neck which are accentuated when one has had too much to drink, the sculpture consists of two black steel masses installed face to face, four feet apart. Fabricated in steel and weighing over 12,000 pounds, the later ''Source'' (1967) is a monumental sculpture which Smith first exhibited at [[Documenta|documenta IV]] in [[Kassel, Germany]] in the summer of 1968.<ref>Tuchman, Phyllis. \"Tony Smith, Master Sculptor.\" ''Portfolio''. Summer 1980.</ref> After exhibiting massive, black-painted [[plywood]] and [[sheet-metal|metal]] works at several sites across the United States and internationally, Smith was featured on the October 13, 1967 cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' with his plywood structure ''Smoke'' (1967)<ref name=\"gugg1\">[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Tony%20Smith&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 Tony Smith] [[Solomon R.

During the 1940s and 1950s Smith became close friends with [[Barnett Newman]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Clyfford Still]].  His sculpture shows their abstract influence. One of Smith\u2019s unrealized architectural projects in 1950 was a plan for a church that was to have painted glass panels designed in collaboration with his friend Pollock.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/13/jacksonsotheractions/ | title=Jackson's Other Actions: Pollock's Sculptures Resurface | work=[[Artnews]] | date= September 13, 2012 | accessdate=February 4, 2018 | author=Cembalest, Robin}}</ref>\n\nSmith also taught at various institutions including [[New York University]], [[Cooper Union]], [[Pratt Institute]], [[Bennington College]], and [[Hunter College]], where he mentored artists such as [[Pat Lipsky]].\n\nSmith was asked to teach a sculpture course at the [[University of Hawaii]] in [[Manoa, Hawaii|Manoa]] during the summer of 1969. He designed two unrealized works, ''Haole Crater'' (a recessed garden) and ''Hubris,'' but eventually created ''The Fourth Sign'' that was sited on the campus. His Hawaii experience also generated fodder for his \"For...\" series whose initials are friends and artists he met during his time in Manoa.\n\nAs a leading sculptor in the 1960s and 1970s, Smith is often typically associated with the [[Minimal art|Minimalist art]] movement.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n[[Image:'The Fourth Sign', painted steel sculpture by Tony Smith, 1976, University of Hawaii at Manoa.JPG|thumb|200px|''[[The Fourth Sign]]'', 1977, at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]]]\n\nSmith's first exhibitions were in 1964, and he had his first one-person exhibition in 1966.

Sometimes he visited the waterworks factory, marveling at the industrial production, machines and fabrication processes.<ref name=\"About\" />\n\nSmith commuted to [[St. Francis Xavier High School (New York City)|St. Francis Xavier High School]], a [[Jesuit]] high school in New York City.<ref name=\"About\">{{cite web | url=http://www.tonysmithestate.com/about/chronology | title=About - Tony Smith | publisher=Tony Smith Estate/Artists Rights Society | accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> In the spring and summer of 1931 he attended [[Fordham University]], and in the fall enrolled at [[Georgetown University]].<ref name=\"About\" /> Smith was disillusioned with formal education, and returned to New Jersey in January 1932, where, during the Great Depression, he opened a second-hand bookstore in Newark on Broad Street.<ref name=\"About\"/> From 1934 to 1936, he worked days at the family factory and attended evening courses at the [[Art Students League of New York]] where he studied anatomy with [[George Bridgman]], drawing and watercolor with [[George Grosz]], and painting with [[Vaclav Vytlacil]].<ref name=\"About\" /> In 1937, he moved to [[Chicago]] intending to study architecture at the [[New Bauhaus]], where he readily absorbed the interdisciplinary curriculum but was ultimately disillusioned. The following year, Smith began working for [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s [[Suntop Homes|Ardmore Project]] near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he began as a carpenter helper and bricklayer, and eventually was named Clerk-of-the-Works. After a brief period with Wright in Taliesin, Wisconsin, Smith worked building the Armstrong house in [[Ogden Dunes, Indiana]]. This period ended when his mother fell ill in 1940 and Smith returned to New Jersey. His father died suddenly on December 1 of that year.\n\n==Career==\n{{Main|List of Tony Smith sculptures}}\n[[Image:LightUpbyTonySmithForbesCourtyard.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Light Up (sculpture)|Light Up]]'', 1974, outside the [[Hillman Library]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]]]\nIn 1940, Smith began his career as an independent architectural designer, which lasted until the early 1960s. He built approximately twenty private homes and envisioned many unrealized projects, such as the 1950 Model Roman Catholic Church, with paintings on glass by Jackson Pollock (1950).  His work included homes for many in the art community, including Fritz Bultman (1945),  [[Theodoros Stamos]] [[Fred Olsen]] (1951), and [[Betty Parsons]] (1959-60).<ref name=\"HOUSE PROUD\">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/08/garden/house-proud-built-just-as-the-sculptor-dreamed-it.html | title=HOUSE PROUD; Built Just as the Sculptor Dreamed It | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 8, 2004 | accessdate=February 4, 2018 | author=Steinberg, Claudia }}</ref><ref name=\"Virtual Globetrotting\">{{cite web | url=http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/olsen-house-by-tony-smith/ | title='Olsen House' by Tony Smith in Guilford, CT | publisher=Virtual Globetrotting | date=May 11, 2010 | accessdate=February 4, 2018 | author=pmoore66}}</ref><ref name=\"About\"/> Despite these successes, the architect-client relationship frustrated Smith enough that he gravitated toward his artwork.<ref name=\"HOUSE PROUD\"/>\n\nSmith returned to the East Coast after two years in Hollywood, California (1943\u201345) and began teaching, while developing architectural projects, at the same time as developing various theoretical ideas and painting abstractly.  He became a central member of the New York School community, with ties ranging from Gerald Kamrowski to Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko.\n\nHe lived in Germany and traveled extensively in Europe from 1953\u20131955, accompanying his wife Jane who was there as an opera singer. There he developed a new group of architectural projects and painted extensively, including the landmark group of Louisenberg paintings (1953\u20131955). Chiara (Kiki) Smith was born in 1954, when they were living in Nuremberg. Twins Beatrice (Bebe) and Seton were born after the family returned to South Orange, in 1955.\n\nSmith taught architecture and design-related classes at the Delahanty Institute (1956\u201357) and Pratt Institute (1957\u20131959), where he developed ''Throne'' (1956). This critical early work developed from a class assignment for students at Pratt to determine the simplest possible three-dimensional joint that could be stacked for more than two levels.  Smith enhanced the geometrical solution of four triangular prisms by adding another joint, resulting in a new form with seven triangular prisms enclosing two tetrahedra.  After some time passed, he decided that the resulting form was something other than a design exercise, so titled it ''Throne'' because the symmetrical abstraction reminded him of the dense volume of an African beaded throne.\n\nSmith joined the faculty at Bennington College, Vermont. In 1960 a class project investigating close-packed cells based on D'Arcy Thompson's book ''Growth & Form'' (1918) sparked Smith's search for artistic inspiration in the natural world. The resulting agglomeration of 14-sided tetrakaidecahedrons, the ideally efficient soap-bubble cell, is known as the Bennington Structure. This was the first time Smith saw the impact that enlarged geometric shapes could have as independent but architecturally scaled forms - as sculpture.\n\nWhile recovering from an automobile accident at home in 1961, Smith started to create small sculptural maquettes using agglomerations of tetrahedrons and octahedrons. By 1962 he was teaching at Hunter College.  In this year he created ''Black Box'', his first fabricated steel sculpture.  The dense rectangular prism, less than two feet high, developed from a mundane object, a 3 x 5\" file card box that Smith saw on the desk of his Eugene Goossen, his colleague and friend.  Smith enlarged the proportions of the box five times, like a recent class assignment. He phoned a local fabricator, Industrial Welding, whose billboard he had seen while driving on the New Jersey Turnpike and asked them to deliver it to his suburban home. Although the welders assumed he was crazed, they treated the project with the utmost workmanship and the result was a stunning form to Smith. With this piece, entitled ''Black Box'', Smith had discovered a sculpting process that he continued to hone. Where others saw a pure geometric shape, Smith saw it as a mysterious form.  The title alluded to the corrupt administration of New York mayor Jimmy Walker (1926\u201332), when contractors would drop bribes into a slot in a \"black\"box.<ref>James Shepperd, written comments to Joan Pachner, March 13, 1991, p.4.  This accords with Smith's own note relating the ''Black Box'' to an object \"For bribes or graft.\"</ref> is ''Black Box'' was set on the site of the black wood-burning stove in the little house he had lived in as a small child, so it functioned as a kind of gravestone. It was deliberately placed on a thin base of two-by-four inch plywood pieces to call attention to its status as a work of art.\n\nIn 1962, he made ''Die'', a 6' [[steel]] cube that established his reputation as one of the most influential and important artists of his time. ''The Elevens Are Up'' (1963) follows formally on ''Die''. Inspired by the two veins on the back of the neck which are accentuated when one has had too much to drink, the sculpture consists of two black steel masses installed face to face, four feet apart. Fabricated in steel and weighing over 12,000 pounds, the later ''Source'' (1967) is a monumental sculpture which Smith first exhibited at [[Documenta|documenta IV]] in [[Kassel, Germany]] in the summer of 1968.<ref>Tuchman, Phyllis. \"Tony Smith, Master Sculptor.\" ''Portfolio''. Summer 1980.</ref> After exhibiting massive, black-painted [[plywood]] and [[sheet-metal|metal]] works at several sites across the United States and internationally, Smith was featured on the October 13, 1967 cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' with his plywood structure ''Smoke'' (1967)<ref name=\"gugg1\">[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/show-full/bio/?artist_name=Tony%20Smith&page=1&f=Name&cr=1 Tony Smith] [[Solomon R.

During the 1940s and 1950s Smith became close friends with [[Barnett Newman]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Mark Rothko]], and [[Clyfford Still]].  His sculpture shows their abstract influence. One of Smith\u2019s unrealized architectural projects in 1950 was a plan for a church that was to have painted glass panels designed in collaboration with his friend Pollock.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/09/13/jacksonsotheractions/ | title=Jackson's Other Actions: Pollock's Sculptures Resurface | work=[[Artnews]] | date= September 13, 2012 | accessdate=February 4, 2018 | author=Cembalest, Robin}}</ref>\n\nSmith also taught at various institutions including [[New York University]], [[Cooper Union]], [[Pratt Institute]], [[Bennington College]], and [[Hunter College]], where he mentored artists such as [[Pat Lipsky]].\n\nSmith was asked to teach a sculpture course at the [[University of Hawaii]] in [[Manoa, Hawaii|Manoa]] during the summer of 1969. He designed two unrealized works, ''Haole Crater'' (a recessed garden) and ''Hubris,'' but eventually created ''The Fourth Sign'' that was sited on the campus. His Hawaii experience also generated fodder for his \"For...\" series whose initials are friends and artists he met during his time in Manoa.\n\nAs a leading sculptor in the 1960s and 1970s, Smith is often typically associated with the [[Minimal art|Minimalist art]] movement.\n\n==Exhibitions==\n[[Image:'The Fourth Sign', painted steel sculpture by Tony Smith, 1976, University of Hawaii at Manoa.JPG|thumb|200px|''[[The Fourth Sign]]'', 1977, at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]]]]\n\nSmith's first exhibitions were in 1964, and he had his first one-person exhibition in 1966.

After a brief stop at [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, where she embarked the Secretary of the [[Brazilian Navy]] for a demonstration during an exercise at sea with five Brazilian destroyers, the attack carrier rounded [[Cape Horn]] on 1 October. She steamed into [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile on 13 October and then sailed two days later for [[Peru]], arriving in [[Callao]] on 20 October where she entertained the President of Peru. At [[Naval Base San Diego|San Diego]], Admiral [[George Whelan Anderson Jr.|George W.

Following operations out of San Diego, she sailed from San Francisco on 13 September 1962. ''Kitty Hawk'' joined the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] on 7 October 1962, relieving {{USS|Midway|CV-41|2}} as the [[flagship]].\n\nAfter participating in the Philippine Republic Aviation Week Air Show, ''Kitty Hawk'' steamed out of [[Manila]] Harbor on 30 November 1962, and welcomed Admiral [[Harry D. Felt]], Commander in Chief, [[United States Pacific Fleet]], for a demonstration of modern naval weapons on 3 December. The ship visited Hong Kong early in December and returned to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 2 January 1963.\n\nIn conjunction with Commander, Carrier Division Seven, ''Kitty Hawk'' carried out several exercises in January and February 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/archives/command-operation-reports/ship-command-operation-reports/k/kitty-hawk-cv-63-ii/s62-m63.pdf |title=Aviation Historical Summary, USS Kitty Hawk, OPNAV Form 5750-2, 30 September 1962 \u2013 30 March 1963 |website=U.S. Navy |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> On 4 January 1963, Operation Checkertail saw ''Kitty Hawk'' and three other attack aircraft carriers launch practice airstrikes against the Okinawa Air Defense Command. From 27 January \u2013 2 February 1963, 'Picture Window III' saw 'foreign aircraft' intercepted and visually identified in the Northern Japan area. Though the official ship's papers released in 2011 do not identify the nationality, it is likely that the 'foreign aircraft' in question were from the Soviet [[Far Eastern Military District]] or [[Soviet Naval Aviation]]. From 16\u201319 February 1963, Exercise 'Red Wheel,' was conducted around Southern Japan also under the direction of Commander, Carrier Division Seven. It aimed to improve the [[United States Seventh Fleet]]'s  ability to conduct conventional and nuclear warfare while maintaining defense against air and submarine attack. It also aimed to evaluate the capability of 'the HUK [Hunter-Killer] Group' to protect two CVA Task Groups. During these exercises, the ship visited [[Kobe]], [[Beppu]] and [[Iwakuni]] before returning to San Diego on 2 April 1963.\n\nOn 6 June 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]], with top civilian and military leaders, boarded ''Kitty Hawk'' to witness a carrier task force weapons demonstration off the California coast. Addressing the men of the task group from ''Kitty Hawk'', President Kennedy told them that, as in the past, control of the seas still means security, peace and ultimate victory. He later wrote to President and Madame [[Chiang Kai-shek]] who had witnessed a similar demonstration on board {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|2}}: \"I hope you were impressed as I was, on my visit to ''Kitty Hawk'', with the great force for peace or war, which these mighty carriers and their accompanying escorts provide, helping to preserve the freedom of distant nations in all parts of the world.\"\n\nLT Felix E.

While approaching Japan, she learned an assassin had shot President Kennedy. Flags were at half mast as she entered [[United States Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo Harbor]] on 25 November 1963, the day of the President's funeral and, as senior ship present, she had the sad honor of firing memorial salutes. After cruising the [[South China Sea]] and ranging to the Philippines in readiness operations with the 7th Fleet, she returned to San Diego on 20 July 1964.\n\n===1965 to 1972===\n[[File:A-6A VA-75 landing on USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63) 1968.jpeg|thumb|left|An [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] from [[Second VA-75 (U.S. Navy)|VA-75]] traps aboard ''Kitty Hawk'' during her 1967-68 deployment to Vietnam]]\n''Kitty Hawk'' overhauled in [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], then trained along the western seaboard. She sailed from San Diego on 19 October 1965, for Hawaii thence to [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], Philippines, where she prepared for combat operations off the coast of [[Vietnam]].\n\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego in June 1966 for overhaul and training until 4 November 1966, when she again deployed to serve in waters of Southeast Asia. Scenes from the 1966 [[Walt Disney]] comedy ''[[Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.]]'' were filmed aboard the warship.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 19 November to relieve ''Constellation'' as flagship for Rear Admiral David C. Richardson, Commander [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]]. On 26 November, ''Kitty Hawk'' departed Yokosuka for [[Yankee Station]] via Subic Bay, and on 5 December, aircraft from ''Kitty Hawk'' began their around-the-clock missions over North Vietnam. About this time ''Kitty Hawk'' \u2014 already accustomed to celebrities as guests \u2013 entertained a number of prominent visitors: [[William Randolph Hearst, Jr.]]; [[Bob Considine]]; [[Billy Graham|Dr. Billy Graham]]; [[Nancy Sinatra]] and [[John Steinbeck]], among others. She remained in the Far East supporting the U.S. in Southeast Asia until departing Subic Bay on 28 May 1968. Steaming via Japan, the carrier reached San Diego on 19 June and a week later entered the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] for maintenance. ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego on 25 August and began a rigorous training program to prepare her for future action.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 23 December 1967 to 1 June 1968, which included the [[Tet Offensive]], while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia, and the Navy Unit Meritorious Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 15 January 1969 to 27 August 1969 while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia and contingency operations in Northeast Asia. Both awards noted that the officers and men of the ''Kitty Hawk'' displayed undaunted spirit, courage, professionalism and dedication to maintain their ship as a fighting unit under the most arduous operating conditions to enable her pilots to destroy vital military targets in [[North Vietnam]] despite intense opposition and extremely adverse weather conditions.\n\n:Cruise: Nov 67 \u2013 Jun 68:  ''Kitty Hawk'' had a fire in port Subic Bay, and went to general quarters for 51 hours.

Nearly 50 sailors were injured in this widely publicized incident.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/report-by-special-subcommittee-disciplinary-problems-us-navy.html |title=Report by the Special Subcommittee on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy |author=United States House Committee on Armed Services |date=2 January 1973 |website=U.S. Navy |accessdate=21 February 2019|author-link=United States House Committee on Armed Services }}</ref> This incident resulted in a Congressional inquiry into discipline in the Navy.\n\n===1973 to 1977===\nFrom January through July 1973, ''Kitty Hawk'' changed [[home port]]s from San Diego to San Francisco. ''Kitty Hawk'' moved into dry dock on 14 January 1973, and work began to convert the ship from an attack (CVA) to a multi-mission carrier (CV). The \"CV\" designation indicated that ''Kitty Hawk'' was no longer strictly an attack carrier, in that [[anti-submarine warfare]] would also become a major role. ''Kitty Hawk'' became the first Pacific Fleet carrier to carry the multi-purpose \"CV\" designation. The conversion consisted of adding 10 new [[helicopter]] calibrating stations, installing [[sonar]]/[[sonobuoy]] readout and analysis center and associated equipment, and changing a large portion of the ship's operating procedures. One of the major equipment/space changes in the conversion was the addition of the Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) in the [[Combat Information Center|CIC]] area. ASCAC worked in close conjunction with the [[anti-submarine warfare]] aircraft assigned aboard [[CVW-11|Carrier Air Wing 11]]. During the yard period, the Engineering Department underwent a major change in its propulsion plant. The Navy Standard Oil (black oil) fuel system was completely converted to Navy Distillate Fuel. The Air Department added several major changes to the flight deck, including enlarging the [[jet blast deflector]]s (JBD) and installing more powerful catapults in order to handle the new [[Grumman]] [[F-14 Tomcat]], which ''Kitty Hawk'' was standing by to receive for its next deployment. Enlarging JBD#1 meant the No. 1 Aircraft Elevator had to be redesigned, making ''Kitty Hawk'' the only carrier at the time having an aircraft elevator which tracked from the hangar deck to the flight deck angling out 6\u00b0. ''Kitty Hawk'' moved out of dry dock on 28 April 1973, and the next day, on her 12th birthday, was named a Multi-Purpose Aircraft Carrier (CV).\n[[Image:USS Kitty Hawk Sydney.jpg|thumb|View of the ''Kitty Hawk'' from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]]]\n\nAfter much needed upgrades and modifications to ''Kitty Hawk''{{'}}s systems, she departed Hunters Point navy shipyards in San Francisco to begin \"sea trial\" exercises and then made a short three-day layover in Pearl Harbor for some crew R&R.  She then departed for the South China Sea. However while en route, during routine maintenance to the ship's fuel oil systems in the No. 1 machinery room on 11 December 1973, a flange gasket failed in one of the fuel transfer tubes of JP5 that pass through Number 1 engine room. Jet fuel was sprayed, atomized, and ignited and the ship went to General Quarters for nearly 38 hours. Due to the massive amounts of thick black smoke the crew was ordered topside to flight deck until the fire could be controlled and smoke cleared. Because two and then three of the ship's four propulsion systems had to be shut down during the fire, ''Kitty Hawk'' began list to about 7 degrees portside and as a result many of the aircraft were moved starboard in an attempt to balance the ship until the fire was finally brought under control and two propulsion systems restored. ''Kitty Hawk'' then headed toward the Philippines where she ported in Subic Bay until the ship's damage could be assessed and repairs could be made, but there would be three days of waiting before reaching port. Six enlisted sailors died in the fire: FR Michael Deverich, FR Linn Schambers, FR Kevin Johnson, FA Alan Champine, Samuel Cardenas and FA Joseph Tulipana. Thirty-four sailors were treated for smoke inhalation and several minor injuries and one sailor for a broken wrist reported. The bodies of those men who died in the fire were escorted home by members of their respective Divisions for burial.\n\nAs a result of the deaths of the six crew members, on 10 January 1974 an investigation was ordered by Rear Admiral [[Donald C. Davis]], Commander of Carrier Group 1 and Senior Officer on board ''Kitty Hawk'' designated as his flagship. Although initial reports lay blame to one of the six men who perished in the tragic fire, upon conclusion of the investigation filed by the Department of the Navy, Commander Seventh Fleet, several opinions on causes were noted within the investigation which included but not limited to the Fourth Endorsement on Captain Kenneth L. Shugart, USN.  The investigative report of 10 January 1974, section 3, paragraph 3 stated \"The replacement of the defective gasket in the strainer cover assembly by Fireman Apprentice Kevin W. Johnson (deceased) reflected, in the words of the investigating officer, poor judgment and unsound maintenance practices.\" Further \"Fireman Apprentice Johnson was therefore negligent in the performance of his duties.\" However, in consonance with the investigating officer, the opinion is expressed that under the circumstances, the maintenance deficiencies noted herein constitute simple, rather than culpable, negligence.\"\n\nIn light of the efforts made by all six navy personnel, FA Cardenas, Champine and Tulipana, and FR Deverich, Schambers and Johnson assigned to the machinery room on 11 December 1973, who all died during the suppression efforts, \"It has administratively been determined each were posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for their heroic devotion to duty in fighting the fire which is the subject of this investigative report.\"<ref>Department of the Navy investigative report by Captain Kenneth L.

''Kitty Hawk'' departed San Diego on 8 March 1976, and on 12 March entered dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in [[Bremerton, Washington]], to commence a US$100 million complex overhaul, scheduled to last just more than 12 months. This overhaul configured ''Kitty Hawk'' to operate with the F-14 and [[S-3 Viking|S-3A \"Viking\"]] aircraft in a total CV sea control mode. This included adding spaces for storage, ordnance handling and maintenance facilities for the two aircraft. Also included in the work package were more efficient work areas for airframes and a repair facility for ground support equipment and the addition of avionics support capability for the S-3. The ship also replaced the Terrier Surface-to-Air missile system with the [[NATO]] [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] system, and added elevators and modified weapons magazines to provide an increased capability for handling and stowing the newer, larger air-launched weapons. ''Kitty Hawk'' completed the overhaul in March 1977, and departed the shipyard 1 April of that year to return to San Diego. After a six-month pre-deployment workup, ''Kitty Hawk'' departed [[NAS North Island]] 25 October 1977<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/archives/command-operation-reports/ship-command-operation-reports/k/kitty-hawk-cv-63-ii/1977.pdf |title=USS Kitty Hawk Command History for 1977 |date=6 April 1978 |website=Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> for another [[Western Pacific Ocean]] deployment and returned 15 May 1978.\n\n===1979 to 1998===\nIn May 1979, the ship teamed up with Carrier Air Wing 15 (CVW-15)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.seaforces.org/usnair/CVW/Carrier-Air-Wing-15.htm |title=CVW-15 Carrier Air Wing 15 CARAIRWING FIFTEEN - US Navy |website=Seaforces Online - Naval Information |publisher=seaforces.org |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> for another Western Pacific deployment. Her duties included search and assistance operations to aid [[Boat people#Vietnamese boat people|refugees in small boats]] fleeing the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nDuring that deployment, ''Kitty Hawk'' also offered contingency support off the coast of [[Korea]] following the assassination of [[Republic of Korea]] President [[Park Chung Hee]]. The deployment was then extended two-and-a-half months to support contingency operations in the North Arabian Sea during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. For their actions in the region, ''Kitty Hawk'' and CVW-15 were awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]].\n[[File:Kitty Hawk Sydney 02.JPG|thumb|''Kitty Hawk'' docked in Sydney harbor]]\n[[File:Kitty Hawk Sydney 01.JPG|thumb|The dual [[close-in weapon systems]] ([[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanxs]]) at the stern of ''Kitty Hawk'']]\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' had a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1980 movie ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', standing in for {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|2}}. On her way home from her Western Pacific deployment, ''Kitty Hawk'' was filmed entering [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] with the crew [[manning the rail]]s as the ship passed the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]]. (At the time of the filming, ''Nimitz'' was still an Atlantic Fleet, vice Pacific Fleet, aircraft carrier.) ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego in late February 1980 and was also awarded the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] and the Naval Air Force Pacific [[Battle Efficiency Award|Battle Efficiency \"E\" Award]] as the best carrier in the Pacific Fleet.\n\nIn April 1981, ''Kitty Hawk'' left San Diego for her thirteenth deployment to the Western Pacific. Following the cruise, the crew was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of Vietnamese refugees in the [[South China Sea]].\n\nIn January 1982, ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to Bremerton for another year-long overhaul. Following the comprehensive upgrade and a vigorous training period with [[CVW-2|Carrier Air Wing 2]], ''Kitty Hawk'' deployed in 1984 as the flagship for Battle Group Bravo. ''Kitty Hawk'' logged more than {{convert|62000|mi|km|abbr=on}} <!-- nautical or statute? --> on this deployment and remained at \"Station Gonzo\" in the north [[Arabian Sea]] for more than 60 consecutive days.\n\nIn March 1984, ''Kitty Hawk'' participated in \"Team Spirit\" exercises in the [[Sea of Japan]]. The Soviet [[Victor class submarine|Victor-class]] nuclear attack [[submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-314|''K-314'']] shadowed the task group. On 21 March 1984, at the end of the Sea of Japan part of the exercise, ''K-314'' surfaced directly in front of ''Kitty Hawk'', time was 22:05, too dark and far too close for ''Kitty Hawk'' to see and avoid the resulting collision, with minor damage to the aircraft carrier, and significant damage to the Soviet submarine. At the time of the accident, ''Kitty Hawk'' is estimated to have carried several dozen nuclear weapons, and ''K-314'' probably carried two nuclear torpedoes.  ''Kitty Hawk'' was thereafter considered the first antisubmarine carrier weapon and a red submarine was painted on her island near the bridge but was ordered removed upon return to home port North Island San Diego, CA.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/22/world/soviet-sub-and-us-ship-collide.html |title=Soviet Sub and U.S. Ship Collide |first=Richard |last=Halloran |date=22 March 1984 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.navalhistory.org/2011/03/21/soviet-sub-collides-with-uss-kitty-hawk-21-march-1984 |title=Soviet Sub Collides with USS Kitty Hawk, 21 March 1984 |date=21 March 2011 |website=Naval History Blog |publisher=[[U.S. Naval Institute]] |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' went to the U.S. Naval Base at [[Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]] for repairs. A piece of one of ''K-314''{{'}}s propellers was embedded in ''Kitty Hawk''{{'}}s bow, as were some chunks of the Soviet [[Anechoic tiles|anechoic coating]], from scraping along the side of the submarine. The result was something of an \"accidental\" intelligence coup for the U.S. Navy.\n\nThe ship returned to San Diego on 1 August 1984. Seven months later, ''Kitty Hawk'' was awarded another Battle Efficiency \"E\" Award.\n\nIn July 1985, ''Kitty Hawk'' and [[CVW-9]] deployed again as flagship for Battle Group Bravo. ''Kitty Hawk'' and CVW-9 combined to set a standard for operations, completing their second consecutive fatality-free deployment.\n\nCVW-9 crews logged more than 18,000 flight hours and 7,300 arrested landings while ''Kitty Hawk'' maintained her catapults and arresting gear at 100 percent availability.\n\nIn 1986, during pre-cruise exercises, one Airman was killed during flight operations when he was struck by an aircraft while checking \"elongs\" during a launch.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' bid farewell to San Diego on 3 January 1987, as the ship departed her home port of 25 years and set out on a six-month world cruise. During the circumnavigation, ''Kitty Hawk'' and CVW-9 again showed their commitment to safety by conducting a third fatality-free deployment . ''Kitty Hawk'' spent 106 consecutive days on station in the Indian Ocean and was again awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service. The world cruise ended at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 3 July. Six months later, ''Kitty Hawk'' began a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) overhaul. ''Kitty Hawk'' emerged from the yards on 2 August 1990. The overhaul was estimated to have added 20 years of service to the ship. The Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department was also awarded the Air Forces, US Pacific Fleet Departmental Excellence Award, the Black \"E\" for this deployment.\n\nWith the return of CVW-15 to its decks, ''Kitty Hawk'' began its second deployment around [[Cape Horn|\"the Horn\"]] of South America to her original home port of San Diego on 11 December 1991, performing [[Gringo-Gaucho]] with the [[Argentine Naval Aviation]] during the transit.\n\nOn 1 August 1992, ''Kitty Hawk'' was appointed as Naval Air Force Pacific's \"ready carrier.\" The ship embarked Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5; Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17 and CVW-15 for three months of work-ups before deploying to the Western Pacific on 3 November 1992. While on deployment, ''Kitty Hawk'' spent nine days off the coast of [[Somalia]] supporting [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and coalition forces involved in [[Operation Restore Hope]]. In response to increasing [[Iraq]]i violations of United Nations sanctions, the ship rushed to the [[Persian Gulf]] on 27 December 1992. Just 17 days later, ''Kitty Hawk'' led a joint coalition offensive strike against designated targets in southern Iraq.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' set sail on her 17th deployment 24 June 1994, with the goal of providing a stabilizing influence operating in the Western Pacific during a time of great tension in the Far East, particularly concerning North Korea.\n\nIn 1995, ''Kitty Hawk'' embarked airwing transitioned to CVW-11, marking a change to a single F-14 squadron, and 3 F/A-18 squadrons.<ref name=\"Former crewmember, with VFA-94\">Former crewmember, with VFA-94.</ref>\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' began her 18th deployment, this time with CVW-11, in October 1996.

The carrier made a rare visit to Hobart, Tasmania as well as being only the second carrier to ever stop in Manama, Bahrain.<ref name=\"Former crewmember, with VFA-94\"/> ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego 11 April 1997, immediately beginning a 15-month, $110 million overhaul, including three months in dry dock in Bremerton, from January to March 1998.\n\n===1998 to 2008 (Forward Deployed: Yokosuka, Japan)===\n[[File:USS Independence (CV-62) and Kitty Hawk (CV-63) at Pearl Harbor 1998.JPEG|thumb|''Kitty Hawk'' (right) relieves {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}} at Pearl Harbor as the 7th Fleet forward deployed carrier]]\n[[File:KittyHawkScrub.jpg|thumb|A navy petty officer supervises sailors performing a flight deck scrub down on board ''Kitty Hawk'' in August 2005]]\n[[File:Aircraft elevator USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|thumb|right|An F/A-18C on the forward elevator on board ''Kitty Hawk'']]\n[[File:USS Kitty Hawk at Yokosuka.jpg|thumb|right|''Kitty Hawk'' docks at the U.S. navy base in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka, Japan]]]]\n[[File:US Navy 021202-N-0271M-016 Jackie Chan tries on a fighter pilot's helmet with night vision goggles attached during his visit aboard USS Kitty Hawk (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright0.1||Jackie Chan tries on a fighter pilot's helmet with night vision goggles]]\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' departed San Diego on 6 July 1998, to assume new duties as America's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' also welcomed aboard [[Carrier Air Wing 5]], operating from [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], Japan. ''Kitty Hawk'' arrived at her new operating location of [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka]], Japan, on 11 August 1998.\n\nWith the decommissioning of ''Independence'' on 30 September 1998, ''Kitty Hawk'' became the second-oldest active warship in the US Navy and was authorized to fly the [[First Navy Jack]].\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' set sail for a planned three-month underway period 2 March 1999, which included Exercise Tandem Thrust off [[Guam]]. Following the exercise, the ''Kitty Hawk''/[[CVW-5]] team was ordered to the Persian Gulf to enforce the [[No-Fly Zone]] over Southern Iraq. CVW-5 pilots flew more than 8,800 sorties in 116 days, including 1,300 combat sorties, dropping more than 20&nbsp;tons of ordnance. On the return trip to Japan, ''Kitty Hawk'' made port visits to [[Perth, Western Australia]], and [[Pattaya]], Thailand. ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to Yokosuka 25 August 1999. She was again underway to the Sea of Japan 22 October to participate in Exercises [[Foal Eagle]] and AnnualEx 11G.\n\nOn 11 April 2000, ''Kitty Hawk'' departed Yokosuka, Japan for routine local area operations and to participate in [[Cobra Gold|Exercise Cobra Gold]] with the navies of Singapore and Thailand. ''Kitty Hawk'' participated in [[Foal Eagle|Exercise Foal Eagle]] in Fall 2000, and deployed again in March 2001 for a Spring underway period with a historic stop. On 22 March, ''Kitty Hawk'' became the first aircraft carrier to ever moor pier-side in [[Singapore]], as the ship visited the brand new Changi Pier, located at the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]'s [[Changi Naval Base]]. On 29 April, shortly after a visit to Guam, ''Kitty Hawk'' celebrated 40 years of active service as the ship and crew sailed south to participate in [[Exercise Talisman Saber|Exercise Tandem Thrust]] 2001 with the Australian and Canadian navies.

In the fall of 2002, ''Kitty Hawk'' was training in the Western Pacific. ''Kitty Hawk'' and her battle group combined with U.S. Air Force units and elements of the [[Japan Maritime Self Defense Force]] to conduct AnnualEx 14G in the waters surrounding Japan.

''Kitty Hawk'' was soon involved in [[Operation Southern Watch|Operations Southern Watch]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraqi Freedom]] in the North Persian Gulf. Although the cruise was originally intended to be short, the ship ended up serving 110 continuous days at sea.

It was the second naval ship named after [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], the site of the [[Wright brothers]]' first powered airplane flight. ''Kitty Hawk'' was both the first of the three {{sclass-|Kitty Hawk|aircraft carrier|1}}s to be commissioned and last to be decommissioned.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' was laid down by the [[New York Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Camden, New Jersey]], on 27 December 1956. The ship was launched on 21 May 1960, sponsored by Mrs. Camilla F. McElroy, wife of Defense Secretary [[Neil H. McElroy]]. ''Kitty Hawk'' was launched by flooding her [[drydock]]; the conventional slide down method was ruled out because of her mass and the risk that she might hit the Philadelphia shore on the far side of the Delaware River.\n\nThe ship was commissioned 29 April 1961, at [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], Captain [[William F. Bringle]] in command.\n\nWith the decommissioning of {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}} on 30 September 1998, ''Kitty Hawk'' became the United States warship with the second-longest active status, after the sailing ship {{USS|Constitution}} ({{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|2}} passed her in 2012; these two aircraft carriers were two of the three carriers to fly the [[First Navy Jack]]).{{Efn|This tradition ended in 2002, when the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]] directed all Navy ships to fly this flag for the duration of the [[War on Terrorism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navyjack.info/war.html |title=First Navy Jack in the War on Terrorism |first=Chris |last=Whitten |website=NavyJack.info |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nFor 10 years, ''Kitty Hawk'' was the forward-deployed carrier at [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka Naval Base]] in [[Yokosuka (city)|Yokosuka]], Japan.  In October 2008, she was replaced in this role by {{USS|George Washington|CVN-73|2}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' then returned to the United States and had her decommissioning ceremony on 31 January 2009. She was officially decommissioned on 12 May 2009 after almost 49 years of service.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=45202 |title=Navy Decommissions USS Kitty Hawk |date=12 May 2009 |website=U.S. Navy, Kitty Hawk Public Affairs |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> ''Kitty Hawk'' was replaced by {{USS|George H.W. Bush|CVN-77|2}}. She was stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 20 October 2017, and will be dismantled.\n\n==Service history==\n\n===1961 to 1964===\n[[File:Pacific Fleet Exercises from the USS Kitty Hawk with Governor Brown.jpg|thumb|250px|left|President Kennedy and [[Pat Brown|Governor Brown]] of California review a fleet demonstration aboard ''Kitty Hawk'' on 6 June 1963]]\n[[File:USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63) and USS Turner Joy (DD-951) refueling from USS Kawishiwi (AO-146) on 23 April 1964.jpg|thumb|''Kitty Hawk'' and the destroyer {{USS|Turner Joy|DD-951|2}} refuel from {{USNS|Kawishiwi|T-AO-146|2}} in 1964]]\nFollowing a shakedown in the Western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], ''Kitty Hawk'' departed [[Naval Station Norfolk]], [[Norfolk, Virginia]] on 11 August 1961. After a brief stop at [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, where she embarked the Secretary of the [[Brazilian Navy]] for a demonstration during an exercise at sea with five Brazilian destroyers, the attack carrier rounded [[Cape Horn]] on 1 October. She steamed into [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile on 13 October and then sailed two days later for [[Peru]], arriving in [[Callao]] on 20 October where she entertained the President of Peru. At [[Naval Base San Diego|San Diego]], Admiral [[George Whelan Anderson Jr.|George W. Anderson]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], landed on her deck 18 November to witness [[antisubmarine]] demonstrations by {{USS|Henry B. Wilson|DDG-7|2}} and {{USS|Blueback|SS-581|2}}, a [[Terrier missile]] demonstration by {{USS|Topeka|CLG-8|2}} and air demonstrations by ''Kitty Hawk''.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' entered [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard]] on 23 November 1961 for alterations. Following operations out of San Diego, she sailed from San Francisco on 13 September 1962. ''Kitty Hawk'' joined the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] on 7 October 1962, relieving {{USS|Midway|CV-41|2}} as the [[flagship]].\n\nAfter participating in the Philippine Republic Aviation Week Air Show, ''Kitty Hawk'' steamed out of [[Manila]] Harbor on 30 November 1962, and welcomed Admiral [[Harry D. Felt]], Commander in Chief, [[United States Pacific Fleet]], for a demonstration of modern naval weapons on 3 December. The ship visited Hong Kong early in December and returned to Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 2 January 1963.\n\nIn conjunction with Commander, Carrier Division Seven, ''Kitty Hawk'' carried out several exercises in January and February 1963.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/archives/command-operation-reports/ship-command-operation-reports/k/kitty-hawk-cv-63-ii/s62-m63.pdf |title=Aviation Historical Summary, USS Kitty Hawk, OPNAV Form 5750-2, 30 September 1962 \u2013 30 March 1963 |website=U.S. Navy |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> On 4 January 1963, Operation Checkertail saw ''Kitty Hawk'' and three other attack aircraft carriers launch practice airstrikes against the Okinawa Air Defense Command. From 27 January \u2013 2 February 1963, 'Picture Window III' saw 'foreign aircraft' intercepted and visually identified in the Northern Japan area. Though the official ship's papers released in 2011 do not identify the nationality, it is likely that the 'foreign aircraft' in question were from the Soviet [[Far Eastern Military District]] or [[Soviet Naval Aviation]]. From 16\u201319 February 1963, Exercise 'Red Wheel,' was conducted around Southern Japan also under the direction of Commander, Carrier Division Seven. It aimed to improve the [[United States Seventh Fleet]]'s  ability to conduct conventional and nuclear warfare while maintaining defense against air and submarine attack. It also aimed to evaluate the capability of 'the HUK [Hunter-Killer] Group' to protect two CVA Task Groups. During these exercises, the ship visited [[Kobe]], [[Beppu]] and [[Iwakuni]] before returning to San Diego on 2 April 1963.\n\nOn 6 June 1963, President [[John F. Kennedy]], with top civilian and military leaders, boarded ''Kitty Hawk'' to witness a carrier task force weapons demonstration off the California coast. Addressing the men of the task group from ''Kitty Hawk'', President Kennedy told them that, as in the past, control of the seas still means security, peace and ultimate victory. He later wrote to President and Madame [[Chiang Kai-shek]] who had witnessed a similar demonstration on board {{USS|Constellation|CV-64|2}}: \"I hope you were impressed as I was, on my visit to ''Kitty Hawk'', with the great force for peace or war, which these mighty carriers and their accompanying escorts provide, helping to preserve the freedom of distant nations in all parts of the world.\"\n\nLT Felix E. Templeton, of VF-114, flying a recently issued F-4B Phantom II, made the ship's 16,000th trap, in Aircraft No. 401, on 17 August 1963.<ref name=\"DANFS\"/>\n\nFilm director [[John Frankenheimer]] filmed shots for the movie ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' on board the vessel in 1963.\n\nFollowing a series of strike exercises and tactics reaching along the California coast and off Hawaii, ''Kitty Hawk'' again sailed for the Far East. While approaching Japan, she learned an assassin had shot President Kennedy. Flags were at half mast as she entered [[United States Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo Harbor]] on 25 November 1963, the day of the President's funeral and, as senior ship present, she had the sad honor of firing memorial salutes. After cruising the [[South China Sea]] and ranging to the Philippines in readiness operations with the 7th Fleet, she returned to San Diego on 20 July 1964.\n\n===1965 to 1972===\n[[File:A-6A VA-75 landing on USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63) 1968.jpeg|thumb|left|An [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] from [[Second VA-75 (U.S. Navy)|VA-75]] traps aboard ''Kitty Hawk'' during her 1967-68 deployment to Vietnam]]\n''Kitty Hawk'' overhauled in [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], then trained along the western seaboard. She sailed from San Diego on 19 October 1965, for Hawaii thence to [[U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay|Subic Bay]], Philippines, where she prepared for combat operations off the coast of [[Vietnam]].\n\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego in June 1966 for overhaul and training until 4 November 1966, when she again deployed to serve in waters of Southeast Asia. Scenes from the 1966 [[Walt Disney]] comedy ''[[Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.]]'' were filmed aboard the warship.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' arrived at Yokosuka, Japan on 19 November to relieve ''Constellation'' as flagship for Rear Admiral David C. Richardson, Commander [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]]. On 26 November, ''Kitty Hawk'' departed Yokosuka for [[Yankee Station]] via Subic Bay, and on 5 December, aircraft from ''Kitty Hawk'' began their around-the-clock missions over North Vietnam. About this time ''Kitty Hawk'' \u2014 already accustomed to celebrities as guests \u2013 entertained a number of prominent visitors: [[William Randolph Hearst, Jr.]]; [[Bob Considine]]; [[Billy Graham|Dr. Billy Graham]]; [[Nancy Sinatra]] and [[John Steinbeck]], among others. She remained in the Far East supporting the U.S. in Southeast Asia until departing Subic Bay on 28 May 1968. Steaming via Japan, the carrier reached San Diego on 19 June and a week later entered the [[Long Beach Naval Shipyard|naval shipyard]] at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] for maintenance. ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego on 25 August and began a rigorous training program to prepare her for future action.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' was awarded the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] for exceptionally meritorious and heroic service from 23 December 1967 to 1 June 1968, which included the [[Tet Offensive]], while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia, and the Navy Unit Meritorious Commendation for exceptionally meritorious service from 15 January 1969 to 27 August 1969 while participating in combat operations in Southeast Asia and contingency operations in Northeast Asia. Both awards noted that the officers and men of the ''Kitty Hawk'' displayed undaunted spirit, courage, professionalism and dedication to maintain their ship as a fighting unit under the most arduous operating conditions to enable her pilots to destroy vital military targets in [[North Vietnam]] despite intense opposition and extremely adverse weather conditions.\n\n:Cruise: Nov 67 \u2013 Jun 68:  ''Kitty Hawk'' had a fire in port Subic Bay, and went to general quarters for 51 hours. Had a plane crash on this cruise also, Jan 1968 lost Bill Reedy AO3 from \"G\" div. and two other men in that crash.\n:Cruise: Nov 68 \u2013 Jun 69:  After the cruise ''Kitty Hawk'' came back to San Diego for a month and then went to Puget Sound shipyard in Washington State Sept 1969 for dry dock.\nOn 12 October 1972 during the [[Vietnam War]], ''Kitty Hawk'' was en route to her station in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]] when a [[Racism|race]] [[USS Kitty Hawk riot|riot involving more]] than 200 sailors broke out. Nearly 50 sailors were injured in this widely publicized incident.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/r/report-by-special-subcommittee-disciplinary-problems-us-navy.html |title=Report by the Special Subcommittee on Disciplinary Problems in the US Navy |author=United States House Committee on Armed Services |date=2 January 1973 |website=U.S. Navy |accessdate=21 February 2019|author-link=United States House Committee on Armed Services }}</ref> This incident resulted in a Congressional inquiry into discipline in the Navy.\n\n===1973 to 1977===\nFrom January through July 1973, ''Kitty Hawk'' changed [[home port]]s from San Diego to San Francisco. ''Kitty Hawk'' moved into dry dock on 14 January 1973, and work began to convert the ship from an attack (CVA) to a multi-mission carrier (CV). The \"CV\" designation indicated that ''Kitty Hawk'' was no longer strictly an attack carrier, in that [[anti-submarine warfare]] would also become a major role. ''Kitty Hawk'' became the first Pacific Fleet carrier to carry the multi-purpose \"CV\" designation. The conversion consisted of adding 10 new [[helicopter]] calibrating stations, installing [[sonar]]/[[sonobuoy]] readout and analysis center and associated equipment, and changing a large portion of the ship's operating procedures. One of the major equipment/space changes in the conversion was the addition of the Anti-Submarine Classification and Analysis Center (ASCAC) in the [[Combat Information Center|CIC]] area. ASCAC worked in close conjunction with the [[anti-submarine warfare]] aircraft assigned aboard [[CVW-11|Carrier Air Wing 11]]. During the yard period, the Engineering Department underwent a major change in its propulsion plant. The Navy Standard Oil (black oil) fuel system was completely converted to Navy Distillate Fuel. The Air Department added several major changes to the flight deck, including enlarging the [[jet blast deflector]]s (JBD) and installing more powerful catapults in order to handle the new [[Grumman]] [[F-14 Tomcat]], which ''Kitty Hawk'' was standing by to receive for its next deployment. Enlarging JBD#1 meant the No. 1 Aircraft Elevator had to be redesigned, making ''Kitty Hawk'' the only carrier at the time having an aircraft elevator which tracked from the hangar deck to the flight deck angling out 6\u00b0. ''Kitty Hawk'' moved out of dry dock on 28 April 1973, and the next day, on her 12th birthday, was named a Multi-Purpose Aircraft Carrier (CV).\n[[Image:USS Kitty Hawk Sydney.jpg|thumb|View of the ''Kitty Hawk'' from the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]]]]\n\nAfter much needed upgrades and modifications to ''Kitty Hawk''{{'}}s systems, she departed Hunters Point navy shipyards in San Francisco to begin \"sea trial\" exercises and then made a short three-day layover in Pearl Harbor for some crew R&R.  She then departed for the South China Sea. However while en route, during routine maintenance to the ship's fuel oil systems in the No. 1 machinery room on 11 December 1973, a flange gasket failed in one of the fuel transfer tubes of JP5 that pass through Number 1 engine room. Jet fuel was sprayed, atomized, and ignited and the ship went to General Quarters for nearly 38 hours. Due to the massive amounts of thick black smoke the crew was ordered topside to flight deck until the fire could be controlled and smoke cleared. Because two and then three of the ship's four propulsion systems had to be shut down during the fire, ''Kitty Hawk'' began list to about 7 degrees portside and as a result many of the aircraft were moved starboard in an attempt to balance the ship until the fire was finally brought under control and two propulsion systems restored. ''Kitty Hawk'' then headed toward the Philippines where she ported in Subic Bay until the ship's damage could be assessed and repairs could be made, but there would be three days of waiting before reaching port. Six enlisted sailors died in the fire: FR Michael Deverich, FR Linn Schambers, FR Kevin Johnson, FA Alan Champine, Samuel Cardenas and FA Joseph Tulipana. Thirty-four sailors were treated for smoke inhalation and several minor injuries and one sailor for a broken wrist reported. The bodies of those men who died in the fire were escorted home by members of their respective Divisions for burial.\n\nAs a result of the deaths of the six crew members, on 10 January 1974 an investigation was ordered by Rear Admiral [[Donald C. Davis]], Commander of Carrier Group 1 and Senior Officer on board ''Kitty Hawk'' designated as his flagship. Although initial reports lay blame to one of the six men who perished in the tragic fire, upon conclusion of the investigation filed by the Department of the Navy, Commander Seventh Fleet, several opinions on causes were noted within the investigation which included but not limited to the Fourth Endorsement on Captain Kenneth L. Shugart, USN.  The investigative report of 10 January 1974, section 3, paragraph 3 stated \"The replacement of the defective gasket in the strainer cover assembly by Fireman Apprentice Kevin W. Johnson (deceased) reflected, in the words of the investigating officer, poor judgment and unsound maintenance practices.\" Further \"Fireman Apprentice Johnson was therefore negligent in the performance of his duties.\" However, in consonance with the investigating officer, the opinion is expressed that under the circumstances, the maintenance deficiencies noted herein constitute simple, rather than culpable, negligence.\"\n\nIn light of the efforts made by all six navy personnel, FA Cardenas, Champine and Tulipana, and FR Deverich, Schambers and Johnson assigned to the machinery room on 11 December 1973, who all died during the suppression efforts, \"It has administratively been determined each were posthumously awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for their heroic devotion to duty in fighting the fire which is the subject of this investigative report.\"<ref>Department of the Navy investigative report by Captain Kenneth L.

''Kitty Hawk'' departed San Diego on 8 March 1976, and on 12 March entered dry dock at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in [[Bremerton, Washington]], to commence a US$100 million complex overhaul, scheduled to last just more than 12 months. This overhaul configured ''Kitty Hawk'' to operate with the F-14 and [[S-3 Viking|S-3A \"Viking\"]] aircraft in a total CV sea control mode. This included adding spaces for storage, ordnance handling and maintenance facilities for the two aircraft. Also included in the work package were more efficient work areas for airframes and a repair facility for ground support equipment and the addition of avionics support capability for the S-3. The ship also replaced the Terrier Surface-to-Air missile system with the [[NATO]] [[AIM-7 Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] system, and added elevators and modified weapons magazines to provide an increased capability for handling and stowing the newer, larger air-launched weapons. ''Kitty Hawk'' completed the overhaul in March 1977, and departed the shipyard 1 April of that year to return to San Diego. After a six-month pre-deployment workup, ''Kitty Hawk'' departed [[NAS North Island]] 25 October 1977<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/archives/command-operation-reports/ship-command-operation-reports/k/kitty-hawk-cv-63-ii/1977.pdf |title=USS Kitty Hawk Command History for 1977 |date=6 April 1978 |website=Naval History and Heritage Command |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref> for another [[Western Pacific Ocean]] deployment and returned 15 May 1978.\n\n===1979 to 1998===\nIn May 1979, the ship teamed up with Carrier Air Wing 15 (CVW-15)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.seaforces.org/usnair/CVW/Carrier-Air-Wing-15.htm |title=CVW-15 Carrier Air Wing 15 CARAIRWING FIFTEEN - US Navy |website=Seaforces Online - Naval Information |publisher=seaforces.org |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> for another Western Pacific deployment. Her duties included search and assistance operations to aid [[Boat people#Vietnamese boat people|refugees in small boats]] fleeing the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nDuring that deployment, ''Kitty Hawk'' also offered contingency support off the coast of [[Korea]] following the assassination of [[Republic of Korea]] President [[Park Chung Hee]]. The deployment was then extended two-and-a-half months to support contingency operations in the North Arabian Sea during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. For their actions in the region, ''Kitty Hawk'' and CVW-15 were awarded the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]].\n[[File:Kitty Hawk Sydney 02.JPG|thumb|''Kitty Hawk'' docked in Sydney harbor]]\n[[File:Kitty Hawk Sydney 01.JPG|thumb|The dual [[close-in weapon systems]] ([[Phalanx CIWS|Phalanxs]]) at the stern of ''Kitty Hawk'']]\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' had a [[cameo appearance]] in the 1980 movie ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', standing in for {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|2}}. On her way home from her Western Pacific deployment, ''Kitty Hawk'' was filmed entering [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] with the crew [[manning the rail]]s as the ship passed the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]]. (At the time of the filming, ''Nimitz'' was still an Atlantic Fleet, vice Pacific Fleet, aircraft carrier.) ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego in late February 1980 and was also awarded the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] and the Naval Air Force Pacific [[Battle Efficiency Award|Battle Efficiency \"E\" Award]] as the best carrier in the Pacific Fleet.\n\nIn April 1981, ''Kitty Hawk'' left San Diego for her thirteenth deployment to the Western Pacific. Following the cruise, the crew was awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Humanitarian Service Medal for the rescue of Vietnamese refugees in the [[South China Sea]].\n\nIn January 1982, ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to Bremerton for another year-long overhaul. Following the comprehensive upgrade and a vigorous training period with [[CVW-2|Carrier Air Wing 2]], ''Kitty Hawk'' deployed in 1984 as the flagship for Battle Group Bravo. ''Kitty Hawk'' logged more than {{convert|62000|mi|km|abbr=on}} <!-- nautical or statute? --> on this deployment and remained at \"Station Gonzo\" in the north [[Arabian Sea]] for more than 60 consecutive days.\n\nIn March 1984, ''Kitty Hawk'' participated in \"Team Spirit\" exercises in the [[Sea of Japan]]. The Soviet [[Victor class submarine|Victor-class]] nuclear attack [[submarine]] [[Soviet submarine K-314|''K-314'']] shadowed the task group. On 21 March 1984, at the end of the Sea of Japan part of the exercise, ''K-314'' surfaced directly in front of ''Kitty Hawk'', time was 22:05, too dark and far too close for ''Kitty Hawk'' to see and avoid the resulting collision, with minor damage to the aircraft carrier, and significant damage to the Soviet submarine. At the time of the accident, ''Kitty Hawk'' is estimated to have carried several dozen nuclear weapons, and ''K-314'' probably carried two nuclear torpedoes.  ''Kitty Hawk'' was thereafter considered the first antisubmarine carrier weapon and a red submarine was painted on her island near the bridge but was ordered removed upon return to home port North Island San Diego, CA.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/22/world/soviet-sub-and-us-ship-collide.html |title=Soviet Sub and U.S. Ship Collide |first=Richard |last=Halloran |date=22 March 1984 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.navalhistory.org/2011/03/21/soviet-sub-collides-with-uss-kitty-hawk-21-march-1984 |title=Soviet Sub Collides with USS Kitty Hawk, 21 March 1984 |date=21 March 2011 |website=Naval History Blog |publisher=[[U.S. Naval Institute]] |accessdate=21 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' went to the U.S. Naval Base at [[Subic Bay]] in the [[Philippines]] for repairs. A piece of one of ''K-314''{{'}}s propellers was embedded in ''Kitty Hawk''{{'}}s bow, as were some chunks of the Soviet [[Anechoic tiles|anechoic coating]], from scraping along the side of the submarine. The result was something of an \"accidental\" intelligence coup for the U.S. Navy.\n\nThe ship returned to San Diego on 1 August 1984. Seven months later, ''Kitty Hawk'' was awarded another Battle Efficiency \"E\" Award.\n\nIn July 1985, ''Kitty Hawk'' and [[CVW-9]] deployed again as flagship for Battle Group Bravo. ''Kitty Hawk'' and CVW-9 combined to set a standard for operations, completing their second consecutive fatality-free deployment.\n\nCVW-9 crews logged more than 18,000 flight hours and 7,300 arrested landings while ''Kitty Hawk'' maintained her catapults and arresting gear at 100 percent availability.\n\nIn 1986, during pre-cruise exercises, one Airman was killed during flight operations when he was struck by an aircraft while checking \"elongs\" during a launch.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' bid farewell to San Diego on 3 January 1987, as the ship departed her home port of 25 years and set out on a six-month world cruise. During the circumnavigation, ''Kitty Hawk'' and CVW-9 again showed their commitment to safety by conducting a third fatality-free deployment . ''Kitty Hawk'' spent 106 consecutive days on station in the Indian Ocean and was again awarded the Navy Expeditionary Medal and the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service. The world cruise ended at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 3 July. Six months later, ''Kitty Hawk'' began a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) overhaul. ''Kitty Hawk'' emerged from the yards on 2 August 1990. The overhaul was estimated to have added 20 years of service to the ship. The Aircraft Intermediate Maintenance Department was also awarded the Air Forces, US Pacific Fleet Departmental Excellence Award, the Black \"E\" for this deployment.\n\nWith the return of CVW-15 to its decks, ''Kitty Hawk'' began its second deployment around [[Cape Horn|\"the Horn\"]] of South America to her original home port of San Diego on 11 December 1991, performing [[Gringo-Gaucho]] with the [[Argentine Naval Aviation]] during the transit.\n\nOn 1 August 1992, ''Kitty Hawk'' was appointed as Naval Air Force Pacific's \"ready carrier.\" The ship embarked Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5; Commander, Destroyer Squadron 17 and CVW-15 for three months of work-ups before deploying to the Western Pacific on 3 November 1992. While on deployment, ''Kitty Hawk'' spent nine days off the coast of [[Somalia]] supporting [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] and coalition forces involved in [[Operation Restore Hope]]. In response to increasing [[Iraq]]i violations of United Nations sanctions, the ship rushed to the [[Persian Gulf]] on 27 December 1992. Just 17 days later, ''Kitty Hawk'' led a joint coalition offensive strike against designated targets in southern Iraq.\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' set sail on her 17th deployment 24 June 1994, with the goal of providing a stabilizing influence operating in the Western Pacific during a time of great tension in the Far East, particularly concerning North Korea.\n\nIn 1995, ''Kitty Hawk'' embarked airwing transitioned to CVW-11, marking a change to a single F-14 squadron, and 3 F/A-18 squadrons.<ref name=\"Former crewmember, with VFA-94\">Former crewmember, with VFA-94.</ref>\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' began her 18th deployment, this time with CVW-11, in October 1996. During the six-month underway period, the ship visited ports in the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific.  The carrier made a rare visit to Hobart, Tasmania as well as being only the second carrier to ever stop in Manama, Bahrain.<ref name=\"Former crewmember, with VFA-94\"/> ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to San Diego 11 April 1997, immediately beginning a 15-month, $110 million overhaul, including three months in dry dock in Bremerton, from January to March 1998.\n\n===1998 to 2008 (Forward Deployed: Yokosuka, Japan)===\n[[File:USS Independence (CV-62) and Kitty Hawk (CV-63) at Pearl Harbor 1998.JPEG|thumb|''Kitty Hawk'' (right) relieves {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}} at Pearl Harbor as the 7th Fleet forward deployed carrier]]\n[[File:KittyHawkScrub.jpg|thumb|A navy petty officer supervises sailors performing a flight deck scrub down on board ''Kitty Hawk'' in August 2005]]\n[[File:Aircraft elevator USS Kitty Hawk.jpg|thumb|right|An F/A-18C on the forward elevator on board ''Kitty Hawk'']]\n[[File:USS Kitty Hawk at Yokosuka.jpg|thumb|right|''Kitty Hawk'' docks at the U.S. navy base in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka, Japan]]]]\n[[File:US Navy 021202-N-0271M-016 Jackie Chan tries on a fighter pilot's helmet with night vision goggles attached during his visit aboard USS Kitty Hawk (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright0.1||Jackie Chan tries on a fighter pilot's helmet with night vision goggles]]\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' departed San Diego on 6 July 1998, to assume new duties as America's only permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier from {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}. ''Kitty Hawk'' also welcomed aboard [[Carrier Air Wing 5]], operating from [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], Japan. ''Kitty Hawk'' arrived at her new operating location of [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka]], Japan, on 11 August 1998.\n\nWith the decommissioning of ''Independence'' on 30 September 1998, ''Kitty Hawk'' became the second-oldest active warship in the US Navy and was authorized to fly the [[First Navy Jack]].\n\n''Kitty Hawk'' set sail for a planned three-month underway period 2 March 1999, which included Exercise Tandem Thrust off [[Guam]]. Following the exercise, the ''Kitty Hawk''/[[CVW-5]] team was ordered to the Persian Gulf to enforce the [[No-Fly Zone]] over Southern Iraq. CVW-5 pilots flew more than 8,800 sorties in 116 days, including 1,300 combat sorties, dropping more than 20&nbsp;tons of ordnance. On the return trip to Japan, ''Kitty Hawk'' made port visits to [[Perth, Western Australia]], and [[Pattaya]], Thailand. ''Kitty Hawk'' returned to Yokosuka 25 August 1999. She was again underway to the Sea of Japan 22 October to participate in Exercises [[Foal Eagle]] and AnnualEx 11G.\n\nOn 11 April 2000, ''Kitty Hawk'' departed Yokosuka, Japan for routine local area operations and to participate in [[Cobra Gold|Exercise Cobra Gold]] with the navies of Singapore and Thailand. ''Kitty Hawk'' participated in [[Foal Eagle|Exercise Foal Eagle]] in Fall 2000, and deployed again in March 2001 for a Spring underway period with a historic stop. On 22 March, ''Kitty Hawk'' became the first aircraft carrier to ever moor pier-side in [[Singapore]], as the ship visited the brand new Changi Pier, located at the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]'s [[Changi Naval Base]]. On 29 April, shortly after a visit to Guam, ''Kitty Hawk'' celebrated 40 years of active service as the ship and crew sailed south to participate in [[Exercise Talisman Saber|Exercise Tandem Thrust]] 2001 with the Australian and Canadian navies. The ship returned to Yokosuka 11 June 2001.\n\nOn 17 October 2000, and again on 9 November 2000, ''Kitty Hawk'' was buzzed by a group of Russian warplanes in the [[Sea of Japan]], which proceeded to take pictures of the reaction on deck.

In a competition in 1989, Freeman ran 11.67s in the 100 metres and Danila began to think about entering her in the Commonwealth Games Trials in Sydney.\n\nIn 1990, Freeman was chosen as a member of Australia's [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100 m relay]] team for the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. The team won the gold medal, making Freeman the first-ever [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] Commonwealth Games gold medallist, as well as one of the youngest, at 16 years old. She moved to Melbourne in 1990 after the Auckland Commonwealth Games. Shortly after moving to Melbourne, her manager Nic Bideau introduced Freeman to athletics coach Peter Fortune, who would become Freeman's coach for the rest of her career. She was then selected to represent Australia at the [[1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics]] in [[Plovdiv]], Bulgaria. There, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 m and placed fifth in the final of the 400 m.\n\nFreeman competed in her second [[1992 World Junior Championships in Athletics|World Junior Championships]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea. She competed only in the 200 m, winning the silver medal behind China's Hu Ling. Also in 1992 she travelled to her [[1992 Summer Olympics|first Olympic Games]], reaching the second round of her new specialty event; the [[400 metres]]. At the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics]] Freeman competed in the 200 m, reaching the semi-finals.\n\n1994 was Freeman's breakthrough season, when she entered into the world's elite for the first time. Competing at the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]] in Canada, Freeman won gold in both the 200 m and 400 m. She also competed as a member of Australia's 4 \u00d7 100 m squad, winning the silver medal and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 400 m team, who finished first but were later disqualified. During the 1994 season, Freeman took 1.3 seconds from her 400 m personal best, achieving 50.04 seconds. She also set all-time personal bests in the 100 m (11.24) and 200 m (22.25).\n\nAlthough a medal favourite at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics]] in Sweden, Freeman finished fourth. She also reached the semi-finals of the 200 m.\n\nFreeman made more progress during the 1996 season, setting many personal bests and Australian records.

She announced her retirement from athletics in 2003.\n\nIn 2007, she founded the Cathy Freeman Foundation.\n\n==Career==\nCathy Freeman began athletics at the age of 5.

In a competition in 1989, Freeman ran 11.67s in the 100 metres and Danila began to think about entering her in the Commonwealth Games Trials in Sydney.\n\nIn 1990, Freeman was chosen as a member of Australia's [[4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|4 \u00d7 100 m relay]] team for the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Auckland]], New Zealand. The team won the gold medal, making Freeman the first-ever [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] Commonwealth Games gold medallist, as well as one of the youngest, at 16 years old. She moved to Melbourne in 1990 after the Auckland Commonwealth Games. Shortly after moving to Melbourne, her manager Nic Bideau introduced Freeman to athletics coach Peter Fortune, who would become Freeman's coach for the rest of her career. She was then selected to represent Australia at the [[1990 World Junior Championships in Athletics]] in [[Plovdiv]], Bulgaria. There, she reached the semi-finals of the 100 m and placed fifth in the final of the 400 m.\n\nFreeman competed in her second [[1992 World Junior Championships in Athletics|World Junior Championships]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea. She competed only in the 200 m, winning the silver medal behind China's Hu Ling. Also in 1992 she travelled to her [[1992 Summer Olympics|first Olympic Games]], reaching the second round of her new specialty event; the [[400 metres]]. At the [[1993 World Championships in Athletics]] Freeman competed in the 200 m, reaching the semi-finals.\n\n1994 was Freeman's breakthrough season, when she entered into the world's elite for the first time. Competing at the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]] in Canada, Freeman won gold in both the 200 m and 400 m. She also competed as a member of Australia's 4 \u00d7 100 m squad, winning the silver medal and as a member of the 4 \u00d7 400 m team, who finished first but were later disqualified. During the 1994 season, Freeman took 1.3 seconds from her 400 m personal best, achieving 50.04 seconds. She also set all-time personal bests in the 100 m (11.24) and 200 m (22.25).\n\nAlthough a medal favourite at the [[1995 World Championships in Athletics]] in Sweden, Freeman finished fourth. She also reached the semi-finals of the 200 m.\n\nFreeman made more progress during the 1996 season, setting many personal bests and Australian records. By this stage, she was the biggest challenger to [[France]]'s [[Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec]] at the [[1996 Summer Olympic Games|1996 Olympics]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} She eventually took the silver medal behind P\u00e9rec, in an Australian record of 48.63 seconds.

It was first officially introduced by the [[British Army]] in 1942, at the direction of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Frederick Browning|Frederick \"Boy\" Browning]], commander of the [[1st Airborne Division (United Kingdom)|British 1st Airborne Division]]. It was first{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} worn by the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] in [[British airborne operations in North Africa|action in North Africa]] during November 1942. Although coloured maroon, the beret of the British Parachute Regiment is often called the \"red beret.\"\n\n==Origins==\nThe first British army unit to adopt the beret was the Armoured Corps in 1924 (for more information see [[black beret]]).\nDuring [[World War II]] some British Army units followed the lead of the Armoured Corps and adopted the beret as a practical headgear, for soldiers who needed a hat that could be worn in confined areas, slept in and could be stowed in a small space when they wore [[steel helmet]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bull |first=Stephen |year=2016 |title=Churchill's Army: 1939\u20131945 The men, machines and organisation  |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-1-84486-399-0 |ref=harv |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dQyGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT287  287]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Sir Basil Henry Liddell|title=The tanks: the history of the Royal Tank Regiment and its predecessors, Heavy Branch, Machine-Gun Corps, Tank Corps, and Royal Tank Corps, 1914-1945 |year=1959 |publisher=Cassell |page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6xK5AAAAIAAJ&q=%22black+beret+was+approved+by+H.M.+The+King+on+March+5,+1924%22 466]}}</ref>\n\nA popular story is that the maroon colour was chosen by Major-General Frederick Browning, after his wife, [[Daphne du Maurier]], suggested that he use the colour which made up part of his horse racing colours.{{sfn|Bull|2016|p=287\u2013288}} However, in a letter, now in the British Airborne Assault Archive, she wrote that it was untrue.<ref>{{cite book |last=Skinner |first=Rebecca |year=2015 |title=British Paratrooper 1940\u201345 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4728-0514-0 |ref=harv |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmCICwAAQBAJ&pg=PT38 38]}}</ref> Whatever its origin, the maroon beret was adopted by the British paratroopers in  July 1942.

In addition, the [[Austrian coat of arms]] is only used as cap badge until the successful completion of the basic selection course (''Jagdkommandogrundkurs''), after which Jagdkommando members wear a cloth version of the ''Kommandoabzeichen'' (=\"commando badge\").\n\n==Australian Army==\n[[File:Maroon or dull cherry beret worn by Australian paratroopers, with RAR badge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Australian Army]] maroon beret with [[Royal Australian Regiment]] badge]]\nMaroon (also referred to as Dull Cherry) berets were worn by parachute qualified members of the [[3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|3 RAR]] Parachute Battalion Group from 1985 \u2013 2012, when the parachute role was performed by 3 RAR. In addition to the battalion, the Group included [[A Field Battery, Royal Australian Artillery|A Field Battery]], Parachute Surgical Team, and Engineer and Signals elements. The beret was worn with the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] Badge by Infantrymen at the battalion, and individual Corps badges for other Corps members as appropriate. [[2nd Commando Regiment (Australia)|2nd Commando Regiment]] now effectively perform the parachuting function formerly held by 3 RAR; they wear a Green Beret with a Commando Badge.\n\nQualified parachutists posted to [[Australian Defence Force Parachuting School|Parachute Training School (PTS)]] wore the beret (or their Special Air Service or Commando Regt beret as appropriate) with individual Corps / Regimental Badges until a few years ago.\n\nThe beret is worn by any [[parachute rigger]] of [[Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps#Rigger Parachute|RAAOC]] in a parachute rigger posting.\n\nThe beret was previously also worn by the Airborne Platoon Royal Australian Regiment 1951\u20131974, then the Australian Special Air Service Company (with the Royal Australian Infantry Corps Badge).
