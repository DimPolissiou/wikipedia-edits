[[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] defines ''gotra'' for grammatical purposes as ''apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram'' (IV. 1. 162), which means \"the word ''gotra'' denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son.\" When a person says \"I am Vipparla-gotra\", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.\n\nAccording to the ''Brihadaranyaka [[Upanisad]]'' 2.2.6, ''Gautama and Bharadv\u0101ja, Vi\u015bv\u0101mitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Ka\u015bhyapa and Shandilya'' are seven sages (also known as [[saptarishi]]); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to P\u0101\u1e47ini.

Many theories have been propounded to explain this system. According to the vedic theories, the [[Brahmin]]s are direct descendants of seven sages who are believed to be the sons of Brahma, borne out of his mind through yogic prowess. They are (1) [[Gautama Maharishi]], (2) [[Bharadwaja]], (3)[[Vishvamitra]], (4)[[Jamadagni]], (5)[[Vashista]], (6)[[Kashyapa]] and (7)[[Atri]] . To this list, [[Agastya]] is also sometimes added. These eight sages are called gotrakarins, from whom all 49 gotras (especially of the Brahmins) have evolved.

A kula is equal to a particular family , or equal to modern day \"clans\",  Kula does relate to lineage or ''caste.''\n\n==Marriages and gotras==\nMarriages within the gotra ('sagotra' marriages) are not permitted under the rule of [[exogamy]] in the traditional matrimonial system. The compound word 'sagotra' is a union of the words 'sa' and 'gotra', where 'sa' means same or similar. It is common practice in preparation for [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage to inquire about the kula-gotra (meaning clan lineage) of the bride and groom before approving the marriage. People within the gotra are regarded as [[siblings]] and marrying such a person would be thought of as taboo. In almost all Hindu families, marriage within the same gotra is not encouraged or practised since they are believed to be descended from the same family. Marriages between different gotras are therefore encouraged. But marriage within the [[J\u0101ti|jaati]] is allowed and even preferred.\n\nFor example, [[Jats]] and [[Rajputs]] have 3000 Gotras and [[Mudiraju|Mudirajas]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] have 2600 Gotras. Gotra is always passed on from father to children among most Hindus. However, among the [[Malayali]] and [[Tulu people]] it is passed on from mother to child.\n\nThe tatsama words 'sahodara' (brother) and 'sahodari' (sister) derive their roots from the Sanskrit word 'saha udara' (\u0938\u0939\u094b\u0926\u0930) meaning co-uterine or born of the same womb. In communities where gotra membership passed from father to children, marriages were allowed between a woman and her maternal uncle,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|title=India \u2013 Marriage|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> while such marriages were forbidden in [[matrilineal]] communities, like [[Thiyyar]]s and [[Tuluva]]s, where gotra membership was passed down from the mother.\n\nA much more common characteristic of South Indian Hindu society is permission for marriage between [[cross-cousin]]s (children of brother and sister) as they are of different gotras. Thus, a man is allowed to marry his maternal uncle's daughter or his paternal aunt's daughter, but is not allowed to marry his paternal uncle's daughter. She would be considered a [[parallel cousin]], of the same gotra, and therefore to be treated as a sister.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://neurologyasia.org/articles/20073_015.pdf|title=Arranged marriage, consanguinity and epilepsy|author=Mehndiratta MM; Paul B and Mehndiratta P|journal=Neurology Asia |year=2007|volume =12 |issue=Supplement 1|pages=15\u201317}}</ref>\n\n[[North Indian]] [[Hindu]] society not only follows the rules of gotra for marriages, but also has many regulations which go beyond the basic definition of gotra and has a broader definition of incest.<ref>[http://anthro.palomar.edu/marriage/marriage_3.htm Sex and Marriage: Marriage Rules (Part 1)]. palomar.edu.</ref> Some communities in North India do not allow marriage with certain other clans, based on the belief that both clans are of the same patrilineal descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/|title=Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage|work=indianexpress.com|author=Vashisht, Dinker |date=20 July 2009}}</ref> In other communities, marriage within the gotra of the mother's father, and possibly some others, is prohibited.\n\nA possible workaround for sagotra marriages is to perform a 'Dathu' (adoption) of the bride to a family of different gotra (usually dathu is given to the bride's maternal uncle who belongs to different gotra by the same rule) and let them perform the '[[Kanyadan]]am' ('kanya' (girl) + 'danam' (to give)). Such workarounds are used in rare cases, and the acceptability is questionable.\n\nThe [[Vedic Hinduism]] recognises eight types of marriages, thus predominantly follows the principles as stated in the [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manu-smriti Manu Smriti], referring to 8 types of marriages, the roles and responsibilities of husband and wife and the purpose of marriage. [[Hindu Marriage|Eight types of marriages]] are, (1) Brahma Vivaha, (2) Arsa Vivaha, (3) Daiva Vivaha, (4) Prajapatya Vivaha, (5) [[Gandharva marriage|Gandharva Vivaha]], (6) Asura Vivaha, (7) Rakshasa Vivaha, and (8) Paishacha Vivaha. The first four types of marriages reflect the paradigm behind arranged marriages. The last three are prohibited as per [[Manu Smriti]], out of which the last two are condemned. The Gandharva marriage is an analogy to the modern day love marriages, where the individuals have the liberty to choose their partners. Though [[Gandharva marriage]] had its due prominence in our Shahstras, but with advancement of time, [[Vedic Hinduism]] giving way to classic Hinduism, the concept of arranged marriage rose to prominence, which till today is predominant [[ritual]] for a marriage between two individuals.\n\nThe Gotra system had significant contribution in preventing genetic abnormalities since its inception thousands of years ago. However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, \u0938\u092a\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0947 \u0964 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0915\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u0947, which means that [[sapinda]] ends after seventh generations.<ref>[http://aryamantavya.in/manusmriti/5-60/ Manu Smriti]</ref> Section 5(v) of [[Hindu marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act 1955]] also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. <ref>[http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf The Hindu Marriage Act 1955]</ref>\n\nWith nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra.

However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, \u0938\u092a\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0947 \u0964 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0915\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u0947, which means that [[sapinda]] ends after seventh generations.<ref>[http://aryamantavya.in/manusmriti/5-60/ Manu Smriti]</ref> Section 5(v) of [[Hindu marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act 1955]] also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. <ref>[http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf The Hindu Marriage Act 1955]</ref>\n\nWith nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra. Even if it is known, there is hardly any way to prove its authenticity. <ref>[https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-June/027680.html advaita-vedanta.org/archives/advaita-l/2011-June/027680]</ref> Under current situation, it is impractical to follow the principles of restrictions on sagotra marriage but legal provision under Hindu Marriage Act are more appropriate to refrain from Sapinda marriage. \n\n===Legal situation===\nWhile the gotras are almost universally used for determining excluding marriages that would be traditionally [[incest]]uous, they are not legally recognized as such, although those within \"degrees of prohibited relationship\" or are  \"sapinda\" are not permitted to marry.<ref>[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/vitalstatkb/Attachment546.aspx THE HINDU MARRIAGE ACT, 1955].</ref> [[Khap]] panchayats in Haryana have campaigned to legally ban marriages within the same gotra. A convener of the Kadyan Khap, Naresh Kadyan, petitioned the courts to seek amendment to the [[Hindu Marriage Act]] to legally prohibit such marriages. However, the petition was dismissed as withdrawn after being vacated, with the Delhi High Court warning that the Khap would face heavy penalty costs for wasting the time of the court.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/article472462.ece HC throws out plea to forbid same gotra marriages], ''The Hindu'', June 2010.</ref>\n\nIn the 1945 court case of ''Madhavrao vs Raghavendrarao'', which involved a [[Deshastha Brahmin]] couple, the definition of gotra as descending from eight sages and then branching out to several families was thrown out by the Bombay High Court. The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras \"impossible to accept.\" The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times, emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of the Hindu society had changed. The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is a near-impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-paradox-of-the-21st-century/article432445.ece|title=The paradox of the 21st century|author=Anand, Pinky |work=The Hindu|date=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aliyasantana]]\n* [[Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar]]\n* [[Pravaras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ruegg, D.

The battle, with the concomitant battle for the adjoining peak of [[Battle of Tololing|Tololing]], culminated in Pakistani forces capturing Tiger Hill.\n\n==Battle==\nTiger Hill was held by elements of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s [[Northern Light Infantry]]. In late May 1999, the 8th Battalion, [[Sikh Regiment]] (8 Sikh) had attempted an assault on Tiger Hill, but were repulsed by heavy small arms fire. Poorly coordinated further assaults initiated without adequate artillery support failed under fire from an entrenched enemy. Unable to press the attack, the soldiers dug in and surrounded the hill. 192 Mountain Brigade assumed command of the operations on Tiger Hill in late June.

The 2nd Battalion, [[Naga Regiment]] (2 Naga) advanced on the right flank and 8 Sikh advanced on the left.

They almost made it to the top before the Pakistanis atop the peak spotted them and opened heavy fire, stalling their attack. Sensing the loss of initiative, Maj.

He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as a youth trainee in July 1999 and the following month he signed professional terms with the club. He played numerous times for the youth and [[Manchester United F.C. Reserves and Academy|reserve]] sides at United and was part of the team that won the [[Manchester Senior Cup]] in  May 2000. He had a short spell on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] at Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] in 2001 before returning to United and making his senior debut in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] tie against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] during the [[2001\u201302 Manchester United F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]]. He was an England youth international as he progressed from the [[England national under-16 football team|under-16s]] to the [[England national under-20 football team|under-20s]] during his time at [[Old Trafford]].\n\nDavis spent three months on loan with [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] club [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in 2002 and scored three goals in 15 appearances. He was a mainstay in the reserves on his return to United; his only involvement with the first team after returning was as an unused [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] in a league game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]  and a [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] second group stage match against [[Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a]].

After Garvey's departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to [[Los Angeles]]. That year, [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Kathie Lee Johnson]] (who would marry [[Frank Gifford]] a year later) became Philbin's new co-host.\n\nIn 1988, [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] began syndicating the show nationally as ''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee''. Gifford left the show in 2000 and was eventually replaced by [[Kelly Ripa]]. Philbin left the show in November 2011 and the show aired for nearly a year as ''Live! with Kelly'' until former [[New York Giants]] defensive end [[Michael Strahan]] became Ripa's permanent co-host in September 2012. In May 2016, Strahan left the show to become a full-time anchor at ''Good Morning America'', thus leaving Ripa as the solo host again. On May 1, 2017, it was announced that [[Ryan Seacrest]] would become the new host of the show; in order to accommodate his syndicated radio show ''[[On Air with Ryan Seacrest]]'' (which normally originates from Los Angeles), an additional studio was built within WABC's facilities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ryan Seacrest Tapped as Kelly Ripa's Permanent Co-Host on 'Live'|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ryan-seacrest-kelly-ripa-co-host-live-with-kelly-and-ryan-1202404490/|website=Variety|accessdate=May 9, 2020|date=May 2020}}\n\n==News operation==\nWABC-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and 5\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV \u2013 which popularized the ''[[Action News]]'' format \u2013 in the production and broadcast of statewide [[New Jersey]] political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], they'll pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks and helicopters.\n\n===Beginning to 1999===\n[[File:WABC Eyewitness News 2013.png|thumb|right|Channel 7 ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' at 11:00 p.m. open, used from August 8, 2011 \u2013 May 3, 2016]]\nWABC-TV launched ''Report to New York'', its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring [[Scott Vincent]] with news, [[Howard Cosell]] with sports, and Lynn Dollar with weather. ''Report to New York'' aired Monday through Friday at 11:00&nbsp;p.m. By January 1961, channel 7 expanded ''Report to New York'' with a 15-minute early edition at 6:15 p.m. on weeknights, and on Saturday and Sunday evenings.\n\nOn October 22, 1962, WABC-TV expanded its weeknight news to 45-minutes, and retitled it ''The Big News''. Newcomers [[Bill Beutel]] and Jim Barnes were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as \"weather girl\". However, this effort failed to draw viewers from ratings leader [[WCBS-TV]] and second-place [[WNBC]].\n\nIn early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the [[London]] bureau chief for [[ABC News]] and was replaced by [[Roger Grimsby]], who was transferred by ABC from [[San Francisco]] sister station [[KGO-TV]]. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by [[Tex Antoine]] doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist [[Rona Barrett]], ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]] with political commentary and reviews by [[Martin Bookspan]] and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports. Known as ''Roger Grimsby and the Noisemakers'', this format didn't help the ratings, which plunged to an all-time low.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvweek.com/in-depth/2003/05/giving-witness-to-eyewitness-n/|title=Giving Witness to Eyewitness News|last=Primo|first=Al|date=May 19, 2003|work=TVWeek.com|access-date=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, newly hired news director [[Al Primo]] brought to WABC-TV the [[Eyewitness News]] format, in which reporters present their stories directly to the viewers. Having experienced great success introducing the format during his time at [[KYW-TV]] in Philadelphia, Primo this time added a twist \u2013 a degree of conversational chatter among the anchors, known as \"happy talk\". The \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the musical score of the [[1967 in film|1967 film]] ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'', composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The ''Eyewitness News'' format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC's other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV didn't use the ''Eyewitness News'' title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.\n\nRetaining only Grimsby, Cosell and Antoine from the earlier ''Noisemakers'' format, Primo also hired [[Tom Dunn (journalist)|Tom Dunn]] away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby's co-anchor. After Dunn departed for [[WOR-TV]] in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of ''Eyewitness News''.\n\nThe Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, ''[[AM America]]'' that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's [[Bill Bonds]] and veteran [[Boston]] anchor [[Tom Ellis (journalist)|Tom Ellis]] to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6:00 p.m. and Bonds at 11:00 p.m.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gardella |first=Kay |date=August 20, 1975 |title=TV's local news front undergoes some changes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/395918532/ |work=Daily News |location=New York, NY |access-date=April 30, 2019 }}{{paywall}}</ref> When ''AM America'' was canceled and replaced with ''Good Morning America'' in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6:00 p.m., with Ellis joining Bonds at 11:00 p.m..

Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |title=Nielsen Sweep |publisher=FOX Business |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212112032/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |archivedate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough and [[WXTV-DT|WXTV]]'s Rafael Pineda. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nWABC-TV's news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5:00 p.m. ''Eyewitness News'' broadcast had been ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at 4:00 p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nThe newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7's digital subchannels, another which also carried a local weather and news channel. WABC-TV's website had a link for live streaming video of \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW\", which offered live local and national weather updated from [[AccuWeather]] alongside local news. The format of \"Eyewitness News NOW\" is similar to the defunct [[NBC Weather Plus]]. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV's sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] simulcast of the [[Live Well Network]], and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]].\n\nOn December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30 a.m. 3 Days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9:00 a.m. \u2013 10:00 a.m.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/08/24/44695/wabc-expands-morning-news |title=WABC Expands Morning News |date=August 24, 2010 |publisher=TVNewsCheck}}</ref> On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4:00 p.m. to replace ''Oprah'', which aired its last original episode the previous day.

After Garvey's departure a year later, she was replaced by Ann Abernathy, who in turn, left in 1985 to return to [[Los Angeles]]. That year, [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Kathie Lee Johnson]] (who would marry [[Frank Gifford]] a year later) became Philbin's new co-host.\n\nIn 1988, [[Disney\u2013ABC Domestic Television|Buena Vista Television]] began syndicating the show nationally as ''Live with Regis and Kathie Lee''.

The station preempts a weekend edition of ''Good Morning America'' and delays ''This Week'' to schedule time for the live broadcast. The marathon is also simulcast on [[ESPN2]] nationally (although viewers in the WABC-TV viewing area cannot see it via ESPN2 because the simulcast is blacked out locally).\n\nWABC-TV currently airs any [[New York Knicks]] and [[Brooklyn Nets]] games televised via the ''[[NBA on ABC]]''. The station has aired the Knicks' appearances in the [[1970 NBA Finals|1970]], [[1972 NBA Finals|1972]] and [[1973 NBA Finals]] (where the Knicks won in 1970 and 1973), as well as the then-New Jersey Nets' appearance in the [[2003 NBA Finals]].\n\n==News operation==\nWABC-TV presently broadcasts 43 hours, 55 minutes of locally produced newscasts each week (with 6 hours, 35 minutes each weekday and 5\u00bd hours each on Saturdays and Sundays). The station partners with Philadelphia sister station, WPVI-TV \u2013 which popularized the ''[[Action News]]'' format \u2013 in the production and broadcast of statewide [[New Jersey]] political debates. When the two stations broadcast a statewide office debate, such as for [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] or [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], they'll pool resources and have anchors or reporters from both stations participate in the debate. Additionally, the two stations share coverage of news from New Jersey where their markets overlap, pooling reporters, live trucks and helicopters.\n\n===Beginning to 1999===\n[[File:WABC Eyewitness News 2013.png|thumb|right|Channel 7 ''[[Eyewitness News]]'' at 11:00 p.m. open, used from August 8, 2011 \u2013 May 3, 2016]]\nWABC-TV launched ''Report to New York'', its first regular news program, on October 26, 1959, featuring [[Scott Vincent]] with news, [[Howard Cosell]] with sports, and Lynn Dollar with weather.

Newcomers [[Bill Beutel]] and Jim Barnes were the anchors, with Cosell continuing on sports and Rosemary Haley as \"weather girl\". However, this effort failed to draw viewers from ratings leader [[WCBS-TV]] and second-place [[WNBC]].\n\nIn early 1968, Beutel left the station to become the [[London]] bureau chief for [[ABC News]] and was replaced by [[Roger Grimsby]], who was transferred by ABC from [[San Francisco]] sister station [[KGO-TV]]. In a complete revamp, Grimsby was joined by [[Tex Antoine]] doing weather, celebrity gossip columnist [[Rona Barrett]], ''[[New York Daily News]]'' columnist [[Jimmy Breslin]] with political commentary and reviews by [[Martin Bookspan]] and Allan Jeffries, while Cosell continued doing sports.

The \"Tar Sequence\" cue from the musical score of the [[1967 in film|1967 film]] ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]'', composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]], was introduced as the theme music. The score included a telegraphic-style melody appropriate for a newscast. The ''Eyewitness News'' format and theme music were quickly adopted by ABC's other four owned-and-operated stations at the time: KGO-TV, WLS-TV in Chicago, WXYZ-TV in Detroit and [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles (though KGO-TV and WXYZ-TV didn't use the ''Eyewitness News'' title for their programs). The format quickly rejuvenated a station that had long been an also-ran to WCBS-TV and WNBC-TV. Within a year, Channel 7 had shot to first place in the ratings for the first time in its history, displacing longtime leader WCBS-TV. It spent most of the decade going back and forth with WCBS-TV for first place. For a time in the 1980s, it fell into last place, but still fought with WNBC-TV for second place.\n\nRetaining only Grimsby, Cosell and Antoine from the earlier ''Noisemakers'' format, Primo also hired [[Tom Dunn (journalist)|Tom Dunn]] away from WCBS-TV to serve as Grimsby's co-anchor. After Dunn departed for [[WOR-TV]] in 1970, Bill Beutel returned to the station as his replacement and for the next 16 years, Grimsby and Beutel were the faces of ''Eyewitness News''.\n\nThe Grimsby-Beutel team were split up for several months in 1975 after ABC had reassigned Beutel to its new morning show, ''[[AM America]]'' that January. The station brought in WXYZ-TV's [[Bill Bonds]] and veteran [[Boston]] anchor [[Tom Ellis (journalist)|Tom Ellis]] to help replace Beutel, with Grimsby teaming with Ellis at 6:00 p.m. and Bonds at 11:00 p.m.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gardella |first=Kay |date=August 20, 1975 |title=TV's local news front undergoes some changes |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/395918532/ |work=Daily News |location=New York, NY |access-date=April 30, 2019 }}{{paywall}}</ref> When ''AM America'' was canceled and replaced with ''Good Morning America'' in November 1975, Beutel was re-teamed with Grimsby at 6:00 p.m., with Ellis joining Bonds at 11:00 p.m..

Applegate claimed credit for taking WLS-TV from last to first in only two years and ABC hoped he could work the same magic at the flagship station. In the wake of declining ratings, Grimsby was fired on April 16, 1986, a move for which Applegate drew considerable ire and Grimsby was quickly hired by rival WNBC-TV. In 1987, Channel 7 surged back into first place. It has been the ratings leader in New York City since then, and has grown to become the most-watched broadcast television station in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |title=Nielsen Sweep |publisher=FOX Business |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212112032/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/channel---tv-station-new-york-nation--nielsen-sweep/ |archivedate=February 12, 2009}}</ref> Beutel stepped down from the anchor desk in 2001, which concluded the longest tenure for a main anchor in New York City television history at that time. His record has since been surpassed by WNBC's Chuck Scarborough and [[WXTV-DT|WXTV]]'s Rafael Pineda. Scarborough's uninterrupted run behind the desk is the longest in New York television (since 1974). Pineda is second, having started with WXTV in 1972, retiring in 2013 after 41 years.\n\n===2000\u2013present===\nWABC-TV's news department is respected for its straightforward presentation (especially during breaking news). For the last decade, it has waged a spirited battle for first place, but for most of the time has held onto the lead, helped in part by lead-ins from highly rated talk and entertainment shows. For over 24 years (December 1986 to May 2011), the lead-in for the 5:00 p.m. ''Eyewitness News'' broadcast had been ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' at 4:00 p.m. and its strong ratings brought viewers along to the 5:00 p.m. newscast.\n\nThe newscasts were replayed on one of channel 7's digital subchannels, another which also carried a local weather and news channel. WABC-TV's website had a link for live streaming video of \"Channel 7 Eyewitness News NOW\", which offered live local and national weather updated from [[AccuWeather]] alongside local news. The format of \"Eyewitness News NOW\" is similar to the defunct [[NBC Weather Plus]]. On February 24, 2011, AccuWeather and ABC both replaced ENN as well as similar news channels on WABC-TV's sister stations, KABC-TV in Los Angeles and WLS-TV in Chicago, replacing them in all three cities with a [[standard-definition television|standard definition]], [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] simulcast of the [[Live Well Network]], and then on April 15, 2015, these stations were replaced by [[Laff (TV network)|Laff]].\n\nOn December 2, 2006, WABC-TV became the second station in the New York City market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[High-definition television|high definition]]. On September 7, 2010, WABC-TV expanded its weekday morning newscast, moving its start time to 4:30 a.m. 3 Days earlier on September 4, 2010, WABC added an hour-long extension of its Saturday morning newscast from 9:00 a.m. \u2013 10:00 a.m.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/2010/08/24/44695/wabc-expands-morning-news |title=WABC Expands Morning News |date=August 24, 2010 |publisher=TVNewsCheck}}</ref> On May 26, 2011, WABC-TV added another hour of local news at 4:00 p.m. to replace ''Oprah'', which aired its last original episode the previous day. WABC also produces a 7:00 p.m. newscast on Saturdays following college football during the regular season.\n\nOn September 24, 2011, the station began broadcasting its newscasts and public affairs programs from a new street-level window studio at a former [[Disney Store]] location in the ABC building on 66th Street and Columbus Avenue. The space previously used for news broadcasts was used to expand the ''Live with Kelly'' studio.<ref>{{cite news |last=Flamm |first=Matthew |date=February 6, 2011 |url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20110206/FREE/302069970# |title=WABC Plans Post-Oprah Era \u2013 Station To Add Local News Hour; Regis Exit Delayed Several Months |newspaper=[[Crain Communications|Crain's New York Business]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Huff |first=Richard |date=February 18, 2011 |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/eyewitness-news-set-major-face-lift-summer-new-studio-timeslot-article-1.136978 |title='Eyewitness News' Set for Major Face-Lift Come Summer with New Studio, Timeslot |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=June 24, 2012}}</ref> In January 2012, the station also expanded its weekend 11:00 p.m. newscasts to an hour.

A revolt in 626\u2013620 BC had seen the loss of the empire's southern provinces to the newly formed [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|war]] against its king [[Nabopolassar]] and the [[Medes]] proved disastrous for Assyria; leading to sacks and destructions of the important cities of [[Assur]] and Nineveh in 614 BC and 612 BC respectively.\n\nAfter the loss of these cities and the death of Sinsharishkun, Ashur-uballit II rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran where, bolstered by an alliance with [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], he ruled for three years. His identification as \"king of Assyria\" comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as \"crown prince\" seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy.\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|Sinsharishkun}}\nIn the beginning of the 7th century BC, Assyria was at the height of its power. The entire [[Fertile Crescent]] was under the rule of the Assyrian king and due to the flourishing of trade and culture, the era has been described as the ''[[Pax Assyriaca]]'' (a term coined to parallel the ''[[Pax Romana]]''). By the end of the same century, Assyria had fallen and disappeared from history, never to rise again.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=11}}\n\nOne of the major reasons for its fall was Assyria's failure to efficiently solve the so-called \"Babylonian problem\", the near constant rebellions in its southern provinces, especially in the ancient and prestigious city of Babylon. Although some kings had ruled successfully without revolts in Babylonia, such as [[Esarhaddon]],'''{{Sfn|Porter|1987|p=1\u20132}}''' the revolts in the region had intensified during the rule of King [[Sinsharishkun]] (reigned 627\u2013612 BC). Sinsharishkun had come to the throne in 627 BC following the death of his brother [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and was almost immediately faced a revolt by the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] in 626 BC, who successfully seized some cities in northern Babylonia, including Babylon itself and Nippur. Although Sin-shumi-lishir was defeated after only three months, his revolt weakened Assyrian control in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}}\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, another revolt sprung up in Babylonia, this one by [[Nabopolassar]], who successfully seized both Babylon and Nippur. The defeat of Sinsharishkun's attempted reconquest of these cities in October of 626 BC was the final Assyrian campaign for the city of Babylon. On 22/23 November of that year, Nabopolassar was formally crowned as [[King of Babylon]], founding the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Sinsharishkun attempted to reconquer cities in northern Babylonia in 625\u2013624 BC but was repeatedly repelled. In 622 BC, Nabopolassar seized the last Assyrian outposts in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nThe Babylonians scored repeated victories against the Assyrians and by 616 BC Babylonian troops had even reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], who saw Assyria as a useful buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east, rushed to Sinsharishkun's aid, but a joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign into Babylonia was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=16\u201317}} In 614 BC, the city of [[Assur]], once the capital and still the ideological and religious center of Assyria, was captured, plundered and sacked by the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]], allies of Nabopolassar.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The Babylonian army under Nabopolassar had been late to the battle, only arriving after the Medes had already killed many of the city's inhabitants and begun plundering it.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Two years later, the Assyrian capital itself, [[Nineveh]], fell.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The fate of King Sinsharishkun is not certain, but it is commonly accepted that he died in defense of Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}\n\nAshur-uballit's background is uncertain. It is known that he was an Assyrian general and he might have been the son of King Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Radner|2013|p=}} Ashur-uballit is likely the same person as the unnamed crown prince (designated heir) attested in inscriptions from Nineveh dated to 626 and 623 BC. Sinsharishkun's appointment of a crown prince so early in his reign (having only become king in 627 BC) was likely to avoid the succession problems which had been common in Assyria since the reign of [[Sennacherib]] (reigned 705\u2013681 BC).{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=264}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rule at Harran and status ===\nIn Assyrian tradition, the king was appointed to his position by the Assyrian national deity, [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], during the New Year festivals in Assur. The last king to be crowned at the temple of Ashur at Assur had been Sinsharishkun and with the city's destruction in 614 BC, the traditional Assyrian coronation ritual was now impossible.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} The coronation ritual in Assur saw the god Ashur invest the king with royal power, affirming his status as Ashur's earthly representative.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} Ashur-uballit did have a coronation ceremony in late 612 BC,{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} but instead of conducting it in Assur, it was conducted in the temple of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], another important deity in the empire, at [[Harran]].{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} At Harran, the Assyrian Empire continued to endure under the rule of Ashur-uballit. His identification as Sinsharishkun's successor and the king of Assyria comes from Babylonian chronicles. The Babylonians thus saw him as the Assyrian king, but the few subjects Ashur-uballit governed himself probably did not share this view. Instead, Ashur-uballit's formal title was crown prince (''mar \u0161arri'', literally meaning \"son of the king\"),{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} which can be inferred from preserved documents, such as the following portion of a legal document from the city [[Dur-Katlimmu]]:\n{{Quote| quote = Whoever contests the agreement, ''[missing portion]'' shall be his legal adversaries; the covenant of the crown prince shall seek vengeance; he shall give ten minas of silver.<br>28th day, month Tebetu, eponym year of Se\u2019-ila\u2019i. Witness is the city lord Iadi\u2019-il. Witness is Nab\u00fb-na\u1e63ir son of \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri. Witness is \u0160arru-emuranni son of Nab\u00fb-e\u1e6dir. Witness is Salmanu-re\u1e2btu-u\u1e63ur.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=137}}|author=|title=|source=}}\nThe portion of the document that is important in regards to Ashur-uballit's status is the mention of the \"covenant of the crown prince\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a mar \u0161arri''). This phrase is common in legal documents, appearing frequently since the reign of King [[Esarhaddon]] in 672 BC, but always in the form of \"covenant of the king\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a \u0161arri''), showing that the office of king was vacant and the crown prince filled that role instead.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}} Inscriptions from this time also record the name of the final Commander-in-Chief of the Assyrian army, Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur{{refn|Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur's predecessor as Commander-in-Chief, \u0160ama\u0161-sarru-ibni, had probably died with King Sinsharishkun at Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}}|group=\"n\"}}, which means \"O [[Nabu]], protect the crown prince!\". Such names were common in Assyria but usually referred to the king, not the crown prince.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}} Ashur-uballit not formally being king does not indicate that his claim to the throne was challenged, only that he had yet to go through with the traditional ceremony. The appointment of a crown prince required the formal recognition of all subjects and of the gods. Should the king be unable to exercise his duties, the crown prince was a competent substitute, exercising similar legal and political power. Ashur-uballit was the recognized legitimate ruler, and his title was only a provisional arrangement until he could undergo the proper coronation.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe choice of ''A\u0161\u0161ur-uballi\u1e6d'' as a regnal name was probably a highly conscious one. The meaning of the name, \"Ashur has kept alive\", suggests that Assyria's chief deity and its empire would be ultimately successful in their battle against their enemies. It also connects him to the earlier Assyrian king of the same name, [[Ashur-uballit I]] of the 14th century BC. Ashur-uballit I had been the first Assyrian ruler to abandon the old religious title of ''i\u0161\u0161i\u2019ak'' (\"governor\") in favor of the title ''\u0161arrum'' (\"king\"), signifying his role as an absolute monarch.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=136}}\n\nIn Assyria, each year was assigned an eponym name. The name used for the year noted in the Dur-Katlimmu legal document, \"Se\u2019-ila\u2019i\", only appears in this source and demonstrates that it is from after the Assyrian heartlands had fallen to invaders, when eponym names, in the absence of central authority, became local and often confined to single cities. The \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri, whose son is mentioned, also appears in inscriptions dating to the reign of Ashurbanipal a little over a decade prior. Although the document uses traditional Assyrian titles such as Companion (''\u0161a qurb\u016bte'', literally meaning \"he who is close to the king\") and cohort commander (''rab ki\u1e63ri''), suggesting that they still carried their traditional importance, the document also calls the local leader Iadi\u2019-il by the title of city lord (Akkadian: ''b\u0113l \u0101li'') a title formerly only associated with members of the Assyrian ruling dynasty. A non-dynastic appointed official for the government of a city was usually titled as ''\u1e2bazannu'' (usually translated as \"mayor\") or ''\u0161a mu\u1e2b\u1e2bi \u0101li'' (meaning \"city oversser\") and the use of the title ''b\u0113l \u0101li'' indicates that parts of the Assyrian administrative framework were no longer functioning.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n=== Fall of Harran and attempted recapture ===\n{{Main|Fall of Harran|Siege of Harran}}\nAt the time Ashur-uballit became the ruler of Assyria in 612 BC, his main objective would have been to retake the Assyrian heartland, including Assur and Nineveh. Bolstered by the forces of his allies, Egypt (a leading military power in the region) and [[Mannaeans|Mannea]], this goal was probably seen as quite possible and his rule at Harran and role as crown prince (and not legitimately crowned king) probably seemed like a mere temporary retreat. Instead, Ashur-uballit's rule at Harran composes the final years of the Assyrian Empire, which at this point had effectively ceased to exist.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=140\u2013141}}{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}}\n\nIn 611 BC, Nabopolassar's army consolidated his rule throughout northern Mesopotamia, going as far as to the border of Harran itself. After Nabopolassar himself had travelled the recently conquered Assyrian heartland in 610 BC in order to ensure stability, the Medo-Babylonian army embarked on a campaign against Harran in November of 610 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}} Intimidated by Nabopolassar's approach, Ashur-uballit and a contingent of Egyptian reinforcements fled the city into the deserts of Syria.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}{{Sfn|Bassir|2018|p=198}}''' The siege of Harran lasted from the winter of 610 BC to the beginning of 609 BC and the city eventually capitulated.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}}\n\nAfter the Babylonians had ruled Harran for three months, Ashur-uballit and a large force of Egyptian soldiers attempted to retake the city, but this campaign failed disastrously.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}'''{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}} Beginning in July or June 609 BC, Ashur-uballit's siege lasted for two months, until August or September, but he and the Egyptians retreated when Nabopolassar again led his army against them. It is possible that they had retreated even earlier.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}} Ashur-uballit's failure at Harran in 609 BC marks the end for the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=141}}\n\n== Fate ==\nThe eventual fate of Ashur-uballit is unknown'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}''' and his siege of Harran in 609 BC is the last time he, or the Assyrians in general, are mentioned in Babylonian records.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}} After the battle at Harran, Nabopolassar resumed his campaign against the remainder of the Assyrian army in the beginning of the year 608 or 607 BC. It is thought that Ashur-uballit was still alive at this point, for in 608 BC the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Necho II]], Psamtik I's successor, personally led a large Egyptian army into former Assyrian territory to rescue his ally and turn the tide of the war. Because there is no mention of a large battle between the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians and Medes in 608 BC (a battle between the four greatest military powers of their day is unlikely to have been forgotten and left out of contemporary sources) and no later mentions of Ashur-uballit, it is possible that he died at some point in 608 BC before his allies and his enemies could clash in battle.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}''' M.B. Rowton speculates Ashur-uballit could have lived until 606 BC,'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}''' but by then the Egyptian army is mentioned in Babylonian sources without any references to the Assyrians or their king.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}}\n\nAlthough Ashur-uballit is no longer mentioned after 609 BC, the Egyptian campaigns in the Levant continued for some time until a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Carchemish]] in 605 BC.

A revolt in 626\u2013620 BC had seen the loss of the empire's southern provinces to the newly formed [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and [[Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|war]] against its king [[Nabopolassar]] and the [[Medes]] proved disastrous for Assyria; leading to sacks and destructions of the important cities of [[Assur]] and Nineveh in 614 BC and 612 BC respectively.\n\nAfter the loss of these cities and the death of Sinsharishkun, Ashur-uballit II rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at Harran where, bolstered by an alliance with [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], he ruled for three years. His identification as \"king of Assyria\" comes from Babylonian sources. Contemporary Assyrian inscriptions suggest that the Assyrians saw Ashur-uballit as their legitimate ruler, but continued to refer to him as \"crown prince\" seeing as he could not undergo the traditional Assyrian coronation ceremony at Assur and thus hadn't formally been bestowed with the kingship by the Assyrian chief deity, Ashur. His rule at Harran came to an end when the city was seized by Medo-Babylonian forces in 610 BC. Ashur-uballit's attempt at retaking it in 609 BC was repulsed whereafter he is no longer mentioned in contemporary chronicles, signalling the end of the ancient Assyrian monarchy.\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Medo-Babylonian war against the Assyrian Empire|Sinsharishkun}}\nIn the beginning of the 7th century BC, Assyria was at the height of its power. The entire [[Fertile Crescent]] was under the rule of the Assyrian king and due to the flourishing of trade and culture, the era has been described as the ''[[Pax Assyriaca]]'' (a term coined to parallel the ''[[Pax Romana]]''). By the end of the same century, Assyria had fallen and disappeared from history, never to rise again.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=11}}\n\nOne of the major reasons for its fall was Assyria's failure to efficiently solve the so-called \"Babylonian problem\", the near constant rebellions in its southern provinces, especially in the ancient and prestigious city of Babylon. Although some kings had ruled successfully without revolts in Babylonia, such as [[Esarhaddon]],'''{{Sfn|Porter|1987|p=1\u20132}}''' the revolts in the region had intensified during the rule of King [[Sinsharishkun]] (reigned 627\u2013612 BC). Sinsharishkun had come to the throne in 627 BC following the death of his brother [[Ashur-etil-ilani]] and was almost immediately faced a revolt by the general [[Sin-shumu-lishir]] in 626 BC, who successfully seized some cities in northern Babylonia, including Babylon itself and Nippur. Although Sin-shumi-lishir was defeated after only three months, his revolt weakened Assyrian control in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=13}}\n\nAlmost immediately afterwards, another revolt sprung up in Babylonia, this one by [[Nabopolassar]], who successfully seized both Babylon and Nippur. The defeat of Sinsharishkun's attempted reconquest of these cities in October of 626 BC was the final Assyrian campaign for the city of Babylon. On 22/23 November of that year, Nabopolassar was formally crowned as [[King of Babylon]], founding the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Sinsharishkun attempted to reconquer cities in northern Babylonia in 625\u2013624 BC but was repeatedly repelled. In 622 BC, Nabopolassar seized the last Assyrian outposts in Babylonia.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=14\u201316}}\n\nThe Babylonians scored repeated victories against the Assyrians and by 616 BC Babylonian troops had even reached as far north as the [[Balikh River]]. Assyria's ally, Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] of [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Egypt]], who saw Assyria as a useful buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and [[Medes]] in the east, rushed to Sinsharishkun's aid, but a joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign into Babylonia was unsuccessful.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=|pp=16\u201317}} In 614 BC, the city of [[Assur]], once the capital and still the ideological and religious center of Assyria, was captured, plundered and sacked by the Medes under King [[Cyaxares]], allies of Nabopolassar.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The Babylonian army under Nabopolassar had been late to the battle, only arriving after the Medes had already killed many of the city's inhabitants and begun plundering it.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=18}} Two years later, the Assyrian capital itself, [[Nineveh]], fell.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}} The fate of King Sinsharishkun is not certain, but it is commonly accepted that he died in defense of Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=135}}\n\nAshur-uballit's background is uncertain. It is known that he was an Assyrian general and he might have been the son of King Sinsharishkun.{{Sfn|Radner|2013|p=}} Ashur-uballit is likely the same person as the unnamed crown prince (designated heir) attested in inscriptions from Nineveh dated to 626 and 623 BC. Sinsharishkun's appointment of a crown prince so early in his reign (having only become king in 627 BC) was likely to avoid the succession problems which had been common in Assyria since the reign of [[Sennacherib]] (reigned 705\u2013681 BC).{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=264}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Rule at Harran and status ===\nIn Assyrian tradition, the king was appointed to his position by the Assyrian national deity, [[Ashur (god)|Ashur]], during the New Year festivals in Assur. The last king to be crowned at the temple of Ashur at Assur had been Sinsharishkun and with the city's destruction in 614 BC, the traditional Assyrian coronation ritual was now impossible.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} The coronation ritual in Assur saw the god Ashur invest the king with royal power, affirming his status as Ashur's earthly representative.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} Ashur-uballit did have a coronation ceremony in late 612 BC,{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}} but instead of conducting it in Assur, it was conducted in the temple of the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], another important deity in the empire, at [[Harran]].{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} At Harran, the Assyrian Empire continued to endure under the rule of Ashur-uballit. His identification as Sinsharishkun's successor and the king of Assyria comes from Babylonian chronicles. The Babylonians thus saw him as the Assyrian king, but the few subjects Ashur-uballit governed himself probably did not share this view. Instead, Ashur-uballit's formal title was crown prince (''mar \u0161arri'', literally meaning \"son of the king\"),{{Sfn|Radner|2019|pp=135\u2013136}} which can be inferred from preserved documents, such as the following portion of a legal document from the city [[Dur-Katlimmu]]:\n{{Quote| quote = Whoever contests the agreement, ''[missing portion]'' shall be his legal adversaries; the covenant of the crown prince shall seek vengeance; he shall give ten minas of silver.<br>28th day, month Tebetu, eponym year of Se\u2019-ila\u2019i. Witness is the city lord Iadi\u2019-il. Witness is Nab\u00fb-na\u1e63ir son of \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri. Witness is \u0160arru-emuranni son of Nab\u00fb-e\u1e6dir. Witness is Salmanu-re\u1e2btu-u\u1e63ur.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=137}}|author=|title=|source=}}\nThe portion of the document that is important in regards to Ashur-uballit's status is the mention of the \"covenant of the crown prince\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a mar \u0161arri''). This phrase is common in legal documents, appearing frequently since the reign of King [[Esarhaddon]] in 672 BC, but always in the form of \"covenant of the king\" (''ad\u00ea \u0161a \u0161arri''), showing that the office of king was vacant and the crown prince filled that role instead.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}} Inscriptions from this time also record the name of the final Commander-in-Chief of the Assyrian army, Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur{{refn|Nab\u00fb-mar-\u0161arri-u\u1e63ur's predecessor as Commander-in-Chief, \u0160ama\u0161-sarru-ibni, had probably died with King Sinsharishkun at Nineveh in 612 BC.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}}|group=\"n\"}}, which means \"O [[Nabu]], protect the crown prince!\". Such names were common in Assyria but usually referred to the king, not the crown prince.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=140}} Ashur-uballit not formally being king does not indicate that his claim to the throne was challenged, only that he had yet to go through with the traditional ceremony. The appointment of a crown prince required the formal recognition of all subjects and of the gods. Should the king be unable to exercise his duties, the crown prince was a competent substitute, exercising similar legal and political power. Ashur-uballit was the recognized legitimate ruler, and his title was only a provisional arrangement until he could undergo the proper coronation.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\nThe choice of ''A\u0161\u0161ur-uballi\u1e6d'' as a regnal name was probably a highly conscious one. The meaning of the name, \"Ashur has kept alive\", suggests that Assyria's chief deity and its empire would be ultimately successful in their battle against their enemies. It also connects him to the earlier Assyrian king of the same name, [[Ashur-uballit I]] of the 14th century BC. Ashur-uballit I had been the first Assyrian ruler to abandon the old religious title of ''i\u0161\u0161i\u2019ak'' (\"governor\") in favor of the title ''\u0161arrum'' (\"king\"), signifying his role as an absolute monarch.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=136}}\n\nIn Assyria, each year was assigned an eponym name. The name used for the year noted in the Dur-Katlimmu legal document, \"Se\u2019-ila\u2019i\", only appears in this source and demonstrates that it is from after the Assyrian heartlands had fallen to invaders, when eponym names, in the absence of central authority, became local and often confined to single cities. The \u0160ulmu-\u0161arri, whose son is mentioned, also appears in inscriptions dating to the reign of Ashurbanipal a little over a decade prior. Although the document uses traditional Assyrian titles such as Companion (''\u0161a qurb\u016bte'', literally meaning \"he who is close to the king\") and cohort commander (''rab ki\u1e63ri''), suggesting that they still carried their traditional importance, the document also calls the local leader Iadi\u2019-il by the title of city lord (Akkadian: ''b\u0113l \u0101li'') a title formerly only associated with members of the Assyrian ruling dynasty. A non-dynastic appointed official for the government of a city was usually titled as ''\u1e2bazannu'' (usually translated as \"mayor\") or ''\u0161a mu\u1e2b\u1e2bi \u0101li'' (meaning \"city oversser\") and the use of the title ''b\u0113l \u0101li'' indicates that parts of the Assyrian administrative framework were no longer functioning.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=137\u2013139}}\n\n=== Fall of Harran and attempted recapture ===\n{{Main|Fall of Harran|Siege of Harran}}\nAt the time Ashur-uballit became the ruler of Assyria in 612 BC, his main objective would have been to retake the Assyrian heartland, including Assur and Nineveh. Bolstered by the forces of his allies, Egypt (a leading military power in the region) and [[Mannaeans|Mannea]], this goal was probably seen as quite possible and his rule at Harran and role as crown prince (and not legitimately crowned king) probably seemed like a mere temporary retreat. Instead, Ashur-uballit's rule at Harran composes the final years of the Assyrian Empire, which at this point had effectively ceased to exist.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=|pp=140\u2013141}}{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}}\n\nIn 611 BC, Nabopolassar's army consolidated his rule throughout northern Mesopotamia, going as far as to the border of Harran itself. After Nabopolassar himself had travelled the recently conquered Assyrian heartland in 610 BC in order to ensure stability, the Medo-Babylonian army embarked on a campaign against Harran in November of 610 BC.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}} Intimidated by Nabopolassar's approach, Ashur-uballit and a contingent of Egyptian reinforcements fled the city into the deserts of Syria.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}{{Sfn|Bassir|2018|p=198}}''' The siege of Harran lasted from the winter of 610 BC to the beginning of 609 BC and the city eventually capitulated.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=19}}\n\nAfter the Babylonians had ruled Harran for three months, Ashur-uballit and a large force of Egyptian soldiers attempted to retake the city, but this campaign failed disastrously.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}'''{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}} Beginning in July or June 609 BC, Ashur-uballit's siege lasted for two months, until August or September, but he and the Egyptians retreated when Nabopolassar again led his army against them. It is possible that they had retreated even earlier.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}} Ashur-uballit's failure at Harran in 609 BC marks the end for the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored.{{Sfn|Radner|2019|p=141}}\n\n== Fate ==\nThe eventual fate of Ashur-uballit is unknown'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}''' and his siege of Harran in 609 BC is the last time he, or the Assyrians in general, are mentioned in Babylonian records.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}} After the battle at Harran, Nabopolassar resumed his campaign against the remainder of the Assyrian army in the beginning of the year 608 or 607 BC. It is thought that Ashur-uballit was still alive at this point, for in 608 BC the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Necho II]], Psamtik I's successor, personally led a large Egyptian army into former Assyrian territory to rescue his ally and turn the tide of the war. Because there is no mention of a large battle between the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians and Medes in 608 BC (a battle between the four greatest military powers of their day is unlikely to have been forgotten and left out of contemporary sources) and no later mentions of Ashur-uballit, it is possible that he died at some point in 608 BC before his allies and his enemies could clash in battle.'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}'''  M.B. Rowton speculates Ashur-uballit could have lived untill 606 BC,'''{{Sfn|Rowton|1951|p=128}}''' but by then the Egyptian army is mentioned in Babylonian sources without any references to the Assyrians or their king.{{Sfn|Reade|1998|p=260}}\n\nAlthough Ashur-uballit is no longer mentioned after 609 BC, the Egyptian campaigns in the Levant continued for some time until a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Carchemish]] in 605 BC. Throughout the next century, Egypt and Babylon, brought into direct contact with each other through Assyria's fall, would frequently be at war with each other over control in the Fertile Crescent.{{Sfn|Lipschits|2005|p=20}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Sargonid dynasty]]\n* [[List of Assyrian kings]]\n* [[Military history of the Neo-Assyrian Empire]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"n\"></references>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Cited bibliography ===\n\n* {{Cite journal|last=Bassir|first=Hussein|date=2018|title=The Egyptian expansion in the near east in the saite period|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52c/14c7ebc70abf1c2053fa944135cb51d6cd87.pdf|journal=Journal of Historical Archaeology & Anthropological Sciences|volume=3|issue=2|pages=196\u2013200|ref=CITEREFBassir2018|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=B5BHDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA214&lpg=PA214&dq=%22Ashuruballit%22&source=bl&ots=4cZW2uzHO-&sig=ACfU3U0WHi6J0_VqLVHKeADYVh52CAfjww&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwje6KC62b_nAhUJt4sKHRvND8oQ6AEwBXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Ashuruballit%22&f=false|title=The Persian Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia: Volume I|last=Kia|first=Mehrdad|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2016|isbn=978-1440845680|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFKia2016}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=78nRWgb-rp8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=fall+of+nimrud+medes#v=onepage&q=fall%20of%20nimrud%20medes&f=true|title=The Fall and Rise of Jerusalem: Judah under Babylonian Rule|last=Lipschits|first=Oled|publisher=Eisenbrauns|year=2005|isbn=978-1575060958|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFLipschits2005}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI8714110/|title=Symbols of Power: Figurative Aspects of Esarhaddon's Babylonian Policy (681-669 BC)|last=Porter|first=Barbara N.|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|year=1987|location=|pages=|ref=CITEREFPorter1987}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Radner|first=Karen|date=2019|title=Last Emperor or Crown Prince Forever?

Rector]] depicting the 1897 [[boxing]] match between [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] in [[Carson City, Nevada]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the [[Feature length|longest]] film released to date; as such, it was the world's first [[feature film]]. The technology that allowed this is known as the [[Latham loop]]. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm [[nitrate film]].  Only fragments of the film survive.  The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built [[optical printer]] to convert the film to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe film was also the first to be shot in [[widescreen]], with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of about 1.65:1. According to Dan Streible, ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'' is \"one of the earliest individual productions to sustain public commentary on the cinema.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\">{{cite book |last= Streible|first= Dan|date= 1997|title= Out of Bounds: Sports, Media, and the Politics of Identity|chapter= Female Spectators and the Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MhMLbP9N-7YC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Bloomington, Indiana|publisher= Indiana University Press|pages= 16\u201347|isbn= 0-253-33228-1|editor1-last= Baker|editor1-first= Aaron|editor2-last= Boyd|editor2-first= Todd Edward}}</ref> The film is so important to [[film history]] that Luke McKernan declared, \"it was boxing that created the cinema.\"<ref>{{cite book|last= McKernan|first= Luke|date= 1996|title= Cinema: The Beginnings and the Future|chapter= Sport and the First Films|location= London|publisher= University of Westminister Press|page= [https://archive.org/details/cinemabeginnings0000unse/page/107 107]|isbn= 1859190073|editor-last= Williams|editor-first= Christopher|url= https://archive.org/details/cinemabeginnings0000unse/page/107}}</ref> As noted by Seth Abraham, the president of ''[[Time Warner Sports]]'', it was the first motion picture to ever depict the championship prizefight.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000023042674&view=1up&seq=77 Statement of Seth G.

This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction.  What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, [[Billy Madden]], introducing the event, the introduction of referee [[George Siler]], and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes.  The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the [[solar plexus]] for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n==Production==\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed ''[[Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph]]'' (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetoscope]] as a separate [[peep show]] for a separate fee.<ref name= \"Musser1990\">{{cite book |last= Musser|first= Charles|date= 1990|title= The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 0-520-08533-7|author-link= Charles Musser}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter [[Dan Stuart (promoter)|Dan Stuart]].<ref name= \"Condon2009\">{{cite book |last= Condon|first= Dennis|date= 2009|chapter= Irish Audiences Watch Their First US Feature: The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897)|title= Screening Irish-America: A Reader|location= Dublin|publisher= Irish Academic Press|pages= 135\u2013147|isbn= 9780716529910|editor-last= Barton|editor-first= Ruth}}</ref>{{rp|137}} Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897.

Fitzsimmons was outraged upon learning of the deal, and the terms were renegotiated. Under the new terms, each boxer and his manager would take 25%, with Rector, Stuart, and [[Samuel J.

Much attention was given to the fact that Rose Julian Fitzsimmons, Bob's wife, viewed the live match from a box with other female companions, such as dancers [[Lo\u00efe Eiler]] and [[Ida Eiler]], while women otherwise did not mix with the crowd.  As much as 60% of the Chicago audience was composed of women.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" /> As [[Miriam Hansen]] put it, \"it afforded women the forbidden sight of male bodies in seminudity, engaged in intimate and intense physical action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Hansen|first= Miriam|date= 1991|title= Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8nFG8zMWI-0C&lpg=PA1&dq=Miriam%20Hansen%20The%20Corbett-Fitzsimmons%20Fight&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Cambridge|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-05831-3}}</ref> She argues a connection between the female reception of this film and the large female audience for [[Rudolph Valentino]] two decades later, who was typically shown stripped to the waist and beaten in his films.\n\nStreible calls this into debate, and suggests that the size of the female audience is predominantly self-generated [[Boilerplate text|boilerplate]].  The film had been strongly opposed by the [[Women's Christian Temperance Union]], which tried to get legislation passed to prevent the film's transmission by mail.<ref>''Congressional Record'' XXIX pp. 2581\u201389</ref>  Their protests of fight films were second only to suffrage on their national agenda.<ref>''23rd Annual Meeting of the Women's Christian Temperance Union'', 11</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|30}} Several state and local authorities tried to ban the reproduction of pugilist films, but this did not come to a vote.<ref>''New York Tribune'', March 25, 1897</ref><ref>''New York Tribune'', April 16, 1897</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}  An editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'' declared, \"It is not very creditable to our civilization perhaps that an achievement of what is now called the 'veriscope' that has attracted and will attract the widest attention should be the representation of a prizefight.\"<ref>''[[The New York Times]]'', May 26, 1897</ref> Rector claimed that the film had \"every defect known to photography\" in the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' in attempt to quell the protests against a film falsely deemed unusable.<ref>[[San Francisco Examiner]], April 14, 1897, p. 1</ref><ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|24}} Because the audience for prizefighting was \"perceived to be a rowdy, less desirable class of patron[,] Veriscope recruited more genteel audiences.

Vincent]] called ''[[Gentleman Jack (play)|Gentleman Jack]]'', which contributed to Corbett's reputation as a [[matinee idol]] for women, as the play was presented to mixed audiences. Brady had honed Corbett's image as an educated gentleman in order to improve his appeal to [[bourgeois]] audiences.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Woods|first= Alan|date= 1976|title= James J.

One of these was by \"Matinee Girl,\" a reporter for the ''[[New York Dramatic Mirror]]'' (who may or may not have been a real woman), who reported in the June 12, 1897 issue viewing the film with some shame, admiration for Corbett, and disappointment at his loss.  He points out that she name-drops Brady, which identifies her as an \"insider.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|34}} The other article he found by a woman was \"Alice Rix at the Veriscope\" from the ''Examiner'' Sunday Magazine.<ref>''Examiner'', July 18, 1897, p. 72</ref>  [[Alice Rix]], known for a particular brand of \"[[sob sister]]\" journalism (along with [[Nellie Bly]] and [[Dorothy Dix]]), claimed that when she viewed the film at the [[Olympia Theatre, New York|Olympia Theatre]], she counted only sixty women in an audience of a thousand, and found the [[dress circle]] empty.  She observed that they were mostly \"dressed down,\" and that all were escorted by men and appeared uninterestedly watching a bloodless spectacle.  She proceeded to describe the entire medium of motion pictures as \"awful.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|36\u201337}}\n\nStreible reproduces a drawing that accompanied Rix's article depicting two women in attendance of the film. One appears to be younger and leaning forward, watching the film with interest, while the other, apparently an older woman acting as chaperon, is turned away from the screen and uninterested in the film, even dismayed at the younger woman's interest. He notes that \"respectable women\" had been allowed to attend theater for only about a generation, and that Broadway did not actively court women or families as audience members until 1865.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|38}} The pre-war audience had primarily been men and prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Allen|first= Robert C.|date= 1991|title= Horrible Prettiness:  Burlesque and American Culture|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4IoXcZyKKJoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Chapel Hill|publisher= The University of North Carolina Press|page= 86|isbn= 0-8078-4316-4|author-link= Robert C.

Musser notes that ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' went so far as to call the film the \"proper\" thing for ladies to see.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|200}} Streible, citing the research of [[Antonia Lant]], contrasts paintings of women in theater audiences by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[Claude Monet]], and [[Berthe Morisot]] with this drawing by making it appear that the fact that women were allowed to look was more important than that the act of looking being allowed to them.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|46}} That the younger woman is leaning indicates that what she is looking at is, in fact, what is important to her rather than the simple privilege of looking.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|39}}\n\nStreible also touches on potential [[homoerotic]] interest in the film, citing work on [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] photos by [[Thomas Waugh]].  He concludes that prizefighting, as opposed to [[physical culture]], was not associated with aesthetics or male beauty, Corbett excepted.  The aesthetics of the boxing scene were better known for broken jaws and [[cauliflower ears]], such that one's [[sexual orientation]] probably had little bearing on one's appreciation of the film, and of a sport surrounded by [[homophobic]] press.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nMusser, in his discussion of subsequent feature-length fight films, that subsequent to ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'', no boxing film drew comparable audience numbers and that women stopped attending in significant numbers.,<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|208}} reinforcing Streible's theories of hype and female interest in Corbett the matinee idol.\n\nDenis Condon discusses how class, rather than gender, affected audience response to the film in Dublin.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" /> The significance of the film's reception in Ireland derives from the fact that Corbett was Irish by birth and often contrasted to the English-born Fitzsimmons, who himself was the son of an Irish blacksmith, a fact that no newspaper noted at the time.  He notes a surprising absence, in response to the film, of ethnic partisanship, in spite of the St. Patrick's Day day of the fight, the Irish-English tension of 1898, and heavy antagonism of the Irish-American Corbett and the English Fitzsimmons, who is elsewhere described as Anglo-Australian.  Audiences put aside political fervors and suspended their knowledge, pretending that they were watching a live performance.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|144}} Irish women did not attend, possibly because [[The Lyric Hall]], where the film was shown, often featured live boxing and sexually risqu\u00e9 material, and thus considered an inappropriate place for a respectable woman, while another theatre nearby was regarded as more family-friendly.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|141}}\n\n==Legacy==\nQuick to compete, [[Siegmund Lubin]] created a film the same year known as ''[[Reproduction of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', staged on a rooftop with two freight handlers from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].  Each round was shot on only 50 feet of 35 millimeter film stock at a very slow speed.

Rector]] depicting the 1897 [[boxing]] match between [[James J. Corbett]] and [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] in [[Carson City, Nevada]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. Originally running for more than 100 minutes, it was the [[Feature length|longest]] film released to date; as such, it was the world's first [[feature film]]. The technology that allowed this is known as the [[Latham loop]]. Rector claimed to have invented the device, but its invention is disputed. He used three such equipped cameras placed adjacently and filming on 63mm [[nitrate film]].  Only fragments of the film survive.  The known fragments were transferred in the 1980s from a print owned by Jean A. LeRoy of New York City, the transfer done on a specially built [[optical printer]] to convert the film to [[35mm movie film|35mm film]].\n\nThe film was also the first to be shot in [[widescreen]], with an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of about 1.65:1.

This was not unusual for a boxing film, although each round would previously have been presented as a separate attraction.  What made this film exceptional is a five-minute introduction that showed former champion [[John L. Sullivan]] (whom Corbett defeated in 1892) and his manager, [[Billy Madden]], introducing the event, the introduction of referee [[George Siler]], and both boxers entering the ring in their robes.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\nThe one-minute rests between each round were captured on film and when it was reissued it included a ten-minute epilogue of the empty ring at the end of the fight, into which members of the audience eventually stormed. Even with these approximate timings, the film ran a minimum of 71 minutes, and sources generally report that it exceeded 90 or 100 minutes.  The film climaxes with Fitzsimmons hitting Corbett in the [[solar plexus]] for a knockout and Corbett crawling outside the space of the camera so that he is not visible above the waist.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|22}}\n\n==Production==\nEnoch J. Rector had been an employee of the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company, which filmed ''[[Corbett and Courtney Before the Kinetograph]]'' (1894) in six one minute rounds, each exhibited via the [[Thomas Edison|Edison]] [[Kinetoscope]] as a separate [[peep show]] for a separate fee.<ref name= \"Musser1990\">{{cite book |last= Musser|first= Charles|date= 1990|title= The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEUMWToGOtUC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press|isbn= 0-520-08533-7|author-link= Charles Musser}}</ref>{{rp|194}} Some time after leaving the company, Rector arranged for the film with boxing promoter [[Dan Stuart (promoter)|Dan Stuart]].<ref name= \"Condon2009\">{{cite book |last= Condon|first= Dennis|date= 2009|chapter= Irish Audiences Watch Their First US Feature: The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight (1897)|title= Screening Irish-America: A Reader|location= Dublin|publisher= Irish Academic Press|pages= 135\u2013147|isbn= 9780716529910|editor-last= Barton|editor-first= Ruth}}</ref>{{rp|137}} Stuart offered $10,000 to the winner of the bout in an agreement signed by both boxers on 4 January 1897.

Much attention was given to the fact that Rose Julian Fitzsimmons, Bob's wife, viewed the live match from a box with other female companions, such as dancers [[Lo\u00efe Eiler]] and [[Ida Eiler]], while women otherwise did not mix with the crowd.  As much as 60% of the Chicago audience was composed of women.<ref name= \"Musser1990\" /> As [[Miriam Hansen]] put it, \"it afforded women the forbidden sight of male bodies in seminudity, engaged in intimate and intense physical action.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Hansen|first= Miriam|date= 1991|title= Babel and Babylon: Spectatorship in American Silent Film|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8nFG8zMWI-0C&lpg=PA1&dq=Miriam%20Hansen%20The%20Corbett-Fitzsimmons%20Fight&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Cambridge|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 0-674-05831-3}}</ref> She argues a connection between the female reception of this film and the large female audience for [[Rudolph Valentino]] two decades later, who was typically shown stripped to the waist and beaten in his films.\n\nStreible calls this into debate, and suggests that the size of the female audience is predominantly self-generated [[Boilerplate text|boilerplate]].

One of these was by \"Matinee Girl,\" a reporter for the ''[[New York Dramatic Mirror]]'' (who may or may not have been a real woman), who reported in the June 12, 1897 issue viewing the film with some shame, admiration for Corbett, and disappointment at his loss.  He points out that she name-drops Brady, which identifies her as an \"insider.\"<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|34}} The other article he found by a woman was \"Alice Rix at the Veriscope\" from the ''Examiner'' Sunday Magazine.<ref>''Examiner'', July 18, 1897, p. 72</ref>  [[Alice Rix]], known for a particular brand of \"[[sob sister]]\" journalism (along with [[Nellie Bly]] and [[Dorothy Dix]]), claimed that when she viewed the film at the [[Olympia Theatre, New York|Olympia Theatre]], she counted only sixty women in an audience of a thousand, and found the [[dress circle]] empty.

One appears to be younger and leaning forward, watching the film with interest, while the other, apparently an older woman acting as chaperon, is turned away from the screen and uninterested in the film, even dismayed at the younger woman's interest. He notes that \"respectable women\" had been allowed to attend theater for only about a generation, and that Broadway did not actively court women or families as audience members until 1865.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|38}} The pre-war audience had primarily been men and prostitutes.<ref>{{cite book |last= Allen|first= Robert C.|date= 1991|title= Horrible Prettiness:  Burlesque and American Culture|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4IoXcZyKKJoC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|location= Chapel Hill|publisher= The University of North Carolina Press|page= 86|isbn= 0-8078-4316-4|author-link= Robert C.

He concludes that prizefighting, as opposed to [[physical culture]], was not associated with aesthetics or male beauty, Corbett excepted.  The aesthetics of the boxing scene were better known for broken jaws and [[cauliflower ears]], such that one's [[sexual orientation]] probably had little bearing on one's appreciation of the film, and of a sport surrounded by [[homophobic]] press.<ref name= \"Streible1997\" />{{rp|41}}\n\nMusser, in his discussion of subsequent feature-length fight films, that subsequent to ''The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight'', no boxing film drew comparable audience numbers and that women stopped attending in significant numbers.,<ref name= \"Musser1990\" />{{rp|208}} reinforcing Streible's theories of hype and female interest in Corbett the matinee idol.\n\nDenis Condon discusses how class, rather than gender, affected audience response to the film in Dublin.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" /> The significance of the film's reception in Ireland derives from the fact that Corbett was Irish by birth and often contrasted to the English-born Fitzsimmons, who himself was the son of an Irish blacksmith, a fact that no newspaper noted at the time.  He notes a surprising absence, in response to the film, of ethnic partisanship, in spite of the St. Patrick's Day day of the fight, the Irish-English tension of 1898, and heavy antagonism of the Irish-American Corbett and the English Fitzsimmons, who is elsewhere described as Anglo-Australian.  Audiences put aside political fervors and suspended their knowledge, pretending that they were watching a live performance.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|144}} Irish women did not attend, possibly because [[The Lyric Hall]], where the film was shown, often featured live boxing and sexually risqu\u00e9 material, and thus considered an inappropriate place for a respectable woman, while another theatre nearby was regarded as more family-friendly.<ref name= \"Condon2009\" />{{rp|141}}\n\n==Legacy==\nQuick to compete, [[Siegmund Lubin]] created a film the same year known as ''[[Reproduction of the Corbett and Fitzsimmons Fight]]'', staged on a rooftop with two freight handlers from the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

{{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|a\u026a|d\u0292|\u0259l}}, designated '''\u03b2 Orionis''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to '''Beta Orionis''', abbreviated '''Beta Ori''', '''\u03b2 Ori'''), is the name applied to a [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], and strictly to the system's brightest star. Appearing as a single blue-white point of light to the [[naked eye]], the system contains at least four [[star]]s, the principal star of which is a [[Massive star|massive]] [[blue supergiant]] of [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] B8Ia. It is  calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times [[Solar luminosity|as luminous]] as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times [[solar mass|as massive]], depending on the method used to calculate its properties and assumptions about its distance, estimated to be about {{convert|860|ly|pc|sigfig=2|lk=on}}. Its radius is over 70 times [[Solar radius|that of the Sun]], and its [[Surface temperature (star)|surface temperature]] is {{val|12,100|ul=K|fmt=commas}}. Rigel varies slightly in brightness, with [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. Its [[Variable star#Intrinsic variable stars|intrinsic variability]] is caused by pulsations, and it is classified as an [[Alpha Cygni variable]]. Rigel is generally the [[list of brightest stars|seventh-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]] and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by the more variable [[Betelgeuse]]. Rigel's mass-loss due to its [[stellar wind]] is estimated be around 10 million times more than that of the [[Sun]]. Estimated to be around 7 to 9 million years old, it has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded and cooled to become a supergiant, and will end its life as a [[type II supernova]].\n\nRigel (A) has a companion {{val|9.5|ul=arc seconds}} away with an apparent magnitude of 6.7, or 1/400th as bright. Often referred to as Rigel B or Rigel BC, this companion is actually a triple star system.  Two stars, components B and C, can be resolved by very large telescopes. The brighter of the two is a [[spectroscopic binary]], the components designated Ba and Bb. These three stars are [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main sequence stars]] each around three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel A and Rigel BC\u2014around 2,200 [[astronomical unit]]s distant from each other\u2014are thought to orbit around a common centre of gravity every 24,000 years. Rigel B and C orbit around each other every 63 years and Rigel Ba and Bb every 10 days. A fainter star, separated from the others by nearly an [[arc minute]], might be part of the same star system.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bright points of light against a dark background with wisps of coloured nebulosity|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], with Rigel at bottom right, at optical wavelengths plus [[H\u03b1]] to emphasize gas clouds]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) included the name \"Rigel\" in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/><ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system. In historical [[astronomical catalogs]], the system is listed variously as [[Herschel Catalogue of Double Stars|H&nbsp;II]]&nbsp;33, [[Struve Double Star Catalog|\u03a3]]&nbsp;668, [[Burnham Double Star Catalogue|\u03b2]]&nbsp;555, or [[Aitken Double Star Catalogue|ADS]]&nbsp;3823. For simplicity, Rigel's companions can be referred to as Rigel B,<ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> C, and D;<ref name=\"kalerrigel\" /><ref name=\"garfinkle1997\"/> the IAU describes such names as \"useful nicknames\" that are \"unofficial\".<ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> In modern comprehensive catalogues, the whole multiple star system is known as [[Washington Double Star Catalog|WDS]] 05145-0812 or [[Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars|CCDM]] 05145\u20130812.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=CCDM>{{cite journal |bibcode=1994CoORB.115....1D |title=Catalogue des composantes d'etoiles doubles et multiples (CCDM) premiere edition - Catalogue of the components of double and multiple stars (CCDM) first edition |last1=Dommanget |first1=J. |last2=Nys |first2=O. |journal=Communications de l'Observatoire Royal de Belgique |volume=115 |pages=1 |year=1994 }}</ref> <!-- SIMBAD adds J; i.e. WDS J05145-0812 or CCDM J05145-0812-->\n\nThe designation of Rigel as \u03b2 Orionis ([[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] to Beta Orionis) was made by [[Johann Bayer]] in 1603. The \"beta\" designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than \u03b1 Orionis ([[Betelgeuse]]).<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Astronomer [[James B. Kaler]] has speculated that Rigel was designated by Bayer during a rare period when it was outshone by the variable star Betelgeuse, resulting in the latter star being designated \"alpha\" and Rigel designated \"beta\".<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> However, Bayer did not strictly order the stars by brightness; rather he grouped them by magnitude class and then ordered the stars within each class according to a different scheme.<ref name=ridpath>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Ridpath |title=Star Tales |chapter=Bayer's ''Uranometria'' and Bayer letters  |publisher=Lutterworth Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7188-2695-6 |chapter-url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer.htm}}</ref>  Rigel and Betelgeuse were both considered to be of the first magnitude class, and in Orion the stars of each class are thought to have been ordered north to south.<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last= Moore|title=Brilliant Stars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWEOGwAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Cassell| location=London | isbn=978-0-304-34903-6}}</ref>  Rigel is included in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]], but since it already has a [[Bayer designation]] it has no separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=baa/>\n\nRigel has many other [[Stellar designations and names|stellar designations]] taken from various catalogues, including the [[Flamsteed designation]] 19&nbsp;Orionis (19 Ori), the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] entry HR&nbsp;1713, and the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] number HD&nbsp;34085. These designations frequently appear in the scientific literature,<ref name=msc/><ref name=schultz/><ref name=markova/> but rarely in popular writing.<ref name=garfinkle1997/><ref name=burnham/>\n\n==Observation==\nRigel is an [[Variable star|intrinsic variable]] star with an [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18.<ref name=guinan/> It is typically the sevkjhgfghujujjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjenth-brightest star in the [[celestial sphere]], excluding the Sun, although occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse.<ref name=burnham/> It is fainter than [[Capella]], which may also vary slightly in brightness.<ref name=Samus2017/> Rigel appears slightly blue-white and has a [[B-V color]] index of \u22120.06.<ref name=\"csiro\"/> It contrasts strongly with reddish Betelgeuse.<ref name=DK/>\n\n[[Culmination|Culminating]] every year at [[midnight]] on 12 December, and at 9 pm on 24 January, Rigel is visible on winter evenings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and on summer evenings in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> In the Southern Hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises.<ref name=ellyard/> The star is a vertex of the \"[[Winter Hexagon]]\", an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that includes [[Aldebaran]], Capella, [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], [[Procyon]], and [[Sirius]]. Rigel is a prominent equatorial [[navigation star]], being easily located and readily visible in all the world's oceans (the exception is the area north of the [[82nd parallel north]]).<ref name=kerigan/>\n\n=== Spectroscopy ===\nRigel's [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] is a defining point of the classification sequence for supergiants.<ref name=morgan1978/><ref name=morgan1950/> The overall spectrum is typical for a [[Late-type star|late]] B class star, with strong [[absorption line]]s of the hydrogen [[Balmer series]] together with neutral helium lines and some of heavier elements such as oxygen, calcium, and magnesium.<ref name=abetti/> The [[luminosity class]] for B8 stars is estimated from the strength and narrowness of the hydrogen spectral lines, and Rigel is assigned to the [[bright supergiant]] class Ia.<ref name=mkk/> Variations in the spectrum have resulted in the assignment of different classes to Rigel, such as B8 Ia, B8 Iab, and B8 Iae.<ref name=schultz/><ref name=bally/>\n\nAs early as 1888, the heliocentric [[radial velocity]] of Rigel, as estimated from the [[Doppler shift]]s of its spectral lines, was seen to vary. This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days.<ref name=plaskett/> The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about {{val|10|ul=km/s}} around a mean of {{val|21.5|u=km/s}}.<ref name=morrison/>\n\nIn 1933, the [[H\u03b1]] line in Rigel's spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted {{val|0.1|ul=nm}} towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow [[emission line|emission spike]] about {{val|1.5|u=nm}} to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line.<ref name=struve/> This is now known as a [[P Cygni profile]] after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with [[mass loss]] where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.<ref name=struve/>\n\nThe unusual H\u03b1 line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. Around a third of the time it is a normal absorption line. About a quarter of the time it is a double-peaked line, that is an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission H\u03b1 line.<ref name=morrison/><!-- cites 5 previous sentences --> The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large [[coronal loop|looping structures]] arising from the [[photosphere]] and driven by magnetic fields.<ref name=israelian/>\n\n=== Variability ===\nRigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel's brightness variation requires [[Photoelectric sensor|photoelectric]] or [[CCD photometry]] to be reliably detected. These brightness changes have no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel's [[colour index]] varies slightly but is not strongly correlated with its brightness variations.<ref name=guinan1985/>\n\nFrom analysis of ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the [[Alpha Cygni variable|Alpha Cygni]] class of variable stars,<ref name=\"waelkens 1998\"/> defined as \"non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep\u2013AepIa spectral types\".<ref name=Samus2017/> In those spectral types, the 'e' indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the 'p' means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular<ref name=AAVSOvartyps/> or have [[quasi-period]]s.<ref name=vangenderen/> Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry,<ref name=IBVS/> which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days.<ref name=lefevre/> Rigel was observed with the Canadian [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\n=== Mass loss ===\nFrom observations of the variable H\u03b1 spectral line, Rigel's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be {{val|1.5|0.4|e=\u22127}} solar masses per year ({{solar mass|link=n}}/yr)\u2014around 10 million times more than the mass-loss rate from the [[Sun]].<ref name=chesneau2010/> More detailed optical and [[K band (infrared)|K band]] infrared spectroscopic observations, together with [[VLTI]] interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the H\u03b1 and [[H\u03b3]] line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel's stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the H\u03b3 line give {{val|9.4|0.9|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2006-7 and {{val|7.6|1.1|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2009\u201310. Calculations using the H\u03b1 line give lower results, around {{val|1.5|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}}. The terminal wind velocity is {{val|300|u=km/s}}.<ref name=chesneau2014/> It is estimated that Rigel has lost around 3 solar masses ({{solar mass}}) since beginning life as a star of {{val|24|3|u={{solar mass}}}} 7 to 9 million years ago.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\n==Distance==\n[[File:Treasures3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A very bright blue-white star with fainter stars near a sharply-defined strip of nebulosity|Rigel and [[reflection nebula]] [[IC 2118]] in [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. Rigel B is not visible in the glare of the main star.]]\nRigel's distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, with different estimates obtained by different methods. The 2007 [[Hipparcos new reduction]] of Rigel's [[stellar parallax|parallax]] is {{val|3.78|0.34|ul=mas}}, giving a distance of {{convert|863|ly|pc|abbr=off}} with a [[margin of error]] of about 9%.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a [[Gaia Data Release 2]] parallax of {{val|2.9186|0.0761|u=mas}}, suggesting a distance around {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}. However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIndirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of [[nebulosity]], with its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5\u00b0-long [[IC 2118]] (Witch Head Nebula),<ref name=Guieu2010/><ref name=\"Jedicke1992\"/> located at an [[angular separation]] of 2.5\u00b0 from the star,<ref name=Guieu2010/> or a projected distance of {{convert|12|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} away.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC&nbsp;2118's distance is estimated to be {{convert|291|\u00b1|2|pc|ly|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=Kounkel2018/>\n\nRigel is an outlying member of the [[Orion OB1 Association]], which is located at a distance of up to {{convert|500|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Earth. It is a member of the loosely-defined [[Taurus-Orion R1 Association]], somewhat closer at {{convert|360|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=markova/><ref name=racine/> Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the [[Orion Nebula]]. Betelgeuse and [[Saiph]] lie at a similar distance to Rigel, although Betelgeuse is a [[runaway star]] with a complex history and might have originally formed in the main body of the association.<ref name=bally/>\n\n== Stellar system ==\n<div style=\"float:left; width:240px; border:solid black 1px; text-align: center; margin: 8px; padding: 4px; font-size: 90%;\">\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|border=1|  |, |S1|  |S1='''Rigel''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |PA|PA=Separation=9.5\u2033<br/>Period=24,000&nbsp;y }} \n{{chart|border=1|-|( |  |, |- |S2|S2='''Ba''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |, |( |PB|PB=Separation={{val|0.58|u=mas}}<br/>Period={{Val|9.860|u=days}} }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |! |! |` |- |S3|S3='''Bb''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |` |( |PC|PC=Separation={{Val|0.1|u=arcsecond}}<br/>Period=63&nbsp;y }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |  |` |S4|  |S4='''C''' }}\n{{chart/end}}\n[[Star systems#Designations and nomenclature|Hierarchical scheme]] for Rigel's components<ref name=msc/> \n<!--This hierarchy structure separates stars into subsystems which are assumed to be gravitationally attached. As some stars in the Rigel system have little evidence of orbital motion, which is questioned by some astronomers, we cannot say it is a 'Hierarchy of orbits'. -->\n</div>\n\nThe Rigel [[multiple star system|star system]] has at least four components. The blue supergiant primary (Rigel A) has a [[Visual double star|visual companion]], which is likely a close triple star system. A fainter star at a wider separation might also be a fifth component of the Rigel system.\n\n[[William Herschel]] discovered Rigel to be a visual double star on 1 October 1781, cataloguing it as star 33 in the \"second class of double stars\" in his Catalogue of Double Stars,<ref name=\"Herschel1782\"/> usually abbreviated to H&nbsp;II&nbsp;33, or as H&nbsp;2&nbsp;33 in the Washington Double Star Catalogue.<ref name=\"WDS\"/>  [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] first measured the relative position of the companion in 1822, cataloguing the visual pair as \u03a3 668.<ref name=FGWStruve/><ref name=\"Webb1917\"/> The secondary star is often referred to as Rigel B or \u03b2 Orionis B. The angular separation of Rigel B from Rigel A is 9.5 arc seconds to its south along [[position angle]] 204\u00b0.<ref name=\"WDS\"/><ref name=bakich/> Although not particularly faint at [[visual magnitude]] 6.7, the overall difference in brightness from Rigel A (about 6.6 magnitudes or 440 times fainter) makes it a challenging target for telescope apertures smaller than {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nAt Rigel's estimated distance, Rigel B's [[projected separation]] from Rigel A is over 2,200&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s (AU). Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar [[proper motion|common proper motion]].<ref name=\"Jedicke1992\" /><ref name=sb9/> The pair would have an estimated orbital period of around 24,000&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains a somewhat unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR2. The Gaia DR2 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIn 1871, [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]] suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components.<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than {{val|0.1|u=\"}} to around {{val|0.3|u=\"}}.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> In 2009, [[speckle interferometric|speckle interferometry]] showed the two almost identical components separated by {{val|0.124|u=\"}},<ref name=mason/> with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6 respectively.<ref name=WDS/> Their estimated orbital period is 63&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as \u03b2&nbsp;555 in his double star catalogue<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> or BU&nbsp;555 in modern use.<ref name=WDS/>\n\nComponent B is a double-lined [[spectroscopic binary]] system, which shows two sets of [[spectral line]]s combined within its single [[stellar spectrum]]. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86&nbsp;days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple star system,<ref name=sb9/> although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nIn 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude. He listed it as component D of \u03b2&nbsp;555,<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> although it is unclear whether it is physically related or a coincidental alignment.  Its 2017 separation from Rigel was {{val|44.5|ul=\"}} almost due north at a position angle of 1\u00b0.<ref name=WDS/>  Gaia DR2 finds it to be a 12th magnitude sunlike star<!-- Does \"orange dwarf\" count as \"sunlike\"? --> at approximately the same distance as Rigel.<ref name=dr2d/> Likely a [[K-type main-sequence star]], this star would have an orbital period of around 250,000 years, if it is part of the Rigel system.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> A spectroscopic companion to Rigel was reported on the basis of radial velocity variations, and its orbit was even calculated, but subsequent work suggests that the star does not exist and that observed pulsations are intrinsic to Rigel itself.<ref name=sb9/>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n[[File:Hertzsprung-Russel StarData.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=A chart showing several labelled stars against shaded coloured areas with axes of spectral type and absolute magnitude|Rigel's place at top-center on the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]]]]\nRigel is a [[blue supergiant]] that has exhausted the hydrogen fuel in its core, expanded and cooled as it moved away from the [[main sequence]] across the upper part of the [[Hertzsprung\u2013Russell diagram]].<ref name=guinan/><ref name=seeds/> When it was on the main sequence, its [[effective temperature]] would have been around {{val|30,000|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=saio/> Rigel's complex variability at [[Electromagnetic spectrum|visual wavelengths]] is caused by [[stellar pulsations]] similar to those of [[Deneb]]. Additional observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\nEstimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical [[Stellar evolution#Models|stellar evolution models]].<ref name=demarque2008/>  However, its effective temperature can be determined from the spectral type and colour to be around {{val|12,100|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=przybilla/> A mass of {{val|21|3|u=solar mass}} at an age of {{val|8|1}} million years has been determined by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modelling from the spectrum gives a mass of {{solar mass|{{val|24|8}}}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\nAlthough Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun,<ref name=\"schaaf\" /><ref name=burnham/> its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of {{convert|264|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun ({{solar luminosity|link=y}}),<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> but another recently published distance of {{convert|360|\u00b1|40|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} suggests an even higher luminosity of {{solar luminosity|219,000}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/> Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel's atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between {{solar luminosity|83,000}} and {{solar luminosity|363,000}},<ref name=markova/> while summing the [[spectral energy distribution]] from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as {{val|61515|11486|u={{solar luminosity}}|fmt=commas}}.<ref name=baines/> A 2018 study using the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer]] measured the [[angular diameter]] as {{val|2.526|u=mas}}. After correcting for [[limb darkening]], the angular diameter is found to be {{val|2.606|0.009|u=mas}}, yielding a radius of {{solar radius|{{val|74.1|+6.1|-7.3}}|link=y}}.<ref name=baines/> An older measurement of the angular diameter gives {{val|2.75|0.01|u=mas}},<ref name=auf/> equivalent to a radius {{solar radius|78.9}} at {{val|264|u=pc}}.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>  These radii are calculated assuming the Hipparcos distance of {{val|264|u=pc}}; adopting a distance of {{val|360|u=pc}} leads to a significantly larger size.<ref name=chesneau2014/>\n\nDue to their closeness to each other and ambiguity of the spectrum, little is known about the individual intrinsic properties of the members of the Rigel BC triple system. All three stars seem to be near equally hot [[B-type main-sequence star]]s that are 3 to 4 times as massive as the Sun.<ref name=msc/>\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[Stellar evolution]] models suggest that the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a [[red supergiant]] phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant.  This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is likely to be [[Triple-alpha process|fusing helium]] in its core.<ref name=apj2012_749_74 /> Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now.  The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modelled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the [[Paul_Ledoux#Ledoux_criterion|Ledoux Criteria]].<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a type II [[supernova]].<ref name=apj2012_749_74/> It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth,<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around {{val|-11}} (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets.)<ref name=guinan/>\n\n==Etymology and cultural significance==\nThe earliest known recording of the modern name ''Rigel'' is in the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' of 1521. It is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''{{transl|ar|Rijl Jauzah al Yusr\u0101}}'', \"the left leg (foot) of Jauzah\" (i.e. ''rijl'' meaning \"leg, foot\"),<ref name=allen/> which can be traced to the 10th century.<ref name=\"KUNITZSCH1959\"/> \"Jauzah\" was a proper name for Orion; an alternative Arabic name was {{lang|ar|\u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0627\u0631}} ''{{transl|ar|rijl al-jabb\u0101r}}'', \"the foot of the great one\", from which stems the rarely used variant names ''Algebar'' or ''Elgebar''. The ''Alphonsine tables'' saw its name split into \"Rigel\" and \"Algebar\", with the note, ''et dicitur Algebar. Nominatur etiam Rigel.''<ref name=Kunitzsch86/> Alternate spellings from the 17th century include ''Regel'' by Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]], ''Riglon'' by German astronomer [[Wilhelm Schickard]], and ''Rigel Algeuze'' or ''Algibbar'' by English scholar [[Edmund Chilmead]].<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nWith the constellation representing the mythological Greek huntsman [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]], Rigel is his knee or (as its name suggests) foot; with the nearby star [[Beta Eridani]] marking Orion's footstool.<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Rigel is presumably the star known as \"[[Aurvandil]]'s toe\" in [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=cleasby/> In the Caribbean, Rigel represented the severed leg of the folkloric figure ''Trois Rois'', himself represented by the three stars of Orion's Belt. The leg had been severed with a cutlass by the maiden ''B\u012fhi'' (Sirius).<ref name=taylor/> The [[Lacandon]] people of southern [[Mexico]] knew it as ''tunsel'' (\"little woodpecker\").<ref name=milbraith/>\n\nRigel was known as ''Yerrerdet-kurrk'' to the [[Wotjobaluk]] [[koori]] of southeastern Australia, and held to be the mother-in-law of ''Totyerguil'' ([[Altair]]). The distance between them signified the taboo preventing a man from approaching his mother-in-law.<ref name=mudrooroo/> The indigenous [[Wergaia|Boorong]] people of northwestern Victoria named Rigel as ''Collowgullouric Warepil''.<ref name=hamacher/> The [[Wardaman people]] of northern Australia know Rigel as the Red [[Kangaroo]] Leader ''Unumburrgu'' and chief conductor of ceremonies in a songline when Orion is high in the sky. [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]], the river, marks a line of stars in the sky leading to it, and the other stars of Orion are his ceremonial tools and entourage. Betelgeuse is ''Ya-jungin'' \"Owl Eyes Flicking\", watching the ceremonies.<ref name=harney/>\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people]] of New Zealand named Rigel as ''[[Puanga]]'', said to be a daughter of ''Rehua'' ([[Antares]]), the chief of all stars.<ref name=parker/> Its [[heliacal rising]] presages the appearance of ''[[Matariki]]'' (the [[Pleiades]]) in the dawn sky, marking the M\u0101ori New Year in late May or early June. The [[Moriori people]] of the [[Chatham Islands]], as well as some Maori groups in New Zealand, mark the start of their New Year with Rigel rather than the Pleiades.<ref name=\"kelley\"/> ''Puaka'' is a local variant used in the South Island.<ref name=\"Best22\"/> In [[Japan]], the Minamoto or [[Genji clan]] chose Rigel and its white color as its symbol, calling the star ''Genji-boshi'' ({{lang|ja|\u6e90\u6c0f\u661f}}), while the Taira or [[Heike clan]] adopted Betelgeuse and its red color. The two powerful families fought the [[Genpei War]]; the stars were seen as facing off against each other and only kept apart by the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]].<ref name=\"RENSHAW1\"/><ref name=daijirin/><ref name=hojiri/>\n\n==In modern culture==\n{{see also|Rigel in fiction}}\nThe [[MS Rigel|MS ''Rigel'']] was originally a Norwegian ship, built in Copenhagen in 1924.

to '''Beta Orionis''', abbreviated '''Beta Ori''', '''\u03b2 Ori'''), is the name applied to a [[star system]] in the [[constellation]] of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], and strictly to the system's brightest star. Appearing as a single blue-white point of light to the [[naked eye]], the system contains at least four [[star]]s, the principal star of which is a [[Massive star|massive]] [[blue supergiant]] of [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] B8Ia. It is  calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times [[Solar luminosity|as luminous]] as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times [[solar mass|as massive]], depending on the method used to calculate its properties and assumptions about its distance, estimated to be about {{convert|860|ly|pc|sigfig=2|lk=on}}. Its radius is over 70 times [[Solar radius|that of the Sun]], and its [[Surface temperature (star)|surface temperature]] is {{val|12,100|ul=K|fmt=commas}}. Rigel varies slightly in brightness, with [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. Its [[Variable star#Intrinsic variable stars|intrinsic variability]] is caused by pulsations, and it is classified as an [[Alpha Cygni variable]]. Rigel is generally the [[list of brightest stars|seventh-brightest star]] in the [[night sky]] and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by the more variable [[Betelgeuse]]. Rigel's mass-loss due to its [[stellar wind]] is estimated be around 10 million times more than that of the [[Sun]]. Estimated to be around 7 to 9 million years old, it has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded and cooled to become a supergiant, and will end its life as a [[type II supernova]].\n\nRigel (A) has a companion {{val|9.5|ul=arc seconds}} away with an apparent magnitude of 6.7, or 1/400th as bright. Often referred to as Rigel B or Rigel BC, this companion is actually a triple star system.  Two stars, components B and C, can be resolved by very large telescopes. The brighter of the two is a [[spectroscopic binary]], the components designated Ba and Bb. These three stars are [[B-type main-sequence star|blue-white main sequence stars]] each around three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel A and Rigel BC\u2014around 2,200 [[astronomical unit]]s distant from each other\u2014are thought to orbit around a common centre of gravity every 24,000 years. Rigel B and C orbit around each other every 63 years and Rigel Ba and Bb every 10 days. A fainter star, separated from the others by nearly an [[arc minute]], might be part of the same star system.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n[[File:Orion Head to Toe.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Bright points of light against a dark background with wisps of coloured nebulosity|[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], with Rigel at bottom right, at optical wavelengths plus [[H\u03b1]] to emphasize gas clouds]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) included the name \"Rigel\" in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.<ref name=\"IAU-CSN\"/><ref name=\"WGSN2018\"/> According to the IAU, this proper name applies only to the primary component A of the Rigel system. In historical [[astronomical catalogs]], the system is listed variously as [[Herschel Catalogue of Double Stars|H&nbsp;II]]&nbsp;33, [[Struve Double Star Catalog|\u03a3]]&nbsp;668, [[Burnham Double Star Catalogue|\u03b2]]&nbsp;555, or [[Aitken Double Star Catalogue|ADS]]&nbsp;3823.

The \"beta\" designation is commonly given to the second-brightest star in each constellation, but Rigel is almost always brighter than \u03b1 Orionis ([[Betelgeuse]]).<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> Astronomer [[James B. Kaler]] has speculated that Rigel was designated by Bayer during a rare period when it was outshone by the variable star Betelgeuse, resulting in the latter star being designated \"alpha\" and Rigel designated \"beta\".<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> However, Bayer did not strictly order the stars by brightness; rather he grouped them by magnitude class and then ordered the stars within each class according to a different scheme.<ref name=ridpath>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Ridpath |title=Star Tales |chapter=Bayer's ''Uranometria'' and Bayer letters  |publisher=Lutterworth Press | location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-7188-2695-6 |chapter-url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/bayer.htm}}</ref>  Rigel and Betelgeuse were both considered to be of the first magnitude class, and in Orion the stars of each class are thought to have been ordered north to south.<ref>{{cite book|first=Patrick|last= Moore|title=Brilliant Stars|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWEOGwAACAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Cassell| location=London | isbn=978-0-304-34903-6}}</ref>  Rigel is included in the [[General Catalogue of Variable Stars]], but since it already has a [[Bayer designation]] it has no separate [[variable star designation]].<ref name=baa/>\n\nRigel has many other [[Stellar designations and names|stellar designations]] taken from various catalogues, including the [[Flamsteed designation]] 19&nbsp;Orionis (19 Ori), the [[Bright Star Catalogue]] entry HR&nbsp;1713, and the [[Henry Draper Catalogue]] number HD&nbsp;34085. These designations frequently appear in the scientific literature,<ref name=msc/><ref name=schultz/><ref name=markova/> but rarely in popular writing.<ref name=garfinkle1997/><ref name=burnham/>\n\n==Observation==\nRigel is an [[Variable star|intrinsic variable]] star with an [[apparent magnitude]] ranging from 0.05 to 0.18.<ref name=guinan/> It is typically the seventh-brightest star in the [[celestial sphere]], excluding the Sun, although occasionally fainter than Betelgeuse.<ref name=burnham/> It is fainter than [[Capella]], which may also vary slightly in brightness.<ref name=Samus2017/> Rigel appears slightly blue-white and has a [[B-V color]] index of \u22120.06.<ref name=\"csiro\"/> It contrasts strongly with reddish Betelgeuse.<ref name=DK/>\n\n[[Culmination|Culminating]] every year at [[midnight]] on 12 December, and at 9 pm on 24 January, Rigel is visible on winter evenings in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and on summer evenings in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"schaaf\"/> In the Southern Hemisphere, Rigel is the first bright star of Orion visible as the constellation rises.<ref name=ellyard/> The star is a vertex of the \"[[Winter Hexagon]]\", an [[asterism (astronomy)|asterism]] that includes [[Aldebaran]], Capella, [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], [[Procyon]], and [[Sirius]]. Rigel is a prominent equatorial [[navigation star]], being easily located and readily visible in all the world's oceans (the exception is the area north of the [[82nd parallel north]]).<ref name=kerigan/>\n\n=== Spectroscopy ===\nRigel's [[Stellar classification#Modern classification|spectral type]] is a defining point of the classification sequence for supergiants.<ref name=morgan1978/><ref name=morgan1950/> The overall spectrum is typical for a [[Late-type star|late]] B class star, with strong [[absorption line]]s of the hydrogen [[Balmer series]] together with neutral helium lines and some of heavier elements such as oxygen, calcium, and magnesium.<ref name=abetti/> The [[luminosity class]] for B8 stars is estimated from the strength and narrowness of the hydrogen spectral lines, and Rigel is assigned to the [[bright supergiant]] class Ia.<ref name=mkk/> Variations in the spectrum have resulted in the assignment of different classes to Rigel, such as B8 Ia, B8 Iab, and B8 Iae.<ref name=schultz/><ref name=bally/>\n\nAs early as 1888, the heliocentric [[radial velocity]] of Rigel, as estimated from the [[Doppler shift]]s of its spectral lines, was seen to vary. This was confirmed and interpreted at the time as being due to a spectroscopic companion with a period of about 22 days.<ref name=plaskett/> The radial velocity has since been measured to vary by about {{val|10|ul=km/s}} around a mean of {{val|21.5|u=km/s}}.<ref name=morrison/>\n\nIn 1933, the [[H\u03b1]] line in Rigel's spectrum was seen to be unusually weak and shifted {{val|0.1|ul=nm}} towards shorter wavelengths, while there was a narrow [[emission line|emission spike]] about {{val|1.5|u=nm}} to the long wavelength side of the main absorption line.<ref name=struve/> This is now known as a [[P Cygni profile]] after a star that shows this feature strongly in its spectrum. It is associated with [[mass loss]] where there is simultaneously emission from a dense wind close to the star and absorption from circumstellar material expanding away from the star.<ref name=struve/>\n\nThe unusual H\u03b1 line profile is observed to vary unpredictably. Around a third of the time it is a normal absorption line. About a quarter of the time it is a double-peaked line, that is an absorption line with an emission core or an emission line with an absorption core. About a quarter of the time it has a P Cygni profile; most of the rest of the time the line has an inverse P Cygni profile, where the emission component is on the short wavelength side of the line. Rarely, there is a pure emission H\u03b1 line.<ref name=morrison/><!-- cites 5 previous sentences --> The line profile changes are interpreted as variations in the quantity and velocity of material being expelled from the star. Occasional very high-velocity outflows have been inferred, and, more rarely, infalling material. The overall picture is one of large [[coronal loop|looping structures]] arising from the [[photosphere]] and driven by magnetic fields.<ref name=israelian/>\n\n=== Variability ===\nRigel has been known to vary in brightness since at least 1930. The small amplitude of Rigel's brightness variation requires [[Photoelectric sensor|photoelectric]] or [[CCD photometry]] to be reliably detected. These brightness changes have no obvious period. Observations over 18 nights in 1984 showed variations at red, blue, and yellow wavelengths of up to 0.13 magnitudes on timescales of a few hours to several days, but again no clear period. Rigel's [[colour index]] varies slightly but is not strongly correlated with its brightness variations.<ref name=guinan1985/>\n\nFrom analysis of ''[[Hipparcos]]'' satellite photometry, Rigel is identified as belonging to the [[Alpha Cygni variable|Alpha Cygni]] class of variable stars,<ref name=\"waelkens 1998\"/> defined as \"non-radially pulsating supergiants of the Bep\u2013AepIa spectral types\".<ref name=Samus2017/> In those spectral types, the 'e' indicates that it displays emission lines in its spectrum, while the 'p' means it has an unspecified spectral peculiarity. Alpha Cygni type variables are generally considered to be irregular<ref name=AAVSOvartyps/> or have [[quasi-period]]s.<ref name=vangenderen/> Rigel was added to the General Catalogue of Variable Stars in the 74th name-list of variable stars on the basis of the Hipparcos photometry,<ref name=IBVS/> which showed variations with a photographic amplitude of 0.039 magnitudes and a possible period of 2.075 days.<ref name=lefevre/> Rigel was observed with the Canadian [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]] satellite for nearly 28 days in 2009. Milli-magnitude variations were observed, and gradual changes in flux suggest the presence of long-period pulsation modes.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\n=== Mass loss ===\nFrom observations of the variable H\u03b1 spectral line, Rigel's mass-loss rate due to stellar wind is estimated be {{val|1.5|0.4|e=\u22127}} solar masses per year ({{solar mass|link=n}}/yr)\u2014around 10 million times more than the mass-loss rate from the [[Sun]].<ref name=chesneau2010/> More detailed optical and [[K band (infrared)|K band]] infrared spectroscopic observations, together with [[VLTI]] interferometry, were taken from 2006 to 2010. Analysis of the H\u03b1 and [[H\u03b3]] line profiles, and measurement of the regions producing the lines, show that Rigel's stellar wind varies greatly in structure and strength. Loop and arm structures were also detected within the wind. Calculations of mass loss from the H\u03b3 line give {{val|9.4|0.9|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2006-7 and {{val|7.6|1.1|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}} in 2009\u201310. Calculations using the H\u03b1 line give lower results, around {{val|1.5|e=\u22127|u={{solar mass}}/yr}}. The terminal wind velocity is {{val|300|u=km/s}}.<ref name=chesneau2014/> It is estimated that Rigel has lost around 3 solar masses ({{solar mass}}) since beginning life as a star of {{val|24|3|u={{solar mass}}}} 7 to 9 million years ago.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\n==Distance==\n[[File:Treasures3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A very bright blue-white star with fainter stars near a sharply-defined strip of nebulosity|Rigel and [[reflection nebula]] [[IC 2118]] in [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]]. Rigel B is not visible in the glare of the main star.]]\nRigel's distance from the Sun is somewhat uncertain, with different estimates obtained by different methods. The 2007 [[Hipparcos new reduction]] of Rigel's [[stellar parallax|parallax]] is {{val|3.78|0.34|ul=mas}}, giving a distance of {{convert|863|ly|pc|abbr=off}} with a [[margin of error]] of about 9%.<ref name=aaa474_2_653/> Rigel B, usually considered to be physically associated with Rigel and at the same distance, has a [[Gaia Data Release 2]] parallax of {{val|2.9186|0.0761|u=mas}}, suggesting a distance around {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}. However, the measurements for this object may be unreliable.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIndirect distance estimation methods have also been employed. For example, Rigel is believed to be in a region of [[nebulosity]], with its radiation illuminating several nearby clouds. Most notable of these is the 5\u00b0-long [[IC 2118]] (Witch Head Nebula),<ref name=Guieu2010/><ref name=\"Jedicke1992\"/> located at an [[angular separation]] of 2.5\u00b0 from the star,<ref name=Guieu2010/> or a projected distance of {{convert|12|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} away.<ref name=\"kalerrigel\"/> From measures of other nebula-embedded stars, IC&nbsp;2118's distance is estimated to be {{convert|291|\u00b1|2|pc|ly|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=Kounkel2018/>\n\nRigel is an outlying member of the [[Orion OB1 Association]], which is located at a distance of up to {{convert|500|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} from Earth. It is a member of the loosely-defined [[Taurus-Orion R1 Association]], somewhat closer at {{convert|360|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}.<ref name=markova/><ref name=racine/> Rigel is thought to be considerably closer than most of the members of Orion OB1 and the [[Orion Nebula]]. Betelgeuse and [[Saiph]] lie at a similar distance to Rigel, although Betelgeuse is a [[runaway star]] with a complex history and might have originally formed in the main body of the association.<ref name=bally/>\n\n== Stellar system ==\n<div style=\"float:left; width:240px; border:solid black 1px; text-align: center; margin: 8px; padding: 4px; font-size: 90%;\">\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|border=1|  |, |S1|  |S1='''Rigel''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |PA|PA=Separation=9.5\u2033<br/>Period=24,000&nbsp;y }} \n{{chart|border=1|-|( |  |, |- |S2|S2='''Ba''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |! |, |( |PB|PB=Separation={{val|0.58|u=mas}}<br/>Period={{Val|9.860|u=days}} }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |! |! |` |- |S3|S3='''Bb''' }}\n{{chart|border=0|  |` |( |PC|PC=Separation={{Val|0.1|u=arcsecond}}<br/>Period=63&nbsp;y }}\n{{chart|border=1|  |  |` |S4|  |S4='''C''' }}\n{{chart/end}}\n[[Star systems#Designations and nomenclature|Hierarchical scheme]] for Rigel's components<ref name=msc/> \n<!--This hierarchy structure separates stars into subsystems which are assumed to be gravitationally attached.

The blue supergiant primary (Rigel A) has a [[Visual double star|visual companion]], which is likely a close triple star system. A fainter star at a wider separation might also be a fifth component of the Rigel system.\n\n[[William Herschel]] discovered Rigel to be a visual double star on 1 October 1781, cataloguing it as star 33 in the \"second class of double stars\" in his Catalogue of Double Stars,<ref name=\"Herschel1782\"/> usually abbreviated to H&nbsp;II&nbsp;33, or as H&nbsp;2&nbsp;33 in the Washington Double Star Catalogue.<ref name=\"WDS\"/>  [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve]] first measured the relative position of the companion in 1822, cataloguing the visual pair as \u03a3 668.<ref name=FGWStruve/><ref name=\"Webb1917\"/> The secondary star is often referred to as Rigel B or \u03b2 Orionis B.

Since its discovery, there has been no sign of orbital motion, although both stars share a similar [[proper motion|common proper motion]].<ref name=\"Jedicke1992\" /><ref name=sb9/> The pair would have an estimated orbital period of around 24,000&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) contains a somewhat unreliable parallax for Rigel B, placing it at about {{convert|340|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, further away than the Hipparcos distance for Rigel, but similar to the Taurus-Orion R1 association. There is no parallax for Rigel in Gaia DR2. The Gaia DR2 proper motions for Rigel B and the Hipparcos proper motions for Rigel are both small, although not quite the same.<ref name=dr2b/>\n\nIn 1871, [[Sherburne Wesley Burnham]] suspected Rigel B to be a binary system, and in 1878, he resolved it into two components.<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> This visual companion is designated as component C (Rigel C), with a measured separation from component B that varies from less than {{val|0.1|u=\"}} to around {{val|0.3|u=\"}}.<ref name=WDS/><ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> In 2009, [[speckle interferometric|speckle interferometry]] showed the two almost identical components separated by {{val|0.124|u=\"}},<ref name=mason/> with visual magnitudes of 7.5 and 7.6 respectively.<ref name=WDS/> Their estimated orbital period is 63&nbsp;years.<ref name=msc/> Burnham listed the Rigel multiple system as \u03b2&nbsp;555 in his double star catalogue<ref name=\"burnham1900\"/> or BU&nbsp;555 in modern use.<ref name=WDS/>\n\nComponent B is a double-lined [[spectroscopic binary]] system, which shows two sets of [[spectral line]]s combined within its single [[stellar spectrum]]. Periodic changes observed in relative positions of these lines indicate an orbital period of 9.86&nbsp;days. The two spectroscopic components Rigel Ba and Rigel Bb cannot be resolved in optical telescopes but are known to both be hot stars of spectral type around B9. This spectroscopic binary, together with the close visual component Rigel C, is likely a physical triple star system,<ref name=sb9/> although Rigel C cannot be detected in the spectrum which is inconsistent with its observed brightness.<ref name=sanford/>\n\nIn 1878, Burnham found another possibly associated star of approximately 13th magnitude.

Additional observations of radial velocity variations indicate that it simultaneously oscillates in at least 19 non-radial modes with periods ranging from about 1.2 to 74 days.<ref name=apj2012_747_108/>\n\nEstimation of many physical characteristics of blue supergiant stars, including Rigel, is challenging due to their rarity and uncertainty about how far they are from the Sun. As such, their characteristics are mainly estimated from theoretical [[Stellar evolution#Models|stellar evolution models]].<ref name=demarque2008/>  However, its effective temperature can be determined from the spectral type and colour to be around {{val|12,100|fmt=commas|ul=K}}.<ref name=przybilla/> A mass of {{val|21|3|u=solar mass}} at an age of {{val|8|1}} million years has been determined by comparing evolutionary tracks, while atmospheric modelling from the spectrum gives a mass of {{solar mass|{{val|24|8}}}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/>\n\nAlthough Rigel is often considered the most luminous star within 1,000 light-years of the Sun,<ref name=\"schaaf\" /><ref name=burnham/> its energy output is poorly known. Using the Hipparcos distance of {{convert|264|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}}, the estimated relative luminosity for Rigel is about 120,000 times that of the Sun ({{solar luminosity|link=y}}),<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> but another recently published distance of {{convert|360|\u00b1|40|pc|ly|abbr=off|order=flip}} suggests an even higher luminosity of {{solar luminosity|219,000}}.<ref name=aaa445_3_1099/> Other calculations based on theoretical stellar evolutionary models of Rigel's atmosphere give luminosities anywhere between {{solar luminosity|83,000}} and {{solar luminosity|363,000}},<ref name=markova/> while summing the [[spectral energy distribution]] from historical photometry with the Hipparcos distance suggests a luminosity as low as {{val|61515|11486|u={{solar luminosity}}|fmt=commas}}.<ref name=baines/> A 2018 study using the [[Navy Precision Optical Interferometer]] measured the [[angular diameter]] as {{val|2.526|u=mas}}.

All three stars seem to be near equally hot [[B-type main-sequence star]]s that are 3 to 4 times as massive as the Sun.<ref name=msc/>\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[Stellar evolution]] models suggest that the pulsations of Rigel are powered by nuclear reactions in a hydrogen-burning shell that is at least partially non-convective. These pulsations are stronger and more numerous in stars that have evolved through a [[red supergiant]] phase and then increased in temperature to again become a blue supergiant.  This is due to the decreased mass and increased levels of fusion products at the surface of the star.<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is likely to be [[Triple-alpha process|fusing helium]] in its core.<ref name=apj2012_749_74 /> Due to strong convection of helium produced in the core while Rigel was on the main sequence and in the hydrogen-burning shell since it became a supergiant, the fraction of helium at the surface has increased from 26.6% when the star formed to 32% now.  The surface abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen seen in the spectrum are compatible with a post-red supergiant star only if its internal convection zones are modelled using non-homogeneous chemical conditions known as the [[Paul_Ledoux#Ledoux_criterion|Ledoux Criteria]].<ref name=saio/>\n\nRigel is expected to eventually end its stellar life as a type II [[supernova]].<ref name=apj2012_749_74/> It is one of the closest known potential supernova progenitors to Earth,<ref name=apj2012_747_108/> and would be expected to have a maximum apparent magnitude of around {{val|-11}} (about the same brightness as a quarter Moon or around 300 times brighter than Venus ever gets.)<ref name=guinan/>\n\n==Etymology and cultural significance==\nThe earliest known recording of the modern name ''Rigel'' is in the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' of 1521.

Over the course of the battle, the Loyalist fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelist fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelist four, managed to close with the Miguelists, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelist fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelist fleet. \n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelist crews proved no match for the Loyalist crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelist fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelist fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]]. The Miguelist-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Loyalist Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]]. \n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Loyalists to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelists forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelist admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelist fleet.\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelist fleet. The Miguelist fleet significantly outnumbered the Loyalist one, and aimed to defeat the Loyalists via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns. \n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelist vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Loyalist fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelist fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelists desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Loyalist victory was that the majority of the Loyalist crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelist fleet. In the battle the Loyalist forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Loyalist cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelist fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelist fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros. \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelist fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Loyalist fleet and the captured Miguelist prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Loyalist victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Loyalist cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Loyalist and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Loyalist victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Loyalist fleet (Charles Napier) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

Vincent]] between a Loyalist fleet under the command of British naval officer [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] against a [[Miguelist]] fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the [[Liberal Wars]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the Loyalist fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Loyalist fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelist fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelist four, managed to close with the Miguelists, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelist fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelist fleet. \n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelist crews proved no match for the Loyalist crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelist fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelist fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]]. The Miguelist-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Loyalist Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as Admiral of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]]. \n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as Vice Admiral, Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Loyalists to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelists forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully disembarking this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelist admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelist fleet.\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelist fleet. The Miguelist fleet significantly outnumbered the Loyalist one, and aimed to defeat the Loyalists via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as tugs, but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns. \n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelist vessels and attempt to board and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his flagship leading the manoeuvre, the Loyalist fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelist fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelists desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Loyalist victory was that the majority of the Loyalist crews were British veterans from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelist fleet. In the battle the Loyalist forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Loyalist cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed (including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains) and about 60 wounded (including Charles Elers Napier), against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelist fleet, including the Admiral, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros. \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelist fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Loyalist fleet and the captured Miguelist prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Loyalist victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Loyalist cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Loyalist and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Loyalist victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834. Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the restored Portuguese parliament. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth parliamentary seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834. He then occupied himself until 1836 with writing a history of the Portuguese War and his own part in it.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Loyalist fleet (Charles Napier) ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"
