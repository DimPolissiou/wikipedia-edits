My wound was from a musket ball through the calf of my right leg, but so far has healed that I began to walk upon it an hour or so in the day. It was a mad but gallant charge made by our Light Cavalry at Balaclava.\n\nThe newspapers will let you see our position at the time. The word was given to \"Charge guns to the front.\" We advanced at a gallop to these guns, and a fearful fire of grape, shell and canister, with ditto on the right and left flanks and infantry pouring in a dreadful fire; horses and men fell thick and fast, but even this did not check our onward rush. All the Russian infantry artillery men were sabred and for an instant we were masters of the guns, but having no support, could not hold them.\n\nIn this condition we were charged to flank and rear by numerous regiments of Russian cavalry and but for the desperation with which our men met their way there would not have been a single man retire from that fatal charge.\n\nAs for myself, I never reached the guns in front as a grape shot went through my busby, about two inches above my head, knocking it to one side, another ball through the calf of my leg and the next through my horse's head (a fine black mare).\n\nI was now at the mercy of their Lancers, whom I saw lancing wounded and dismounted men. The demons give you no quarter when you are down. At this moment the 8th Hussars came by with a horse without a rider. This I mounted, and formed in the rear of the 8th as if it were my own regiment, dashed on. But worse again - we were obliged to wheel \"Right about\" and to pass through a strong body of their cavalry which had gathered in our rear, and cutting off our retreat.\n\nOf course, with our handful, it was life or death, so we rushed at them to break through, but as soon as we got through one body there was another to engage. At any rate, with five or six fellows at my rear I galloped on, passing with the determination of one who would not lose his life, breaking the lances of the cowards who attacked us in the proportion of three or four to one, occasionally catching one a slap with a sword across his teeth, and giving another the point on his arm or breast.\n\nThey still pressed on me till I got sight of our own \"Heavies\" when, thanks be to God, they stopped pursuing us, and I got clear, without a scratch from their lances ... (Oh, the sabre before the lance!)\n\nI found that I could not dismount from the wound in my right leg, and so was lifted off, and then how I caressed the noble horse that brought me safely out. I will not disgrace you as a soldier, father, take my word.'<ref name=Boys/>\n</blockquote>\n\nPennington was in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari Hospital]] during April to May 1855 and became the Camp Cook at [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] in July 1855.

My wound was from a musket ball through the calf of my right leg, but so far has healed that I began to walk upon it an hour or so in the day. It was a mad but gallant charge made by our Light Cavalry at Balaclava.\n\nThe newspapers will let you see our position at the time. The word was given to \"Charge guns to the front.\" We advanced at a gallop to these guns, and a fearful fire of grape, shell and canister, with ditto on the right and left flanks and infantry pouring in a dreadful fire; horses and men fell thick and fast, but even this did not check our onward rush. All the Russian infantry artillery men were sabred and for an instant we were masters of the guns, but having no support, could not hold them.\n\nIn this condition we were charged to flank and rear by numerous regiments of Russian cavalry and but for the desperation with which our men met their way there would not have been a single man retire from that fatal charge.\n\nAs for myself, I never reached the guns in front as a grape shot went through my busby, about two inches above my head, knocking it to one side, another ball through the calf of my leg and the next through my horse's head (a fine black mare).\n\nI was now at the mercy of their Lancers, whom I saw lancing wounded and dismounted men. The demons give you no quarter when you are down. At this moment the 8th Hussars came by with a horse without a rider. This I mounted, and formed in the rear of the 8th as if it were my own regiment, dashed on. But worse again - we were obliged to wheel \"Right about\" and to pass through a strong body of their cavalry which had gathered in our rear, and cutting off our retreat.\n\nOf course, with our handful, it was life or death, so we rushed at them to break through, but as soon as we got through one body there was another to engage. At any rate, with five or six fellows at my rear I galloped on, passing with the determination of one who would not lose his life, breaking the lances of the cowards who attacked us in the proportion of three or four to one, occasionally catching one a slap with a sword across his teeth, and giving another the point on his arm or breast.\n\nThey still pressed on me till I got sight of our own \"Heavies\" when, thanks be to God, they stopped pursuing us, and I got clear, without a scratch from their lances ... (Oh, the sabre before the lance!)\n\nI found that I could not dismount from the wound in my right leg, and so was lifted off, and then how I caressed the noble horse that brought me safely out. I will not disgrace you as a soldier, father, take my word.'<ref name=Boys/>\n</blockquote>\n\nPennington was in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[Selimiye Barracks|Scutari Hospital]] during April to May 1855 and became the Camp Cook at [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]] in July 1855.

The first President of the Society, the [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Earl of Plymouth]], addressed the assembled Aldermen, Councillors, Architects and other city worthies at that first meeting. He stated the aims of the Society, which were:<ref name=BCS>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/our-history|title=Birmingham Civic Society: Our history|accessdate=29 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701142842/http://birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/our-history|archivedate=1 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|to bring public interest to bear upon all proposals put forward by public bodies and private owners for building, upon the laying out of open spaces and parks, and generally upon all matters concerned with the outward amenities of the city and district. It will insist that taste is a thing that matters, and if any offence against taste is challenged at the outset, great good will be done, and converting of mean and unlovely parts of the City will gradually follow.}}\n\n[[Sir Gilbert Barling]] [[Baronet|Bt]] [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] was the Society's first Chairman and [[William Haywood (architect)|William Haywood]] was the first Secretary. Its principal objectives were the stimulation of historical interest in the city, the preservation of buildings and monuments of historic worth, the prevention of vandalism and the promotion of a sense of beauty and civic pride in the lives of citizens.\n\n[[Image:Kings norton park.jpg|left|thumb|Kings Norton Park - a gift from the Society to the City of Birmingham]]\n\nImmediately upon its foundation the Society received from an anonymous trust the sum of \u00a315,000 (equivalent to around \u00a3596,000 in 2016) to buy land for open spaces, the land later to be vested in the Birmingham Corporation. As a result, several areas of land were purchased, transformed into parks and handed over to the City authorities. In most cases the Civic Society has retained until the present the right to be consulted about the management of these parks. Two notable parks in this gift were [[Kings Norton|Kings Norton Park]] (25\u00bd acres in October 1920) and Highbury Park (42 acres in 1923).\n\nFrom its earliest days the Society has taken a prominent role in advising on and lobbying for improvements to the physical development of the city. This has progressed from 1919 when it lobbied for improvements to the (then) village of [[Northfield, West Midlands|Northfield]] right up to the present. Often, the Society has commissioned its own plans for developments either at the request of the City Council or on its own initiative. In some cases, such as the refurbishment of the [[Chamberlain Memorial, Birmingham|Chamberlain Memorial Fountain]] in 1978 and the creation of formal gardens in some city parks, it has provided the funding needed to bring about the developments in question.\n\nThe Society has also taken a number of publishing initiatives. The first of these in 1919 was an illustrated pamphlet on the right use of the City-owned portion of the [[Lickey Hills]], followed by a Guide to [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]], containing a selection of articles and a picture map of the whole park. The Society\u2019s most recent publication is its Heritage Buildings Guide, published in 2003 with a distribution of over 500,000 to date.\n\nThe cultural life of the city has also benefited from the Society's attentions. On its recommendation, the City Council set up an Advisory Art Committee in 1922; it played a critical role in saving the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Repertory Theatre]] from closure in 1924, and again in 1934&ndash;35. The link with the Repertory Theatre continues through ex officio membership of the Sir Barry Jackson Trust which holds the shares of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Ltd. The Centenary Concert for [[Birmingham Town Hall]] in 1934 was organised in the manner and form suggested by the Society jointly with the [[City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra|City of Birmingham Orchestra]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the Society played a pivotal role in saving [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' [[stained glass window]]s in [[St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham|Birmingham Cathedral]] from exposure to bomb damage.<ref name=BCS /> The Society had them removed and later reinstalled, whilst during the interim, most of the other windows were blown out by heavy bombing. It has worked successfully with the City Council in organising major events; in the 1920s it organised the city's [[Armistice Day]] commemorations and more recently this involved being the Council's principal partner in celebrating the bi-centenary of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and the 80th Birthday of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Society has played a leading role in preserving the city's statues, especially in the 1950s when many were in danger of being scrapped. Subjects that have been preserved in total or in part (the head being cast as a bust) by the action of the Society are [[Queen Victoria]]'s statue, which was cast in bronze and placed upon a new plinth paid for by the Society for the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951; the busts of [[Josiah Mason]]; [[George Dawson (preacher)|George Dawson]] and [[John Skirrow Wright]]. More recently the Society has been involved in raising half of the \u00a330,000 needed for the restoration of the [[Joseph Sturge memorial]] at [[Five Ways, Birmingham|Five Ways]] and initiated the process for the relocation and restoration of the [[King Edward VII Memorial]], which is now in [[Centenary Square]].\n \n[[File:Burne-Jones blue plaque.jpg|left|thumb|BCS [[blue plaque]] on [[Bennetts Hill]], marking the birthplace of [[Edward Burne-Jones]]]]\n\nWithin the wider community, the Society has taken a number of significant initiatives. It played a key role in establishing the Consultative Committee (later the Birmingham Council for Community Associations), to foster the development of local community associations and the building of community halls. Currently, it runs two programmes aimed at promoting active citizenship among young people, noting in particular the growing ethnic diversity of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/citizenship |title=Birmingham Civic Society: Citizenship|accessdate= 29 November 2011}}</ref> The first rewards children who have contributed directly to the improvement of their own local environments. The second involves 1,000 children aged 11 to 14 projecting their lives forward by 20 years, and proposing plans for developments they consider most important for their lives and for those of their children.\n\nThe Society operates the city's [[blue plaque]] scheme, normally erecting two each year to former [[List of famous residents of Birmingham, England|eminent citizens]]. As of 2017, there are 106 plaques around the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/organisations/birmingham_civic_society |title=Birmingham Civic Society plaques list |accessdate=18 February 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the Society adopted a new constitution retaining the spirit of its original objectives, but reflecting the current needs and aspirations of the city and in 2008 the society became the first civic society in the United Kingdom to receive a grant of arms which included a coat of arms and Crest for the sole use of the society and its Officers and a badge to be worn by members.\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Society makes a number of awards each year in recognition of contributions to the city.

The first President of the Society, the [[Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth|Earl of Plymouth]], addressed the assembled Aldermen, Councillors, Architects and other city worthies at that first meeting. He stated the aims of the Society, which were:<ref name=BCS>{{cite web|url=http://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/our-history|title=Birmingham Civic Society: Our history|accessdate=29 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701142842/http://birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/our-history|archivedate=1 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|to bring public interest to bear upon all proposals put forward by public bodies and private owners for building, upon the laying out of open spaces and parks, and generally upon all matters concerned with the outward amenities of the city and district. It will insist that taste is a thing that matters, and if any offence against taste is challenged at the outset, great good will be done, and converting of mean and unlovely parts of the City will gradually follow.}}\n\n[[Sir Gilbert Barling]] [[Baronet|Bt]] [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] was the Society's first Chairman and [[William Haywood (architect)|William Haywood]] was the first Secretary. Its principal objectives were the stimulation of historical interest in the city, the preservation of buildings and monuments of historic worth, the prevention of vandalism and the promotion of a sense of beauty and civic pride in the lives of citizens.\n\n[[Image:Kings norton park.jpg|left|thumb|Kings Norton Park - a gift from the Society to the City of Birmingham]]\n\nImmediately upon its foundation the Society received from an anonymous trust the sum of \u00a315,000 (equivalent to around \u00a3596,000 in 2016) to buy land for open spaces, the land later to be vested in the Birmingham Corporation. As a result, several areas of land were purchased, transformed into parks and handed over to the City authorities. In most cases the Civic Society has retained until the present the right to be consulted about the management of these parks. Two notable parks in this gift were [[Kings Norton|Kings Norton Park]] (25\u00bd acres in October 1920) and Highbury Park (42 acres in 1923).\n\nFrom its earliest days the Society has taken a prominent role in advising on and lobbying for improvements to the physical development of the city. This has progressed from 1919 when it lobbied for improvements to the (then) village of [[Northfield, West Midlands|Northfield]] right up to the present. Often, the Society has commissioned its own plans for developments either at the request of the City Council or on its own initiative. In some cases, such as the refurbishment of the [[Chamberlain Memorial, Birmingham|Chamberlain Memorial Fountain]] in 1978 and the creation of formal gardens in some city parks, it has provided the funding needed to bring about the developments in question.\n\nThe Society has also taken a number of publishing initiatives. The first of these in 1919 was an illustrated pamphlet on the right use of the City-owned portion of the [[Lickey Hills]], followed by a Guide to [[Sutton Park, West Midlands|Sutton Park]], containing a selection of articles and a picture map of the whole park. The Society\u2019s most recent publication is its Heritage Buildings Guide, published in 2003 with a distribution of over 500,000 to date.\n\nThe cultural life of the city has also benefited from the Society's attentions. On its recommendation, the City Council set up an Advisory Art Committee in 1922; it played a critical role in saving the [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre|Repertory Theatre]] from closure in 1924, and again in 1934&ndash;35. The link with the Repertory Theatre continues through ex officio membership of the Sir Barry Jackson Trust which holds the shares of the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Ltd. The Centenary Concert for [[Birmingham Town Hall]] in 1934 was organised in the manner and form suggested by the Society jointly with the [[City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra|City of Birmingham Orchestra]].\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]] the Society played a pivotal role in saving [[Edward Burne-Jones]]' [[stained glass window]]s in [[St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham|Birmingham Cathedral]] from exposure to bomb damage.<ref name=BCS /> The Society had them removed and later reinstalled, whilst during the interim, most of the other windows were blown out by heavy bombing. It has worked successfully with the City Council in organising major events; in the 1920s it organised the city's [[Armistice Day]] commemorations and more recently this involved being the Council's principal partner in celebrating the bi-centenary of the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and the 80th Birthday of Queen Elizabeth.\n\nThe Society has played a leading role in preserving the city's statues, especially in the 1950s when many were in danger of being scrapped. Subjects that have been preserved in total or in part (the head being cast as a bust) by the action of the Society are [[Queen Victoria]]'s statue, which was cast in bronze and placed upon a new plinth paid for by the Society for the [[Festival of Britain]] in 1951; the busts of [[Josiah Mason]]; [[George Dawson (preacher)|George Dawson]] and [[John Skirrow Wright]]. More recently the Society has been involved in raising half of the \u00a330,000 needed for the restoration of the [[Joseph Sturge memorial]] at [[Five Ways, Birmingham|Five Ways]] and initiated the process for the relocation and restoration of the [[King Edward VII Memorial]], which is now in [[Centenary Square]].\n \n[[File:Burne-Jones blue plaque.jpg|left|thumb|BCS [[blue plaque]] on [[Bennetts Hill]], marking the birthplace of [[Edward Burne-Jones]]]]\n\nWithin the wider community, the Society has taken a number of significant initiatives. It played a key role in establishing the Consultative Committee (later the Birmingham Council for Community Associations), to foster the development of local community associations and the building of community halls. Currently, it runs two programmes aimed at promoting active citizenship among young people, noting in particular the growing ethnic diversity of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birminghamcivicsociety.org.uk/citizenship |title=Birmingham Civic Society: Citizenship|accessdate= 29 November 2011}}</ref> The first rewards children who have contributed directly to the improvement of their own local environments. The second involves 1,000 children aged 11 to 14 projecting their lives forward by 20 years, and proposing plans for developments they consider most important for their lives and for those of their children.\n\nThe Society operates the city's [[blue plaque]] scheme, normally erecting two each year to former [[List of famous residents of Birmingham, England|eminent citizens]]. As of 2017, there are 106 plaques around the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/organisations/birmingham_civic_society |title=Birmingham Civic Society plaques list |accessdate=18 February 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2005 the Society adopted a new constitution retaining the spirit of its original objectives, but reflecting the current needs and aspirations of the city and in 2008 the society became the first civic society in the United Kingdom to receive a grant of arms which included a coat of arms and Crest for the sole use of the society and its Officers and a badge to be worn by members.\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Society makes a number of awards each year in recognition of contributions to the city.
