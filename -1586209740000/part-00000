He saw action during the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the [[Second World War]], and rose to the rank of vice-admiral.\n\nBorn into the family of a shipyard worker, Yegipko and several of his brothers joined up to fight for the Soviets in the [[Russian Civil War]]. He served initially as a field telephonist, though he was wounded, twice captured by [[White movement|White]] forces, and twice escaped. He spent the rest of the war working with the [[Komsomol]] in [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]], though he was not permitted to join their ranks after a report circulated that he washed with \"perfumed\" soap. With the Soviet victory in the civil war, Yegipko was demobilised and returned to shipyard work. He reenlisted in the armed forces in 1925, serving on ships of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], and then on submarines in the [[Baltic Fleet|Baltic]] and [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]]s. In 1936 he commanded the submarine [[Soviet submarine S-117|''Shch-117'']] on a record-breaking voyage of endurance, for which he and his entire crew received honours. He then went to Spain to support the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He commanded two submarines during his time there, and though the cause ultimately failed, he was rewarded for his service with the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].\n\nYegipko commanded submarine brigades after his return to the Soviet Union, including during the [[Winter War|Soviet-Finnish War]], and after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, participated in the [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn]] in August 1941. During this time his submarine, [[Soviet submarine S-5|''S-5'']], was sunk by a mine, and Yegipko had to be rescued from the water after being blown overboard. He then became [[Military attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] to the United Kingdom and was an observer on several of the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]], including the disastrous [[Convoy PQ 17]]. The later war years were spent with the General Staff of the Armed Forces, after which he held several posts in naval education and academia, ending as head of the {{ill|Higher Naval School of Submarine Navigation|ru|\u0412\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}.

He saw action during the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], and the [[Second World War]], and rose to the rank of vice-admiral.\n\nBorn into the family of a shipyard worker, Yegipko and several of his brothers joined up to fight for the Soviets in the [[Russian Civil War]]. He served initially as a field telephonist, though he was wounded, twice captured by [[White movement|White]] forces, and twice escaped. He spent the rest of the war working with the [[Komsomol]] in [[Mykolaiv|Nikolaev]], though he was not permitted to join their ranks after a report circulated that he washed with \"perfumed\" soap. With the Soviet victory in the civil war, Yegipko was demobilised and returned to shipyard work. He reenlisted in the armed forces in 1925, serving on ships of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], and then on submarines in the [[Baltic Fleet|Baltic]] and [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]]s. In 1936 he commanded the submarine [[Soviet submarine S-117|''Shch-117'']] on a record-breaking voyage of endurance, for which he and his entire crew received honours. He then went to Spain to support the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican faction]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He commanded two submarines during his time there, and though the cause ultimately failed, he was rewarded for his service with the title of [[Hero of the Soviet Union]].\n\nYegipko commanded submarine brigades after his return to the Soviet Union, including during the [[Winter War|Soviet-Finnish War]], and after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941, participated in the [[Soviet evacuation of Tallinn]] in August 1941. During this time his submarine, [[Soviet submarine S-5|''S-5'']], was sunk by a mine, and Yegipko had to be rescued from the water after being blown overboard. He then became [[Military attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] to the United Kingdom and was an observer on several of the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Arctic convoys]], including the disastrous [[Convoy PQ 17]]. The later war years were spent with the General Staff of the Armed Forces, after which he held several posts in naval education and academia, ending as head of the {{ill|Higher Naval School of Submarine Navigation|ru|\u0412\u044b\u0441\u0448\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e-\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0443\u0447\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}.

{"title_page": "Colonization of Angola", "text_new": "{{History of Angola}}\n\nThe '''[[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony of Angola]]''' was founded in 1407 with the arrival of [[Capitan Diogo Cao]]. Paulo Dias de Novais, the second Navy commando, came to Angola after Diogo Cao with a hundred families of colonists and four hundred soldiers. Luanda was granted the status of city in 1605. The fortified Portuguese towns were Luanda (established in 1407 with 400 Portuguese settlers) and [[Benguela]].\n\n==History==\nThe Portuguese, [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] secured a grant allowing him to colonize what is now Angola. In exchange for agreeing to raise private funds to finance his expedition, bring Portuguese colonists and build forts in the country, the crown gave him rights to conquer and rule the sections south of the [[Kwanza River]] \n\nTo the south of the [[Kingdom of the Kongo]], around the river Kwanza, there were various important states, of which the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] - located in the highlands between the Kwanza and Lukala Rivers - ruled by the Samara (Queen), was the most significant.\n\nDias de Novais arrived in Angola with an armed force and more [[Jesuit]] priests. Originally he planned to offer his small force as a mercenary reinforcement to Ndongo and to Kongo for their various wars. After indifferent success, a Portuguese who had long resided in Kongo, Francisco Barbuda, persuaded the king of Ndongo that Portugal intended to take his country over. Acting on this intelligence, the king ordered the Portuguese to be killed and expelled. \n\n===War===\nIn 1579 therefore, Ndongo made a sudden and devastating war on the Portuguese (and their many servants and slaves, many of whom were from Kongo) and drove them from Ndongo back to a few holdings in the region around [[Luanda]]. The Portuguese were aided in their defense by Kongo, whose king [[\u00c1lvaro I]], sent a large army in his support and to attack Ndongo in revenge for the slaughter of Kongo slaves. Although Kongo's army was defeated trying to cross the Bengo River and ran out of supplies, Dias de Novais managed to hold on to Luanda and the small fort of Nzele on the Kwanza River.\n\n===Further expansion===\nFrom 1575 to 1589 when he died, Dias de Novais sought to recover and expand Portuguese possessions in the Kwanza Valley. He did so largely by making alliances with local rulers who were disaffected with Ndongo rule, notably the ruler ([[soba]]) of Muxima. In this effort, Portuguese managed to take over the province of [[Ilamba]] located between the Kwanza and Bengo Rivers, and in a hard-fought battle in 1582, founded the post at Massangano at the confluence of the Kwanza and Lucala Rivers. Emboldened by victories over Ndongo armies in 1583 and 1585, Dias de Novais' lieutenant Luis Serr\u00e3o, who took over the colony following Dias de Novais' death in 1589 led an attack on Ndongo's capital at [[Kabasa]]. This attack, however, was a spectacular failure, as Ndongo, allied with its neighbor [[Matamba]] crushed the Portuguese army and drove it back to Massangano.\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe following period was a stalemate, capped by a peace agreement in 1599. Portuguese governors in the interim, finding themselves too weak to attack Ndongo, were content with engaging in political wrangling with the kingdom and with seeking opportunities to use its own political conflicts to their advantage.\n\n==Philip of Spain==\n[[Philip III of Spain|King Philip]], disappointed with the revenue generated from taxing trade, sent Manuel Cerveira Pereira to Benguela in 1610 to take control of the copper in inner Angola.

The increased food production per unit of land supported higher population density and more city-like activities. In his book, ''Cities and Economic Development'', [[Paul Bairoch]] takes up this position in his argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities can form.<ref>Bassett, California</ref>\n\n[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Mohenjo-daro]], a [[World Heritage site]] that was part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]]]\n[[File:IVC Map.png|thumb|right|Extent and major sites of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] of ancient India]]\n[[File:Ur from the Air.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph shows the remains of the [[Sumer]]ian city [[Ur]], near [[Nasiriyah]], Iraq.]]\n\nAccording to [[Vere Gordon Childe]], for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population.<ref>{{Harv |Pacione|2001| p=16}}</ref> Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: \"Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre\".<ref name=\"Bairoch 1988 13\">{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| p=13}}</ref> Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that \"...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required. When the cost of transport is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometres&nbsp;...\".<ref name=\"Bairoch 1988 13\"/> Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of [[Great Britain]]. The urban theorist [[Jane Jacobs]] suggests that city formation preceded the birth of agriculture, but this view is not widely accepted.<ref name=\"Jacobs 1969 23\">{{Harv |Jacobs|1969| p=23}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''City Economics'', Brendan O'Flaherty asserts \"Cities could persist\u2014as they have for thousands of years\u2014only if their advantages offset the disadvantages\" <ref>{{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=12}}</ref>. O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as [[increasing returns to scale]] and [[economies of scale]], which are concepts usually associated with [[business]]es. Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well. Increasing returns to scale occurs when \"doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost\".<ref>{{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| pp=572\u2013573}}</ref> \n\nSimilarly, \"Are Cities Dying?\", a paper by Harvard economist [[Edward Glaeser|Edward L. Glaeser]], delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people and ideas. Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if a city is doubled in size, workers get a ten percent increase in earnings. Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in. The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city. They do gain other benefits from living in cities, though.{{which|date=February 2014}}\n\n=== Childe\u2019s ten criteria ===\n{{Main|Urban revolution}}\n\nThe first true towns are sometimes considered large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power were centralized.

At the turn of the century, the \"[[Garden city movement|garden city]]\" model became the icon of a self-contained, comprehensively designed, residential and commercial settlement. Professional [[urban planner]]s appeared in large numbers, not only to design cities, but to provide technical expertise to their administration.\n\n[[Cities in the great depression]] of the 1930s, especially those with a base in heavy industry, were hard hit by [[unemployment]].

However, manufacturing employment was in relative decline. Barry Bluestone noted that manufacturing represented a decreasing proportion of the U.S. labour force, from 26.2 per cent in 1973 to 22.1 per cent in 1980. Studies in Canada have likewise shown that manufacturing employment was only in relative decline during these years. Yet mills and factories did close, and towns and cities lost their industries.

The benefits of dense settlement included reduced transport costs, exchange of ideas, sharing of natural resources, large local markets, and in some cases amenities such as [[running water]] and [[sewage]] disposal. Possible costs would include higher rate of crime, higher mortality rates, higher cost of living, worse pollution, traffic and high commuting times. Cities grow when the benefits of proximity between people and firms are higher than the cost.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck after the first excavations by James Mellaart and his team..jpg|thumb|Excavated foundations of [[\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck]], an Anatolian town dated to 7000 BC.]]\nThere is not enough [[evidence]] to assert what conditions gave rise to the first cities. Some theorists have speculated on what they consider suitable pre-conditions and basic mechanisms that might have been important driving forces.\n\nThe conventional view holds that cities first formed after the [[Neolithic revolution]]. The Neolithic revolution brought agriculture, which made denser human populations possible, thereby supporting city development.<ref>{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| pp=3\u20134}}</ref> Whether farming immigrants replaced foragers or foragers began farming is not clear. The increased food production per unit of land supported higher population density and more city-like activities. In his book, ''Cities and Economic Development'', [[Paul Bairoch]] takes up this position in his argument that agricultural activity appears necessary before true cities can form.<ref>Bassett, California</ref>\n\n[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Mohenjo-daro]], a [[World Heritage site]] that was part of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]]]\n[[File:IVC Map.png|thumb|right|Extent and major sites of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] of ancient India]]\n[[File:Ur from the Air.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph shows the remains of the [[Sumer]]ian city [[Ur]], near [[Nasiriyah]], Iraq.]]\n\nAccording to [[Vere Gordon Childe]], for a settlement to qualify as a city, it must have enough surplus of raw materials to support trade and a relatively large population.<ref>{{Harv |Pacione|2001| p=16}}</ref> Bairoch points out that, due to sparse population densities that would have persisted in pre-Neolithic, hunter-gatherer societies, the amount of land that would be required to produce enough food for subsistence and trade for a large population would make it impossible to control the flow of trade. To illustrate this point, Bairoch offers an example: \"Western Europe during the pre-Neolithic, [where] the density must have been less than 0.1 person per square kilometre\".<ref name=\"Bairoch 1988 13\">{{Harv |Bairoch|1988| p=13}}</ref> Using this population density as a base for calculation, and allotting 10% of food towards surplus for trade and assuming that city dwellers do no farming, he calculates that \"...to maintain a city with a population of 1,000, and without taking the cost of transport into account, an area of 100,000 square kilometres would have been required. When the cost of transport is taken into account, the figure rises to 200,000 square kilometres&nbsp;...\".<ref name=\"Bairoch 1988 13\"/> Bairoch noted that this is roughly the size of [[Great Britain]]. The urban theorist [[Jane Jacobs]] suggests that city formation preceded the birth of agriculture, but this view is not widely accepted.<ref name=\"Jacobs 1969 23\">{{Harv |Jacobs|1969| p=23}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''City Economics'', Brendan O'Flaherty asserts \"Cities could persist\u2014as they have for thousands of years\u2014only if their advantages offset the disadvantages\" <ref>{{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| p=12}}</ref>. O'Flaherty illustrates two similar attracting advantages known as [[increasing returns to scale]] and [[economies of scale]], which are concepts usually associated with [[business]]es. Their applications are seen in more basic economic systems as well. Increasing returns to scale occurs when \"doubling all inputs more than doubles the output [and] an activity has economies of scale if doubling output less than doubles cost\".<ref>{{Harv |O'Flaherty|2005| pp=572\u2013573}}</ref> \n\nSimilarly, \"Are Cities Dying?\", a paper by Harvard economist [[Edward Glaeser|Edward L. Glaeser]], delves into similar reasons for city formation: reduced transport costs for goods, people and ideas. Discussing the benefits of proximity, Glaeser claims that if a city is doubled in size, workers get a ten percent increase in earnings. Glaeser furthers his argument by stating that bigger cities do not pay more for equal productivity than in a smaller city, so it is reasonable to assume that workers become more productive if they move to a city twice the size as they initially worked in. The workers do not benefit much from the ten percent wage increase, because it is recycled back into the higher cost of living in a larger city. They do gain other benefits from living in cities, though.{{which|date=February 2014}}\n\n=== Childe\u2019s ten criteria ===\n{{Main|Urban revolution}}\n\nThe first true towns are sometimes considered large settlements where the inhabitants were no longer simply farmers of the surrounding area, but began to take on specialized occupations, and where trade, food storage and power were centralized.

Excavations at early urban sites show that some cities were sparsely populated political capitals, others were trade centers, and still other cities had a primarily religious focus. Some cities had large dense populations, whereas others carried out urban activities in the realms of politics or religion without having large associated populations.

According to Roderick and Susan McIntosh, Jenn\u00e9-Jeno did not fit into traditional Western conceptions of urbanity as it lacked monumental architecture and a distinctive elite social class, but it should indeed be considered a city based on a functional redefinition of urban development. In particular, Jenn\u00e9-Jeno featured settlement mounds arranged according to a horizontal, rather than vertical, power hierarchy, and served as a center of specialized production and exhibited functional interdependence with the surrounding hinterland.<ref>McIntosh, Roderic J., McIntosh, Susan Keech. \"Early Urban Configurations on the Middle Niger: Clustered Cities and Landscapes of Power,\" Chapter 5.</ref> Archaeological evidence from Jenn\u00e9-Jeno, specifically the presence of non-West African glass beads dated from the third century BC to the fourth century AD, indicates that pre-Arabic trade contacts probably existed between Jenn\u00e9-Jeno and North Africa.<ref name=Magnavita>{{cite journal|last=Magnavita|first=Sonja|title=Initial Encounters: Seeking traces of ancient trade connections between West Africa and the wider world|url=http://afriques.revues.org/1145?lang=en|work=Afriques|year=2013|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}</ref> Additionally, other early urban centers in sub-Saharan Africa, dated to around 500 AD, include Awdaghust, Kumbi-Saleh the ancient capital of Ghana, and Maranda a center located on a trade rout between Egypt and Gao.<ref>''[http://markuswiener.com/book_reviews.html?products_id=93&products_name=History%20of%20African%20Cities%20South%20of%20the%20Sahara History of African Cities South of the Sahara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124191535/http://markuswiener.com/book_reviews.html?products_id=93&products_name=History%20of%20African%20Cities%20South%20of%20the%20Sahara |date=2008-01-24 }}'' By Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch. 2005. {{ISBN|1-55876-303-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Americas ===\n[[File:Teotihuac\u00e1n-5973.JPG|thumb|right|The Avenue of the Dead in [[Teotihuacan]] originates with the [[Pyramid of the Moon]], forming the basis of the city grid.<ref name=MillonKaplan />]]\n\nIn the [[Pre-Columbian era|ancient Americas]], early [[Mesoamerican architecture|urban traditions]] developed in the [[Andes]] and [[Mesoamerica]].

City residence brought freedom from customary rural obligations to lord and community: ''\"[[Stadtluft macht frei]]\"'' (\"City air makes you free\") was a saying in Germany. In [[Continental Europe]] cities with a legislature of their own were not unheard of, the laws for towns as a rule other than for the countryside, the lord of a town often being another than for surrounding land. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], some cities had no other lord than the emperor.

The streets within the Bastide city were likewise regularly placed, intended to connect logically to each other, to the central market square, and to the town gates.

However, manufacturing employment was in relative decline. Barry Bluestone noted that manufacturing represented a decreasing proportion of the U.S. labour force, from 26.2 per cent in 1973 to 22.1 per cent in 1980. Studies in Canada have likewise shown that manufacturing employment was only in relative decline during these years. Yet mills and factories did close, and towns and cities lost their industries.
