The main architectural motif of the interior is the so-called eastern wall (Mizrah) and the cupboard. The latter is a party-building with double Corinthian columns. The semicircular cab has the following inscription: \"Father, King, open the gates of heaven to our prayers.\" (Psalm 113: 3). The lake is surrounded by a large arcade with lined ornamentation, which integrates the lake cabin with the ornate circular window, bridging the columns in a semicircle. The wall's curve has a lion detailing with text reading: \"Praise the Eternal Name from Sunrise to Sunset.\" (Psalm 113: 3).\n\nThe synagogue, together with other religious buildings in its vicinity, is still used by the local Jewish community.\n\n== Sources ==\n* (szerk.)
