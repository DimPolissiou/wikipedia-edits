He appears for the first time in \"Part II\" of the manga and the ''Shippuden'' anime adaptation, as a background character. He, along with its first leader [[Hashirama Senju]], is one of the co-founders of {{nihongo4|Konohagakure|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc|Konohagakure no Sato|lead=yes}} village from the ninja world . Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named [[Obito Uchiha]] as his agent. He transplants his Eye Technique {{nihongo|Rinnegan|\u8f2a\u5efb\u773c||lit. \"[[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] Eye\"}} eye power into a child named [[Nagato (Naruto)|Nagato]], the leader of the terrorist organization [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]], to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named [[Kabuto Yakushi]] reanimates the real Madara who becomes the main antagonist during the Fourth Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, including a ''Boruto'' feature film. Many  [[List of Naruto video games|''Naruto'' video games]] have featured him as a [[playable character]].\n\nKishimoto created the character to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face the series' protagonist, [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. This confrontation would be different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's likeness, including keychains, [[plush doll]]s, and figurines. In the Japanese anime, [[Naoya Uchida]] voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, [[Neil Kaplan]] provides Madara's voice with [[Xander Mobus]] voicing him as a child. Critics have commented on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for how integral his story is to the series' scenario.\n\n==Creation and design==\nMadara originated from [[Masashi Kishimoto]]'s desire to elaborate on the ending to the [[manga]] series ''[[Naruto]]''. Once the series began its second part, simply referred to as \"Part II\" in the manga and ''Shippuden'' in the [[anime]], Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. According to Kishimoto, Naruto and his group were weak as children in the first part and he wanted to make them stronger in the second part. This is the reason he introduced the Akatsuki and in turn Madara as their enemies.<ref name=\"Madara002\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

Naruto, truly forgave his enemy, instead of having the protagonist kill them, which Kishimoto liked but no shonen manga truly followed.<ref name=\"Madara002\"/> Kishimoto found the idea of the two characters interacting and settling their differences more interesting and challenging, rather than killing them. So from the Nagato battle onwards, he decided to introduce the resurrected Madara to have someone to beat. According to Kishimoto, this was one of the reasons why he introduced Edo-Madara into the storyline. But he confessed this was complicated at first. It ended up with confusion about the difference between the two characters.<ref name=\"Madara002\"/>\n\nJapanese voice actor [[Naoya Uchida]] enjoyed voicing Madara's character, most notably in his final recording where he sent regards to fellow actor [[Kazuhiko Inoue]] (Kakashi Hatake) and [[Wataru Takagi]] (Obito Uchiha.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Naoya Uchida|last=Uchida Naoya|first=Naoya |author-link=Naoya Uchida|user=nao1953 |number=750587936744337408|date=July 6, 2016 |title=\u672c\u65e5\u300c\u3046\u3061\u306f\u30de\u30c0\u30e9\u300d \u6700\u7d42\u53ce\u9332 \u3055\u3088\u306a\u3089&\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046 \u67f1\u9593\u5f79\u83c5\u751f\u3055\u3093\u3068 \u30ab\u30ab\u30b7\u3001\u30aa\u30d3\u30c8\u3068\u3082\u266a( \u00b4\u25bd\uff40|language=Japanese|access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref> [[Neil Kaplan]] first voiced Madara in the video game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 3]]''.

He appears for the first time in \"Part II\" of the manga and the ''Shippuden'' anime adaptation, as a background character. He, along with its first leader [[Hashirama Senju]], is one of the co-founders of {{nihongo4|Konohagakure|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc|Konohagakure no Sato|lead=yes}} village from the ninja world . Their power conflict over how to run the village, as well as the long-term feud between clans, leads to Madara's death. However, it is revealed later that Madara had used a man named [[Obito Uchiha]] as his agent. He transplants his Eye Technique {{nihongo|Rinnegan|\u8f2a\u5efb\u773c||lit. \"[[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra]] Eye\"}} eye power into a child named [[Nagato (Naruto)|Nagato]], the leader of the terrorist organization [[List of Naruto characters#Akatsuki|Akatsuki]], to be preserved for his eventual revival years later. During most of the series, Obito uses Madara's name until a criminal named [[Kabuto Yakushi]] reanimates the real Madara who becomes the main antagonist during the Fourth Shinobi World War storyline. Madara has appeared in several pieces of ''Naruto'' media, including a ''Boruto'' feature film. Many  [[List of Naruto video games|''Naruto'' video games]] have featured him as a [[playable character]].\n\nKishimoto created the character to provide a strong villain in the series' final arc who would face the series' protagonist, [[Naruto Uzumaki]]. This confrontation would be different from that with previous enemies and result in more of a focus on fight scenes. Merchandise has been released in Madara's likeness, including keychains, [[plush doll]]s, and figurines. In the Japanese anime, [[Naoya Uchida]] voices Madara, while Go Inoue voices him as a child. In the English version, [[Neil Kaplan]] provides Madara's voice with [[Xander Mobus]] voicing him as a child. Critics have commented on his role as an antagonist in the series; some have placed him on top all-time anime villains lists, while others have criticized his effectiveness. Nevertheless, Madara's background was well-received for how integral his story is to the series' scenario.\n\n==Creation and design==\nMadara originated from [[Masashi Kishimoto]]'s desire to elaborate on the ending to the [[manga]] series ''[[Naruto]]''. Once the series began its second part, simply referred to as \"Part II\" in the manga and ''Shippuden'' in the [[anime]], Kishimoto felt the need to create a story arc that would emphasize the tragedy of wars, leading to the final arc which would include a war. According to Kishimoto, Naruto and his group were weak as children in the first part and he wanted to make them stronger in the second part. This is the reason he introduced the Akatsuki and in turn Madara as their enemies.<ref name=\"Madara002\">{{Cite AV media |title=\u6f2b\u9053\u30b3\u30d0\u30e4\u30b7\u7b2c13\u53f7\u300cNARUTO\u5b8c\u7d50\uff01\u5cb8\u672c\u6589\u53f2SP\u300d |date=December 13, 2014 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Fuji Television]] |trans-title=Kobayashi No. 13 'Completion of Naruto!

Naruto, truly forgave his enemy, instead of having the protagonist kill them, which Kishimoto liked but no shonen manga truly followed.<ref name=\"Madara002\"/> Kishimoto found the idea of the two characters interacting and settling their differences more interesting and challenging, rather than killing them. So from the Nagato battle onwards, he decided to introduce the resurrected Madara to have someone to beat.

On the Australian leg, \"Your Own Special Way\" was performed for the first time since 1977. The 1987 U.S. and European legs of the tour saw the \"Supper's Ready\" section of the \"In the Cage\" medley dropped in favour of \"Afterglow\"*+. \"In Too Deep\" and \"Follow You Follow Me\" were dropped from set.\n\nNew songs \"Throwing It All Away\", and \"Land of Confusion\" contained several high notes that were vocally challenging for Collins to perform every night. To prevent potential damage to his voice, the songs were performed in a lower key from their original studio recordings as a safety measure after the initial North American leg of the tour. To this end however, the song \"Invisible Touch\" was placed in the set directly after the vocal stretching \"Apocalypse in 9/8\" (dropped for this very reason) and was never performed live in its original key of F on this or any tour thereafter.<ref name=ITT>{{cite AV media | people = [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] | title = Genesis: Live at Wembley Stadium | medium = DVD | publisher = Warner Strat.

General areas of research include the technology and structure of artistic and historic works. In other words, the materials and techniques from which cultural, artistic and historic objects are made. There are three broad categories of conservation science with respect to cultural heritage:  1) understanding the materials and techniques used by artists, 2) study of the causes of deterioration, and 3) improving methods/techniques and materials for examination and treatment. Conservation science includes aspects of [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[engineering]], as well as [[art history]] and [[anthropology]].<ref name=\"race\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/natureofconserva0000ward|title=The Nature of Conservation: A Race Against Time|last=Ward|first=Phillip|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|year=1986|isbn=0-941103-00-5|location=Marina del Rey, CA|url-access=registration}}</ref> Institutions such as the [[Getty Conservation Institute]] specialize in publishing and disseminating information relating to both tools used for and outcomes of conservation science research, as well as recent discoveries in the field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/?hp-2nd-level-nav=1|title=Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) {{!}} The Getty|website=Getty Conservation Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\nPrior to thorough scientific analysis, a detailed visual assessment of the object, heritage site, or artwork is necessary in addition to gathering all relevant historic and current documentation.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6HAoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR7&dq=articles+on+object+conservation+science#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Conservation Science: Heritage Materials|last=May|first=Eric|last2=Jones|first2=Mark|date=2007-10-31|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|isbn=978-1-84755-762-9|language=en}}</ref> Diagnosing the current state in a non-invasive way allows both conservators and [[conservation scientist]]s to determine exactly what further analysis would be required and whether the subject of the study will be able to withstand more rigorous examination.

The deterioration of paper may be the result of pests such as vermin, insects, and microbes, or by theft, fire, and flood. More specifically, paper deteriorates from two mechanisms that alter its hue and weaken its fibers: '''acid-catalyzed hydrolysis''' and '''oxidation.'''<ref name=\"May and Jones\"/> Treatment for paper includes [[deacidification]], bleaching and washing.\n\nSafe environments for the storage and display of paper artifacts include having a [[relative humidity]] (RH) of below 65% and above 40% and an ideal temperature between 18-20\u00b0C (64-68\u00b0F).<ref name=\"May and Jones\"/>\n\n=== Textiles ===\n[[Textiles]] are woven fabrics or cloth that represent culture, material legacy of international trade, social history, agricultural development, artistic trends, and technological progress.<ref name=\"May and Jones\"/> There are four main material sources: '''animal''', '''plant''', '''mineral''', and '''synthetic.'''<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile. Retrieved 15 December 2019</ref> Deterioration of textiles can be caused by exposure to [[ultraviolet]] (UV) or [[infrared light]] (IR), incorrect [[relative humidity]] and temperature, pests, pollutants, and physical forces such as fire and water.<ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/textiles-environment.html. Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref> Textiles may be treated in a number of ways including vacuuming, wet cleaning, dry cleaning, steaming, and ironing. To preserve the integrity of textiles, storage and display environments result in as little light exposure as possible. Safe environments for textiles include those with a temperature of around 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) and relative humidity of 50%.<ref>Fahey, Mary (2007). \u201cThe Care and Preservation of Antique Textiles and Costumes.\u201d Henry Ford Museum.</ref>\n\n=== Leather ===\n[[Leather]] is a manufactured product made from the skin of animals.  Leather can deteriorate from [[red rot]], excessive dryness resulting in cracking and breakage, fading from exposure to light, mold resulting in odors, stains, and distortion, and insects and dust, both of which can cause holes and abrasions. [[Corrosion]] can also occur when leather comes into contact with metals.<ref name=\"Dirksen\">Dirksen, V., 1997. The Degredation and Conservation of Leather. Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies, 3, pp.6\u201310. DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/jcms.3972</ref> There are two primary methods for leather conservation: application of dressings or treatments to prolong the life of the leather and improving the means by which leather is stored. The second method is a preventive approach while the first, an older method, is an interventive approach.<ref name=\"Dirksen\"/> Leather artifacts are best stored with relative humidity between 45% to 55% and a temperature of 18-20\u00b0C (64-68\u00b0F).<ref name=\"Dirksen\"/>\n\n=== Glass and ceramics ===\n[[Glass]] and [[ceramic]]s can be maintained for much longer periods of time and are two of the most durable materials. The biggest risk to glass and ceramics is breakage, however improper display and storage can lead to stains and discoloration. Ceramics can become stained from inappropriate cleaning and repair while porous or cracked ceramics can develop stains from being soaked in water during cleaning. Increased temperatures can cause darkening of already existing stains and can lead to cracks. Glass can become damaged from 'weeping glass' wherein droplets of moisture form on glass surfaces. This can lead to a leaching out of unstable components that produce an [[Alkali|alkaline solution]]. If allowed to remain on the glass for an extended period of time, this solution can produce fine cracks known as [[crizzling]].<ref name=\"Deck\">Deck, Clara. (2016). ''The Care and Preservation of Glass and Ceramics.'' The Henry Ford: Dearborn, MI.</ref> Careful handling and storage is the surest means to preventing damage to glass and ceramics. The below table displays recommended storage conditions for damaged and unstable objects:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n| Weeping glass|| Temperature and relative humidity|| 18-21\u00b0C (65-70\u00b0F), 40% \n|-\n| Crizzling glass|| Temperature and relative humidity|| 18-21\u00b0C (65-70\u00b0F), 55% \n|-\n| Archaeological ceramics|| Temperature and relative humidity|| 18-21\u00b0C (65-70\u00b0F), 45% \n|}\n<ref name=\"Deck\"/>\n\n=== Metals ===\nMetals are produced from [[ores]] that are found naturally in the environment. Most metal objects are made from a combination of individual metals called [[alloys]] and exhibit different strengths and colors based on their composition. Metals and alloys commonly found in cultural objects include [[gold]], [[silver]], [[copper]], [[pewter]], [[tin]], and [[iron]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/metals |title = Metals|date = 2008-04-09}}</ref> The most common form of deterioration for metal is [[corrosion]]. Corrosion occurs when metals come into contact with water, acids, bases, salts, oils, polishes, pollutants and chemicals.<ref>https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/metals. Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref> Mechanical damage, breakage, dents, and scratches can occur from mishandling metal objects and result in damage to the metal object. Over polishing can lead to deterioration and potentially misidentification by removing plating, decoration, makers' marks, or engravings. Mechanical, electrical, and chemical interventions are often used in the treatment of metals. Appropriate storage of metal objects helps to increase their longevity; it is recommended that metal objects be stored in closed systems with well-sealed doors and drawers with relative humidity between 35 and 55%.<ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/storage-metals.html. Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Plastics ===\nPlastics experience degradation from several factors including light, [[ultraviolet radiation]], oxygen, water, heat, and pollutants. There are no international standards for the storage of plastics so it is common for museums to employ similar methods to those used to preserve paper and other organic materials. A wide range of instruments and techniques can be used in the treatment of plastics including 3-D scanning and printing technologies as a means of reproducing broken or missing parts. Recommended relative humidity for plastics is 50% along with a temperature of 18\u201320\u00b0C (64-68\u00b0F).<ref>Shashoua, Yvonne. (2014). A Safe Place: Storage Strategies for Plastics. Conservation Perspectives, The GCI Newsletter. Spring 2014.The Getty Conservation Institute.</ref>\n\n=== Stone ===\nStone objects take on many forms including sculpture, architecture, ornamental decoration, or functional pieces. Deterioration of stone depends on several factors such as the type of stone, geographical or physical location, and maintenance. Stone is subject to a number of decay mechanisms that include '''environmental''', '''mechanical''', and '''applied decay'''. [[Erosion]] from air, water, and physical touch can wear away surface texture. Carved stone should not be regularly cleaned as cleaning can cause deterioration by opening its pores as well as removing surface features such as engravings, artists' tools, and historical marks. Dirt, moss, and lichen do not usually cause decay to stone but may add to its [[patina]].<ref>The Institute of Conservation. (2011). ''Care and Conservation of Carved Stone''. Retrieved 15 December 2019 from http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-Stone.asp</ref>\n\n=== Wood ===\nWood is a [[biodegradable]], organic material that is susceptible to deterioration from both living organisms and environmental factors. Some ancient wood is recognized for its archaeological value and falls into two categories: dry and waterlogged.<ref>Macchioni N. (2014) [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-0465-2_480#howtocite Wood: Conservation and Preservation]. In: Smith C. (eds) Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology. Springer, New York, NY</ref> The recommended temperature for storage and display of wooden artifacts is 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) during the winter months and 21-24\u00b0C (70-75\u00b0F) during the summer months. The recommended relative humidity for storage and display of wooden artifacts during the winter months is 35%-45% and 55%-65% during the summer months.<ref>Deck, C. (2016). The Care and Preservation of Furniture and Wooden Objects [PDF]. Dearborn: The Henry Ford Museum.</ref> Effective cleaning of wooden artifacts includes waxing, polishing, dusting, and buffing.<ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/furniture-wooden-objects-basketry/basic-care-furniture-objects-wood.html. Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref>\n\nSee also [[conservation and restoration of wooden artifacts]].\n\n=== Paintings ===\n\nPainting materials include [[acrylic paint]], [[oil paint]], [[egg tempera]], [[lacquer]], [[Watercolor painting|water color]], and [[gouache]]. Conservation techniques for paintings include dirt and varnish removal, consolidation, structural treatments, [[Inpainting|in-painting]], in-filling, and retouching of losses.<ref>Ebert, Bettina. (2010). [https://asiarta.org/introduction-to-conservation/oil-paintings/painting-conservation-techniques/ Painting conservation techniques]. Asiarta Foundation.  Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref> It is recommended that paintings be stored with other heritage and art collections.\n\nSee also [[conservation and restoration of paintings]].\n\n== Mechanisms of deterioration ==\nConservation science studies the process by which the various mechanisms of deterioration cause changes to [[material culture]] that affect their longevity for future generations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://postalmuseumblog.si.edu/2015/04/the-10-agents-of-deterioration.html|title=The 10 Agents of Deterioration|website=National Postal Museum|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html|title=Agents of deterioration|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-14|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> These mechanisms may produce [[chemical change|chemical]], [[physical change|physical]], or biological changes and differ based on the material properties of the subject at hand.<ref name=\"aic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1|title=Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)}}</ref> A large portion of conservation science research is the study of the behavior of different materials under a range of environmental conditions.<ref name=\"Getty\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/?hp-2nd-level-nav=1|title=Getty Conservation Institute (GCI) {{!}} The Getty|website=Getty Conservation Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> One method used by scientists is to artificially age objects in order to study what conditions cause or mitigate deterioration.<ref name=\"Getty\"/> The results of these investigations informs the field on the major risk factors as well as the strategies to control and monitor environmental conditions to aid in long term preservation. Further, scientific inquiry has led to the development of more stable and long-term treatment methods and techniques for the types of damages that do occur.\n\n===Fire===\n\n[[Fire]] is caused by chemical reactions resulting in [[combustion]]. Organic material such as paper, textiles, and wood are especially susceptible to combustion.<ref name=\"Fire\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/fire.html|title=Fire|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Inorganic material, while less susceptible, may still suffer damage if exposed to fire for any period of time.<ref name=\"Fire\" /> The materials used to extinguish fires, such as chemical retardants or water, can also result in further damage to material culture.\n\n===Water===\n[[Water]] primarily causes physical changes such as warping, stains, discoloration, and other weakening to both inorganic and organic materials.<ref name=\"Water\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/water.html|title=Water|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Water can come from natural sources such as flooding, mechanical/technological failures, or human error.<ref name=\"Water\"/> Water damage to organic material may lead to the growth of other pests such as mold. In addition to the physical effects of water directly on an object or artwork, moisture in the air directly affects relative humidity which can in turn exacerbate deterioration and damage.\n\n===Light===\n[[Light]] causes cumulative and irreversible damage to light-sensitive objects.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=Museum Collection Environments|last=National Park Services|access-date= 2019-12-15}}</ref> The energy from light interacts with objects at the molecular level and can lead to both physical and chemical damage such as fading, darkening, yellowing, embrittlement, and stiffening.<ref name=\"NPS\" /> [[Ultraviolet radiation]] and [[Infrared radiation]], in addition to [[Light|visible light]], can be emitted from light sources and can also be damaging to material culture. Cultural institutions are tasked with finding the balance between needing light for patrons and guests and exposure to the collection. Any amount of light can be damaging to a variety of objects and artworks and the effects are cumulative and irreversible. Conservation science has helped establish 50 [[Lux]] as the benchmark level of light intensity that allows the human eye to operate within the full range the visible light spectrum.<ref name=\"Light\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/light.html|title=Light, ultraviolet and infrared|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> While this is a baseline for many museums, adjustments are often needed for based on specific situations. Conservation science has informed the industry on the levels of light sensitivity of common materials used in material culture and the length of time permissible before deterioration is likely to occur.<ref name=\"Light\"/> Control strategies must be considered on an item by item basis. Light, ultraviolet, and thermometers for infrared radiation are some of the tools used to detect when levels fall outside of an acceptable range.<ref name=\"Light\"/>\n\n===Incorrect relative humidity===\n[[Relative humidity]] (RH) is the measure of the humidity, or the water vapor content, in relation to the atmosphere and ranges from damp to dry.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/humidity.html|title=Incorrect relative humidity|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Material properties determine the affect that different levels of RH can have on any particular item. Organic materials like wood, paper, and leather, as well as some inorganic material like metals are susceptible to damage from incorrect RH.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=Museum Collection Environments|last=National Park Services|access-date= 2019-12-15}}</ref> Damage ranges from physical changes like cracking and warping of organic materials to chemical reactions like corrosion of metals.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\"/> Temperature has a direct effect on relative humidity: as warm air cools, relative humidity increases and as cool air warms up, relative humidity falls.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\"/> Dampness can cause the growth of mold which has its own damaging properties. Research in the field has determined the various ranges and fluctuations of incorrect humidity, the sensitivity of various objects to each one, and has helped establish guidelines for proper environmental conditions specific to the objects in question.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\"/>\n\n=== Incorrect temperature===\nMaterial properties directly determine the appropriate [[temperature]] needed to preserve that item. Incorrect temperatures, whether too high, too low, or fluctuating between the two, can cause varying levels of deterioration for objects.<ref name=\"Incorrect Temperature\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/temperature.html|title=Incorrect temperature|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Temperatures that are too high can lead to chemical and physical damage such as [[embrittlement]], cracking, fading, and disintegration. Too high temperatures can also promote biological reactions like mold growth. Temperatures that are too low can also result in physical damages such as embrittlement and cracking.<ref name=\"Incorrect Temperature\"/> Temperature fluctuations can cause materials to expand and contract rapidly which causes [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] to build up within the material and eventual deterioration over time.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=Museum Collection Environments|last=National Park Services|access-date= 2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\n===Pests===\n[[Pest (organism)|Pest]]s include microorganisms, insects, and rodents and are able to disfigure, damage, and destroy material culture.<ref name=\"Pests\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/pests.html|title=Pests|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Both organic material and inorganic material are highly susceptible. Damage can occur from pests consuming, burrowing into, and excreting on material.<ref name=\"Pests\" /> The presence of pests can be the result of other deterioration mechanisms such as incorrect temperature, incorrect relative humidity, and the presence of water. [[Fumigation]] and [[pesticide]]s may also be damaging to certain materials and requires careful consideration. Conservation science has aided in the development of thermal control methods to eradicate pests.<ref name=\"Pests\" />\n\n===Pollutants===\nPollutants consist of a wide range of compounds that can have detrimental chemical reactions with objects.<ref name=\"Pollutants\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/pollutants.html|title=Pollutants|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Pollutants can be [[gas]]es, [[aerosol]]s, [[liquid]]s, or [[solid]]s and are able to reach objects from transference from other objects, dissipation in the air, or intrinsically as part of the object's makeup. They all have the potential to cause adverse reactions with material culture.<ref name=\"Pollutants\" /> Conservation science aids in identifying both material and pollutant properties and the types of reactions that will occur. Reactions range from discoloration and stains, to [[acidification]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2019}} and structural weakening.<ref name=\"Pollutants\" /> Dust is one of the most common airborne pollutants and its presence can attract pests as well as alter the object's surface.<ref name=\"Pollutants\" /> Research in the field informs conservators on how to properly manage damage that occurs as well as means to monitor and control pollutant levels.\n\n===Physical forces===\n\nPhysical [[force]]s are any interaction with an object that changes its current state of motion. Physical forces can cause a range of damage from small cracks and [[fissure]]s to complete destruction or disintegration of material.<ref name=\"Physical Forces\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/physical-forces.html|title=Physical forces|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> The level of damage is dependent on the [[fragility]], [[brittleness]], or [[hardness]] of object's material and the magnitude of the force being inflicted. Impact, shock, vibration, pressure, and abrasion are a few examples of physical forces that can have adverse effects on material culture.<ref name=\"Physical Forces\" /> Physical forces can occur from natural disasters like earthquakes, working forces like handling, cumulative forces like gravity, or low-level forces like building vibrations.<ref name=\"Physical Forces\" /> During an object's [[risk assessment]], the material properties of the object will inform the necessary steps (i.e. building, housing, and handling) that need to take place to mitigate the effects of physical forces.\n\n===Theft and vandalism===\n[[Theft]], the removal of an asset, and [[vandalism]], the deliberate destruction or disfigurement of an asset, are directly controlled and limited by the security measures put in place at a cultural institution.<ref name=\"Theft and Vandalism\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/thieves-vandals.html|title=Thieves and vandals|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Conservation science can aid in the [[authentication]] or identification of stolen objects. In addition, the research of the field can help inform decisions as to the best course of action repair, minimize, or mitigate damage from vandalism.\n\n===Dissociation===\nDissociation is the loss of an object, its associated data, or its value due to outside influence.<ref name=\"Dissociation\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/dissociation.html|title=Dissociation|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Adherence to proper policies and procedures is the best defense against dissociation and as such, meticulous record keeping is the basis for all good practice.

The deterioration of paper may be the result of pests such as vermin, insects, and microbes, or by theft, fire, and flood. More specifically, paper deteriorates from two mechanisms that alter its hue and weaken its fibers: '''acid-catalyzed hydrolysis''' and '''oxidation.'''<ref name=\"May and Jones\"/> Treatment for paper includes [[deacidification]], bleaching and washing.\n\nSafe environments for the storage and display of paper artifacts include having a [[relative humidity]] (RH) of below 65% and above 40% and an ideal temperature between 18-20\u00b0C (64-68\u00b0F).<ref name=\"May and Jones\"/>\n\n=== Textiles ===\n[[Textiles]] are woven fabrics or cloth that represent culture, material legacy of international trade, social history, agricultural development, artistic trends, and technological progress.<ref name=\"May and Jones\"/> There are four main material sources: '''animal''', '''plant''', '''mineral''', and '''synthetic.'''<ref>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile.

Leather can deteriorate from [[red rot]], excessive dryness resulting in cracking and breakage, fading from exposure to light, mold resulting in odors, stains, and distortion, and insects and dust, both of which can cause holes and abrasions.

The biggest risk to glass and ceramics is breakage, however improper display and storage can lead to stains and discoloration. Ceramics can become stained from inappropriate cleaning and repair while porous or cracked ceramics can develop stains from being soaked in water during cleaning. Increased temperatures can cause darkening of already existing stains and can lead to cracks. Glass can become damaged from 'weeping glass' wherein droplets of moisture form on glass surfaces. This can lead to a leaching out of unstable components that produce an [[Alkali|alkaline solution]]. If allowed to remain on the glass for an extended period of time, this solution can produce fine cracks known as [[crizzling]].<ref name=\"Deck\">Deck, Clara. (2016).

Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref> Mechanical damage, breakage, dents, and scratches can occur from mishandling metal objects and result in damage to the metal object. Over polishing can lead to deterioration and potentially misidentification by removing plating, decoration, makers' marks, or engravings. Mechanical, electrical, and chemical interventions are often used in the treatment of metals. Appropriate storage of metal objects helps to increase their longevity; it is recommended that metal objects be stored in closed systems with well-sealed doors and drawers with relative humidity between 35 and 55%.<ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/storage-metals.html. Retrieved 15 December 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Plastics ===\nPlastics experience degradation from several factors including light, [[ultraviolet radiation]], oxygen, water, heat, and pollutants. There are no international standards for the storage of plastics so it is common for museums to employ similar methods to those used to preserve paper and other organic materials. A wide range of instruments and techniques can be used in the treatment of plastics including 3-D scanning and printing technologies as a means of reproducing broken or missing parts. Recommended relative humidity for plastics is 50% along with a temperature of 18\u201320\u00b0C (64-68\u00b0F).<ref>Shashoua, Yvonne. (2014). A Safe Place: Storage Strategies for Plastics. Conservation Perspectives, The GCI Newsletter. Spring 2014.The Getty Conservation Institute.</ref>\n\n=== Stone ===\nStone objects take on many forms including sculpture, architecture, ornamental decoration, or functional pieces. Deterioration of stone depends on several factors such as the type of stone, geographical or physical location, and maintenance. Stone is subject to a number of decay mechanisms that include '''environmental''', '''mechanical''', and '''applied decay'''. [[Erosion]] from air, water, and physical touch can wear away surface texture. Carved stone should not be regularly cleaned as cleaning can cause deterioration by opening its pores as well as removing surface features such as engravings, artists' tools, and historical marks. Dirt, moss, and lichen do not usually cause decay to stone but may add to its [[patina]].<ref>The Institute of Conservation. (2011). ''Care and Conservation of Carved Stone''. Retrieved 15 December 2019 from http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-Stone.asp</ref>\n\n=== Wood ===\nWood is a [[biodegradable]], organic material that is susceptible to deterioration from both living organisms and environmental factors. Some ancient wood is recognized for its archaeological value and falls into two categories: dry and waterlogged.<ref>Macchioni N. (2014) [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-0465-2_480#howtocite Wood: Conservation and Preservation]. In: Smith C. (eds) Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology. Springer, New York, NY</ref> The recommended temperature for storage and display of wooden artifacts is 21\u00b0C (70\u00b0F) during the winter months and 21-24\u00b0C (70-75\u00b0F) during the summer months. The recommended relative humidity for storage and display of wooden artifacts during the winter months is 35%-45% and 55%-65% during the summer months.<ref>Deck, C. (2016). The Care and Preservation of Furniture and Wooden Objects [PDF]. Dearborn: The Henry Ford Museum.</ref> Effective cleaning of wooden artifacts includes waxing, polishing, dusting, and buffing.<ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/care-objects/furniture-wooden-objects-basketry/basic-care-furniture-objects-wood.html.

Further, scientific inquiry has led to the development of more stable and long-term treatment methods and techniques for the types of damages that do occur.\n\n===Fire===\n\n[[Fire]] is caused by chemical reactions resulting in [[combustion]]. Organic material such as paper, textiles, and wood are especially susceptible to combustion.<ref name=\"Fire\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/fire.html|title=Fire|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Inorganic material, while less susceptible, may still suffer damage if exposed to fire for any period of time.<ref name=\"Fire\" /> The materials used to extinguish fires, such as chemical retardants or water, can also result in further damage to material culture.\n\n===Water===\n[[Water]] primarily causes physical changes such as warping, stains, discoloration, and other weakening to both inorganic and organic materials.<ref name=\"Water\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/water.html|title=Water|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Water can come from natural sources such as flooding, mechanical/technological failures, or human error.<ref name=\"Water\"/> Water damage to organic material may lead to the growth of other pests such as mold. In addition to the physical effects of water directly on an object or artwork, moisture in the air directly affects relative humidity which can in turn exacerbate deterioration and damage.\n\n===Light===\n[[Light]] causes cumulative and irreversible damage to light-sensitive objects.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=Museum Collection Environments|last=National Park Services|access-date= 2019-12-15}}</ref> The energy from light interacts with objects at the molecular level and can lead to both physical and chemical damage such as fading, darkening, yellowing, embrittlement, and stiffening.<ref name=\"NPS\" /> [[Ultraviolet radiation]] and [[Infrared radiation]], in addition to [[Light|visible light]], can be emitted from light sources and can also be damaging to material culture. Cultural institutions are tasked with finding the balance between needing light for patrons and guests and exposure to the collection. Any amount of light can be damaging to a variety of objects and artworks and the effects are cumulative and irreversible. Conservation science has helped establish 50 [[Lux]] as the benchmark level of light intensity that allows the human eye to operate within the full range the visible light spectrum.<ref name=\"Light\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/light.html|title=Light, ultraviolet and infrared|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> While this is a baseline for many museums, adjustments are often needed for based on specific situations. Conservation science has informed the industry on the levels of light sensitivity of common materials used in material culture and the length of time permissible before deterioration is likely to occur.<ref name=\"Light\"/> Control strategies must be considered on an item by item basis. Light, ultraviolet, and thermometers for infrared radiation are some of the tools used to detect when levels fall outside of an acceptable range.<ref name=\"Light\"/>\n\n===Incorrect relative humidity===\n[[Relative humidity]] (RH) is the measure of the humidity, or the water vapor content, in relation to the atmosphere and ranges from damp to dry.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/humidity.html|title=Incorrect relative humidity|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Material properties determine the affect that different levels of RH can have on any particular item. Organic materials like wood, paper, and leather, as well as some inorganic material like metals are susceptible to damage from incorrect RH.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=Museum Collection Environments|last=National Park Services|access-date= 2019-12-15}}</ref> Damage ranges from physical changes like cracking and warping of organic materials to chemical reactions like corrosion of metals.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\"/> Temperature has a direct affect on relative humidity: as warm air cools, relative humidity increases and as cool air warms up, relative humidity falls.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\"/> Dampness can cause the growth of mold which has its own damaging properties. Research in the field has determined the various ranges and fluctuations of incorrect humidity, the sensitivity of various objects to each one, and has helped establish guidelines for proper environmental conditions specific to the objects in question.<ref name=\"Relative Humidity\"/>\n\n=== Incorrect temperature===\nMaterial properties directly determine the appropriate [[temperature]] needed to preserve that item. Incorrect temperatures, whether too high, too low, or fluctuating between the two, can cause varying levels of deterioration for objects.<ref name=\"Incorrect Temperature\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/temperature.html|title=Incorrect temperature|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Temperatures that are too high can lead to chemical and physical damage such as [[embrittlement]], cracking, fading, and disintegration. Too high temperatures can also promote biological reactions like mold growth. Temperatures that are too low can also result in physical damages such as embrittlement and cracking.<ref name=\"Incorrect Temperature\"/> Temperature fluctuations can cause materials to expand and contract rapidly which causes [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] to build up within the material and eventual deterioration over time.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|title=Museum Collection Environments|last=National Park Services|access-date= 2019-12-15}}</ref>\n\n===Pests===\n[[Pest (organism)|Pest]]s include microorganisms, insects, and rodents and are able to disfigure, damage, and destroy material culture.<ref name=\"Pests\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/pests.html|title=Pests|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Both organic material and inorganic material are highly susceptible. Damage can occur from pests consuming, burrowing into, and excreting on material.<ref name=\"Pests\" /> The presence of pests can be the result of other deterioration mechanisms such as incorrect temperature, incorrect relative humidity, and the presence of water. [[Fumigation]] and [[pesticide]]s may also be damaging to certain materials and requires careful consideration. Conservation science has aided in the development of thermal control methods to eradicate pests.<ref name=\"Pests\" />\n\n===Pollutants===\nPollutants consist of a wide range of compounds that can have detrimental chemical reactions with objects.<ref name=\"Pollutants\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/pollutants.html|title=Pollutants|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Pollutants can be [[gas]]es, [[aerosol]]s, [[liquid]]s, or [[solid]]s and are able to reach objects from transference from other objects, dissipation in the air, or intrinsically as part of the object's makeup. They all have the potential to cause adverse reactions with material culture.<ref name=\"Pollutants\" /> Conservation science aids in identifying both material and pollutant properties and the types of reactions that will occur. Reactions range from discoloration and stains, to [[acidification]]{{disambiguation needed|date=December 2019}} and structural weakening.<ref name=\"Pollutants\" /> Dust is one of the most common airborne pollutants and its presence can attract pests as well as alter the object's surface.<ref name=\"Pollutants\" /> Research in the field informs conservators on how to properly manage damage that occurs as well as means to monitor and control pollutant levels.\n\n===Physical forces===\n\nPhysical [[force]]s are any interaction with an object that changes its current state of motion. Physical forces can cause a range of damage from small cracks and [[fissure]]s to complete destruction or disintegration of material.<ref name=\"Physical Forces\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/physical-forces.html|title=Physical forces|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> The level of damage is dependent on the [[fragility]], [[brittleness]], or [[hardness]] of object's material and the magnitude of the force being inflicted. Impact, shock, vibration, pressure, and abrasion are a few examples of physical forces that can have adverse effects on material culture.<ref name=\"Physical Forces\" /> Physical forces can occur from natural disasters like earthquakes, working forces like handling, cumulative forces like gravity, or low-level forces like building vibrations.<ref name=\"Physical Forces\" /> During an object's [[risk assessment]], the material properties of the object will inform the necessary steps (i.e. building, housing, and handling) that need to take place to mitigate the effects of physical forces.\n\n===Theft and vandalism===\n[[Theft]], the removal of an asset, and [[vandalism]], the deliberate destruction or disfigurement of an asset, are directly controlled and limited by the security measures put in place at a cultural institution.<ref name=\"Theft and Vandalism\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/thieves-vandals.html|title=Thieves and vandals|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Conservation science can aid in the [[authentication]] or identification of stolen objects. In addition, the research of the field can help inform decisions as to the best course of action repair, minimize, or mitigate damage from vandalism.\n\n===Dissociation===\nDissociation is the loss of an object, its associated data, or its value due to outside influence.<ref name=\"Dissociation\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration/dissociation.html|title=Dissociation|last=Institute|first=Canadian Conservation|date=2017-09-22|website=aem|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> Adherence to proper policies and procedures is the best defense against dissociation and as such, meticulous record keeping is the basis for all good practice. Conservation science aids in the authentication or identification of misplaced objects and detailed records of all past, present, and future study is necessary for the prevention of dissociation.\n\n== Methods ==\n[[File:Optical microscope for the study of paint fragments.jpg|thumb|Optical microscope used to visually study very small paint fragments (mounted in epoxy) as a means of identifying paints used by artists.]]\nThere are a variety of methods used by [[Conservation scientist (museums)|conservation scientists]] to support work in the fields of [[art conservation]], [[architectural conservation]], [[cultural heritage]], and care of [[cultural objects]] in museums and other collections. In addition to the use of specialized equipment, visual inspections are often the first step in order to look for obvious signs of damage, decay, [[Inpainting|infilling]], etc.\n\nPrior to any type of scientific analysis, detailed documentation of the initial state of the object and justification for all proposed examinations is required to avoid unnecessary or potentially damaging study and keep the amount of handling to a minimum.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conservation Skills: Judgement, Method and Decision Making|last=Caple|first=Chris|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-18881-4|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Processes such as [[Stereo microscope|stereomicroscopy]] can reveal surface features such as the weave of parchment paper, whether a print was done in [[Relief printing|relief]] or in i[[Intaglio (printmaking)|ntaglio]], and even what kind of tools an artist may have used to create their works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/collex/exhibits/under-covers/research-conservation/microscopy/|title=Microscopy - Under Covers - The University of Chicago Library|website=www.lib.uchicago.edu|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> While there are many different specialized and generic tools used for conservation science studies, some of the most common are listed below.\n\n=== Scientific equipment <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Gates|first=G.
