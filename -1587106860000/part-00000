Based on [[R. L. Stine]]'s [[Goosebumps|children's horror book series of the same name]], it follows a teenager who tries to save his town with Stine's help after all the monsters from the ''Goosebumps'' franchise begin to escape from their books, wreaking havoc in the real world. The film stars [[Jack Black]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Odeya Rush]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]], and [[Jillian Bell]].\n\nThe development of a ''Goosebumps'' feature film adaptation began in 1998, with [[Tim Burton]] attached to direct. After failing to find a script to determine which book to adapt, the project was halted. In early 2008, [[Columbia Pictures]] acquired the rights to create a ''Goosebumps''-based film, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from April to July 2014 in [[Candler Park]], [[Atlanta]].\n\n''Goosebumps'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 16, 2015, by Columbia Pictures. The film was a commercial and critical success, with praise for its humor, usage of the ''Goosebumps'' characters, and performances (especially Black's and Minnette's)<ref name=\"VarietyReview\">{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: 'Goosebumps'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/goosebumps-film-review-r-l-stine-1201608681/|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=Variety|date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> and grossed $158 million against its $84 million budget.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-goosebumps-could-831790|title=Box-Office Preview: 'Goosebumps' Could Out-Spook 'Crimson Peak,' 'Bridge of Spies'|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween]]'', was released on October 12, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his father's recent death, Zach Cooper and his mother Gale move from [[New York City]] to the peaceful town of Madison, [[Delaware]]. While settling in the neighborhood, Zach meets his neighbor Hannah, but her overprotective father warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned [[amusement park]] where they start to befriend. However, when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach should stay away or something bad will happen.\n\nThe following night, Gale leaves to supervise a dance at the school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine Conyers. Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the local police station while he and Champ enter in his home. While investigating, both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the [[Goosebumps|''Goosebumps'' franchise]], each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens ''The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena'', releasing the book's titular monster. With Hannah's help, they chase the creature to a local [[ice rink]] where Hannah's father appears and encloses the monster again the book.\n\nHannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is ''Goosebumps''<nowiki/> creator, [[R. L. Stine]].  Back home, the group encounters [[Slappy the Dummy]] from the ''Night of the Living Dummy'' books. As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his book and flees with all the others. Stine and the kids are attacked by the lawn gnomes from ''Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes'', being forced to escape. Slappy begins releasing several other monsters from their books, causing panic and destruction around Madison. Meanwhile, Lorraine is attacked by Fifi the Vampire Poodle from ''Please Don't Feed the Vampire!''.\n\nZach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural [[typewriter]] in the school. Along the way, the group is attacked by The Invisible Boy from ''My Best Friend Is Invisible'' and the giant [[Mantis|praying mantis]] from ''A Shocker on Shock Street'', forcing them to hide in the local supermarket. The killer werewolf from ''[[The Werewolf of Fever Swamp]]'' chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived Fifi's attack.\n\nStine and the kids go through a cemetery, where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight, claiming to be Hannah Fairchild from \"The Ghost Next Door\",  before being attacked by [[Ghoul|ghouls]] from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls''. When they arrive at the school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his \"daughter\" is Hannah Fairchild from ''The Ghost Next Door'', and that he created her to face his loneliness, although Hannah is unaware of this. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events around them, while Zach and Champ try to warn everyone, but nobody believes them until the mantis attacks the building. Slappy releases the rest of the monsters from the books and they storm the school. Despite the students and school staff's efforts to keep the monsters out, they break in nonetheless. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter's case before he can finish the book. \n\nTo ensure everyone's safety, Stine and the kids trick them into following a school bus rigged with explosives while they board another bus to the abandoned amusement park. After realizing the group's ruse, Slappy tracks down and confronts them, he then releases the Blob from ''The Blob That Ate Everyone'' as the other monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature but is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a [[ferris wheel]] to finish the book. However, the mantis causes it to collapse and roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book, because Hannah will also be sucked in, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all along. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before accepting her fate.\n\nSome time later, Stine starts working as a new teacher at Madison High School while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. When Zach and Hannah leave school together, Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. However, when Stine is about to leave school, he looks at his typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green was omitted in imprisonment, beginning to write a new ''Goosebumps'' book entitled ''The Invisible Boy's Revenge''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Goosebumps,_Jack_Black,_SDCC_2014_07.jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| image3    = OdeyaRush2011-1-.jpg\n| width3    = 100\n| image2    = Dylan_Minnette_2010.jpg\n| width2     = 107\n| footer      = [[Jack Black]],  [[Dylan Minnette]], and [[Odeya Rush]] starred in the film as R.

Based on [[R. L. Stine]]'s [[Goosebumps|children's horror book series of the same name]], it follows a teenager who tries to save his town with Stine's help after all the monsters from the ''Goosebumps'' franchise begin to escape from their books, wreaking havoc in the real world. The film stars [[Jack Black]], [[Dylan Minnette]], [[Odeya Rush]], [[Amy Ryan]], [[Ryan Lee (actor)|Ryan Lee]], and [[Jillian Bell]].\n\nThe development of a ''Goosebumps'' feature film adaptation began in 1998, with [[Tim Burton]] attached to direct. After failing to find a script to determine which book to adapt, the project was halted. In early 2008, [[Columbia Pictures]] acquired the rights to create a ''Goosebumps''-based film, and the project reentered development. [[Principal photography]] lasted from April to July 2014 in [[Candler Park]], [[Atlanta]].\n\n''Goosebumps'' was theatrically released in the United States on October 16, 2015, by Columbia Pictures. The film was a commercial and critical success, with praise for its humor, usage of the ''Goosebumps'' characters, and performances (especially Black's and Minnette's)<ref name=\"VarietyReview\">{{cite news|last1=Berkshire|first1=Geoff|title=Film Review: 'Goosebumps'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/reviews/goosebumps-film-review-r-l-stine-1201608681/|accessdate=October 14, 2015|work=Variety|date=October 5, 2015}}</ref> and grossed $158 million against its $84 million budget.<ref name=\"boxoffice\">{{cite web|url=https://hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-goosebumps-could-831790|title=Box-Office Preview: 'Goosebumps' Could Out-Spook 'Crimson Peak,' 'Bridge of Spies'|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=([[Prometheus Global Media]])|date=October 13, 2015|accessdate=October 14, 2015}}</ref> A sequel, ''[[Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween]]'', was released on October 12, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter his father's recent death, Zach Cooper and his mother Gale move from [[New York City]] to the peaceful town of Madison, [[Delaware]]. While settling in the neighborhood, Zach meets his neighbor Hannah, but her overprotective father warns him to avoid contact with them. The next morning, at Madison High School, where Gale works as vice-principal, Zach befriends Champ, a clumsy student. That night, Hannah invites Zach to an abandoned [[amusement park]] where they start to befriend. However, when they return home, Hannah's father warns again that Zach stay away or something bad will happen.\n\nThe following night, Gale leaves to supervise a dance at the school, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine Conyers. Fearing that Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the local police station while he and Champ enter in his home. While investigating, both find a bookshelf with numerous books from the [[Goosebumps|''Goosebumps'' franchise]], each mysteriously locked. In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach opens ''The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena'', releasing the book's titular monster. With Hannah's help, they chase the creature to a local [[ice rink]] where Hannah's father appears and encloses the monster again the book.\n\nHannah's father unwittingly reveals that he is ''Goosebumps''<nowiki/> creator, [[R. L. Stine]].  Back home, the group encounters [[Slappy the Dummy]] from the ''Night of the Living Dummy'' books. As revenge for being locked up for years, Slappy burns his book and flees with all the others. Stine and the kids are attacked by the lawn gnomes from ''Revenge of the Lawn Gnomes'', being forced to escape. Slappy begins releasing several other monsters from their books, causing panic and destruction around Madison. Meanwhile, Lorraine is attacked by Fifi the Vampire Poodle from ''Please Don't Feed the Vampire!''.\n\nZach implores Stine to write a new book that can lock all the monsters back, but it can only be done with a supernatural [[typewriter]] in the school. Along the way, the group is attacked by Brent Green from ''My Best Friend Is Invisible'' and the giant [[Mantis|praying mantis]] from ''A Shocker on Shock Street'', forcing them to hide in the local supermarket. Will Blake from ''[[The Werewolf of Fever Swamp]]'' chases them to the parking lot where he is run over by Lorraine, who survived Fifi's attack.\n\nStine and the kids go through a cemetery, where Zach realizes that Hannah shines in the moonlight before being attacked by [[Ghoul|ghouls]] from ''Attack of the Graveyard Ghouls''. When they arrive at the school, Zach confronts Stine in private; he reveals that his \"daughter\" is Hannah Fairchild from ''The Ghost Next Door'', and that he created her to face his loneliness, although Hannah is unaware of this. Stine finds the typewriter and begins writing a book based on the events around them, while Zach and Champ try to warn everyone, but nobody believes them until the mantis attacks the building. Slappy releases the rest of the monsters from the books and they storm the school. Despite the students and school staff's efforts to keep the monsters out, they break in nonetheless. Slappy finds Stine and breaks his fingers with the typewriter's case before he can finish the book. \n\nTo ensure everyone's safety, Stine and the kids trick them into following a school bus rigged with explosives while they board another bus to the abandoned amusement park. After realizing the group's ruse, Slappy tracks down and confronts them, he then releases the Blob from ''The Blob That Ate Everyone'' as the other monsters arrive at the park. Stine confronts the creature but is devoured while Zach, Hannah and Champ climb a [[ferris wheel]] to finish the book. However, the mantis causes it to collapse and roll towards the forest. Zach refuses to open the book, because Hannah will also be sucked in, but she reveals that she knew the truth about herself all along. Hannah opens the book, sucking Slappy and all the monsters inside, saying goodbye to Zach with a kiss before accepting her fate.\n\nSome time later, Stine starts working as a new teacher at Madison High School while starting to date Lorraine. After school, Stine reveals to Zach that he re-wrote Hannah back into reality with a new book. When Zach and Hannah leave school together, Stine burns Hannah's book, making her permanently real. However, when Stine is about to leave school, he looks at his typewriter writing by itself. To his horror, Brent Green was omitted in imprisonment, beginning to write a new ''Goosebumps'' book entitled ''The Invisible Boy's Revenge''.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Goosebumps,_Jack_Black,_SDCC_2014_07.jpg\n| width1    = 100\n| image3    = OdeyaRush2011-1-.jpg\n| width3    = 100\n| image2    = Dylan_Minnette_2010.jpg\n| width2     = 107\n| footer      = [[Jack Black]],  [[Dylan Minnette]], and [[Odeya Rush]] starred in the film as R.

The Pharmacy College was affiliated in June 1873, and together the ''Medical College'' and the ''Pharmacy College'' came to be known as 'Affiliated Colleges'. The third college, the ''College of Dentistry'', was established in 1881.\n\n===Expansion and growth===\nInitially, the three Affiliated Colleges were located at different sites around San Francisco, but near the end of the 19th Century interest in bringing them together grew. To make this possible, San Francisco Mayor [[Adolph Sutro]] donated 13 acres in Parnassus Heights at the base of Mount Parnassus (now known as [[Mount Sutro]]). The new site, overlooking [[Golden Gate Park]], opened in the fall of 1898, with the construction of the new Affiliated Colleges buildings. The school's first female student, [[Lucy Maria Field Wanzer|Lucy Wanzer]], graduated in 1876, after having to appeal to the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Board of Regents]] to gain admission in 1873.<ref name=Chen>{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jeffrey|title=140 Years Later: The First Female Graduate of UCSF|url=https://medschool.ucsf.edu/features/140-years-later-first-female-graduate-ucsf|publisher=UCSF School of Medicine|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/1868_hospitals.html|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1906, the school faculty had provided care at the City-County Hospital ([[San Francisco General Hospital]], 1915\u20132016, but ''Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH)'' since 2016), but did not have a hospital of its own. Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], more than 40,000 people were relocated to a makeshift tent city in Golden Gate Park and were treated by the faculty of the Affiliated Colleges. This brought the school, which until then was located on the western outskirts of the city, in contact with significant population and fueled the commitment of the school towards civic responsibility and health care, increasing the momentum towards the construction of its own health facilities. Finally, in April 1907, one of the buildings was renovated for outpatient care with 75 beds. This created the need to train nursing students, and, in 1907, the ''UC Training School for Nurses'' was established, adding a fourth professional school to the Affiliated Colleges.\n\nAround this time, the Affiliated Colleges agreed to submit to the Regents' governance at the urging of President [[Benjamin Ide Wheeler]], who had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC [[brand]] but over which UC had no real control.<ref name=\"StadtmanPage125138\">{{cite book |last1=Stadtman |first1=Verne A. |title=The University of California, 1868-1968 |url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad |url-access=registration |date=1970 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/125 125\u2013138]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:UCSF 1908.jpg|thumb|250px|The Affiliated Colleges buildings in 1908, with the streetcar that used to run on Parnassus]]\n\n===Post-War 20th century ===\nThe schools continued to grow in numbers and reputation in the following year. One notable event was the incorporation of the '''Hooper Foundation for Medical Research''' in 1914, a medical research institute second only to the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]]. This addition bolstered the prestige of the Parnassus site during a dispute over whether the schools should consolidate at Parnassus or in Berkeley, where some of the departments had transferred. The final decision came in 1949 when the ''Regents of the University of California'' designated the Parnassus campus as the '''UC Medical Center in San Francisco'''. The medical facilities were updated, and the departments returned to San Francisco from [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. During this period a number of research institutes were established, and many new facilities were added, such as the 225-bed ''UC Hospital'' (1917), the ''Clinics Building'' (1934), the ''[[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute|Langley Porter Clinic]]'' (1942) and the ''Herbert C. Moffitt Hospital'' (1955). In 1958, the addition of the ''Guy S. Millberry Union'' offered dorms and services for students.\n\nThe school gained more independence in the 1960s, when it started to be seen as a campus in its own right instead of as the medical center of the UC system. The four departments were renamed as \"School of ...\" and the ''Graduate Division'' was founded in 1961. Further along this line, in 1964 the institution obtained full administrative independence under the name '''University of California, San Francisco Medical Center''',  becoming the ninth campus in the [[University of California system]] and the only one devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The first Chancellor under the new independent configuration was John B. de C.M. Saunders, previously Provost, who had a strong preference for medical training over research.<ref>{{cite web|title=John B. de C. M. Saunders - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/saunders.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref> This stance led to his resignation and the naming of Willard C. Fleming, DDS, as the second Chancellor in 1966. Fleming brought balance between clinicians and researchers and a new found stability to the administration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Willard Corwin Fleming - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/fleming.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref> By the end of the 1960s, the university was starting to become a leading research center, also bolstered by the opening of ''Health Sciences East'' and ''Health Sciences West'' the same year.\n\nUnder the guidance of the third Chancellor, [[Philip R. Lee]], the institution was renamed to its current form, the '''University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)'''. Lee also was crucial in guiding UCSF through the turmoil of the late 1960s and worked to increase minority recruitment and enrollment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Randolph Lee - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/lee.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref> By then, UCSF had already reached the top ranks of US schools in the health sciences through its innovative programs that blended basic science, research, and clinical instruction. This stature was further augmented by Francis A. Sooy, fourth Chancellor, who dedicated his ten years to recruiting the top physicians and scientists in the field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francis A. Sooy - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/sooy.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nThe 1970s saw a dramatic expansion of UCSF, both in its medical capacities and as a research institute. The increase in researchers, physicians and students brought a need for additional space. The nursing school opened its own building in 1972 and the medical center opened the ''Ambulatory Care Center'' in 1973. The discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] technology by UCSF and Stanford scientists in the mid-1970s opened many new avenues of research and attracted more people. UCSF scientists also played a central role in the birth and development of the biotechnology industry in the San Francisco Bay area during this period. Herbert Boyer, a Professor of UCSF\u2019s biochemistry and biophysics department co-founded Genentech, the first therapeutic biotech firm, and UCSF scientists were also involved in the formation of most other major biotech firms in the San Francisco region that date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jong|first=Simcha|date=2006-04-01|title=How organizational structures in science shape spin-off firms: the biochemistry departments of Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF and the birth of the biotech industry|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/15/2/251/655839|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=251\u2013283|doi=10.1093/icc/dtj014|issn=0960-6491}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2006 analysis of the roots of the ten largest biotech firms measured in terms of their market capitalization in the San Francisco region highlighted the central position of UCSF continued to play within the region\u2019s industry: six biotech firms out of the top ten were either directly or indirectly linked to UCSF\u2014a direct link meaning that the firm was founded by a UCSF scientist, an indirect link meaning that the firm was spun-off from a firm founded by a UCSF scientist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jong|first=Simcha|date=2006-04-01|title=How organizational structures in science shape spin-off firms: the biochemistry departments of Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF and the birth of the biotech industry|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/15/2/251/655839|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=251\u2013283|doi=10.1093/icc/dtj014|issn=0960-6491}}</ref>\n\nOn the clinical side, great advances in patient care, diagnostics, and treatments advanced UCSF's reputation in the health field. 1975 also saw the opening of the ''UCSF Center'' in [[Fresno]].\n[[File:UCSF panorama.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama of UCSF and [[Golden Gate Park]] from ''Health Sciences West''|300px]]\n\nJulius R. Krevans, the fifth Chancellor from 1982 to 1993, was a strong advocate of biomedical research and public policy in the health sciences. During his tenure, UCSF rose to become one of the leading recipients of [[NIH]] funding. This led to the need for new space, and additions included the ''Marilyn Reed Lucia Child Care Center'' in 1978, the ''Dental Clinics Building'' (1980), the new ''Joseph M. Long Hospital'' in 1983 (which was integrated with the existing Moffitt Hospital), ''Beckman Vision Center'' and ''Koret Vision Research Laboratory'' (1988), and ''Kalmanovitz Library'' (1990).\n\nDue to the space constraints of the Parnassus Heights campus, UCSF started looking into expanding into other areas of the city. The university opened ''UCSF Laurel Heights'' in 1985 in the [[Laurel Heights]] neighborhood. Initially intended for pharmacy school laboratory research and instruction, neighborhood concerns pushed the university to instead employ the building for academic desktop research, social and behavioral science departments, and administrative offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laurel Heights {{!}} UC San Francisco|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/locations/laurel-heights|website=www.ucsf.edu|language=en|access-date=July 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729202530/https://www.ucsf.edu/locations/laurel-heights|archive-date=July 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> On the western side of the city, the university acquired '''Mount Zion Hospital''' in 1990, which became the second major clinical site and since 1999 has hosted the first comprehensive [[cancer]] center in Northern California. Under the chancellorship of [[Joseph B. Martin]], UCSF engaged in a health merger with '''Stanford Health''' and laid the groundwork for the expansion into Mission Bay.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:UCSF! (8457525216).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Mission Bay Campus, UCSF's second campus, developed starting in 1999]]\n\nA pivotal moment in UCSF history was the deal between Vice Chancellor Bruce Spaulding and San Francisco Mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] for the development of the [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]] campus in 1999. The development of a second campus in San Francisco was planned carefully and with business and community input. The Mission Bay neighborhood was occupied by old warehouses and rail yards. Initially, the campus consisted of 29.2 acres donated by the [[Catellus Development Corporation]] and 13.2 acres donated by the City and County of San Francisco. A later addition of a 14.5-acre parcel brought the total campus area to about 57 acres.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mission Bay|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/about/locations/mission-bay#the-mission-bay-campus|website=UC San Francisco|language=en}}</ref> The Mission Bay expansion was overseen by a one-year chancellorship of surgeon [[Haile Debas]]. Under his guidance, UCSF further increased its lead in the field of surgery, transplant surgery, and surgical training. The ''Mission Bay Campus'' doubled the university's research and provided new opportunities for biomedical discovery and student training. The first phase of construction cost $800 million and included four research buildings, a community center, a student housing complex, two parking structures, and development of large open spaces.\n\nScientist [[J. Michael Bishop]], a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] recipient, became the eighth Chancellor in 1998.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2018/05/24/j-michael-bishop-scientist-ucsf-chancellor-and-nobel-laureate/|title=J.

The ''Stem Cell Center'' was named in honor of  [[Eli Broad]], who donated $25 million to the cause of research for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, HIV/AIDS, and cancer.\n\nIn 2014, UCSF celebrated its 150th anniversary with a year of events.<ref>{{cite web|title=UCSF 150: Celebrating UC San Francisco's 150th Anniversary|url=http://ucsf150.ucsf.edu/|language=en}}</ref> That same year Neonatologist and Dean of the UCSF School of Medicine [[Sam Hawgood]], MBBS, became the tenth Chancellor. In 2015, the Mission Bay campus saw the grand opening of the new UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay, a 289-bed integrated hospital complex dedicated to serving children, women and cancer patients.\n\nSince 2015 UCSF has increased its focus on novel biomedical research and has attracted many acts of philanthropy. UCSF became one of the three institutions (together with [[UC Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]]) which comprise the [[Biohub]], which is housed on the Mission Bay campus. The project consists of a medical science research center funded by a $600 million commitment from [[Facebook]] [[CEO]] and founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and UCSF alumna pediatrician [[Priscilla Chan]], his wife.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Anwar |first1=Yasmin |date=September 21, 2016 |title=UC Berkeley to partner in $600M Chan Zuckerberg science 'Biohub' |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/09/21/biohub/ |website=Berkeley News |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, UCSF announced a $500 million gift from the Helen Diller Foundation to increase financial aid for faculty and students, invest in cutting-edge research projects, and expand scholarships for dental, medical, nursing and pharmacy students.

The site was established along Parnassus Avenue in 1898 on land donated by Mayor [[Adolph Sutro]]. At the time, the site was in the remote and uninhabited western part of San Francisco, but its medical facilities became vital in saving lives when 40,000 people were hosted in the nearby [[Golden Gate Park]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]. In the early 1900s, the medical research operations of the medical center were split between Parnassus and [[UC Berkeley]], and discussions arose about which site should become the center of medical activity. In 1914, the ''Hooper Foundation for Medical Research'' decided to move its research work to the Parnassus site, becoming the first medical research foundation in the United States to be incorporated into a university. This expansion led to a 1949 decision by the [[UC Board of Regents]] designating the UCSF campus, rather than [[UC Berkeley]], as the main site for all medical sciences of the UC system. The 20th century saw remarkable growth, with the expansion of new research institutes and facilities, which led to the administrative independence of UCSF and the selection of John B. de C.M. Saunders as the first Chancellor in 1964.\n\nParnassus serves as the main campus of the University and includes administration offices, numerous research labs, the 600-bed [[UCSF Medical Center]], the [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute]], the Mulberry Student Union, and the [[UCSF Library]]. Additionally, the Schools of Dentistry, Pharmacy, Medicine, Nursing are also located at Parnassus. It also houses the UCSF neurology outpatient practice that serves as a referral center for most of northern California and [[Reno, Nevada]]. UCSF's Beckman Vision Center is also located at the Parnassus campus. It is a center for the diagnosis, treatment, and research of all areas of eye care, including [[eye surgery|vision correction surgery]]. Also located on the Parnassus campus is the ''[[University of California, San Francisco Fetal Treatment Center|UCSF Fetal Treatment Center]]'', a multidisciplinary care center dedicated to the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up of fetal birth defects.\n\n===Mission Bay===\nUCSF's [[Mission Bay (San Francisco)|Mission Bay]] Campus, also located in San Francisco, is the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2003/07/4846/new-ucsf-mission-bay-campus-countrys-largest-biomedical-university-expansio|title=New UCSF Mission Bay campus: country's largest biomedical university expansion|last=Ravven|first=Wallace|date=July 22, 2003|website=|publisher=UCSF News Center|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The {{convert|43|acre|ha|adj=on}} Mission Bay campus, opened in 2003 with construction still ongoing, contains additional research space and facilities to foster biotechnology and life sciences companies.

To make this possible, San Francisco Mayor [[Adolph Sutro]] donated 13 acres in Parnassus Heights at the base of Mount Parnassus (now known as [[Mount Sutro]]). The new site, overlooking [[Golden Gate Park]], opened in the fall of 1898, with the construction of the new Affiliated Colleges buildings. The school's first female student, [[Lucy Maria Field Wanzer|Lucy Wanzer]], graduated in 1876, after having to appeal to the [[Regents of the University of California|UC Board of Regents]] to gain admission in 1873.<ref name=Chen>{{cite web|last=Chen|first=Jeffrey|title=140 Years Later: The First Female Graduate of UCSF|url=https://medschool.ucsf.edu/features/140-years-later-first-female-graduate-ucsf|publisher=UCSF School of Medicine|accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/1868_hospitals.html|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil 1906, the school faculty had provided care at the City-County Hospital ([[San Francisco General Hospital]], 1915\u20132016, but ''Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center (SFGH)'' since 2016), but did not have a hospital of its own. Following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], more than 40,000 people were relocated to a makeshift tent city in Golden Gate Park and were treated by the faculty of the Affiliated Colleges. This brought the school, which until then was located on the western outskirts of the city, in contact with significant population and fueled the commitment of the school towards civic responsibility and health care, increasing the momentum towards the construction of its own health facilities. Finally, in April 1907, one of the buildings was renovated for outpatient care with 75 beds. This created the need to train nursing students, and, in 1907, the ''UC Training School for Nurses'' was established, adding a fourth professional school to the Affiliated Colleges.\n\nAround this time, the Affiliated Colleges agreed to submit to the Regents' governance at the urging of President [[Benjamin Ide Wheeler]], who had come to recognize the problems inherent in the existence of independent entities that shared the UC [[brand]] but over which UC had no real control.<ref name=\"StadtmanPage125138\">{{cite book |last1=Stadtman |first1=Verne A. |title=The University of California, 1868-1968 |url=https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad |url-access=registration |date=1970 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/universityofcali00stad/page/125 125\u2013138]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:UCSF 1908.jpg|thumb|250px|The Affiliated Colleges buildings in 1908, with the streetcar that used to run on Parnassus]]\n\n===Post-War 20th century ===\nThe schools continued to grow in numbers and reputation in the following year. One notable event was the incorporation of the '''Hooper Foundation for Medical Research''' in 1914, a medical research institute second only to the [[Rockefeller University|Rockefeller Institute]]. This addition bolstered the prestige of the Parnassus site during a dispute over whether the schools should consolidate at Parnassus or in Berkeley, where some of the departments had transferred. The final decision came in 1949 when the ''Regents of the University of California'' designated the Parnassus campus as the '''UC Medical Center in San Francisco'''. The medical facilities were updated, and the departments returned to San Francisco from [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. During this period a number of research institutes were established, and many new facilities were added, such as the 225-bed ''UC Hospital'' (1917), the ''Clinics Building'' (1934), the ''[[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute|Langley Porter Clinic]]'' (1942) and the ''Herbert C. Moffitt Hospital'' (1955). In 1958, the addition of the ''Guy S. Millberry Union'' offered dorms and services for students.\n\nThe school gained more independence in the 1960s, when it started to be seen as a campus in its own right instead of as the medical center of the UC system. The four departments were renamed as \"School of ...\" and the ''Graduate Division'' was founded in 1961. Further along this line, in 1964 the institution obtained full administrative independence under the name '''University of California, San Francisco Medical Center''',  becoming the ninth campus in the [[University of California system]] and the only one devoted exclusively to the health sciences. The first Chancellor under the new independent configuration was John B. de C.M. Saunders, previously Provost, who had a strong preference for medical training over research.<ref>{{cite web|title=John B. de C. M. Saunders - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/saunders.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref> This stance led to his resignation and the naming of Willard C. Fleming, DDS, as the second Chancellor in 1966. Fleming brought balance between clinicians and researchers and a new found stability to the administration.<ref>{{cite web|title=Willard Corwin Fleming - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/fleming.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref> By the end of the 1960s, the university was starting to become a leading research center, also bolstered by the opening of ''Health Sciences East'' and ''Health Sciences West'' the same year.\n\nUnder the guidance of the third Chancellor, [[Philip R. Lee]], the institution was renamed to its current form, the '''University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)'''. Lee also was crucial in guiding UCSF through the turmoil of the late 1960s and worked to increase minority recruitment and enrollment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Philip Randolph Lee - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/lee.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref> By then, UCSF had already reached the top ranks of US schools in the health sciences through its innovative programs that blended basic science, research, and clinical instruction. This stature was further augmented by Francis A. Sooy, fourth Chancellor, who dedicated his ten years to recruiting the top physicians and scientists in the field.<ref>{{cite web|title=Francis A. Sooy - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/sooy.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Late 20th century===\nThe 1970s saw a dramatic expansion of UCSF, both in its medical capacities and as a research institute. The increase in researchers, physicians and students brought a need for additional space. The nursing school opened its own building in 1972 and the medical center opened the ''Ambulatory Care Center'' in 1973. The discovery of [[recombinant DNA]] technology by UCSF and Stanford scientists in the mid-1970s opened many new avenues of research and attracted more people. UCSF scientists also played a central role in the birth and development of the biotechnology industry in the San Francisco Bay area during this period. Herbert Boyer, a Professor of UCSF\u2019s biochemistry and biophysics department co-founded the first therapeutic biotech firm, Genentech, and UCSF scientists were also involved in the formation of most other major biotech firms in the San Francisco region that date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jong|first=Simcha|date=2006-04-01|title=How organizational structures in science shape spin-off firms: the biochemistry departments of Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF and the birth of the biotech industry|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/15/2/251/655839|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=251\u2013283|doi=10.1093/icc/dtj014|issn=0960-6491}}</ref> Furthermore, a 2006 analysis of the roots of the ten largest biotech firms measured in terms of their market capitalization in the San Francisco region shows the continuing central position of UCSF within the region\u2019s industry: six biotech firms out of the top ten are either directly or indirectly linked to UCSF\u2014a direct link meaning that the firm was founded by a UCSF scientist, an indirect link meaning that the firm was spun-off from a firm founded by a UCSF scientist.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jong|first=Simcha|date=2006-04-01|title=How organizational structures in science shape spin-off firms: the biochemistry departments of Berkeley, Stanford, and UCSF and the birth of the biotech industry|url=https://academic.oup.com/icc/article/15/2/251/655839|journal=Industrial and Corporate Change|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=251\u2013283|doi=10.1093/icc/dtj014|issn=0960-6491}}</ref>\n\nOn the clinical side, great advances in patient care, diagnostics, and treatments advanced UCSF's reputation in the health field. 1975 also saw the opening of the ''UCSF Center'' in [[Fresno]].\n[[File:UCSF panorama.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama of UCSF and [[Golden Gate Park]] from ''Health Sciences West''|300px]]\n\nJulius R. Krevans, the fifth Chancellor from 1982 to 1993, was a strong advocate of biomedical research and public policy in the health sciences. During his tenure, UCSF rose to become one of the leading recipients of [[NIH]] funding. This led to the need for new space, and additions included the ''Marilyn Reed Lucia Child Care Center'' in 1978, the ''Dental Clinics Building'' (1980), the new ''Joseph M. Long Hospital'' in 1983 (which was integrated with the existing Moffitt Hospital), ''Beckman Vision Center'' and ''Koret Vision Research Laboratory'' (1988), and ''Kalmanovitz Library'' (1990).\n\nDue to the space constraints of the Parnassus Heights campus, UCSF started looking into expanding into other areas of the city. The university opened ''UCSF Laurel Heights'' in 1985 in the [[Laurel Heights]] neighborhood. Initially intended for pharmacy school laboratory research and instruction, neighborhood concerns pushed the university to instead employ the building for academic desktop research, social and behavioral science departments, and administrative offices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laurel Heights {{!}} UC San Francisco|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/locations/laurel-heights|website=www.ucsf.edu|language=en|access-date=July 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729202530/https://www.ucsf.edu/locations/laurel-heights|archive-date=July 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> On the western side of the city, the university acquired '''Mount Zion Hospital''' in 1990, which became the second major clinical site and since 1999 has hosted the first comprehensive [[cancer]] center in Northern California. Under the chancellorship of [[Joseph B. Martin]], UCSF engaged in a health merger with '''Stanford Health''' and laid the groundwork for the expansion into Mission Bay.\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:UCSF! (8457525216).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Mission Bay Campus, UCSF's second campus, developed starting in 1999]]\n\nA pivotal moment in UCSF history was the deal between Vice Chancellor Bruce Spaulding and San Francisco Mayor [[Willie Brown (politician)|Willie Brown]] for the development of the [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]] campus in 1999. The development of a second campus in San Francisco was planned carefully and with business and community input. The Mission Bay neighborhood was occupied by old warehouses and rail yards. Initially, the campus consisted of 29.2 acres donated by the [[Catellus Development Corporation]] and 13.2 acres donated by the City and County of San Francisco. A later addition of a 14.5-acre parcel brought the total campus area to about 57 acres.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mission Bay|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/about/locations/mission-bay#the-mission-bay-campus|website=UC San Francisco|language=en}}</ref> The Mission Bay expansion was overseen by a one-year chancellorship of surgeon [[Haile Debas]]. Under his guidance, UCSF further increased its lead in the field of surgery, transplant surgery, and surgical training. The ''Mission Bay Campus'' doubled the university's research and provided new opportunities for biomedical discovery and student training. The first phase of construction cost $800 million and included four research buildings, a community center, a student housing complex, two parking structures, and development of large open spaces.\n\nScientist [[J. Michael Bishop]], a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] recipient, became the eighth Chancellor in 1998.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2018/05/24/j-michael-bishop-scientist-ucsf-chancellor-and-nobel-laureate/|title=J.

The ''Stem Cell Center'' was named in honor of  [[Eli Broad]], who donated $25 million to the cause of research for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, HIV/AIDS, and cancer.\n\nIn 2014, UCSF celebrated its 150th anniversary with a year of events.<ref>{{cite web|title=UCSF 150: Celebrating UC San Francisco's 150th Anniversary|url=http://ucsf150.ucsf.edu/|language=en}}</ref> That same year Neonatologist and Dean of the UCSF School of Medicine [[Sam Hawgood]], MBBS, became the tenth Chancellor. In 2015, the Mission Bay campus saw the grand opening of the new UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay, a 289-bed integrated hospital complex dedicated to serving children, women and cancer patients.\n\nSince 2015 UCSF has increased its focus on novel biomedical research and has attracted many acts of philanthropy. UCSF became one of the three institutions (together with [[UC Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]]) which comprise the [[Biohub]], which is housed on the Mission Bay campus. The project consists of a medical science research center funded by a $600 million commitment from [[Facebook]] [[CEO]] and founder [[Mark Zuckerberg]] and UCSF alumna pediatrician [[Priscilla Chan]], his wife.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Anwar |first1=Yasmin |date=September 21, 2016 |title=UC Berkeley to partner in $600M Chan Zuckerberg science 'Biohub' |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/09/21/biohub/ |website=Berkeley News |accessdate=July 10, 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, UCSF announced a $500 million gift from the Helen Diller Foundation to increase financial aid for faculty and students, invest in cutting-edge research projects, and expand scholarships for dental, medical, nursing and pharmacy students.

The site was established along Parnassus Avenue in 1898 on land donated by Mayor [[Adolph Sutro]]. At the time, the site was in the remote and uninhabited western part of San Francisco, but its medical facilities became vital in saving lives when 40,000 people were hosted in the nearby [[Golden Gate Park]] after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]. In the early 1900s, the medical research operations of the medical center were split between Parnassus and [[UC Berkeley]], and discussions arose about which site should become the center of medical activity. In 1914, the ''Hooper Foundation for Medical Research'' decided to move its research work to the Parnassus site, becoming the first medical research foundation in the United States to be incorporated into a university. This expansion led to a 1949 decision by the [[UC Board of Regents]] designating the UCSF campus, rather than [[UC Berkeley]], as the main site for all medical sciences of the UC system. The 20th century saw remarkable growth, with the expansion of new research institutes and facilities, which led to the administrative independence of UCSF and the selection of John B. de C.M. Saunders as the first Chancellor in 1964.\n\nParnassus serves as the main campus of the University and includes administration offices, numerous research labs, the 600-bed [[UCSF Medical Center]], the [[Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute]], the Mulberry Student Union, and the [[UCSF Library]]. Additionally, the Schools of Dentistry, Pharmacy, Medicine, Nursing are also located at Parnassus. It also houses the UCSF neurology outpatient practice that serves as a referral center for most of northern California and [[Reno, Nevada]]. UCSF's Beckman Vision Center is also located at the Parnassus campus. It is a center for the diagnosis, treatment, and research of all areas of eye care, including [[eye surgery|vision correction surgery]]. Also located on the Parnassus campus is the ''[[University of California, San Francisco Fetal Treatment Center|UCSF Fetal Treatment Center]]'', a multidisciplinary care center dedicated to the diagnosis, treatment, and long-term follow-up of fetal birth defects.\n\n===Mission Bay===\nUCSF's [[Mission Bay (San Francisco)|Mission Bay]] Campus, also located in San Francisco, is the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2003/07/4846/new-ucsf-mission-bay-campus-countrys-largest-biomedical-university-expansio|title=New UCSF Mission Bay campus: country's largest biomedical university expansion|last=Ravven|first=Wallace|date=July 22, 2003|website=|publisher=UCSF News Center|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref> The {{convert|43|acre|ha|adj=on}} Mission Bay campus, opened in 2003 with construction still ongoing, contains additional research space and facilities to foster biotechnology and life sciences companies.

The fictional Don Camillo is one of two main protagonists of Guareschi's short stories, the other being the communist mayor of the town, Peppone.  The stories are set in what Guareschi refers to as the \"small world\" of rural Italy after World War II.\n\nMost of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine ''Candido'', founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca.  These \"Little World\" (Italian: ''Mondo piccolo'') stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.\n\n==Characterisation==\n[[File:Don camillo4.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Don Camillo as depicted by [[Fernandel]]]]\nIn the post-war years (after 1945), [[Don (honorific)|Don]] '''Camillo Tarocci''' (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the [[Po valley]] in northern [[Italy]]. Don Camillo is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was [[Brescello]] (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.\n[[File:Don camillo.jpg|thumb|Don Camillo talking with [[Jesus]]]]\n\nDon Camillo is constantly at odds with the [[communist]] mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as '''Peppone''' (meaning, roughly, ''Big Joe'') and is also on very close terms with the [[crucifix]] in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ.<ref name = lower-alpha>As the author notes in the preface of the first book, not the Christ, but \"his\" Christ, the voice of his conscience.</ref> The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.\n\nWhat Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been [[Italian Resistance Movement|partisan]] fighters during [[World War II]]; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how \"the reactionaries\" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches [[fire and brimstone]] against \"godless Communists\", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.\n\nAs depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The [[Italian Christian Democratic Party]], the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the [[Stockholm Peace Appeal]], it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.\n\nMany stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Italian Communist Party]], not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal [[Feud|vendetta]]s in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.\n\nPolitical forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small [[Italian Liberal Party]] has scheduled an elections rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up \u2014 only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.\n\nIn one story, Don Camillo visits the [[Soviet Union]], pretending to be a [[comrade]]. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting \"decadence\", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when the Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the proprietor of several profitable dealerships, riding the \"Boom\" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo \u2014 at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems \u2014 the [[Second Vatican Council]] has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chich\u00ec, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.\n\nDespite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two \"political enemies\" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).\n\nGuareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally \"three marble balls\" or \"three billiard balls\"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of [[Trepalle]] (literally \"three balls\"), a real town (near [[Livigno]]) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.\n\n== Books in chronological order ==\nThe following Italian language books have been published:\n* ''Mondo Piccolo: Don Camillo''.

The fictional Don Camillo is one of two main protagonists of Guareschi's short stories, the other being the communist mayor of the town, Peppone.  The stories are set in what Guareschi refers to as the \"small world\" of rural Italy after World War II.\n\nMost of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine ''Candido'', founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca.  These \"Little World\" (Italian: ''Mondo piccolo'') stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.\n\n==Characterisation==\n[[File:Don camillo4.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Don Camillo as depicted by [[Fernandel]]]]\nIn the post-war years (after 1945), [[Don (honorific)|Don]] '''Camillo Tarocci''' (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the [[Po valley]] in northern [[Italy]]. Don Camillo is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was [[Brescello]] (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi's tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.\n[[File:Don camillo.jpg|thumb|Don Camillo talking with [[Jesus]]]]\n\nDon Camillo is constantly at odds with the [[communist]] mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as '''Peppone''' (meaning, roughly, ''Big Joe'') and is also on very close terms with the [[crucifix]] in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ.<ref name = lower-alpha>As the author notes in the preface of the first book, not the Christ, but \"his\" Christ, the voice of his conscience.</ref> The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.\n\nWhat Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been [[Italian Resistance Movement|partisan]] fighters during [[World War II]]; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how \"the reactionaries\" ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches [[fire and brimstone]] against \"godless Communists\", they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo's flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]] and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.\n\nAs depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The [[Italian Christian Democratic Party]], the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the [[Stockholm Peace Appeal]], it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.\n\nMany stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Italian Communist Party]], not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal [[Feud|vendetta]]s in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.\n\nPolitical forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small [[Italian Liberal Party]] has scheduled an elections rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up \u2014 only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.\n\nIn one story, Don Camillo visits the [[Soviet Union]], pretending to be a [[comrade]]. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting \"decadence\", a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when the Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the proprietor of several profitable dealerships, riding the \"Boom\" years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo \u2014 at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems \u2014 the [[Second Vatican Council]] has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chich\u00ec, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.\n\nDespite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two \"political enemies\" show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).\n\nGuareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally \"three marble balls\" or \"three billiard balls\"). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of [[Trepalle]] (literally \"three balls\"), a real town (near [[Livigno]]) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi's.\n\n== Books in chronological order ==\nThe following Italian language books have been published:\n* ''Mondo Piccolo: Don Camillo''.
