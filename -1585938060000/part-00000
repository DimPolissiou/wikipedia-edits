In the [[2010\u201311 in French football|2010\u201311 season]], he was a part of the Lille team that won the [[Double (association football)|league and cup double]]. Following the season, in June 2011, Cabaye joined English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a five-year deal.

[[midfielder]] for [[Ligue 1]] club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]].\n\nCabaye began his football career playing for hometown club Tourcoing FC at the age of six. After seven years developing in the club's youth academy, he joined professional club [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. Cabaye spent six years in the club's youth academy before making his professional debut in the [[2004\u201305 Ligue 1|2004\u201305 season]] helping Lille win the [[2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. He became a regular starter in the following season and participated in the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the first time under [[Claude Puel]]. Under manager [[Rudi Garcia]], Cabaye developed into a [[playmaker]] and had his best season to date in the [[2009\u201310 Ligue 1|2009\u201310 season]] scoring over 15 goals from the midfield position. In the [[2010\u201311 in French football|2010\u201311 season]], he was a part of the Lille team that won the [[Double (association football)|league and cup double]]. Following the season, in June 2011, Cabaye joined English club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a five-year deal. On 29 January 2014, Newcastle accepted a \u00a319&nbsp;million offer for Cabaye from [[List of French football champions|Ligue 1 champions]] Paris Saint-Germain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/25949006|title=Yohan Cabaye: Newcastle midfielder joins PSG for \u00a319m|date=29 December 2017|website=BBC Sport}}</ref> Cabaye joined, signing a three-year contract with the club.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yohan Cabaye joins Paris until June 2017 |url=http://www.psg.fr/en/News/003001/Article/65397/Yohan-Cabaye-joins-Paris-until-June-2017 |publisher=Paris Saint-Germain F.C. |date=29 January 2014}}</ref> On 10 July 2015, he joined Crystal Palace.\n\nCabaye is a former [[France national youth football team|French youth international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[France national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[France national under-19 football team|under-19]], [[France national under-20 football team|under-20]], and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. At under-19 level, he played on the team that won the [[2005 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]]. With the under-20 team, Cabaye played at the 2006 edition of the [[Toulon Tournament]].

In August 2010, Cabaye was called up to the [[France national football team|senior team]] for the first time under new [[manager (association football)|manager]] [[Laurent Blanc]], and made his international debut on 11 August in a 2\u20131 [[Exhibition match|friendly]] defeat against [[Norway national football team|Norway]].

He started out at the club at the age of six.

Hearn, S.J. and, with a stipulation of strict anonymity, gave him an envelope with the money needed to start a school to educate Catholic boys. After Mrs. Grant died, her children took over the funding of the school. The last surviving member of the family, Lucie Mackey Grant, a daughter-in-law of Julia Grant, died in 2007. Since the 1960s, Regis has relied primarily on the Grant endowments and alumni donations to keep the school tuition free.

Hearn, S.J. and, with a stipulation of strict anonymity, gave him an envelope with the money needed to start a school to educate Catholic boys. After Mrs. Grant died, her children took over the funding of the school. The last surviving member of the family, Lucie Mackey Grant, a daughter-in-law of Julia Grant, died in 2007. Since the 1960s, Regis has relied primarily on the Grant endowments and alumni donations to keep the school tuition free. Following Lucie Mackey Grant's death, at an auction of her estate, Regis bid successfully for the original golden [[chalice]] used during Mass when the school was founded in 1914.<ref name=auction>{{cite web|title=The Collection of Hugh J.

The club was formed in 1905 as Galata-Serai Football Club and played its [[Exhibition game|first friendly]] match on 10 November 1905. Galatasaray SK managed to win its first ever match, when they beat [[St. Joseph High School (Istanbul)|Faure Mektebi]] 2\u20130.\nGalatasaray SK played its first competitive match on 25 November 1906, when it drew 1\u20131 in the first week of the [[1906\u201307 Istanbul Football League]] against [[HMS Imogene FC]].<ref>http://www.mackolik.com/Team/Default.aspx?id=1&season=1906/1907</ref>\nInitially Galatasaray SK played against other local clubs in various [[Istanbul]] tournaments, but in 1959 the club became one of the founding members of [[S\u00fcper Lig]], Turkey's first national league.\nGalatasaray SK is one of the founding members of the Turkish Super Lig in 1959 and is one of only three clubs never to have been relegated from the top level of Turkish football, the others being the archrival [[Fenerbah\u00e7e SK]] and [[Be\u015fikta\u015f JK]].\n\nGalatasaray\u2019s most successful spell was in the 1999-2000 season, when it became one of the three European clubs to ever achieve a continental [[List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season|quadruple]], by winning the  [[UEFA Cup]], as the undefeated champion throughout the tournament, [[UEFA Super Cup]], beating the [[UEFA Champions League]] winners [[Real Madrid CF]], the

Kupas\u0131  a record 18 times, the [[TFF S\u00fcper Kupa]] a record 15 times, the UEFA Europa League one time and the UEFA Super Cup one time.\nThe table details the club's achievements in the early

From 1194 he was also [[King of Sicily]].\n\nHe was the second son of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and his consort [[Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy|Beatrix of Burgundy]]. In 1186 he was married to [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance of Sicily]], the posthumous daughter of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman]] king [[Roger II of Sicily]]. Henry, stuck in the Hohenstaufen conflict with the [[House of Welf]] until 1194, had to enforce the inheritance claims by his wife against her nephew Count [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]]. Henry's attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] failed at the [[Siege of Naples (1191)|siege of Naples in 1191]] due to an epidemic, and following his retreat Empress Constance was captured. Based on an enormous ransom for the release of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]], he conquered Sicily in 1194; however, the intended unification with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ultimately failed due to the opposition of the [[Papacy]].\n\nHenry threatened to invade the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1194 and succeeded in extracting a ransom, the [[Alamanikon]], from Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] in return for cancelling the invasion. In 1195 and 1196 Henry attempted to turn the Holy Roman Empire from an elective to a hereditary monarchy, the so-called ''[[Erbreichsplan]]'', but met strong resistance from the [[prince-elector]]s and abandoned the plan. Henry pledged to go on [[crusade]] in 1195 and began preparations. A revolt in Sicily was crushed in 1197. The Crusaders set sail for the [[Holy Land]] that same year but Henry died of illness at [[Messina]] on 28 September 1197 before he could join them. His death plunged the Empire into the chaos of the [[German throne dispute]] for the next 17 years.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHenry was born in autumn 1165 at the ''Valkhof'' [[Kaiserpfalz|pfalz]] of [[Nijmegen]] to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Beatrix of Burgundy. At the age of four his father had him [[Prince-elector|elected]] [[King of the Romans]] during a ''[[Hoftag]]'' in [[Bamberg]] at [[Pentecost]] 1169. Henry was crowned on 15 August at [[Aachen Cathedral]].<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire'', (Harvard University Press, 2016), 307.</ref><ref>John B. Freed, ''Frederick Barbarossa: The Prince and the Myth'', (Yale University Press, 2016), 351.</ref>\n\nHe accompanied his father on his [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] campaign of 1174-76 against the [[Lombard League]], whereby he was educated by [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] and associated with [[Minnesang|minnesingers]] like [[Friedrich von Hausen]], [[Bligger von Steinach]], and [[Bernger von Horheim]]. Henry was fluent in [[Latin]] and, according to the chronicler [[Alberic of Trois-Fontaines]], was \"distinguished by gifts of knowledge, wreathed in flowers of eloquence, and learned in canon and Roman law\". He was a patron of poets and poetry, and he almost certainly composed the song ''Kaiser Heinrich'', now among the [[Weingarten Abbey|Weingarten]] Song Manuscripts. According to his rank and with [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] (''Reichsadler''), [[Imperial regalia|regalia]], and a scroll, he is the first and foremost to be portrayed in the famous ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', a 14th-century songbook manuscript featuring 140 reputed poets; at least three poems are attributed to a young and romantically minded Henry VI. In one of those he describes a romance that makes him forget all his earthly power, and neither riches nor royal dignity can outweigh his yearning for that lady (''\u00ea ich mich ir verzige, ich verzige mich \u00ea der kr\u00f4ne'' \u2013 before I give her up, I'd rather give up the crown).\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=  \n|align=center\n|width=160\n|File:Arms of Swabia.svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen.\n|File:Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (Hohenstaufen).svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen as Holy Roman Emperor.\n|File:Attributed Coat and Shield of Arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Codex Manesse).svg|Attributed coat of arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (''Codex Manesse'').\n}}\n\n===Emperor's son===\nHaving returned to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] in 1178, Henry supported his father against insurgent Duke [[Henry the Lion]].

Constance, almost 30-year-old, was said to have been confined in [[Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo]] as a nun since childhood to keep [[celibacy]] due to a prediction that \"her marriage would destroy Sicily\" despite having become the sole legitimate heir to William as the marriage of the latter had remained childless; and, after the latter's death in November 1189, Henry had the opportunity of adding the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicilian]] crown to the imperial one. He and Constance were married on 27 January 1186 in [[Milan]].<ref>''The Marriage of Henry VI and Constance of Sicily: Prelude and Consequences'', Walter Frohlich, '''Anglo~Norman Studies: XV. Proceedings of the Battle Conference''', ed. Marjorie Chibnall, (The Boydell Press, 1993), 109.</ref>\n\nIn the Hohenstaufen conflict with [[Pope Urban III]], Henry moved to the [[March of Tuscany]], and with the aid of his deputy [[Markward von Annweiler]] devastated the adjacent territory of the [[Papal States]]. Back in Germany, he became sovereign ruler of the Empire, as his father had died while on the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190. Henry tried to secure his rule in the [[Low Countries]] by elevating Count [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin V of Hainaut]] to a [[margrave]] of [[County of Namur|Namur]], and at the same time he tried to reach a settlement with rivalling Duke [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry of Brabant]]. Further difficulties arose when the exiled Welf duke [[Henry the Lion]] returned from [[Kingdom of England|England]] and began to subdue large estates in his former [[Duchy of Saxony]]. A Hohenstaufen campaign to Saxony had to be abandoned when King Henry received the message of the death of King William II of Sicily on 18 November 1189. The Sicilian vice-chancellor [[Matthew of Ajello]] pursued the succession of Count Tancred of Lecce and gained the support of the [[Roman Curia]].\n\nTo assert his own rights in the inheritance dispute, Henry initially supported Tancred's rival Count [[Roger of Andria]] and made arrangements for a campaign to Italy. The next year he concluded a peace agreement with Henry the Lion at [[Fulda]] and moved farther southwards to [[Augsburg]], where he learned that his father had died on crusade attempting to cross the [[G\u00f6ksu|Saleph]] River near [[Silifke|Seleucia]] in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Cilicia]] (now part of [[Turkey]]) on 10 June 1190.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\">{{cite book|author=Horst Fuhrmann|title=Germany in the High Middle Ages: C.1050-1200 - pp. 181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlapxde55rAC|date=9 October 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31980-5}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[File:Friedrich-barbarossa-und-soehne-welfenchronik 1-1000x1540.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Barbarossa with his sons Henry and Frederick, ''Historia Welforum'', Weingarten Abbey, c. 1180]]\n[[File:Pope Coelestinus 4. crowning the Emperour Henricus 6. with his feete.gif|thumb|[[Pope Celestine III]] crowning Henry VI with his feet. He was only crowned after promising to cede [[Tusculum]].]]\nWhile he sent an Imperial army to Italy, Henry initially stayed in Germany to settle the succession of [[Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia]], who had also died on the Third Crusade. He had planned to seize the [[Thuringia]]n landgraviate as a reverted fief, but Louis' brother [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Hermann]] was able to reach his enfeoffment. The next year, the king followed his army across the [[Alps]]. In [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] he negotiated with [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], widow of King [[Henry II of England]], to break the engagement of her son King Richard with [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alys]], a daughter of late King [[Louis VII of France]]. He hoped to deteriorate English-French relations and to isolate Richard, who had offended him by backing Count Tancred in Sicily. Eleanor acted cleverly; she reached Henry's assurance that he would not interfere in her son's conflict with King [[Philip II of France]], and she would also prevent the marriage of Henry's younger brother [[Conrad II, Duke of Swabia|Conrad]] with [[Berengaria of Castile]] to confine the Hohenstaufen claims to power.\n\nHenry entered into further negotiations with the Lombard League cities and with [[Pope Celestine III]] on his [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial coronation]], and ceded [[Tusculum]] to the Pope. At Easter Monday on 15 April 1191, in [[Rome]], Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in [[Apulia]] and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's vassal [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege. Upon his retreat, those cities that had surrendered to Henry resubmitted to Tancred. As a result, Constance, who was left in the palace of [[Salerno]] as a sign that Henry would soon return, was betrayed and handed over to Tancred.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nHenry had to return to Germany when he learned that Henry the Lion had again incited a conflict with the Saxon [[House of Ascania]] and the [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Counts of Schauenburg]]. His son [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry of Brunswick]] deserted from the Imperial army in Italy and was ostracized by the emperor at the ''Hoftag'' in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] at Pentecost 1192. However, Henry VI had to realise that his powers were limited: after his closest ally in Saxony, Archbishop [[Wichmann von Seeburg|Wichmann of Magdeburg]] died, he concluded another armistice with inflammatory Henry the Lion.\n\nMeanwille, despite his wife had been captured by Sicilians, Henry always refused Celestine III making peace with Tancred. While Tancred would not permit Constance to be ransomed unless Henry recognized him, Henry complained her capture to Celestine. In June 1192 Constance was released on the intervention of Pope Celestine III, who in return recognized Tancred as King of Sicily. Constance was to be sent to Rome for Celestine III to put pressure on Henry, but German soldiers managed to set up an ambush on the border of Papal States, releasing Constance.\n\n[[File:Heinrich 6 sigillum.jpg|thumb|Facsimile of the Imperial seal (1192)]]\n\nOn the other hand, the emperor was able to strengthen his power base in the [[Duchy of Swabia]], when he inherited the possessions of Henry the Lion's cousin [[Welf VI]]. During the election of a new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of L\u00fcttich]] he favored [[Albert de Rethel]] for Albert was a maternal-uncle of then-captive Empress Constance, whom both he and Constance had planned to be the next bishop of Liege, but the other candidate [[Albert of Louvain]] the brother of Duke Henry of Brabant gained more support. In January 1192 Henry claimed the election was under dispute and appointed his newly-made imperial chancellor [[Lothar of Hochstaden]], provost of the church of St Cassius in Bonn and brother of Count Dietrich of Hochstaden instead, and in September 1192 he proceeded to [[Li\u00e8ge|L\u00fcttich]] (Li\u00e8ge) to enforce the succession. The majority of the electors of Li\u00e8ge accepted the imperial decision because of the emperor's threat, and Albert de Rethel also relinquished and indignantly refused a financial settlement offered by the emperor. Albert of Louvain had to yield and sought support from the pope in Rome and from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archbishop of Reims]]. In [[Reims]], he took the holy orders with papal consent, but he was killed soon after by hired assassins. His brother Duke Henry chose to conclude a peace agreement with the emperor but remained a bitter enemy.\n\nEmperor Henry already was concerned with the deposition of the Welf supporter Archbishop [[Hartwig of Uthlede|Hartwig II of Bremen]]. He further had to arbitrate in a conflict in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] on the eastern border of the Empire, where the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margrave [[Albert I, Margrave of Meissen|Albert I]] had to fend off the claims raised by his brother [[Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen|Theoderic]] and Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia. Meanwhile, the opposition in the west took on a dramatic scale, when the dukes of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] joined forces with Archbishop [[Bruno III of Berg|Bruno III of Cologne]]. A massive confederacy against the emperor loomed ahead, including Archbishop [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]], Archchancellor of Germany, and Duke [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]], as well Henry's old rival Henry the Lion, the Swabian [[House of Z\u00e4hringen]], the [[Kingdom of England|English Crown]], and the pope, irritated by the killing of Albert of Louvain.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n===Capture of Richard the Lionheart===\n[[File:Heinrich VI. begnadigt Richard Loewenherz.jpg|thumb|Richard the Lionheart submits himself to Emperor Henry, ''Liber ad honorem Augusti'', fol. 129R]]\nAt this stage, Henry had a stroke of good fortune when the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]] gave him his prominent prisoner, [[Richard the Lionheart]], King of England, whom he had captured on his way back from the Third Crusade and arrested at [[Burgruine D\u00fcrnstein|D\u00fcrnstein Castle]]. On 28 March 1193, Richard was handed over to the emperor in [[Speyer]] and imprisoned at [[Trifels Castle]], taking revenge for Richard's alliance with Tancred of Lecce. Ignoring his nearly [[excommunication]] by Pope Celestine III for imprisoning a former crusader, he held the English King for a ransom of 150,000 silver marks and officially declared a dowry of Richard's niece [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]], who was to marry Duke Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The opposition [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] had to face the defeat of their mighty ally and to refrain from their plans to overthrow the Hohenstaufen dynasty.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyscotland.com/history/on-this-day-in-history-richard-the-lionheart-was-captured-by-leopold/ |title=On this day in history - Richard the Lionheart was captured by Leopold V of Austria |publisher=  History Scotland  |author= |date=December 20, 2011  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBacked by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, who successfully defended his interests against his rivaling brother [[John, King of England|John Lackland]] and his ally King Philip of France, King Richard procured his release in exchange for the huge ransom, a further interest payment, and his [[oath of allegiance]] to Henry. In turn the emperor under threat of military violence demanded the restitution of the French lands, which John had seized upon approval by Philip during Richard's absence. Henry not only gained another vassal and ally, he could also assume the role of a mediator between [[England]] and [[France]]. He and Richard ceremoniously reconciled at the ''Hoftag'' in Speyer during Holy Week 1194: the English King publicly regretted any hostilities, genuflected, and cast himself on the emperor's mercy. He was released and returned to England.<ref name=\"Purser2004\">{{cite book|author=Toby Purser|title=Medieval England, 1042-1228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBs0VlTA-qEC|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-32760-6}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Henry settled the longstanding conflict with the Welf dynasty when he secured the marriage of [[Agnes of Hohenstaufen]], daughter of his cousin Count Palatine [[Conrad, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Conrad]], to Henry the Lion's son Henry of Brunswick, followed by a peace agreement in March 1194.\n\n===Conquest of Sicily===\n[[File:Jind\u0159ich VI. obl\u00e9h\u00e1 Neapol (1191).jpg|thumb|left|Siege of Naples, [[Peter of Eboli]], ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'', 1196]]\n[[File:Woodcut illustration of Constance of Sicily, her husband HRE Henry VI and her son HRE Frederick II - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, depicting [[Constance of Sicily]], husband Henry VI and son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]]]\nMeanwhile, the situation in Southern Italy had grown worse: After Henry's defeat at Naples, Tancred's brother-in-law Count [[Richard, Count of Acerra|Richard of Acerra]] had reconquered large parts of Apulia, and Tancred himself had reached the allowance of his claims by the pope. Henry was granted free passage in Northern Italy, having forged an alliance with the Lombard communes. In February 1194, Tancred of Lecce died, leaving as heir a young boy, [[William III of Sicily|William III]], under the tutelage of his mother [[Sibylla of Acerra]]. In May Emperor Henry, based on King Richard's ransom, again set out for Italy. He reached Milan at Pentecost and occupied Naples in August. He met little resistance and on 20 November 1194 entered [[Palermo]] capital of Kingdom of Sicily and was crowned king on 25 December. On the next day his wife Constance, who had stayed back in [[Iesi]], gave birth to his only son and heir [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the future emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nThe young William and his mother Sibylla had fled to [[Caltabellotta]] Castle; he officially renounced the Sicilian kingdom in turn for the [[County of Lecce]] and the [[Principality of Capua]]. A few days after Henry's coronation, however, the royal family and several Norman nobles were accused of a coup attempt and arrested. Henry is said to have had William blinded and castrated, while many of his liensmen{{cfn|date=November 2019}} were [[death by burning|burned alive]]. Some, however, like the Siculo-Greek [[Eugene of Palermo]], transitioned into the new Hohenstaufen government with ease. William probably was deported to [[Hohenems|Altems]] (Hohenems) Castle in Swabia, where he died in captivity about 1198. To take revenge of the capture of his wife Henry hanged [[Richard, Count of Acerra]] brother of Sibylla in 1196.\n\nIn March 1195 Henry held a ''Hoftag'' in [[Bari]] and appointed his wife Constance Sicilian [[queen regnant]], though with Henry's liensman{{cfn|date=November 2019}} [[Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto|Conrad of Urslingen]], elevated to a hereditary [[Duchy of Spoleto|Duke of Spoleto]], as [[Imperial vicar]] to secure the emperor's position in Southern Italy. He placed further ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' in the Sicilian administration, like the [[Troia, Apulia|Troia]] bishop [[Walter of Palearia]] who became chancellor. His loyal henchman Markward von Annweiler was appointed a Duke of [[Ravenna]], placing him in a highly strategic position to control the route to Sicily via the Italian [[Romagna]] region and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. Henry's younger brother [[Philip of Swabia]] was vested with the large estates of late Margravine [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]] in [[March of Tuscany|Tuscany]]. The emperor also felt strong enough to send home the Pisan and Genoese ships without giving their governments the promised concessions.<ref name=\"Matthew1992\">{{cite book|author=Donald Matthew|title=The Norman Kingdom of Sicily - p. 290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQfub3l_ejkC|date=30 July 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26911-7}}</ref>\n\n===Universal ruler===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich VI. (HRR).jpg|thumb|Portrait from the ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', {{circa}} 1304]]\nAt that point, Emperor Henry was the most powerful monarch in the Mediterranean and Europe, since the Sicilian kingdom added to his personal and Imperial revenues an income without parallel in Europe. However, his aims to integrate Sicily into the Empire as a second power base of the Hohenstaufen dynasty were not realised during his lifetime. The negotiations with Pope Celestine III to approve the unification (''unio regni ad imperium'') in return of another [[Crusade of 1197|crusade]] reached a deadlock. On the other hand, his beliefs of a universal rule according to the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' concept collided with the existence of the [[Byzantine Empire]], reflected in Henry's expansionist policies by forging alliances with King [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo I of Armenia]] and King [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Aimery of Cyprus]].\n\nIn 1195 Henry's envoys in [[Constantinople]] raised claims to former [[Italo-Norman]] possessions around [[Durr\u00ebs|Dyrrachium]] (Durr\u00ebs), one of the most important naval bases on the eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, and pressed for a contribution to the planned crusade. Upon the deposition of Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] Henry openly threatened with an attack on Byzantine territory.

However, he first again had to deal with the quarrels in the Wettin Margraviate of Meissen upon the death of Margrave Albert I. As Albert had tried to gain control over the adjacent [[Pleissnerland]], an Imperial Hohenstaufen territory, Henry took the occasion to deny the inheritance claims of the margrave's younger brother Theodoric and seized the Meissen territory for himself. In October he reconciled with Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen at [[Gelnhausen]] and was able to obtain the support of numerous Saxon and Thuringian nobles for his crusade which was scheduled to begin on Christmas 1196.\n\nHis next aim was to make the imperial crown [[Erbreichsplan|hereditary]]. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop [[Adolf of Altena|Adolf of Cologne]]. Spending the winter in [[Hagenau]] Castle, the emperor and his ''ministeriales'' evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would be willing to give up the ''[[Jus Spolii]]'' and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of ''[[sede vacante]]''. At the Diet of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://file.upi.edu/Direktori/FPBS/JUR._PEND._BAHASA_JERMAN/196111101985031-AMIR/Bahan_Ajar_dan_Silabus_Deutsche_Geschichte_2010/Sailer_und_Staufer.pdf |title= Hochmittelalter |publisher=  UPI |author=Alfred Haverkamp |date=  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWhile in July 1196 Henry proceeded to Burgundy and Italy in order to negotiate with Pope Celestine III, the resistance in Germany grew. At the following diet at [[Erfurt]] in October, a majority of the princes rejected the emperor's plans. Furthermore, the Pope, still concerned in view of the Hohenstaufen rule over Sicily, broke off the talks. Nevertheless, on Christmas Henry's son Frederick II was elected King of the Romans in Frankfurt.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:DSC00548 - Cattedrale - Tomba di Enrico VI + 1197 - Foto G.

He entered Sicily in March 1197 and applied himself to prepare his crusade in [[Messina]].\n\nSoon after, the tyrannical power of the foreign King in Italy spurred a revolt, especially around [[Catania]] and southern Sicily, which his German soldiers led by Markward of Annweiler and [[Henry of Kalden]] suppressed mercilessly. The rebels even sought to make Count [[Jordan Lupinus|Jordan of Bovino]] king in Henry's place. Even Queen Constance, provoked by the neglect of Henry and pitying her countrymen, joined the revolts against him and besieged him in a castle, forcing him into a treaty.<ref>[[Evelyn Jamison]], ''Admiral Eugenius of Sicily, His Life and Work and the Authorship of the ''Epistola ad Petrum'' and the ''Historia Hugonis Falcandi Siculi (London: 1957), pp. 158\u201359.</ref> In the midst of preparations Henry fell ill with [[chills]] while hunting near [[Fiumedinisi]] and on 28 September died, possibly of [[malaria]], in Messina,<ref>In 1197, although \"the well-prepared crusade of Emperor Henry VI aimed at winning the Holy Land, it also aimed at attaining the ancient goal of Norm[an] policy in the E[ast]: the conquest of the Byz[antine] Empire.\"  See Werner Hilgemann and Hermann Kinder, ''The Anchor Atlas of World History, Volume I: From the Stone Age to the Eve of the French Revolution'', trans.

However, a number of princes around Archbishop Adolf of Cologne elected the Welf [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], son of Henry the Lion, anti-king. To defend the claims of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, Frederick's uncle Philip of Swabia had himself elected King of the Romans in March 1198. The [[German throne dispute|German throne quarrel]] lasted nearly twenty years, until Frederick was again elected king in 1212 and Otto, defeated by the [[kingdom of France|French]] in the 1214 [[Battle of Bouvines]] and abandoned by his former allies, finally died in 1218.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:PfalzKaiserswert08.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ruins of the ''Kaiserpfalz'' in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth]], western front (\"interior\" view)]]\nDuring his rule in Germany, Henry moved from one ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' residence to another or\u2013to a lesser extent\u2013stayed at [[Prince-bishop]]'s sees in the tradititon of the medieval itinerant kingship. He concentrated on the [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconian]] core locations of his kingdom, while the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] lands were less subject to the central authority. His travel routes through Germany as well as his campaigns in Italy are documented by numerous deeds he issued year by year.\n\nThe emperor strongly relied on high-ranking clergy like the archbishops [[Philip I (archbishop of Cologne)|Philip of Cologne]] and [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]]. Several contemporary accounts of his life given by ecclesiastical chroniclers like [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] or [[Peter of Eboli]] in his ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'' (on the emperor's conquest of Sicily) paint a bright picture of Henry's rule; while the annals by [[Otto of Sankt Blasien]] are considered more objective. In his ''[[Arnoldi Chronica Slavorum]]'' the chronicler [[Arnold of L\u00fcbeck]] concentrates on the dispute between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties from a pronounced Welf perspective, while [[Gislebert of Mons]] tells of Henry's policies in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The Hohenstaufen rule in Italy and the Meezogiorno is documented by the chronicles of Archbishop [[Romuald Guarna|Romuald of Salerno]] and [[Richard of San Germano]]. Henry's conflict with King Richard I of England is rendered by [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Gervase of Tilbury]], expressing their negative attitudes towards the emperor.\n\nLater historians stressed the fact of Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback for the development of a German [[nation state]] begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as a man of his time; though a capable ruler he had to cope with the centrifugal forces of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

From 1194 he was also [[King of Sicily]].\n\nHe was the second son of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and his consort [[Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy|Beatrix of Burgundy]]. In 1186 he was married to [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance of Sicily]], the posthumous daughter of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman]] king [[Roger II of Sicily]]. Henry, stuck in the Hohenstaufen conflict with the [[House of Welf]] until 1194, had to enforce the inheritance claims by his wife against her nephew Count [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]]. Henry's attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] failed at the [[Siege of Naples (1191)|siege of Naples in 1191]] due to an epidemic, and following his retreat Empress Constance was captured. Based on an enormous ransom for the release of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]], he conquered Sicily in 1194; however, the intended unification with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ultimately failed due to the opposition of the [[Papacy]].\n\nHenry threatened to invade the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1194 and succeeded in extracting a ransom, the [[Alamanikon]], from Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] in return for cancelling the invasion. In 1195 and 1196 Henry attempted to turn the Holy Roman Empire from an elective to a hereditary monarchy, the so-called ''[[Erbreichsplan]]'', but met strong resistance from the [[prince-elector]]s and abandoned the plan. Henry pledged to go on [[crusade]] in 1195 and began preparations. A revolt in Sicily was crushed in 1197. The Crusaders set sail for the [[Holy Land]] that same year but Henry died of illness at [[Messina]] on 28 September 1197 before he could join them. His death plunged the Empire into the chaos of the [[German throne dispute]] for the next 17 years.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHenry was born in autumn 1165 at the ''Valkhof'' [[Kaiserpfalz|pfalz]] of [[Nijmegen]] to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Beatrix of Burgundy. At the age of four his father had him [[Prince-elector|elected]] [[King of the Romans]] during a ''[[Hoftag]]'' in [[Bamberg]] at [[Pentecost]] 1169. Henry was crowned on 15 August at [[Aachen Cathedral]].<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire'', (Harvard University Press, 2016), 307.</ref><ref>John B.

Henry was fluent in [[Latin]] and, according to the chronicler [[Alberic of Trois-Fontaines]], was \"distinguished by gifts of knowledge, wreathed in flowers of eloquence, and learned in canon and Roman law\". He was a patron of poets and poetry, and he almost certainly composed the song ''Kaiser Heinrich'', now among the [[Weingarten Abbey|Weingarten]] Song Manuscripts. According to his rank and with [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] (''Reichsadler''), [[Imperial regalia|regalia]], and a scroll, he is the first and foremost to be portrayed in the famous ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', a 14th-century songbook manuscript featuring 140 reputed poets; at least three poems are attributed to a young and romantically minded Henry VI. In one of those he describes a romance that makes him forget all his earthly power, and neither riches nor royal dignity can outweigh his yearning for that lady (''\u00ea ich mich ir verzige, ich verzige mich \u00ea der kr\u00f4ne'' \u2013 before I give her up, I'd rather give up the crown).\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=  \n|align=center\n|width=160\n|File:Arms of Swabia.svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen.\n|File:Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (Hohenstaufen).svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen as Holy Roman Emperor.\n|File:Attributed Coat and Shield of Arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Codex Manesse).svg|Attributed coat of arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (''Codex Manesse'').\n}}\n\n===Emperor's son===\nHaving returned to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] in 1178, Henry supported his father against insurgent Duke [[Henry the Lion]].

He and Constance were married on 27 January 1186 in [[Milan]].<ref>''The Marriage of Henry VI and Constance of Sicily: Prelude and Consequences'', Walter Frohlich, '''Anglo~Norman Studies: XV.

Back in Germany, he became sovereign ruler of the Empire, as his father had died while on the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190. Henry tried to secure his rule in the [[Low Countries]] by elevating Count [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin V of Hainaut]] to a [[margrave]] of [[County of Namur|Namur]], and at the same time he tried to reach a settlement with rivalling Duke [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry of Brabant]]. Further difficulties arose when the exiled Welf duke [[Henry the Lion]] returned from [[Kingdom of England|England]] and began to subdue large estates in his former [[Duchy of Saxony]]. A Hohenstaufen campaign to Saxony had to be abandoned when King Henry received the message of the death of King William II of Sicily on 18 November 1189. The Sicilian vice-chancellor [[Matthew of Ajello]] pursued the succession of Count Tancred of Lecce and gained the support of the [[Roman Curia]].\n\nTo assert his own rights in the inheritance dispute, Henry initially supported Tancred's rival Count [[Roger of Andria]] and made arrangements for a campaign to Italy. The next year he concluded a peace agreement with Henry the Lion at [[Fulda]] and moved farther southwards to [[Augsburg]], where he learned that his father had died on crusade attempting to cross the [[G\u00f6ksu|Saleph]] River near [[Silifke|Seleucia]] in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Cilicia]] (now part of [[Turkey]]) on 10 June 1190.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\">{{cite book|author=Horst Fuhrmann|title=Germany in the High Middle Ages: C.1050-1200 - pp. 181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlapxde55rAC|date=9 October 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31980-5}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[File:Friedrich-barbarossa-und-soehne-welfenchronik 1-1000x1540.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Barbarossa with his sons Henry and Frederick, ''Historia Welforum'', Weingarten Abbey, c. 1180]]\n[[File:Pope Coelestinus 4. crowning the Emperour Henricus 6. with his feete.gif|thumb|[[Pope Celestine III]] crowning Henry VI with his feet. He was only crowned after promising to cede [[Tusculum]].]]\nWhile he sent an Imperial army to Italy, Henry initially stayed in Germany to settle the succession of [[Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia]], who had also died on the Third Crusade. He had planned to seize the [[Thuringia]]n landgraviate as a reverted fief, but Louis' brother [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Hermann]] was able to reach his enfeoffment. The next year, the king followed his army across the [[Alps]]. In [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] he negotiated with [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], widow of King [[Henry II of England]], to break the engagement of her son King Richard with [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alys]], a daughter of late King [[Louis VII of France]]. He hoped to deteriorate English-French relations and to isolate Richard, who had offended him by backing Count Tancred in Sicily. Eleanor acted cleverly; she reached Henry's assurance that he would not interfere in her son's conflict with King [[Philip II of France]], and she would also prevent the marriage of Henry's younger brother [[Conrad II, Duke of Swabia|Conrad]] with [[Berengaria of Castile]] to confine the Hohenstaufen claims to power.\n\nHenry entered into further negotiations with the Lombard League cities and with [[Pope Celestine III]] on his [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial coronation]], and ceded [[Tusculum]] to the Pope. At Easter Monday on 15 April 1191, in [[Rome]], Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in [[Apulia]] and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's vassal [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege. Upon his retreat those cities had surrendered to him resubmitted to Tancred, and Constance, who was left in the palace of [[Salerno]] as a sign that he would soon return, was betrayed and handed over to Tancred.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nHenry had to return to Germany when he learned that Henry the Lion had again incited a conflict with the Saxon [[House of Ascania]] and the [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Counts of Schauenburg]]. His son [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry of Brunswick]] deserted from the Imperial army in Italy and was ostracized by the emperor at the ''Hoftag'' in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] at Pentecost 1192. However, Henry VI had to realise that his powers were limited: after his closest ally in Saxony, Archbishop [[Wichmann von Seeburg|Wichmann of Magdeburg]] died, he concluded another armistice with inflammatory Henry the Lion.\n\nMeanwille, despite his wife had been captured by Sicilians, Henry always refused Celestine III making peace with Tancred. While Tancred would not permit Constance to be ransomed unless Henry recognized him, Henry complained her capture to Celestine. In June 1192 Constance was released on the intervention of Pope Celestine III, who in return recognized Tancred as King of Sicily. Constance was to be sent to Rome for Celestine III to put pressure on Henry, but German soldiers managed to set up an ambush on the border of Papal States, releasing Constance.\n\n[[File:Heinrich 6 sigillum.jpg|thumb|Facsimile of the Imperial seal (1192)]]\n\nOn the other hand, the emperor was able to strengthen his power base in the [[Duchy of Swabia]], when he inherited the possessions of Henry the Lion's cousin [[Welf VI]]. During the election of a new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of L\u00fcttich]] he favored [[Albert de Rethel]] for Albert was a maternal-uncle of then-captive Empress Constance, whom both he and Constance had planned to be the next bishop of Liege, but the other candidate [[Albert of Louvain]] the brother of Duke Henry of Brabant gained more support. In January 1192 Henry claimed the election was under dispute and appointed his newly-made imperial chancellor [[Lothar of Hochstaden]], provost of the church of St Cassius in Bonn and brother of Count Dietrich of Hochstaden instead, and in September 1192 he proceeded to [[Li\u00e8ge|L\u00fcttich]] (Li\u00e8ge) to enforce the succession. The majority of the electors of Li\u00e8ge accepted the imperial decision because of the emperor's threat, and Albert de Rethel also relinquished and indignantly refused a financial settlement offered by the emperor. Albert of Louvain had to yield and sought support from the pope in Rome and from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archbishop of Reims]]. In [[Reims]], he took the holy orders with papal consent, but he was killed soon after by hired assassins. His brother Duke Henry chose to conclude a peace agreement with the emperor but remained a bitter enemy.\n\nEmperor Henry already was concerned with the deposition of the Welf supporter Archbishop [[Hartwig of Uthlede|Hartwig II of Bremen]]. He further had to arbitrate in a conflict in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] on the eastern border of the Empire, where the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margrave [[Albert I, Margrave of Meissen|Albert I]] had to fend off the claims raised by his brother [[Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen|Theoderic]] and Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia. Meanwhile, the opposition in the west took on a dramatic scale, when the dukes of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] joined forces with Archbishop [[Bruno III of Berg|Bruno III of Cologne]]. A massive confederacy against the emperor loomed ahead, including Archbishop [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]], Archchancellor of Germany, and Duke [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]], as well Henry's old rival Henry the Lion, the Swabian [[House of Z\u00e4hringen]], the [[Kingdom of England|English Crown]], and the pope, irritated by the killing of Albert of Louvain.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n===Capture of Richard the Lionheart===\n[[File:Heinrich VI. begnadigt Richard Loewenherz.jpg|thumb|Richard the Lionheart submits himself to Emperor Henry, ''Liber ad honorem Augusti'', fol. 129R]]\nAt this stage, Henry had a stroke of good fortune when the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]] gave him his prominent prisoner, [[Richard the Lionheart]], King of England, whom he had captured on his way back from the Third Crusade and arrested at [[Burgruine D\u00fcrnstein|D\u00fcrnstein Castle]]. On 28 March 1193, Richard was handed over to the emperor in [[Speyer]] and imprisoned at [[Trifels Castle]], taking revenge for Richard's alliance with Tancred of Lecce. Ignoring his nearly [[excommunication]] by Pope Celestine III for imprisoning a former crusader, he held the English King for a ransom of 150,000 silver marks and officially declared a dowry of Richard's niece [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]], who was to marry Duke Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The opposition [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] had to face the defeat of their mighty ally and to refrain from their plans to overthrow the Hohenstaufen dynasty.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyscotland.com/history/on-this-day-in-history-richard-the-lionheart-was-captured-by-leopold/ |title=On this day in history - Richard the Lionheart was captured by Leopold V of Austria |publisher=  History Scotland  |author= |date=December 20, 2011  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBacked by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, who successfully defended his interests against his rivaling brother [[John, King of England|John Lackland]] and his ally King Philip of France, King Richard procured his release in exchange for the huge ransom, a further interest payment, and his [[oath of allegiance]] to Henry. In turn the emperor under threat of military violence demanded the restitution of the French lands, which John had seized upon approval by Philip during Richard's absence. Henry not only gained another vassal and ally, he could also assume the role of a mediator between [[England]] and [[France]]. He and Richard ceremoniously reconciled at the ''Hoftag'' in Speyer during Holy Week 1194: the English King publicly regretted any hostilities, genuflected, and cast himself on the emperor's mercy. He was released and returned to England.<ref name=\"Purser2004\">{{cite book|author=Toby Purser|title=Medieval England, 1042-1228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBs0VlTA-qEC|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-32760-6}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Henry settled the longstanding conflict with the Welf dynasty when he secured the marriage of [[Agnes of Hohenstaufen]], daughter of his cousin Count Palatine [[Conrad, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Conrad]], to Henry the Lion's son Henry of Brunswick, followed by a peace agreement in March 1194.\n\n===Conquest of Sicily===\n[[File:Jind\u0159ich VI. obl\u00e9h\u00e1 Neapol (1191).jpg|thumb|left|Siege of Naples, [[Peter of Eboli]], ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'', 1196]]\n[[File:Woodcut illustration of Constance of Sicily, her husband HRE Henry VI and her son HRE Frederick II - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, depicting [[Constance of Sicily]], husband Henry VI and son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]]]\nMeanwhile, the situation in Southern Italy had grown worse: After Henry's defeat at Naples, Tancred's brother-in-law Count [[Richard, Count of Acerra|Richard of Acerra]] had reconquered large parts of Apulia, and Tancred himself had reached the allowance of his claims by the pope. Henry was granted free passage in Northern Italy, having forged an alliance with the Lombard communes. In February 1194, Tancred of Lecce died, leaving as heir a young boy, [[William III of Sicily|William III]], under the tutelage of his mother [[Sibylla of Acerra]]. In May Emperor Henry, based on King Richard's ransom, again set out for Italy. He reached Milan at Pentecost and occupied Naples in August. He met little resistance and on 20 November 1194 entered [[Palermo]] capital of Kingdom of Sicily and was crowned king on 25 December. On the next day his wife Constance, who had stayed back in [[Iesi]], gave birth to his only son and heir [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the future emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nThe young William and his mother Sibylla had fled to [[Caltabellotta]] Castle; he officially renounced the Sicilian kingdom in turn for the [[County of Lecce]] and the [[Principality of Capua]]. A few days after Henry's coronation, however, the royal family and several Norman nobles were accused of a coup attempt and arrested. Henry is said to have had William blinded and castrated, while many of his liensmen{{cfn|date=November 2019}} were [[death by burning|burned alive]]. Some, however, like the Siculo-Greek [[Eugene of Palermo]], transitioned into the new Hohenstaufen government with ease. William probably was deported to [[Hohenems|Altems]] (Hohenems) Castle in Swabia, where he died in captivity about 1198. To take revenge of the capture of his wife Henry hanged [[Richard, Count of Acerra]] brother of Sibylla in 1196.\n\nIn March 1195 Henry held a ''Hoftag'' in [[Bari]] and appointed his wife Constance Sicilian [[queen regnant]], though with Henry's liensman{{cfn|date=November 2019}} [[Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto|Conrad of Urslingen]], elevated to a hereditary [[Duchy of Spoleto|Duke of Spoleto]], as [[Imperial vicar]] to secure the emperor's position in Southern Italy. He placed further ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' in the Sicilian administration, like the [[Troia, Apulia|Troia]] bishop [[Walter of Palearia]] who became chancellor. His loyal henchman Markward von Annweiler was appointed a Duke of [[Ravenna]], placing him in a highly strategic position to control the route to Sicily via the Italian [[Romagna]] region and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. Henry's younger brother [[Philip of Swabia]] was vested with the large estates of late Margravine [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]] in [[March of Tuscany|Tuscany]]. The emperor also felt strong enough to send home the Pisan and Genoese ships without giving their governments the promised concessions.<ref name=\"Matthew1992\">{{cite book|author=Donald Matthew|title=The Norman Kingdom of Sicily - p. 290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQfub3l_ejkC|date=30 July 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26911-7}}</ref>\n\n===Universal ruler===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich VI. (HRR).jpg|thumb|Portrait from the ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', {{circa}} 1304]]\nAt that point, Emperor Henry was the most powerful monarch in the Mediterranean and Europe, since the Sicilian kingdom added to his personal and Imperial revenues an income without parallel in Europe. However, his aims to integrate Sicily into the Empire as a second power base of the Hohenstaufen dynasty were not realised during his lifetime. The negotiations with Pope Celestine III to approve the unification (''unio regni ad imperium'') in return of another [[Crusade of 1197|crusade]] reached a deadlock. On the other hand, his beliefs of a universal rule according to the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' concept collided with the existence of the [[Byzantine Empire]], reflected in Henry's expansionist policies by forging alliances with King [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo I of Armenia]] and King [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Aimery of Cyprus]].\n\nIn 1195 Henry's envoys in [[Constantinople]] raised claims to former [[Italo-Norman]] possessions around [[Durr\u00ebs|Dyrrachium]] (Durr\u00ebs), one of the most important naval bases on the eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, and pressed for a contribution to the planned crusade. Upon the deposition of Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] Henry openly threatened with an attack on Byzantine territory. He already evolved plans to betroth his younger brother Philip to Isaac's daughter Princess [[Irene Angelina]] \u2014deliberately or not\u2014 opening up a perspective to unite the Western and Eastern Empire under Hohenstaufen rule. According to the contemporary historian [[Niketas Choniates]] his legates were able to collect [[Alamanikon|a large tribute]] from Isaac's brother and successor [[Alexios III Angelos|Alexios III]], which, however, was not paid before Henry's death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/6w924c14h |title=Byzantium confronts the West, 1180-1204 |publisher=  History Scotland  |author=Charles M.

''La Serenissima'' had suspiciously eyed Henry's claims to Adriatic ports threatening her dominating position and commercial interests in the region. The emperor had to culminate the conflict by arranging a peace treaty and confirming the Venetian autonomy.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/1777/Brubaker_uta_2502M_10368.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |title= BYZANTINE DIPLOMACY AND THE DECLINE IN RELATIONS WITH THE WEST  FROM 962 TO 1204 |publisher=  University of Texas  |author=Jeff Brubaker |date=  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Hereditary monarchy===\n{{main|Erbreichsplan}}\nIn summer 1195 Henry returned to Germany, in order to call for support to launch his crusade and to arrange his succession in the case of his death. However, he first again had to deal with the quarrels in the Wettin Margraviate of Meissen upon the death of Margrave Albert I. As Albert had tried to gain control over the adjacent [[Pleissnerland]], an Imperial Hohenstaufen territory, Henry took the occasion to deny the inheritance claims of the margrave's younger brother Theodoric and seized the Meissen territory for himself. In October he reconciled with Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen at [[Gelnhausen]] and was able to obtain the support of numerous Saxon and Thuringian nobles for his crusade which was scheduled to begin on Christmas 1196.\n\nHis next aim was to make the imperial crown [[Erbreichsplan|hereditary]]. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop [[Adolf of Altena|Adolf of Cologne]]. Spending the winter in [[Hagenau]] Castle, the emperor and his ''ministeriales'' evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would be willing to give up the ''[[Jus Spolii]]'' and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of ''[[sede vacante]]''. At the Diet of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://file.upi.edu/Direktori/FPBS/JUR._PEND._BAHASA_JERMAN/196111101985031-AMIR/Bahan_Ajar_dan_Silabus_Deutsche_Geschichte_2010/Sailer_und_Staufer.pdf |title= Hochmittelalter |publisher=  UPI |author=Alfred Haverkamp |date=  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWhile in July 1196 Henry proceeded to Burgundy and Italy in order to negotiate with Pope Celestine III, the resistance in Germany grew. At the following diet at [[Erfurt]] in October, a majority of the princes rejected the emperor's plans. Furthermore, the Pope, still concerned in view of the Hohenstaufen rule over Sicily, broke off the talks. Nevertheless, on Christmas Henry's son Frederick II was elected King of the Romans in Frankfurt.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:DSC00548 - Cattedrale - Tomba di Enrico VI + 1197 - Foto G. Dall'Orto.jpg|thumb|Henry's grave in the Cathedral of Palermo]]\n\nAt the same time, the emperor stayed in [[Capua]], where he had Count Richard of Acerra, held in custody by his ''ministerialis'' [[Dipold, Count of Acerra|Dipold von Schweinspeunt]], cruelly executed. He entered Sicily in March 1197 and applied himself to prepare his crusade in [[Messina]].\n\nSoon after, the tyrannical power of the foreign King in Italy spurred a revolt, especially around [[Catania]] and southern Sicily, which his German soldiers led by Markward of Annweiler and [[Henry of Kalden]] suppressed mercilessly. The rebels even sought to make Count [[Jordan Lupinus|Jordan of Bovino]] king in Henry's place. Even Queen Constance, provoked by the neglect of Henry and pitying her countrymen, joined the revolts against him and besieged him in a castle, forcing him into a treaty.<ref>[[Evelyn Jamison]], ''Admiral Eugenius of Sicily, His Life and Work and the Authorship of the ''Epistola ad Petrum'' and the ''Historia Hugonis Falcandi Siculi (London: 1957), pp. 158\u201359.</ref> In the midst of preparations Henry fell ill with [[chills]] while hunting near [[Fiumedinisi]] and on 28 September died, possibly of [[malaria]], in Messina,<ref>In 1197, although \"the well-prepared crusade of Emperor Henry VI aimed at winning the Holy Land, it also aimed at attaining the ancient goal of Norm[an] policy in the E[ast]: the conquest of the Byz[antine] Empire.\"  See Werner Hilgemann and Hermann Kinder, ''The Anchor Atlas of World History, Volume I: From the Stone Age to the Eve of the French Revolution'', trans.

However, a number of princes around Archbishop Adolf of Cologne elected the Welf [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], son of Henry the Lion, anti-king. To defend the claims of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, Frederick's uncle Philip of Swabia had himself elected King of the Romans in March 1198. The [[German throne dispute|German throne quarrel]] lasted nearly twenty years, until Frederick was again elected king in 1212 and Otto, defeated by the [[kingdom of France|French]] in the 1214 [[Battle of Bouvines]] and abandoned by his former allies, finally died in 1218.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:PfalzKaiserswert08.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ruins of the ''Kaiserpfalz'' in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth]], western front (\"interior\" view)]]\nDuring his rule in Germany, Henry moved from one ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' residence to another or\u2013to a lesser extent\u2013stayed at [[Prince-bishop]]'s sees in the tradititon of the medieval itinerant kingship. He concentrated on the [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconian]] core locations of his kingdom, while the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] lands were less subject to the central authority. His travel routes through Germany as well as his campaigns in Italy are documented by numerous deeds he issued year by year.\n\nThe emperor strongly relied on high-ranking clergy like the archbishops [[Philip I (archbishop of Cologne)|Philip of Cologne]] and [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]]. Several contemporary accounts of his life given by ecclesiastical chroniclers like [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] or [[Peter of Eboli]] in his ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'' (on the emperor's conquest of Sicily) paint a bright picture of Henry's rule; while the annals by [[Otto of Sankt Blasien]] are considered more objective. In his ''[[Arnoldi Chronica Slavorum]]'' the chronicler [[Arnold of L\u00fcbeck]] concentrates on the dispute between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties from a pronounced Welf perspective, while [[Gislebert of Mons]] tells of Henry's policies in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The Hohenstaufen rule in Italy and the Meezogiorno is documented by the chronicles of Archbishop [[Romuald Guarna|Romuald of Salerno]] and [[Richard of San Germano]]. Henry's conflict with King Richard I of England is rendered by [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Gervase of Tilbury]], expressing their negative attitudes towards the emperor.\n\nLater historians stressed the fact of Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback for the development of a German [[nation state]] begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as a man of his time; though a capable ruler he had to cope with the centrifugal forces of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

They were initially classified 7F, but this was later changed to the more familiar 8F.\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the design was chosen to become the country's standard freight design, reprising the role the [[GCR Class 8K]] had in the [[World War I|First World War]].  The [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] had 208 8Fs built by [[Beyer Peacock]] and [[North British Locomotive Company]] and [[requisitioned]] 51 more.\n\nStanier 8F production for the WD continued until 1943, when the cheaper [[WD Austerity 2-8-0]] was introduced.  Production for British domestic use continued until 1946.\n\n== Construction ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Order\n! Builder\n! Delivered\n! Quantity\n! Original Numbers\n!

However, most of them did see wartime military service overseas in [[Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iran]] and [[Italy]].  Many of these locomotives were later sold to the local railways in these countries, and some were also sold to [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\">Tourret, R., 1995, ''Allied Military Locomotives of the Second World War'', Abingdon: Tourrett Publishing.</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nThe British Army's [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] (MEF) in Egypt received 42 8Fs in 1941-42, with some having been lost at sea en route (246-304, 322, 370, 371, 415, 416, 428, 429, 444 & 445)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\">HaRakevet: Rothschild PhD, Rabbi Walter (march 1991), ROD 2-8-0s in Palestina, 11942-1946. Issue 12</ref> possibly on the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.<ref>In the fins of Cousteau \u2026 The S.S. Thistlegorm and its incredible cargo</ref>  Some of these were loaned to [[Egyptian State Railways]] (ESR) and the others were used by the MEF on the Western Desert Extension Railway (WDER).  The scarcity of water made steam locomotive operations on the WDER difficult, and their smoke also attracted unwanted attention from enemy aircraft, so once American diesels began to arrive from late 1942 the use of 8Fs on the WDER declined.  Forty locomotives were sold to ESR in 1942-44.  The other two locomotives had accident damage, and were made into one good locomotive which was also sold to ESR in 1945.  The remains of the last locomotive were bought by ESR for spares in 1946.\n\nThe MEF received another 50 8Fs from Iran in 1944, for use in both Egypt and Palestine, although 15 of these were transferred to Italy later in the year.  Some of the 50 were not in operational condition, and 4 were scrapped by the MEF in 1946 without further use.  Another 59 former Iranian 8Fs were transferred to the MEF in 1946, most of which were initially used in Palestine.  This brought the number of 8Fs in the Middle East Forces up to 90.\n\nAfter the war the British military presence in the region waned, so the need for military locomotives declined. The MEF's fleet was largely sold off in 1947-48 to British Railways (39), Palestine Railways (24) and ESR (11).  Five returned to Britain for continued WD use in 1952.  MEF railway operation ended in 1954, with 10 8Fs being sold to ESR, and 1 scrapped by MEF following bomb damage.\n\nESR thus purchased a total of 62 8Fs from MEF between 1942 and 1954, and operated the type until 1963.\n\n===Iran===\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupation of Iran]] in 1941, WD locomotives were required to operate the [[Persian Corridor]] supply route, delivering war materials to the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]].  163 8F were dispatched to Iran in 1941-42, but only 143 arrived (12 being lost at sea (246-444, 445, 608, 617, 619, 622 (latter 4 former [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] 8066, 8068, 8071, 8087)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" />) and 8 returned to Britain with sea damage).  These operated as [[Iranian Railways|Iranian State Railways']] Class 41.{{sfn|Hughes|1981|p=124}}\n\nThe arrival of [[Transportation Corps|US Army Transportation Corps]] units in Iran with their own locomotives (including diesels which were more suitable for use in desert regions) made many of the 8Fs redundant, and 50 locomotives were transferred to the [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] in 1944.  At the end of the war the need for steam locomotives in Iran was further reduced and another 71 locomotives left for the MEF (59) and Iraq (12) in 1945-48.  The remaining 22 locomotives in Iran had all been withdrawn by 1963.\n\n===Iraq===\nTen WD locomotives were transferred from Iran in 1946-47, being purchased by [[Iraqi State Railways]] in 1947, and two more locomotive were purchased from Iran in 1948.

In 1947 24 MEF 8Fs were sold to [[Palestine Railways#World War II locomotives|Palestine Railways]].  Following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] 23 of these locomotives were taken over by [[Israel Railways]], being operated until 1958. The war stranded the other 8F, 70372 (NBL works no. 24680),{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=132}} on a small section of the main line near [[Tulkarm]] on the West Bank side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice line]].{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=69}} It remained there, increasingly derelict, until after the [[Six-Day War|1967 Israeli invasion]] of the West Bank.  The Israelis finally removed and scrapped it in about 1973.{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=70}}\n\n===Turkey===\nTwenty five new WD locomotives were sold to [[Turkish State Railways|Turkish State Railways (TCDD)]] in 1941 for diplomatic reasons, but seven of these were lost at sea en route (246-338, 343-345, 354-356.<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" /> 345 sunk when the {{SS|Jesmore}} collided with ''Baron Pentland'' on 16 February 1941). Two more locomotives were delivered in 1943, making a total of 20.  These served as the [[TCDD 45151 Class]], operating until the 1980s.\n\n==War Department use in UK==\nWith their intended role in France having ceased to exist, early WD 8Fs were loaned to British railway companies in 1940-42, being given temporary numbers in the LMS series.  However, by late 1941 the need for locomotives in Iran and Egypt was such that all of the WD locomotives which had been completed up to that point were recalled for military service, and 50 more locomotives were requisitioned from the LMS.  Locomotive WD 407 (LMS 8293) had been damaged in an accident whilst on loan to the Great Western Railway, so a 51st LMS engine was requisitioned as a replacement.<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\"/>\n\nBy 1942 the need for locomotives overseas had been satisfied, and the final 24 new WD 8Fs remained in the UK on loan to LMS.  Also remaining in the UK were nine damaged locomotives (WD 407 and 8 requisitioned locomotives whose voyage to Iran had been aborted after the {{SS|Pentridge Hill|1941|6}} suffered severe storm damage \u2013 4 other locomotives had had to be jettisoned into the sea to save the ship).  Two locomotives were sold to Turkey in 1944, and the other 31 were sold to the LMS in 1943.\n\nIn 1952 five WD 8Fs returned to the UK from the MEF in poor condition.  These were refurbished for WD use at the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] (LMR).  Three of these were sold to British Railways in 1957 becoming Nos. 48773-75.  The other two were transferred to the [[Cairnryan Harbour|Cairnryan Military Railway]] and were scrapped in 1959, ending the WD's use of 8F locomotives.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 21 January 1941, Locomotive No. 8247 of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] was derailed at Wallneuk Junction, [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]].

A further 245 were built by the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], [[Great Western Railway]] and [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] in 1943-45 for LMS stock, though mostly retained on loan by the other railways during the war.  The LNER also purchased 68 Stanier 8Fs for its own use in 1944-46, classifying them [[LNER Class O6|O6]], though these were also sold to the LMS after the war.  As noted above, 51 LMS locomotives were requisitioned by the WD in 1941, but 31 WD locomotives were subsequently purchased by the LMS in 1943 (including 8 of the requisitioned engines).\n\n===British Railways===\nAs a result, 624 8Fs passed into [[British Rail]]ways ownership when Britain's railways were [[Transport Act 1947|nationalised]] in 1948.  A further 39 (10 requisitioned) were purchased from MEF stock in 1948, and a final 3 (1 requisitioned) from the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] in 1957, bringing the total to 666.  The 8Fs were concentrated on the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]], but were also allocated to former LMS sheds on other regions.  Despite some having operated in Scotland by the LMS, they were not common on the [[Scottish Region of British Railways|Scottish Region]] under BR ownership as the later WD 'Austerity' 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 types were used instead.\n\n8F No. 48600 was used in the 1953 [[Glenn Ford]] film ''[[Time Bomb (1953 film)|Time Bomb]]'', also called ''[[Terror on a Train]]''.\n\n===Withdrawal===\n[[File:Withdrawn Stanier 8Fs at Newton Heath.jpg|thumb|right|250px|End of the line: withdrawn 8Fs in spring 1968 at Newton Heath, Manchester awaiting scrapping]]\nThe 8Fs were successful and durable locomotives in BR service, with all 666 locomotives surviving until 1960 and routine withdrawals not beginning until 1964. The first to go in 1960 was 48616, followed two years later by 48009. 48773\u201348775 (the former Longmoor Military Railway locomotives which were the only 8Fs on the Scottish Region) were also withdrawn in 1962, but these were reinstated into London Midland Region stock in 1963. The remaining 664 were withdrawn between 1964 and 1968, with 150 surviving to the last year of steam on BR.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, no. 48773 had diagonal yellow stripes painted on the cabsides to indicate that it could not run south of Crewe due to it being out of gauge for the new 25\u00a0kV AC overhead electrification.{{sfn|Hunt|Jennison|James|Essery|2005|p=117}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!

None of the prewar 8Fs survived into preservation. Of the six LMS/BR locomotives that exist only 48773 was purchased directly from BR for preservation following withdrawal from Rose Grove in July 1968, the remaining five including 48518 which would later be used as a donor engine were all rescued from Barry Scrapyard. Three members of the class have over the years been repatriated to the UK from Turkey, with one later sent to a museum in Israel. Two of the Turkish based 8F's which were to be repatriated to the UK no's 45166 & 45170 made an appearance on the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] tv programme [[Monster Moves]],<ref>http://www.windfallfilms.com/show/1756/monster-moves-episode-3-titanic-trains.aspx Monster Moves, Windfall Films</ref> this episode showed the two engines being moved 850 miles by rail across Turkey from [[Sivas]] to [[Izmir]]. 45166 would later end up in Israel as a static exhibit while 45170 is presently under restoration at Bo'ness. In addition, two Turkish Railway (TCDD) locomotives have been preserved in Turkey, and some more remain there in a derelict state. One locomotive has even survived in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.ajg41.plus.com/iraq/locomotives.html#steam Railways of Iraq: Locomotives and rolling stock in Iraq]</ref> The complete list is shown below. Two more are also visible underwater on the wreck of the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.\n\nOf the fourteen engines known to have survived into preservation, all the British located examples except 48173 & 45170 \u201cSir William McAlpine\u201d have run in preservation (both are undergoing restoration). Two of the British-based engines have even seen main line operation: Nos. 48151 and 48773. These have been regular main line performers in recent years with 48773 being withdrawn from operation in 2000. As of 2019 none of the class are operational on the main line.\n\nSome of the preserved examples have stars on their cabsides indicating that they have specially balanced wheelsets/motion. This practice began under the auspices of British Railways, to denote that locomotives thus treated were able to work fast, vacuum-braked goods services.<ref>Foster, Michael (1998).

They were initially classified 7F, but this was later changed to the more familiar 8F.\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the design was chosen to become the country's standard freight design, reprising the role the [[GCR Class 8K]] had in the [[World War I|First World War]].  The [[War Department (United Kingdom)|War Department]] had 208 8Fs built by [[Beyer Peacock]] and [[North British Locomotive Company]] and [[requisitioned]] 51 more.\n\nStanier 8F production for the WD continued until 1943, when the cheaper [[WD Austerity 2-8-0]] was introduced.  Production for British domestic use continued until 1946.\n\n== Construction ==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Order\n! Builder\n! Delivered\n! Quantity\n! Original Numbers\n!

However, most of them did see wartime military service overseas in [[Egypt]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Iran]] and [[Italy]].  Many of these locomotives were later sold to the local railways in these countries, and some were also sold to [[Turkey]] and [[Iraq]].<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\">Tourret, R., 1995, ''Allied Military Locomotives of the Second World War'', Abingdon: Tourrett Publishing.</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nThe British Army's [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] (MEF) in Egypt received 42 8Fs in 1941-42, with some having been lost at sea en route (246-304, 322, 370, 371, 415, 416, 428, 429, 444 & 445)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\">HaRakevet: Rothschild PhD, Rabbi Walter (march 1991), ROD 2-8-0s in Palestina, 11942-1946. Issue 12</ref> possibly on the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.<ref>In the fins of Cousteau \u2026 The S.S. Thistlegorm and its incredible cargo</ref>  Some of these were loaned to [[Egyptian State Railways]] (ESR) and the others were used by the MEF on the Western Desert Extension Railway (WDER).  The scarcity of water made steam locomotive operations on the WDER difficult, and their smoke also attracted unwanted attention from enemy aircraft, so once American diesels began to arrive from late 1942 the use of 8Fs on the WDER declined.  Forty locomotives were sold to ESR in 1942-44.  The other two locomotives had accident damage, and were made into one good locomotive which was also sold to ESR in 1945.  The remains of the last locomotive were bought by ESR for spares in 1946.\n\nThe MEF received another 50 8Fs from Iran in 1944, for use in both Egypt and Palestine, although 15 of these were transferred to Italy later in the year.  Some of the 50 were not in operational condition, and 4 were scrapped by the MEF in 1946 without further use.  Another 59 former Iranian 8Fs were transferred to the MEF in 1946, most of which were initially used in Palestine.  This brought the number of 8Fs in the Middle East Forces up to 90.\n\nAfter the war the British military presence in the region waned, so the need for military locomotives declined. The MEF's fleet was largely sold off in 1947-48 to British Railways (39), Palestine Railways (24) and ESR (11).  Five returned to Britain for continued WD use in 1952.  MEF railway operation ended in 1954, with 10 8Fs being sold to ESR, and 1 scrapped by MEF following bomb damage.\n\nESR thus purchased a total of 62 8Fs from MEF between 1942 and 1954, and operated the type until 1963.\n\n===Iran===\nFollowing the [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|occupation of Iran]] in 1941, WD locomotives were required to operate the [[Persian Corridor]] supply route, delivering war materials to the Soviet Union via the [[Trans-Iranian Railway]].  163 8F were dispatched to Iran in 1941-42, but only 143 arrived (12 being lost at sea (246-444, 445, 608, 617, 619, 622 (latter 4 former [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] 8066, 8068, 8071, 8087)<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" />) and 8 returned to Britain with sea damage).  These operated as [[Iranian Railways|Iranian State Railways']] Class 41.{{sfn|Hughes|1981|p=124}}\n\nThe arrival of [[Transportation Corps|US Army Transportation Corps]] units in Iran with their own locomotives (including diesels which were more suitable for use in desert regions) made many of the 8Fs redundant, and 50 locomotives were transferred to the [[Middle East Command|Middle East Forces]] in 1944.  At the end of the war the need for steam locomotives in Iran was further reduced and another 71 locomotives left for the MEF (59) and Iraq (12) in 1945-48.  The remaining 22 locomotives in Iran had all been withdrawn by 1963.\n\n===Iraq===\nTen WD locomotives were transferred from Iran in 1946-47, being purchased by [[Iraqi State Railways]] in 1947, and two more locomotive were purchased from Iran in 1948.

In 1947 24 MEF 8Fs were sold to [[Palestine Railways#World War II locomotives|Palestine Railways]].  Following the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] 23 of these locomotives were taken over by [[Israel Railways]], being operated until 1958. The war stranded the other 8F, 70372 (NBL works no. 24680),{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=132}} on a small section of the main line near [[Tulkarm]] on the West Bank side of the [[Green Line (Israel)|1949 Armistice line]].{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=69}} It remained there, increasingly derelict, until after the [[Six-Day War|1967 Israeli invasion]] of the West Bank.  The Israelis finally removed and scrapped it in about 1973.{{sfn|Cotterell|1984|p=70}}\n\n===Turkey===\nTwenty five new WD locomotives were sold to [[Turkish State Railways|Turkish State Railways (TCDD)]] in 1941 for diplomatic reasons, but seven of these were lost at sea en route (246-338, 343-345, 354-356.<ref name=\"HaRakevet 12\" /> 345 sunk when the {{SS|Jesmore}} collided with ''Baron Pentland'' on 16 February 1941). Two more locomotives were delivered in 1943, making a total of 20.  These served as the [[TCDD 45151 Class]], operating until the 1980s.\n\n==War Department use in UK==\nWith their intended role in France having ceased to exist, early WD 8Fs were loaned to British railway companies in 1940-42, being given temporary numbers in the LMS series.  However, by late 1941 the need for locomotives in Iran and Egypt was such that all of the WD locomotives which had been completed up to that point were recalled for military service, and 50 more locomotives were requisitioned from the LMS.  Locomotive WD 407 (LMS 8293) had been damaged in an accident whilst on loan to the Great Western Railway, so a 51st LMS engine was requisitioned as a replacement.<ref name=\"Tourret, R. 1995\"/>\n\nBy 1942 the need for locomotives overseas had been satisfied, and the final 24 new WD 8Fs remained in the UK on loan to LMS.  Also remaining in the UK were nine damaged locomotives (WD 407 and 8 requisitioned locomotives whose voyage to Iran had been aborted after the {{SS|Pentridge Hill|1941|6}} suffered severe storm damage \u2013 4 other locomotives had had to be jettisoned into the sea to save the ship).  Two locomotives were sold to Turkey in 1944, and the other 31 were sold to the LMS in 1943.\n\nIn 1952 five WD 8Fs returned to the UK from the MEF in poor condition.  These were refurbished for WD use at the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] (LMR).  Three of these were sold to British Railways in 1957 becoming Nos. 48773-75.  The other two were transferred to the [[Cairnryan Harbour|Cairnryan Military Railway]] and were scrapped in 1959, ending the WD's use of 8F locomotives.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 21 January 1941, Locomotive No. 8247 of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] was derailed at Wallneuk Junction, [[Paisley, Renfrewshire]].

A further 245 were built by the [[London and North Eastern Railway]], [[Great Western Railway]] and [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] in 1943-45 for LMS stock, though mostly retained on loan by the other railways during the war.  The LNER also purchased 68 Stanier 8Fs for its own use in 1944-46, classifying them [[LNER Class O6|O6]], though these were also sold to the LMS after the war.  As noted above, 51 LMS locomotives were requisitioned by the WD in 1941, but 31 WD locomotives were subsequently purchased by the LMS in 1943 (including 8 of the requisitioned engines).\n\n===British Railways===\nAs a result, 624 8Fs passed into [[British Rail]]ways ownership when Britain's railways were [[Transport Act 1947|nationalised]] in 1948.  A further 39 (10 requisitioned) were purchased from MEF stock in 1948, and a final 3 (1 requisitioned) from the [[Longmoor Military Railway]] in 1957, bringing the total to 666.  The 8Fs were concentrated on the [[London Midland Region of British Railways|London Midland Region]], but were also allocated to former LMS sheds on other regions.  Despite some having operated in Scotland by the LMS, they were not common on the [[Scottish Region of British Railways|Scottish Region]] under BR ownership as the later WD 'Austerity' 2-8-0 and 2-10-0 types were used instead.\n\n8F No. 48600 was used in the 1953 [[Glenn Ford]] film ''[[Time Bomb (1953 film)|Time Bomb]]'', also called ''[[Terror on a Train]]''.\n\n===Withdrawal===\n[[File:Withdrawn Stanier 8Fs at Newton Heath.jpg|thumb|right|250px|End of the line: withdrawn 8Fs in spring 1968 at Newton Heath, Manchester awaiting scrapping]]\nThe 8Fs were successful and durable locomotives in BR service, with all 666 locomotives surviving until 1960 and routine withdrawals not beginning until 1964. The first to go in 1960 was 48616, followed two years later by 48009. 48773\u201348775 (the former Longmoor Military Railway locomotives which were the only 8Fs on the Scottish Region) were also withdrawn in 1962, but these were reinstated into London Midland Region stock in 1963. The remaining 664 were withdrawn between 1964 and 1968, with 150 surviving to the last year of steam on BR.\n\nDuring the late 1960s, no. 48773 had diagonal yellow stripes painted on the cabsides to indicate that it could not run south of Crewe due to it being out of gauge for the new 25\u00a0kV AC overhead electrification.{{sfn|Hunt|Jennison|James|Essery|2005|p=117}}\n\n{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n!

None of the prewar 8Fs survived into preservation. Of the six LMS/BR locomotives that exist only 48773 was purchased directly from BR for preservation following withdrawal from Rose Grove in July 1968, the remaining five including 48518 which would later be used as a donor engine were all rescued from Barry Scrapyard. Three members of the class have over the years been repatriated to the UK from Turkey, with one later sent to a museum in Israel. Two of the Turkish based 8F's which were to be repatriated to the UK no's 45166 & 45170 made an appearance on the [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] tv programme [[Monster Moves]],<ref>http://www.windfallfilms.com/show/1756/monster-moves-episode-3-titanic-trains.aspx Monster Moves, Windfall Films</ref> this episode showed the two engines being moved 850 miles by rail across Turkey from [[Sivas]] to [[Izmir]]. 45166 would later end up in Isreal as a static exhibit while 45170 is presently under restoration at Bo'ness. In addition, two Turkish Railway (TCDD) locomotives have been preserved in Turkey, and some more remain there in a derelict state. One locomotive has even survived in Iraq.<ref>[http://www.ajg41.plus.com/iraq/locomotives.html#steam Railways of Iraq: Locomotives and rolling stock in Iraq]</ref> The complete list is shown below. Two more are also visible underwater on the wreck of the {{SS|Thistlegorm}}.\n\nOf the fourteen engines known to have survived into preservation, all the British located examples except 48173 & 45170 \u201cSir William McAlpine\u201d have run in preservation (both are undergoing restoration). Two of the British-based engines have even seen main line operation: Nos. 48151 and 48773. These have been regular main line performers in recent years with 48773 being withdrawn from operation in 2000. As of 2019 none of the class are operational on the main line.\n\nSome of the preserved examples have stars on their cabsides indicating that they have specially balanced wheelsets/motion. This practice began under the auspices of British Railways, to denote that locomotives thus treated were able to work fast, vacuum-braked goods services.<ref>Foster, Michael (1998).

The incumbent governor of the province is [[Saud bin Nayef Al Saud|Prince Saud bin Nayef Al Saud]]. Other populous cities in the province include [[Hofuf]], Mubarraz, [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]], [[Jubail]] and [[Khobar]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/saudi-arabia-population/cities/|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Rub al Khali 002.JPG|thumb|248x248px|The [[Rub' al Khali|Rub' al-Khali]] or Empty Quarter, comprises more than a third of the Eastern Province]]\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun empire-slide.gif|thumb|335x335px|The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] expanded the Muslim world into three continents within 20 years of the death of [[Muhammad]]]]\n\n=== Lakhmid and Sasanian rule (300-623 AD) ===\nThe northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids. Much of the Eastern Province was under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule at the time of [[Muhammad|Muhammad.]] The entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] fell into Muslim hands during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], after [[Muhammad]]'s death. \n[[File:IbnSaud.jpg|thumb|[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Ibn Saud]] is largely accepted to be the founder of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]], also known as the Third Saudi State]]\n\n=== Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (623-899 AD) ===\nThe region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates.\n\n=== Qarmatian rule (899-1076 AD) ===\nDuring the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids. The Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. The region was mostly overlooked until the 1500s, when the [[Jabrids]] took over around 1507 AD, but they too fell due to internal conflicts in or around the 1540s.\n\n=== Ottoman invasions (1551-1671 AD) ===\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671.\n\n=== The Saudi era (1751 AD-present) ===\nThe region has stayed in Muslims hands since. In the late 1800s, during the period of the [[Second Saudi State]], the area came into Saudi control for the first time from Ottoman hands, before briefly being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then retaken by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] after the in 1913, which was later consolidated into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] under [[Ibn Saud]] on September 23, 1932.\n\nDue to the significance of the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], the region around the oasis, which comprises much of modern-day [[Hofuf]] and its surrounding areas, was simply known as ''al-Ahsa''' and the region around present-day [[Bahrain]] and the [[Greater Dammam]] area was simply known as ''al-Bahran'' from pre-Islamic times.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals.

As such, the Eastern Province, being the province with most of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves enjoys a high economic position. [[Saudi Aramco]], the [[government-owned corporation|state-owned]] oil company of Saudi Arabia and an organization of major significance in the [[petroleum industry]], is based in [[Dhahran]] in [[Greater Dammam]]. It became the fifth company in the world to reach a [[market capitalization]] of $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) on December 11, 2019. After going public the same day in what is considered the largest [[IPO|public offering]] ever as of December 2019, the next day, on December 12, 2019, the company reached a market cap of $2 trillion, becoming the first and only company in the world to break the record<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/investing/saudi-aramco-2-trillion/index.html|title=The world has its first $2 trillion company.

Petroleum is refined in various refineries spread across the kingdom and shipped to dozens of countries from port cities such as [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]]. The East\u2013West pipeline enables efficient transport of oil from the eastern oil fields and refineries to the western refineries and ports, such as [[Rabigh]] and [[Jeddah]].\n\nSaudi Arabia's largest agricultural product, dates, also forms a large part of the province's economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oasis of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa]] to be sold in and around the kingdom.\n\n==Transportation==\nDammam's [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area, is the only airport in the entire Eastern Province with scheduled international flights. Located 30&nbsp;km northwest of the city, the airport is the primary air hub of the Eastern Province. Dammam is well connected by air with other cities in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Other airports in the province include [[Al-Ahsa International Airport|Ahsa International Airport]] and [[Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport|Qaisumah-Hafr Al Batin Airport]]. Saudi Aramco has a separate terminal at the King Fahd International Airport for their employees and aircraft with scheduled flights to [[Shaybah]], [[Yanbu]], Jeddah and other sites where the company is active.\n\nBuilt in the 1940s, the [[King Abdul Aziz Port|King Abdulaziz Sea Port]], located on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], is the second largest and second busiest port in [[Saudi Arabia]], after the [[Jeddah Islamic Port]] in Jeddah. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf. The port is equipped with 56 multi-purpose hoists, 8 container cranes, and 524 tanker containers.\n\nHighway 95 (Route 5M) connects [[Khafji]] on the [[Kuwait|Kuwaiti]] border in the north to the Ramlah border station on the [[Oman|Omani]] border in the south via [[Jubail]], [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]], the [[Dammam metropolitan area]], the Salwa border station on the [[Qatar|Qatari]] border and the Batha' border station with the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Highway 40 (Route 80M) connects [[Bahrain]] and [[Dammam]] via the 25 km (15 mi) [[King Fahd Causeway]] over the [[Persian Gulf]] and onward to [[Jeddah]] on the [[Red Sea]] via [[Riyadh]], [[Ta'if]] and [[Makkah]]. Highways 605, 610, 613, 614, 615, 617 and 619, known locally by other popular names, connect the Greater Dammam area to Ra's Tanura, Jubail, the King Fahd International Airport, [[Abqaiq]] and [[Hofuf]].\n\nIntercity bus services are operated in the province by the Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO). [[Umrah]] and [[Hajj]] shuttle services are also provided to residents of the kingdom by private contractors. Shuttle services also connect the [[Dammam metropolitan area]] to the [[Bahrain International Airport]], northeast of [[Manama]] in Bahrain.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian railways are managed by two separate organizations, the [[Saudi Railways Organization]] and [[Saudi Railway Company]]. The lines in the Eastern Province, two lines, one passenger, which runs from Dammam to Riyadh via Abqaiq an Hofuf, and the other freight, which runs directly from Dammam to Riyadh, are managed by the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO).\n\nA plan to build a [[Dammam Metro|metro]] in Dammam is also in the works.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{see also|Regions of Saudi Arabia|List of governorates of Saudi Arabia}}\nThe Eastern Province is one of the 13 [[regions of Saudi Arabia|provinces of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arab.net/saudi/sa_admindivisions.htm |title=Saudi Arabia: Administrative divisions |publisher=arab.net }}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}}; ''manatiq id\u0101riyya'', sing. \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629; ''[[mintaqah]] idariyya'').

The incumbent governor of the province is [[Saud bin Nayef Al Saud|Prince Saud bin Nayef Al Saud]]. Other populous cities in the province include [[Hofuf]], Mubarraz, [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]], [[Jubail]] and [[Khobar]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/saudi-arabia-population/cities/|website=worldpopulationreview.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. The region is extremely popular among tourists for its beaches on the [[Persian Gulf]] and proximity to the other countries of the eastern [[Arab world]], such as the [[UAE|United Arab Emirates]] and [[Bahrain]], with the latter being linked to the province via the 25 km (15 mi) long [[King Fahd Causeway]]. The region also shares a border with [[Oman]]. The province is bordered to the west, from north to south, by the provinces of the [[Northern Borders Region|Northern Borders]], [[Ha'il Region|Ha'il]], [[Al-Qassim Region|Qassim]], [[Riyadh Region|Riyadh]] and [[Najran Region|Najran]].\n\nThe Eastern Province encompasses the entire east coast of Saudi Arabia and acts as a major platform for most of the kingdom's oil production and exports. [[Petroleum|Oil]] was first found in the country in the Eastern Province, at the Prosperity Well site (formerly known as Dammam No.7). The [[Ghawar Field|Ghawar oil field]], located in the [[Al-Ahsa Governorate|Ahsa Governorate]], measuring 8400 sq.km. (3240 sq.mi.) is the largest oil field in the world, and accounts for roughly a third of the kingdom's oil production. The [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], located off the coast of the province, is the largest [[offshore oil field]] in the world. The Jubail Industrial City, part of the city of [[Jubail]], the fifth most populous in the province, is the largest industrial city in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/world-s-largest-industrial-areas.html|title=The World's Largest Industrial Areas|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> \n\nThe area was largely uninhabited until the [[Iron Age]], when a few people migrated over from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] empires. For most of the early medieval period, the region was under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule until the advent of Islam under [[Muhammad]], and subsequently, the [[Islamic empires]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]. After a brief period of [[British Empire|British]] rule during the early modern period, the [[Unification of Saudi Arabia]] led to the consolidation of the region into the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]], which in 1932, was united into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].\n\n==Geography==\nApproximately two-thirds of the province is desert, comprising of, from south to north, the [[Rub' al Khali]], [[Ad-Dahna Desert|Dahna]] and [[An Nafud|Nafud]] deserts, with the Rub' al-Khali alone comprising more than half of the area of the province. Areas such as [[Hafar Al-Batin|Hafr al-Batin]] and the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]] have become important sites for [[desert farming]] due to the advancements made during the [[Green Revolution]] in farming and irrigation techniques. \n\nThe entire eastern coast of the kingdom lies in the Eastern Province. The region borders, from north to south, the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Bahrain|Bahrain,]] [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Oman]].\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun empire-slide.gif|thumb|335x335px|The [[Rashidun Caliphate]] expanded the Muslim world into three continents within 20 years of the death of [[Muhammad]]]]\n\n=== Lakhmid and Sasanian rule (300-623 AD) ===\nThe northern part of the Eastern Province was first inhabited by the [[Lakhmids]] around 300 AD, with the coastal regions claimed by the [[Sasanians]] but governed by the Lakhmids. Much of the Eastern Province was under [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] rule at the time of [[Muhammad|Muhammad.]] The entire [[Arabian Peninsula]] fell into Muslim hands during the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], after [[Muhammad]]'s death. \n[[File:IbnSaud.jpg|thumb|[[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] [[Ibn Saud]] is largely accepted to be the founder of present-day [[Saudi Arabia]], also known as the Third Saudi State]]\n\n=== Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates (623-899 AD) ===\nThe region stayed stable during the first three Islamic caliphates.\n\n=== Qarmatian rule (899-1076 AD) ===\nDuring the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], the region was taken over by the [[Qarmatians]], a [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] group of the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] branch, around 899 AD. The Qarmatians attacked [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]] and held the [[Black Stone]] to ransom in Ahsa in 920 AD. The region was ruled by the Qaramatians until 976 AD, when after losing to the Abbasids, they were reduced to the status of a local power. After Bahrain and Qatif seceded from Qarmatian rule around 1058 AD, they retreated to the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], to which [[Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni]] laid siege and invaded in 1076 AD, ending the rule of Qarmatians in Ahsa and founding the [[Uyunid Emirate]]. \n\n=== Uyunids, Usfurids and Jabrids (1076-1521 AD) ===\nNot much is known of the Uyunids, except that they were the descendants of the [[Banu Abdul Qays]] tribe. They were involved in several internal disputes, causing the emirate to become unstable and eventually leading to the rise of the Bedouin Usfurids. The Usfurids saw a short period of stability. After overthrowing their former allies, the Uyunids, they had an uneasy relationship with the Persian rulers of Hormuz, who took control of the former Uyunid cities of Qatif and Bahrain around 1320 AD. This eventually led to the fall of the Usfurids. The region was mostly overlooked until the 1500s, when the [[Jabrids]] took over around 1507 AD, but they too fell due to internal conflicts in or around the 1540s.\n\n=== Ottoman invasions (1551-1671 AD) ===\nIn 1551 AD, the Ottomans invaded the region during their [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1532-1555)|first war with the Safavids]], and kept it under their control until 1671.\n\n=== The Saudi era (1751 AD-present) ===\nThe region has stayed in Muslims hands since. In the late 1800s, during the period of the [[Second Saudi State]], the area came into Saudi control for the first time from Ottoman hands, before briefly being taken over by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and then retaken by the [[Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd]] after the in 1913, which was later consolidated into the modern [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]] under [[Ibn Saud]] on September 23, 1932.\n\nDue to the significance of the [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa Oasis]], the region around the oasis, which comprises much of modern-day [[Hofuf]] and its surrounding areas, was simply known as ''al-Ahsa''' and the region around present-day [[Bahrain]] and the [[Greater Dammam]] area was simply known as ''al-Bahran'' from pre-Islamic times.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2015}}According to the Population Characteristics Surveys conducted by the General Authority of Statistics, the Eastern Province had a population of 4,900,325 as of December 2017<ref name=\":0\" />, of which 3,140,362 were Saudis and 1,759,963 were foreign nationals. The Eastern Province is the third most populous province in Saudi Arabia, after Makkah and Riyadh.

As such, the Eastern Province, being the province with most of Saudi Arabia's oil reserves enjoys a high economic position. [[Saudi Aramco]], the [[government-owned corporation|state-owned]] oil company of Saudi Arabia and an organization of major significance in the [[petroleum industry]], is based in [[Dhahran]] in [[Greater Dammam]]. It became the fifth company in the world to reach a [[market capitalization]] of $1 trillion ($1,000,000,000,000) on December 11, 2019. After going public the same day in what is considered the largest [[IPO|public offering]] ever as of December 2019, the next day, on December 12, 2019, the company reached a market cap of $2 trillion, becoming the first and only company in the world to break the record<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/12/investing/saudi-aramco-2-trillion/index.html|title=The world has its first $2 trillion company. But for how long?|last=Business|first=Charles Riley, CNN|website=CNN|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. \n\nThe kingdom's main oil and gas fields are located in the Eastern Province with sites such as the [[Ghawar Field]], the largest onshore [[Petroleum reservoir|oil field]] in the world and the [[Safaniya Oil Field|Safaniya oil field]], the largest [[offshore oil]] field in the world. Petroleum is refined in various refineries spread across the kingdom and shipped to dozens of countries from port cities such as [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]]. The East\u2013West pipeline enables efficient transport of oil from the eastern oil fields and refineries to the western refineries and ports, such as [[Rabigh]] and [[Jeddah]].\n\nSaudi Arabia's largest agricultural product, dates, also forms a large part of the province's economy. Every year thousands of tonnes of dates are harvested from the date palms in the giant oasis of [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Ahsa]] to be sold in and around the kingdom.\n\n==Transportation==\nDammam's [[King Fahd International Airport]], the largest airport in the world in terms of land area, is the only airport in the entire Eastern Province with scheduled international flights. Located 30&nbsp;km northwest of the city, the airport is the primary air hub of the Eastern Province. Dammam is well connected by air with other cities in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Other airports in the province include [[Al-Ahsa International Airport|Ahsa International Airport]] and [[Al Qaisumah/Hafr Al Batin Airport|Qaisumah-Hafr Al Batin Airport]]. Saudi Aramco has a separate terminal at the King Fahd International Airport for their employees and aircraft with scheduled flights to [[Shaybah]], [[Yanbu]], Jeddah and other sites where the company is active.\n\nBuilt in the 1940s, the [[King Abdul Aziz Port|King Abdulaziz Sea Port]], located on the coast of the [[Persian Gulf]], is the second largest and second busiest port in [[Saudi Arabia]], after the [[Jeddah Islamic Port]] in Jeddah. It is also the largest port in the Persian Gulf. The port is equipped with 56 multi-purpose hoists, 8 container cranes, and 524 tanker containers.\n\nHighway 95 (Route 5M) connects [[Khafji]] on the [[Kuwait|Kuwaiti]] border in the north to the Ramlah border station on the [[Oman|Omani]] border in the south via [[Jubail]], [[Ras Tanura|Ra's Tanura]], the [[Dammam metropolitan area]], the Salwa border station on the [[Qatar|Qatari]] border and the Batha' border station with the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Highway 40 (Route 80M) connects [[Bahrain]] and [[Dammam]] via the 25 km (15 mi) [[King Fahd Causeway]] over the [[Persian Gulf]] and onward to [[Jeddah]] on the [[Red Sea]] via [[Riyadh]], [[Ta'if]] and [[Makkah]]. Highways 605, 610, 613, 614, 615, 617 and 619, known locally by other popular names, connect the Greater Dammam area to Ra's Tanura, Jubail, the King Fahd International Airport, [[Abqaiq]] and [[Hofuf]].\n\nIntercity bus services are operated in the province by the Saudi Arabian Public Transport Company (SAPTCO). [[Umrah]] and [[Hajj]] shuttle services are also provided to residents of the kingdom by private contractors. Shuttle services also connect the [[Dammam metropolitan area]] to the [[Bahrain International Airport]], northeast of [[Manama]] in Bahrain.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian railways are managed by two separate organizations, the [[Saudi Railways Organization]] and [[Saudi Railway Company]]. The lines in the Eastern Province, two lines, one passenger, which runs from Dammam to Riyadh via Abqaiq an Hofuf, and the other freight, which runs directly from Dammam to Riyadh, are managed by the Saudi Railways Organization (SRO).\n\nA plan to build a [[Dammam Metro|metro]] in Dammam is also in the works.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{see also|Regions of Saudi Arabia|List of governorates of Saudi Arabia}}\nThe Eastern Province is one of the 13 [[regions of Saudi Arabia|provinces of Saudi Arabia]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arab.net/saudi/sa_admindivisions.htm |title=Saudi Arabia: Administrative divisions |publisher=arab.net }}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0637\u0642 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629}}; ''manatiq id\u0101riyya'', sing. \u0645\u0646\u0637\u0642\u0629 \u0625\u062f\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629; ''[[mintaqah]] idariyya'').
