This is due to two criteria: the architecture of the Cathedral shows 800 years of European architectural styles, and it's one of the earliest examples in Scandinavia of a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral to be built in [[brick]], it encouraged the spread of the [[Brick Gothic]] style throughout [[Northern Europe]]. Constructed during the 12th and 13th centuries, the Cathedral incorporates both Gothic and [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architectural features in its design. The Cathedral has been the main burial site for [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish monarchs]] since the 15th century. As such, it has been significantly extended and altered over the centuries to accommodate a considerable number of burial chapels and the many added chapels shows different architectural styles.\n\nThe Cathedral is a major tourist attraction, bringing in over 165,000 visitors annually. Since 1995, it has been listed as a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] due to its unique architecture. A working church, it also hosts concerts throughout the year.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View of Roskilde Domkirke from Bishop's house.jpg|thumb|left|The cathedral seen from the Bispeg\u00e5rden (Bishop's house).]]\n[[File:Roskilde kathedraal 12.jpg|thumb|left|Christian IX's Chapel (right) and Frederick IX's Burial Site (left).]]\n\n=== Previous churches ===\n\n[[Roskilde]] was named the new capital of Denmark by King [[Harald Bluetooth]] around the year 960. The king had previously resided in [[Jelling]], where he built a church and raised the [[Jelling stones]], but after uniting the Danes and Norwegians, a move was necessary to enable the monarch to stay close to the centre of power in the new kingdom. According to written sources, when moving to Roskilde, Bluetooth built a royal farm and next to it, a small [[stave church]], dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Little is known of the Trinity Church, let alone its architecture, but despite its brief history at least two events are known to have taken place. In [[Adam of Bremen]]'s [[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]], there is an account of how the king's son, [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], raised a rebellion against him, forcing him to flee to [[Jomsborg]]. When Bluetooth died in 985/986, the army that had been raised against him brought his body to Roskilde and buried him in the church he had built.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=10}} At Christmas in 1026, [[Ulf the Earl]] was murdered by one of [[Cnut the Great]]'s [[housecarl]]s. Though the sources differ, this happened either inside the church ([[Chronicon Roskildense]]) or at the royal farm ([[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s [[Gesta Danorum]]). Ulf had been married to Cnut the Great's sister [[Estrid Svendsdatter|Estrid]], who was outraged by the murder and demanded a [[weregild]].{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=13}}\n\nThere is some doubt as to when Roskilde became the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|seat of the Bishop of Roskilde]]. When Sweyn Forkbeard conquered [[England]] in 1013, he began sending English bishops to Denmark, a process which was continued by his successor Cnut the Great. This caused some conflict with the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg]], who regarded Scandinavia as belonging to the Archdiocese of Bremen. The earliest known bishop of Roskilde was Gerbrand, who had been a [[Clergy|cleric]] with Cnut the Great, and who was intercepted by the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen's men when he sailed to Denmark in 1022. Only after swearing allegiance to the archbishop was he allowed to continue his journey. The archbishop may have had good reason to be suspicious, as documents of the time suggest that Cnut the Great may have planned to create an archdiocese in Roskilde, with Gerbrand as archbishop.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=12}}\n\nFunded by the weregild [[Estrid Svendsdatter]] had received, the old Trinity Church was torn down and construction of a simple stone cathedral began around 1026. This may have formed the base of the later [[travertine]] cathedral, but it is difficult to tell, as two cathedrals have subsequently been built on the same site. However, an archaeological excavation in 1968 showed that the bases of both buildings were at the same height, which would not make sense if two separate buildings had been constructed in a 50-year span.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=15}}\n\nIt is, however, certain that a travertine cathedral was built at the location. Construction had been started by Bishop Wilhelm between 1060\u20131073 and was completed by his successor Svend Nordmand around 1080. The new Cathedral was built using travertine, a stone found in abundance around [[Roskilde Fjord]]. It was constructed as a [[basilica]] in Romanesque style with half-rounded interior arches to support the flat interior ceiling, with two towers flanking the west front entrance. To the north, a three-sided stone monastery was constructed for monks and others associated with the Cathedral. Svend Nordmand's successor, Arnold, added a wall around the building, which was to act as a guarantee of safety for anyone who sought sanctuary there. However, Arnold was also considered the bishop who lost the Archdiocese of Scandinavia to [[Lund Cathedral]], as a result of his lack of drive and motivation.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|pp=16-8}}\n\nWith the new Cathedral completed, there was a desire to obtain a [[relic]] for it. Two [[Canon (priest)|canons]] (clerics of the cathedral) were dispatched to [[Rome]] to find something suitable. Legend holds that while they were resting after their arrival, [[Pope Lucius I|St Lucius]], who had been pope from 253\u2013255, appeared before them and told them that he had been chosen to be the [[patron saint]] of Roskilde until the end of time. The next day, the two canons were taken to [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]] to choose amongst the many relics there. They saw a skull shining brightly, the skull of St Lucius. On their return, while the canons were sailing through the [[Great Belt]], their ship came under attack by a powerful demon which had long lurked in Danish waters. The crew drew straws and the lot fell on the canon carrying the skull of St Lucius. He offered a prayer to the saint, washed the skull three times, threw the water in the ocean, and jumped overboard. To everyone's surprise, the canon was able to walk on the water. The demon disappeared screaming into the depths, never to be seen again.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|pp=19-21}}\n\nIt is not known for certain which year the relic arrived in Roskilde, only the date, August 25, as it was on that date that the relic's arrival was always celebrated. The first written mention of the relic dates to [[\u00c6lnoth of Canterbury|\u00c6lnoth]], a monk in [[Odense]], who described it in a work on the life of [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute the Holy]] in 1122. Another item of the period, a seal carved from a [[walrus]] tusk, depicting St Lucius between the twin towers of the cathedral, has been dated to the early 12th century. The relic may have been acquired to help win Roskilde the archdiocese, which was given to Lund in 1103/1104.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=21}}\n\n=== Current cathedral ===\n[[File:Altar, Roskilde Cathedral 2017-08-18.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[altar]]]]\nIt has been accepted, that soon after he became Bishop of Roskilde in 1157, [[Absalon]] began to expand the travertine cathedral.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=30}} In 1160, the art of firing bricks was brought to Denmark from Italy by monks, and the new material was employed. Researchers decided to build a new cathedral around the existing one, allowing services to continue during construction. It has long been believed that bishop Absalon began construction, and when Absalon was forced to surrender his position as Bishop of Roskilde in 1191, only the two floors of the [[apse]], the choir towers and part of the [[transept]] had been completed.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|pp=30-1}} Absalon's successor, Peder Sunesen, embracing the new [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] style, later made significant changes to the plans, tearing down the choir towers and reducing the width of the transept.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=28}} But new research points to Peder Sunesen as the main initiator and hence instead of rebuilding it, it was constructed in the transition period between Romanesque and Gothic show elements from both styles in the Cathedral.\n\nThe choir was completed and inaugurated in 1225, allowing services to begin there, and the old travertine cathedral was torn down. Work on the nave continued for the next 55 years, limited by funds, lack of kilns to fire the bricks, and the winters.{{sfn|H\u00f8jlund|2010|p=50}} With the exception of the two towers on the west facade, the Cathedral was completed by 1280, and work on the interior proceeded, slowed by a fire in 1282 which also destroyed several of the canons' houses in the area. Several chapels were also added to the Cathedral, and in 1405, work on the towers was completed.\n[[Image:MargretheI-Sarkofag.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] of Scandinavian Queen Margrethe I.]]\nWhen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]] died in 1412, she was buried in her family's chapel at [[Sor\u00f8 Klosterkirke]]. But the following year bishop Peder Jensen Lodehat, who had been the queen's chancellor and religious advisor, brought her body to Roskilde Cathedral. The monks in Sor\u00f8 were outraged, above all because the loss of the queen's earthly remains would mean a significant loss in income from requiems \u2014 at that time monks and clergy would typically have been paid to say [[requiem mass]]es for a dead person, and for a queen such masses would likely have been said on a regular basis in perpetuity, each one incurring a fee \u2014 as well as a loss of prestige. Though often blamed on the bishop, it is quite possible that the move was orchestrated by the queen's adoptive son, [[Eric of Pomerania]]. This is reinforced by the inscription on the sarcophagus, which describes how it was given by the new king, Eric VII, in 1423.\n\nIn his \"Chronica novella\", German chronicler [[:de:Hermann Korner]] describes the vast, three-day-long burial ceremony involving King Eric VII, several noblemen, the Archbishop of Lund, and all of the Danish bishops. There is an account of how the procession granted substantial gifts to each of the 50 altars in the Cathedral. On the first day, the royal couple would give each altar a golden [[ornament (art)|ornament]], a golden [[antependium]] and a silver [[chalice]]; the noblemen would each bestow a [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]] on the altars; and the knights, squires, and anyone else who wished to bestow gifts, would provide each altar with silver coins from [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]]. On the second and third days, the royal couple would bestow two [[Noble (English coin)|nobles]] on each altar, the noblemen would bestow a florin on them, and the rest of the procession would bestow silver coins as they wished. What was left of silver coins were then put in a bowl, to be cast among the poor in Roskilde.\n\nOn 14 May 1443, a fire swept through Roskilde, destroying most of the city and all but three of the clergy's houses. The fire was so intense that the glass windows cracked, and the lead roofing melted. The cathedral was badly damaged and it was not until 1463 that the bishop, Oluf Mortensen, could rededicate it. To help with its reconstruction, the bishops of Denmark each signed a letter granting 40 days of [[indulgence]] to whoever would contribute to its cost.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=82}} The reconstruction could also have been helped by the decision of [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to build a chapel at the cathedral. The Chapel of the Magi was built during the 1460s, and together with the sarcophagus of Margrethe I and the remains from the previous churches, it marks the earliest royal burials.\n\nThe [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]] arrived in 1536, marking a sharp negative turn for Roskilde Cathedral. Not only was the Bishop of Roskilde, Joachim R\u00f8nnow, jailed in [[Copenhagen Castle]], the diocese was moved to Copenhagen and Peder Palladius, became the new [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent]] of Zealand and later bishop. Hans Tausen, who had sought to encourage wide adoption of the Reformation, was sent to Roskilde in 1538 to help convert the clergymen who were opposed to the new ideas. At a Reformation meeting in 1540, it was decided that all of the bishop's property was now to belong to the king, both symbolically and in reality the head of the [[Church of Denmark]]. The cathedral had already been forced to hand over some of its property during the [[Count's Feud]], but following the decision and with an impending war against the Swedes, the confiscation of church property was stepped up. Among the cathedral's most prized possessions was a wooden statue of St Lucius, covered in gold and gems. The [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] fought hard to try and retain its property, at one point asking for a receipt for some of the confiscated goods, to which the king's men replied that the king did not need to hand out a receipt for something that already belonged to him.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=110}}\n[[File:Roskilde Cathedral Interior 2017-08-18 5.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The nave of the cathedral]]\nAfter the Reformation, the cathedral was opened up to the ordinary congregation, necessitating the purchase of new furniture, especially [[pew]]s. As in other former Catholic cathedrals, the choir, which had been separated from the nave by a large wall, was left intact with the altar placed against the wall.\n\nWhile the cathedral suffered financial hardship, having been forced to give away all its property (which at the time included one in every four farms on Zealand and 30 large estates), it was endowed with a variety of gifts from [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]: The altarpiece (between 1555 and 1623), a royal box ca 1600, the [[pulpit]] in 1610, his own burial chapel in 1614, the construction of the iconic twin spires in 1633 and finally a grand Renaissance sandstone entrance portal in 1635.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=124}}\n\nOn 26 February 1658, the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] was signed in the cathedral. In the loot the Swedes took from the cathedral, was the golden dress of Margrethe I, which had hung in a closet near her sarcophagus. The dress was taken by the Swedish queen consort [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|Hedwig Eleonora]] and is now located at [[Uppsala Cathedral]]. In 1690, [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] ordered the old Catholic choir cleared, so he could create a crypt beneath it for the children he had had with his mistress [[Sophie Amalie Moth|Sophie Amalie]]. This also allowed for the altar to be moved to its present position.\n\nIn 1774, work on the third royal burial chapel, Frederick V's chapel, began with the removal of the pre-existing Chapel of Our Lady. Money soon ran out, and it was not until 1825 that the work was completed. In the meantime, in 1806, the cathedral sold its inventory from its Catholic days at a notorious auction. Among the items sold was a grand crucifix which went to a local coppersmith. While he was sawing the crucifix into firewood, the head of [[Jesus]] split open and a small, golden [[patriarchal cross]] fell out. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that the cross was hollow and that a splinter from Christ's cross was hidden inside. Rumour of the find quickly reached the Royal Art Collection, later the [[National Museum of Denmark]], which immediately purchased it.{{Sfn|Kruse|2003|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nIn 1871, the entrance portal was replaced with one that matched the rest of the cathedral, while the old portal was donated to [[Holmen Church]]. However, when the new portal arrived, the [[churchwarden]] was horrified to see it was a poor copy of the old style. But he had no choice but to erect it.{{Sfn|Fang|1960|p=124}}\n\nWork on the fourth royal burial chapel began in 1915, and prior to its completion in 1924, Roskilde was once again made a diocese. On 27 August 1968, as restoration work on the Margrethe spire was nearing completion, the spire burned, threatening to collapse into the choir. During firefighting operations, members of the [[civil defense]] and church staff covered the canons' chairs, the altar, and the sarcophagi in the retrochoir with damp fire blankets, hoping to prevent damage to the invaluable items. The [[Defence Minister of Denmark]] ordered a complete ban on jet operations in the area, pending investigations into whether the vaults were in danger of collapsing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roskilde-luften forbudt omr\u00e5de|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/8038/|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=Politiken|page=4|language=Danish}}</ref> It was later discovered, that despite a total ban on any heat sources in the area where the restoration was taking place, the craftsmen had been smoking and using blowtorches in the loft.<ref>{{cite news|title=Retssag efter kirkebranden|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/8037/|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=Politiken|page=2|language=Danish}}</ref> The latest addition to the cathedral was in 1985, when the New Burial Ground, also known as Frederick IX's Burial Ground, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 2018, the future resting places and monument for the current queen of Denmark [[Queen Margrethe II]] was placed in the chapel of St. Brigitte. The design is made by Danish sculptor [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]]. A model is at display in the cathedral alongside an exhibition on the tradition of royal burials.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://roskildedomkirke.dk/besoeg/kongegrave/dronningens-gravmaele |website=Roskilde Cathedral |publisher=Roskilde Cathedral}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:Roskilde Dom10.jpg|200px|thumb|Sepulchral monument of Frederick II by Gert van Egen in the Chapel of the Magi]]\n[[Image:Roskilde kathedraal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Sepulchral monument of Christian III by Cornelis Floris]]\n\n=== Chapels ===\n\n==== Chapel of the Magi (Christian I's chapel) ====\nWhen King [[Christopher of Bavaria|Christopher III]] died childless in 1448, his widow [[Dorothea of Brandenburg]] remarried the newly chosen king, [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]]. Within a few years, he became king of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and Dorothea had given birth to the future king [[John of Denmark|John]], thus establishing the [[House of Oldenburg]]. Against this background of events, the Christian I decided to build a grand chapel at the cathedral.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|p=13}} The instrument of foundation was signed on April 28, 1459, which not only ordered the construction of the chapel, but also granted large tracts of land to the church.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|p=17}}  In the spring of 1462, the king applied to [[Pope Pius II]] for indulgence for having constructed the chapel, which was finally granted upon his visit to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in Rome in 1474.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|p=42}}\n\nBuilt in Gothic style, in line with the rest of the cathedral, the chapel consists of two floors, the lower floor intended as a burial chapel for Christian I and the upper floor as [[Great Hall]] for the members of the king's newly created Fellowship of the Mother of God, the precursor to the modern day [[Order of the Elephant]]. The two floors rest on a central granite pillar, the so-called King's Pillar, where numerous kings have had their height measured over the years.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=34}} Amongst the kings measured, [[Peter the Great]], measured in 1716, stands tallest, while [[Chulalongkorn|Chulalongkorn of Siam]], measured in 1907, is the smallest. The height mark for Christian I is believed to be a technical error, as the king may have been tall, but not the giant the marker would suggest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roskilde Domkirke|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/verdensarv/verdensarv/roskilde-domkirke/|publisher=Kulturarvsstyrelsen|language=Danish|quote=Nogle af m\u00e5lene m\u00e5 i h\u00f8jere grad v\u00e6re udtryk for \u00f8nsker om kongelig pondus end de reelle forhold.

Christian III's [[alabaster]], [[Rouge Belge]] and [[Noir Belge]] monument was created 1574\u201375 by Antwerpian sculptor [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt|Cornelis Floris]]. When the sculptor died in October 1575, the monument was more or less complete, lacking only its weapons and inscriptions, which were to be added by the [[herald]] Jan Baptist Guidetty. In fact, they were never added, and when the Spanish [[Sack of Antwerp|sacked Antwerp]] in November 1576, the monument was held until the widow of Cornelis Floris paid a ransom. The widow then sent word to the Danish court, requesting that the monument be retrieved and her contribution covered, which was not done until 1578. When the monument arrived in [[Elsinore]], two local [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]] set to work completing the monument, and in the summer of 1580 it was finally placed in the chapel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Truds\u00f8|first=Susanne|title=Kongelige gravm\u00e6ler i sten|url=http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/graphics/Klub/November.ST.pdf|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|page=3|language=Danish}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFrederick II's monument, crafted from the same materials, was built 1594\u20131598 by the [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] sculptor [[Gert van Egen]], who was a pupil of Cornelis Floris and was a resident of Elsinore. Both monuments are empty however, as the coffins have been buried below the floor of the chapel.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|pp=47\u201348}} King John was also supposed to have been buried in the chapel, but in his later years, he and his wife enjoyed living in N\u00e6sbyhoved Castle near [[Odense]] so much, that he expressed a preference to be buried in the town's [[St. Canute's Cathedral|Franciscan cathedral]]. However, the bishop and canons in Roskilde claimed that the King had determined that he was to be buried in Roskilde. The king's widow, [[Christina of Saxony]], sent a letter to [[Pope Leo X]] asking for assistance, and in his reply, the pope stated that a man's last wish must always be followed, and the king was therefore buried in Odense.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|pp=228-9}}\n\nThe chapel's vaults and walls are richly decorated with [[fresco]]s, dating from the 1460s when the chapel was created by Christian I and his wife.

Built in Dutch [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style, work on exterior of the chapel was begun in 1614 by [[Lorenz van Steenwinckel]] and completed in 1641 by his brother, [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger]].{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=36}} The exterior was constructed in red brick with a [[Crow-stepped gable|corbie stepped gable]] facing north. On each of the gable steps, a sandstone figure is placed, representing each of the [[Seven virtues|Christian virtues]]. Next to the gable's windows, four [[Putto|putti]] are placed, each holding up one of the [[symbols of death]]: a skull, a scythe, a torch pointing downwards, and an hourglass. Central At the centre of the gable, the king's [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is found.{{sfn|H\u00f8jlund|2010|p=90}}\n[[Image:RoskildeDomkirke-CasparFinckeGitter.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Caspar Fincke]]s latticework]]\nThe wrought-iron lattice separating the chapel from the nave was forged by [[Caspar Fincke]] in 1619, and contains an amusing quip by its creator:\n\n::Caspar Fincke bin ich benant\n::Dieser arbeit bin ich bekant\n(''Rough translation: Caspar Fincke I am named, for this work I am famed'').\n\nUpon the death of Christian IV in 1648 the interior had not been completed, and the king's coffin was placed in the crypt below instead. The king had commissioned his own monument, depicting him and his queen kneeling before a [[crucifix]], but since it had been completed before his death, the monument had been temporarily placed in storage in the [[Christian IV's Arsenal|king's arsenal]]. When the arsenal burned in 1647, all that remained of the monument was the grand [[sandstone]] crucifix and a head carved from alabaster. The crucifix was subsequently placed in [[Holmen Church]], while the head was given to the [[National Museum of Denmark]].{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=128}}\nThe king's successors were each unable to provide a fitting resting place for the king, and it was not until 1840 and [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]] that work was finally begun. He had hoped to see the project finished by 1848, the 200th anniversary of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV's]] death, but it was not until 1870 that the work was completed.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=23}}\n\nWork on the interior began in 1840, when Christian VIII ordered a statue of Christian IV from famed sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. This was to be part of a planned monument for Christian IV, which was to be designed by architect G.F. Hetcsh, but it still had to be decided who was to was going to create the decorations. In 1845 a commission tasked [[Heinrich Eddelien]] with the job, but work progressed slowly, perhaps due to Christian VIII's close concern with the matter and criticism of the proposed works. When Christian VIII died in 1848, the project lost its major motivational force, as the new king, Frederick VII, was not sufficiently interested in seeing project finished. When Eddelien died in 1852, only the work on the starry vaulted ceiling and the [[allegory]] motives beneath it had been completed, and work ground to a complete halt.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=24}}\n[[Image:Roskilde Dom05.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Interior of Christian IV's Chapel.]]\nIn 1856, [[Georg Hilker]] added a [[frieze]] below the ceiling vault, which was to act as a separator between the ceiling and wall decorations. When [[Wilhelm Marstrand]] and [[Heinrich Hansen (painter)|Heinrich Hansen]] were finally appointed in 1860, it was the [[Finance Minister of Denmark|finance minister]], C.E. Fenger, who was responsible. The original commission was outraged that the minister had acted behind their backs, but times had changed since the commission had been formed, and with the [[National Liberal Party (Denmark)|National Liberal Party]] in power, there was an increased focus on the national attitude. The National Liberal minister felt that seeing the completion of Christian IV's chapel, which he regarded as a national relic, would strengthen the national sentiment in the developing conflict with Prussia.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=28}}\n\nMarstrand and Hansen submitted their decoration proposals in 1861, having decided that Marstrand would paint the paintings while Hansen would paint the framings. That year the pair travelled to France to study oil painting on plaster. Marstrand then spent the summers of 1864\u20131866 in Roskilde, painting one wall per year. When Marstrand had finished his work, the five coffins in the chapel were placed in their current positions.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=28}}\n\n==== Frederick V's chapel ====\n[[Image:RoskildeDomkirke-FrederikVKapelIndgang.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Interior of Frederick V's Chapel]]\nConsisting of two chapels in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, the construction spanned 51 years (1774\u20131825) and required the removal of a previous existing chapel, the Chapel of Our Lady.\n\nConstruction of the chapel was started by [[Caspar Frederik Harsdorff|C. F. Harsdorff]] in 1774, possibly using early sketches made during his travels to Rome 1762\u20131764, but due to a lack of funding the work was suspended in 1779. It was resumed by his apprentice [[Christian Frederik Hansen|C. F. Hansen]] in 1820 and completed in 1825. The chapel consists of a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] with two adjoining rooms on the north and south sides, usually referred to as Christian VI's chapel, and a domed cruciform-shaped hall, Frederick V's chapel. While the interior of the building had classical, [[whitewash]]ed walls, the exterior retained the red brick characteristic of the rest of the cathedral.\n\nWhen the chapel was inaugurated in September 1825, coffins that had been temporarily stored in Christian IV's chapel were moved to the new chapel, and as members of the royal family died, more were added. This led to the chapel, which had been designed for five marble sarcophagi,{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=49}} holding upwards of 17 coffins in 1912. However, the addition of Christian IX's chapel, the removal of some coffins to the crypts, and a rearrangement of the coffins, led to the present situation where only 12 coffins and sarcophagi are present. It has however led to confusion, as some of the coffins have not been arranged in the pairs which correspond to the relationships that existed during their lifetimes.{{sfn|Fang|1960|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe chapel shows a gradual trend in moving from grand marble sarcophagi to more simple, velvet-covered coffins, and in the case of Frederick VII, a wooden coffin.\n\n==== Christian IX's chapel ====\n[[Image:Roskilde Cathedral - Christian IX's Chapel.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Interior of Christian IX's Chapel]]\nWhen the [[Constitution of Denmark]] was revised in 1915, the [[Folketing]] decided to honour the [[Danish Royal Family|Royal Family]], granting King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X's]] wish, by constructing a new chapel at the cathedral, dedicated to the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]] which had held the throne since [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] became king in 1863. The chapel was designed by then cathedral architect, Andreas Clemmensen.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=145}}\n\nConstruction of the chapel, overseen by a master builder Schledermann, began in 1919 and was completed in 1924, built in a [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine Revival]] style, with a [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]] inspiration. Built as an extension of the northwestern [[Church porch|weaponporch]], which then ceased to exist as an independent building, the chapel is [[cruciform]] with grey walls and a domed roof.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=145}} Upon its completion, there was a heavy debate in the Danish newspapers, with some believing that the chapel was completely removed from the prevailing style of the cathedral.\n\nIn the northern arm stands the double sarcophagus of Christian IX and his Queen [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Louise]]. Designed by [[Hack Kampmann]], the sarcophagus was originally to have stood in the eastern arm of Frederick V's chapel. Surrounding the sarcophagus are three statues of female figures, designed by [[Edvard Eriksen]]. The statues are named \"Grief\", \"Memory\", and \"Love\" and were cut from white [[marble]] from [[Carrara]] in Italy. The statue of \"Grief\" bears a notable resemblance to the statue of [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|the Little Mermaid]] in [[Copenhagen]], which is not without reason. Edvard Eriksen had created the statue of the Little Mermaid in 1911, two years before he created the statues in the chapel, and his wife [[Eline Eriksen]] was model for both.<ref>{{cite web|last=Truds\u00f8|first=Susanne|title=Kongelige gravm\u00e6ler i sten|url=http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/graphics/Klub/November.ST.pdf|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|page=8|language=Danish}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the western arm stands the double sarcophagus of [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Frederick VIII]] and his Queen [[Louise of Sweden|Louise]], designed by [[Einar Utzon-Frank|Utzon-Frank]].

The coffins were designed by [[Kaare Klint|Kaare]] and Naur Klint, made from Norwegian marble, and have a stylized [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] covering the lid and sides.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]] in 1928, and following a short ceremony in the [[Alexander Nevsky Church, Copenhagen|Alexander Nevsky Church]] in Copenhagen and a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] ceremony in Roskilde, the coffin of the dowager empress was placed in the chapel close to the tomb of her parents and brother and sister-in-law. In 1957, the coffin was placed in the crypt under the chapel, until September 2006, when it was returned to Russia. It had been the wish of the dowager empress to be buried when possible next to her husband [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] in the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]]. This was possible after extensive negotiations between Queen Margrethe II and President Putin.\n\nFollowing Frederick IX's death in 1972, his coffin was placed in the chapel, draped with his [[Flag of Denmark#Royal Standards|Royal Standard]], guarded by three silver lions from the [[Danish Crown Regalia]], and flanked by a pair of [[candelabra]] in the shape of anchors. After the king's coffin was buried in 1985, only the candelabra remain in the chapel.\n\n==== St Andrew's Chapel and St Bridget's Chapel ====\n[[Image:RoskildeDomkirke-SanktAndreasKapelAltertavle.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The altar in St Andrew's Chapel]]\nThese two chapels, on the north side of the cathedral, are the only remnants of the many medieval chapels that were attached to the original cathedral. St Andrew's chapel was constructed in 1396, and St Bridget's in 1485.\n\nSt Andrew's chapel was completely redecorated in 2010 by artist Peter Brandes, who provided a new altarpiece as well as a latticework separating the chapel from the nave. It is the intention of the parochial church council that in future the chapel will provide a more intimate setting for some of the church functions in the cathedral, such as weddings or baptisms. The chapel has its own small organ for these services.\n\nSince the Reformation, St Bridget's chapel has mainly been used to store various items of church inventory from Catholic times, no longer needed in the Lutheran era. These include the three-seated [[Officiant|celebrant's]] chair, the [[Cantor (church)|cantor's]] chair, and the [[Canon (priest)|canons']] [[letter box]]. The chapel also has the oldest gravestone in the cathedral, dating back to ca. 1250.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kruse|first=Anette|title=Roskilde Domkirke|year=2003|publisher=Roskilde Domkirkes Salgsfond|pages=17, 21}}</ref> [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] has chosen St Birgitte's Chapel as the future burial site for herself with a sarcophagus created by artist [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]].

A meeting was held in May of the same year, involving the municipality, the parochial church council, the National Museum of Denmark, and a foundation for building and landscaping culture. In 1974 a discussion paper was presented, which spelled out how the area would be preserved and the new burial site established. There was some opposition from members of the parochial council, who insisted that the tradition of burying monarchs inside the cathedral be upheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voksende modstand mod det nye gravkammer|publisher=Politikens Hus|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/24267/8/|language=Danish}}</ref> The zoning plan for the area was finished in 1982 and work on the burial site could begin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fang|first=Lotte|title=By og bibliotek|year=2001|publisher=Roskilde Library|page=47}}</ref>\n\nThe burial site was designed by architect [[Vilhelm Wohlert]] in cooperation with Inger and Johannes Exner, and consists of a simple, uncovered brick octagon with a bronze gate designed by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen.

This is due to two criteria: the architecture of the Cathedral shows 800 years of European architectural styles, and it's one of the earliest examples in Scandinavia of a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedral to be built in [[brick]], it encouraged the spread of the [[Brick Gothic]] style throughout [[Northern Europe]]. Constructed during the 12th and 13th centuries, the Cathedral incorporates both Gothic and [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] architectural features in its design. The Cathedral has been the main burial site for [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish monarchs]] since the 15th century. As such, it has been significantly extended and altered over the centuries to accommodate a considerable number of burial chapels and the many added chapels shows different architectural styles.\n\nThe Cathedral is a major tourist attraction, bringing in over 165,000 visitors annually. Since 1995, it has been listed as a [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] due to its unique architecture. A working church, it also hosts concerts throughout the year.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:View of Roskilde Domkirke from Bishop's house.jpg|thumb|left|The cathedral seen from the Bispeg\u00e5rden (Bishop's house).]]\n[[File:Roskilde kathedraal 12.jpg|thumb|left|Christian IX's Chapel (right) and Frederick IX's Burial Site (left).]]\n\n=== Previous churches ===\n\n[[Roskilde]] was named the new capital of Denmark by King [[Harald Bluetooth]] around the year 960. The king had previously resided in [[Jelling]], where he built a church and raised the [[Jelling stones]], but after uniting the Danes and Norwegians, a move was necessary to enable the monarch to stay close to the centre of power in the new kingdom. According to written sources, when moving to Roskilde, Bluetooth built a royal farm and next to it, a small [[stave church]], dedicated to the Holy Trinity. Little is known of the Trinity Church, let alone its architecture, but despite its brief history at least two events are known to have taken place. In [[Adam of Bremen]]'s [[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]], there is an account of how the king's son, [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], raised a rebellion against him, forcing him to flee to [[Jomsborg]]. When Bluetooth died in 985/986, the army that had been raised against him brought his body to Roskilde and buried him in the church he had built.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=10}} At Christmas in 1026, [[Ulf the Earl]] was murdered by one of [[Cnut the Great]]'s [[housecarl]]s. Though the sources differ, this happened either inside the church ([[Chronicon Roskildense]]) or at the royal farm ([[Saxo Grammaticus]]'s [[Gesta Danorum]]). Ulf had been married to Cnut the Great's sister [[Estrid Svendsdatter|Estrid]], who was outraged by the murder and demanded a [[weregild]].{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=13}}\n\nThere is some doubt as to when Roskilde became the [[Diocese of Roskilde (Roman-Catholic)|seat of the Bishop of Roskilde]]. When Sweyn Forkbeard conquered [[England]] in 1013, he began sending English bishops to Denmark, a process which was continued by his successor Cnut the Great. This caused some conflict with the [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Archbishop of Hamburg]], who regarded Scandinavia as belonging to the Archdiocese of Bremen. The earliest known bishop of Roskilde was Gerbrand, who had been a [[Clergy|cleric]] with Cnut the Great, and who was intercepted by the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen's men when he sailed to Denmark in 1022. Only after swearing allegiance to the archbishop was he allowed to continue his journey. The archbishop may have had good reason to be suspicious, as documents of the time suggest that Cnut the Great may have planned to create an archdiocese in Roskilde, with Gerbrand as archbishop.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=12}}\n\nFunded by the weregild [[Estrid Svendsdatter]] had received, the old Trinity Church was torn down and construction of a simple stone cathedral began around 1026. This may have formed the base of the later [[travertine]] cathedral, but it is difficult to tell, as two cathedrals have subsequently been built on the same site. However, an archaeological excavation in 1968 showed that the bases of both buildings were at the same height, which would not make sense if two separate buildings had been constructed in a 50-year span.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=15}}\n\nIt is, however, certain that a travertine cathedral was built at the location. Construction had been started by Bishop Wilhelm between 1060\u20131073 and was completed by his successor Svend Nordmand around 1080. The new Cathedral was built using travertine, a stone found in abundance around [[Roskilde Fjord]]. It was constructed as a [[basilica]] in Romanesque style with half-rounded interior arches to support the flat interior ceiling, with two towers flanking the west front entrance. To the north, a three-sided stone monastery was constructed for monks and others associated with the Cathedral. Svend Nordmand's successor, Arnold, added a wall around the building, which was to act as a guarantee of safety for anyone who sought sanctuary there. However, Arnold was also considered the bishop who lost the Archdiocese of Scandinavia to [[Lund Cathedral]], as a result of his lack of drive and motivation.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|pp=16-8}}\n\nWith the new Cathedral completed, there was a desire to obtain a [[relic]] for it. Two [[Canon (priest)|canons]] (clerics of the cathedral) were dispatched to [[Rome]] to find something suitable. Legend holds that while they were resting after their arrival, [[Pope Lucius I|St Lucius]], who had been pope from 253\u2013255, appeared before them and told them that he had been chosen to be the [[patron saint]] of Roskilde until the end of time. The next day, the two canons were taken to [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]] to choose amongst the many relics there. They saw a skull shining brightly, the skull of St Lucius. On their return, while the canons were sailing through the [[Great Belt]], their ship came under attack by a powerful demon which had long lurked in Danish waters. The crew drew straws and the lot fell on the canon carrying the skull of St Lucius. He offered a prayer to the saint, washed the skull three times, threw the water in the ocean, and jumped overboard. To everyone's surprise, the canon was able to walk on the water. The demon disappeared screaming into the depths, never to be seen again.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|pp=19-21}}\n\nIt is not known for certain which year the relic arrived in Roskilde, only the date, August 25, as it was on that date that the relic's arrival was always celebrated. The first written mention of the relic dates to [[\u00c6lnoth of Canterbury|\u00c6lnoth]], a monk in [[Odense]], who described it in a work on the life of [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute the Holy]] in 1122. Another item of the period, a seal carved from a [[walrus]] tusk, depicting St Lucius between the twin towers of the cathedral, has been dated to the early 12th century. The relic may have been acquired to help win Roskilde the archdiocese, which was given to Lund in 1103/1104.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=21}}\n\n=== Current cathedral ===\n[[File:Altar, Roskilde Cathedral 2017-08-18.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[altar]]]]\nIt has been accepted, that soon after he became Bishop of Roskilde in 1157, [[Absalon]] began to expand the travertine cathedral.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=30}} In 1160, the art of firing bricks was brought to Denmark from Italy by monks, and the new material was employed. Researchers decided to build a new cathedral around the existing one, allowing services to continue during construction. It has long been believed that bishop Absalon began construction, and when Absalon was forced to surrender his position as Bishop of Roskilde in 1191, only the two floors of the [[apse]], the choir towers and part of the [[transept]] had been completed.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|pp=30-1}} Absalon's successor, Peder Sunesen, embracing the new [[French Gothic architecture|French Gothic]] style, later made significant changes to the plans, tearing down the choir towers and reducing the width of the transept.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=28}} But new research points to Peder Sunesen as the main initiator and hence instead of rebuilding it, it was constructed in the transition period between Romanesque and Gothic show elements from both styles in the Cathedral.\n\nThe choir was completed and inaugurated in 1225, allowing services to begin there, and the old travertine cathedral was torn down. Work on the nave continued for the next 55 years, limited by funds, lack of kilns to fire the bricks, and the winters.{{sfn|H\u00f8jlund|2010|p=50}} With the exception of the two towers on the west facade, the Cathedral was completed by 1280, and work on the interior proceeded, slowed by a fire in 1282 which also destroyed several of the canons' houses in the area. Several chapels were also added to the Cathedral, and in 1405, work on the towers was completed.\n[[Image:MargretheI-Sarkofag.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] of Scandinavian Queen Margrethe I.]]\nWhen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margrethe I]] died in 1412, she was buried in her family's chapel at [[Sor\u00f8 Klosterkirke]]. But the following year bishop Peder Jensen Lodehat, who had been the queen's chancellor and religious advisor, brought her body to Roskilde Cathedral. The monks in Sor\u00f8 were outraged, above all because the loss of the queen's earthly remains would mean a significant loss in income from requiems \u2014 at that time monks and clergy would typically have been paid to say [[requiem mass]]es for a dead person, and for a queen such masses would likely have been said on a regular basis in perpetuity, each one incurring a fee \u2014 as well as a loss of prestige. Though often blamed on the bishop, it is quite possible that the move was orchestrated by the queen's adoptive son, [[Eric of Pomerania]]. This is reinforced by the inscription on the sarcophagus, which describes how it was given by the new king, Eric VII, in 1423.\n\nIn his \"Chronica novella\", German chronicler [[:de:Hermann Korner]] describes the vast, three-day-long burial ceremony involving King Eric VII, several noblemen, the Archbishop of Lund, and all of the Danish bishops. There is an account of how the procession granted substantial gifts to each of the 50 altars in the Cathedral. On the first day, the royal couple would give each altar a golden [[ornament (art)|ornament]], a golden [[antependium]] and a silver [[chalice]]; the noblemen would each bestow a [[Florin (Italian coin)|florin]] on the altars; and the knights, squires, and anyone else who wished to bestow gifts, would provide each altar with silver coins from [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]]. On the second and third days, the royal couple would bestow two [[Noble (English coin)|nobles]] on each altar, the noblemen would bestow a florin on them, and the rest of the procession would bestow silver coins as they wished. What was left of silver coins were then put in a bowl, to be cast among the poor in Roskilde.\n\nOn 14 May 1443, a fire swept through Roskilde, destroying most of the city and all but three of the clergy's houses. The fire was so intense that the glass windows cracked, and the lead roofing melted. The cathedral was badly damaged and it was not until 1463 that the bishop, Oluf Mortensen, could rededicate it. To help with its reconstruction, the bishops of Denmark each signed a letter granting 40 days of [[indulgence]] to whoever would contribute to its cost.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=82}} The reconstruction could also have been helped by the decision of [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to build a chapel at the cathedral. The Chapel of the Magi was built during the 1460s, and together with the sarcophagus of Margrethe I and the remains from the previous churches, it marks the earliest royal burials.\n\nThe [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]] arrived in 1536, marking a sharp negative turn for Roskilde Cathedral. Not only was the Bishop of Roskilde, Joachim R\u00f8nnow, jailed in [[Copenhagen Castle]], the diocese was moved to Copenhagen and Peder Palladius, became the new [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|Superintendent]] of Zealand and later bishop. Hans Tausen, who had sought to encourage wide adoption of the Reformation, was sent to Roskilde in 1538 to help convert the clergymen who were opposed to the new ideas. At a Reformation meeting in 1540, it was decided that all of the bishop's property was now to belong to the king, both symbolically and in reality the head of the [[Church of Denmark]]. The cathedral had already been forced to hand over some of its property during the [[Count's Feud]], but following the decision and with an impending war against the Swedes, the confiscation of church property was stepped up. Among the cathedral's most prized possessions was a wooden statue of St Lucius, covered in gold and gems. The [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] fought hard to try and retain its property, at one point asking for a receipt for some of the confiscated goods, to which the king's men replied that the king did not need to hand out a receipt for something that already belonged to him.{{sfn|Kruse|2003|p=110}}\n[[File:Roskilde Cathedral Interior 2017-08-18 5.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The nave of the cathedral]]\nAfter the Reformation, the cathedral was opened up to the ordinary congregation, necessitating the purchase of new furniture, especially [[pew]]s. As in other former Catholic cathedrals, the choir, which had been separated from the nave by a large wall, was left intact with the altar placed against the wall.\n\nWhile the cathedral suffered financial hardship, having been forced to give away all its property (which at the time included one in every four farms on Zealand and 30 large estates), it was endowed with a variety of gifts from [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]: The altarpiece (between 1555 and 1623), a royal box ca 1600, the [[pulpit]] in 1610, his own burial chapel in 1614, the construction of the iconic twin spires in 1633 and finally a grand Renaissance sandstone entrance portal in 1635.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=124}}\n\nOn 26 February 1658, the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] was signed in the cathedral. In the loot the Swedes took from the cathedral, was the golden dress of Margrethe I, which had hung in a closet near her sarcophagus. The dress was taken by the Swedish queen consort [[Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp|Hedwig Eleonora]] and is now located at [[Uppsala Cathedral]]. In 1690, [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] ordered the old Catholic choir cleared, so he could create a crypt beneath it for the children he had had with his mistress [[Sophie Amalie Moth|Sophie Amalie]]. This also allowed for the altar to be moved to its present position.\n\nIn 1774, work on the third royal burial chapel, Frederick V's chapel, began with the removal of the pre-existing Chapel of Our Lady. Money soon ran out, and it was not until 1825 that the work was completed. In the meantime, in 1806, the cathedral sold its inventory from its Catholic days at a notorious auction. Among the items sold was a grand crucifix which went to a local coppersmith. While he was sawing the crucifix into firewood, the head of [[Jesus]] split open and a small, golden [[patriarchal cross]] fell out. Upon closer inspection, it was revealed that the cross was hollow and that a splinter from Christ's cross was hidden inside. Rumour of the find quickly reached the Royal Art Collection, later the [[National Museum of Denmark]], which immediately purchased it.{{Sfn|Kruse|2003|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nIn 1871, the entrance portal was replaced with one that matched the rest of the cathedral, while the old portal was donated to [[Holmen Church]]. However, when the new portal arrived, the [[churchwarden]] was horrified to see it was a poor copy of the old style. But he had no choice but to erect it.{{Sfn|Fang|1960|p=124}}\n\nWork on the fourth royal burial chapel began in 1915, and prior to its completion in 1924, Roskilde was once again made a diocese. On 27 August 1968, as restoration work on the Margrethe spire was nearing completion, the spire burned, threatening to collapse into the choir. During firefighting operations, members of the [[civil defense]] and church staff covered the canons' chairs, the altar, and the sarcophagi in the retrochoir with damp fire blankets, hoping to prevent damage to the invaluable items. The [[Defence Minister of Denmark]] ordered a complete ban on jet operations in the area, pending investigations into whether the vaults were in danger of collapsing.<ref>{{cite news|title=Roskilde-luften forbudt omr\u00e5de|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/8038/|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=Politiken|page=4|language=Danish}}</ref> It was later discovered, that despite a total ban on any heat sources in the area where the restoration was taking place, the craftsmen had been smoking and using blowtorches in the loft.<ref>{{cite news|title=Retssag efter kirkebranden|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/8037/|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=Politiken|page=2|language=Danish}}</ref> The latest addition to the cathedral was in 1985, when the New Burial Ground, also known as Frederick IX's Burial Ground, was inaugurated.\n\nIn 2018, the future resting places and monument for the current queen of Denmark [[Queen Margrethe II]] was placed in the chapel of St. Brigitte. The design is made by Danish sculptor [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]]. A model is at display in the cathedral alongside an exhibition on the tradition of royal burials.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://roskildedomkirke.dk/besoeg/kongegrave/dronningens-gravmaele |website=Roskilde Cathedral |publisher=Roskilde Cathedral}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n[[Image:Roskilde Dom10.jpg|200px|thumb|Sepulchral monument of Frederick II by Gert van Egen in the Chapel of the Magi]]\n[[Image:Roskilde kathedraal.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Sepulchral monument of Christian III by Cornelis Floris]]\n\n=== Chapels ===\n\n==== Chapel of the Magi (Christian I's chapel) ====\nWhen King [[Christopher of Bavaria|Christopher III]] died childless in 1448, his widow [[Dorothea of Brandenburg]] remarried the newly chosen king, [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]]. Within a few years, he became king of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, and Dorothea had given birth to the future king [[John of Denmark|John]], thus establishing the [[House of Oldenburg]]. Against this background of events, the Christian I decided to build a grand chapel at the cathedral.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|p=13}} The instrument of foundation was signed on April 28, 1459, which not only ordered the construction of the chapel, but also granted large tracts of land to the church.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|p=17}}  In the spring of 1462, the king applied to [[Pope Pius II]] for indulgence for having constructed the chapel, which was finally granted upon his visit to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] in Rome in 1474.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|p=42}}\n\nBuilt in Gothic style, in line with the rest of the cathedral, the chapel consists of two floors, the lower floor intended as a burial chapel for Christian I and the upper floor as [[Great Hall]] for the members of the king's newly created Fellowship of the Mother of God, the precursor to the modern day [[Order of the Elephant]]. The two floors rest on a central granite pillar, the so-called King's Pillar, where numerous kings have had their height measured over the years.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=34}} Amongst the kings measured, [[Peter the Great]], measured in 1716, stands tallest, while [[Chulalongkorn|Chulalongkorn of Siam]], measured in 1907, is the smallest. The height mark for Christian I is believed to be a technical error, as the king may have been tall, but not the giant the marker would suggest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Roskilde Domkirke|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/verdensarv/verdensarv/roskilde-domkirke/|publisher=Kulturarvsstyrelsen|language=Danish|quote=Nogle af m\u00e5lene m\u00e5 i h\u00f8jere grad v\u00e6re udtryk for \u00f8nsker om kongelig pondus end de reelle forhold.

Christian III's [[alabaster]], [[Rouge Belge]] and [[Noir Belge]] monument was created 1574\u201375 by Antwerpian sculptor [[Cornelis Floris de Vriendt|Cornelis Floris]]. When the sculptor died in October 1575, the monument was more or less complete, lacking only its weapons and inscriptions, which were to be added by the [[herald]] Jan Baptist Guidetty. In fact, they were never added, and when the Spanish [[Sack of Antwerp|sacked Antwerp]] in November 1576, the monument was held until the widow of Cornelis Floris paid a ransom. The widow then sent word to the Danish court, requesting that the monument be retrieved and her contribution covered, which was not done until 1578. When the monument arrived in [[Elsinore]], two local [[Stonemasonry|stonemasons]] set to work completing the monument, and in the summer of 1580 it was finally placed in the chapel.<ref>{{cite web|last=Truds\u00f8|first=Susanne|title=Kongelige gravm\u00e6ler i sten|url=http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/graphics/Klub/November.ST.pdf|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|page=3|language=Danish}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFrederick II's monument, crafted from the same materials, was built 1594\u20131598 by the [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] sculptor [[Gert van Egen]], who was a pupil of Cornelis Floris and was a resident of Elsinore. Both monuments are empty however, as the coffins have been buried below the floor of the chapel.{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|pp=47\u201348}} King John was also supposed to have been buried in the chapel, but in his later years, he and his wife enjoyed living in N\u00e6sbyhoved Castle near [[Odense]] so much, that he expressed a preference to be buried in the town's [[St. Canute's Cathedral|Franciscan cathedral]]. However, the bishop and canons in Roskilde claimed that the King had determined that he was to be buried in Roskilde. The king's widow, [[Christina of Saxony]], sent a letter to [[Pope Leo X]] asking for assistance, and in his reply, the pope stated that a man's last wish must always be followed, and the king was therefore buried in Odense.{{Sfn|Arhnung|1965|pp=228-9}}\n\nThe chapel's vaults and walls are richly decorated with [[fresco]]s, dating from the 1460s when the chapel was created by Christian I and his wife. Once whitewashed over, they were rediscovered in 1826. The arms of the king and queen decorate the chapel's east wall.<ref>[http://www.astoft2.co.uk/sjaelland/roskildedomuk.htm \"Roskilde Cathedral\"], Astoft.

Built in Dutch [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style, work on exterior of the chapel was begun in 1614 by [[Lorenz van Steenwinckel]] and completed in 1641 by his brother, [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger]].{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=36}} The exterior was constructed in red brick with a [[Crow-stepped gable|corbie stepped gable]] facing north. On each of the gable steps, a sandstone figure is placed, representing each of the [[Seven virtues|Christian virtues]]. Next to the gable's windows, four [[Putto|putti]] are placed, each holding up one of the [[symbols of death]]: a skull, a scythe, a torch pointing downwards, and an hourglass. Central At the centre of the gable, the king's [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] is found.{{sfn|H\u00f8jlund|2010|p=90}}\n[[Image:RoskildeDomkirke-CasparFinckeGitter.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Caspar Fincke]]s latticework]]\nThe wrought-iron lattice separating the chapel from the nave was forged by [[Caspar Fincke]] in 1619, and contains an amusing quip by its creator:\n\n::Caspar Fincke bin ich benant\n::Dieser arbeit bin ich bekant\n(''Rough translation: Caspar Fincke I am named, for this work I am famed'').\n\nUpon the death of Christian IV in 1648 the interior had not been completed, and the king's coffin was placed in the crypt below instead. The king had commissioned his own monument, depicting him and his queen kneeling before a [[crucifix]], but since it had been completed before his death, the monument had been temporarily placed in storage in the [[Christian IV's Arsenal|king's arsenal]]. When the arsenal burned in 1647, all that remained of the monument was the grand [[sandstone]] crucifix and a head carved from alabaster. The crucifix was subsequently placed in [[Holmen Church]], while the head was given to the [[National Museum of Denmark]].{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=128}}\nThe king's successors were each unable to provide a fitting resting place for the king, and it was not until 1840 and [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Christian VIII]] that work was finally begun. He had hoped to see the project finished by 1848, the 200th anniversary of [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV's]] death, but it was not until 1870 that the work was completed.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=23}}\n\nWork on the interior began in 1840, when Christian VIII ordered a statue of Christian IV from famed sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. This was to be part of a planned monument for Christian IV, which was to be designed by architect G.F. Hetcsh, but it still had to be decided who was to was going to create the decorations. In 1845 a commission tasked [[Heinrich Eddelien]] with the job, but work progressed slowly, perhaps due to Christian VIII's close concern with the matter and criticism of the proposed works. When Christian VIII died in 1848, the project lost its major motivational force, as the new king, Frederick VII, was not sufficiently interested in seeing project finished. When Eddelien died in 1852, only the work on the starry vaulted ceiling and the [[allegory]] motives beneath it had been completed, and work ground to a complete halt.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=24}}\n[[Image:Roskilde Dom05.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Interior of Christian IV's Chapel.]]\nIn 1856, [[Georg Hilker]] added a [[frieze]] below the ceiling vault, which was to act as a separator between the ceiling and wall decorations. When [[Wilhelm Marstrand]] and [[Heinrich Hansen (painter)|Heinrich Hansen]] were finally appointed in 1860, it was the [[Finance Minister of Denmark|finance minister]], C.E. Fenger, who was responsible. The original commission was outraged that the minister had acted behind their backs, but times had changed since the commission had been formed, and with the [[National Liberal Party (Denmark)|National Liberal Party]] in power, there was an increased focus on the national attitude. The National Liberal minister felt that seeing the completion of Christian IV's chapel, which he regarded as a national relic, would strengthen the national sentiment in the developing conflict with Prussia.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=28}}\n\nMarstrand and Hansen submitted their decoration proposals in 1861, having decided that Marstrand would paint the paintings while Hansen would paint the framings. That year the pair travelled to France to study oil painting on plaster. Marstrand then spent the summers of 1864\u20131866 in Roskilde, painting one wall per year. When Marstrand had finished his work, the five coffins in the chapel were placed in their current positions.{{sfn|Cederstr\u00f8m|1988|p=28}}\n\n==== Frederick V's chapel ====\n[[Image:RoskildeDomkirke-FrederikVKapelIndgang.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Interior of Frederick V's Chapel]]\nConsisting of two chapels in [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, the construction spanned 51 years (1774\u20131825) and required the removal of a previous existing chapel, the Chapel of Our Lady.\n\nConstruction of the chapel was started by [[Caspar Frederik Harsdorff|C. F. Harsdorff]] in 1774, possibly using early sketches made during his travels to Rome 1762\u20131764, but due to a lack of funding the work was suspended in 1779. It was resumed by his apprentice [[Christian Frederik Hansen|C. F. Hansen]] in 1820 and completed in 1825. The chapel consists of a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] with two adjoining rooms on the north and south sides, usually referred to as Christian VI's chapel, and a domed cruciform-shaped hall, Frederick V's chapel. While the interior of the building had classical, [[whitewash]]ed walls, the exterior retained the red brick characteristic of the rest of the cathedral.\n\nWhen the chapel was inaugurated in September 1825, coffins that had been temporarily stored in Christian IV's chapel were moved to the new chapel, and as members of the royal family died, more were added. This led to the chapel, which had been designed for five marble sarcophagi,{{sfn|Horskj\u00e6r|1970|p=49}} holding upwards of 17 coffins in 1912. However, the addition of Christian IX's chapel, the removal of some coffins to the crypts, and a rearrangement of the coffins, led to the present situation where only 12 coffins and sarcophagi are present. It has however led to confusion, as some of the coffins have not been arranged in the pairs which correspond to the relationships that existed during their lifetimes.{{sfn|Fang|1960|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe chapel shows a gradual trend in moving from grand marble sarcophagi to more simple, velvet-covered coffins, and in the case of Frederick VII, a wooden coffin.\n\n==== Christian IX's chapel ====\n[[Image:Roskilde Cathedral - Christian IX's Chapel.JPG|200px|right|thumb|Interior of Christian IX's Chapel]]\nWhen the [[Constitution of Denmark]] was revised in 1915, the [[Folketing]] decided to honour the [[Danish Royal Family|Royal Family]], granting King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X's]] wish, by constructing a new chapel at the cathedral, dedicated to the [[House of Gl\u00fccksburg]] which had held the throne since [[Christian IX of Denmark|Christian IX]] became king in 1863. The chapel was designed by then cathedral architect, Andreas Clemmensen.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=145}}\n\nConstruction of the chapel, overseen by a master builder Schledermann, began in 1919 and was completed in 1924, built in a [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine Revival]] style, with a [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman]] inspiration. Built as an extension of the northwestern [[Church porch|weaponporch]], which then ceased to exist as an independent building, the chapel is [[cruciform]] with grey walls and a domed roof.{{sfn|Fang|1960|p=145}} Upon its completion, there was a heavy debate in the Danish newspapers, with some believing that the chapel was completely removed from the prevailing style of the cathedral.\n\nIn the northern arm stands the double sarcophagus of Christian IX and his Queen [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Louise]]. Designed by [[Hack Kampmann]], the sarcophagus was originally to have stood in the eastern arm of Frederick V's chapel. Surrounding the sarcophagus are three statues of female figures, designed by [[Edvard Eriksen]]. The statues are named \"Grief\", \"Memory\", and \"Love\" and were cut from white [[marble]] from [[Carrara]] in Italy. The statue of \"Grief\" bears a notable resemblance to the statue of [[The Little Mermaid (statue)|the Little Mermaid]] in [[Copenhagen]], which is not without reason. Edvard Eriksen had created the statue of the Little Mermaid in 1911, two years before he created the statues in the chapel, and his wife [[Eline Eriksen]] was model for both.<ref>{{cite web|last=Truds\u00f8|first=Susanne|title=Kongelige gravm\u00e6ler i sten|url=http://www.nationalmuseet.dk/graphics/Klub/November.ST.pdf|publisher=National Museum of Denmark|page=8|language=Danish}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In the western arm stands the double sarcophagus of [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Frederick VIII]] and his Queen [[Louise of Sweden|Louise]], designed by [[Einar Utzon-Frank|Utzon-Frank]]. The eastern arm houses the simple marble coffins of Christian X and his Queen [[Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Alexandrine]]. The coffins were designed by [[Kaare Klint|Kaare]] and Naur Klint, made from Norwegian marble, and have a stylized [[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] covering the lid and sides.\n\nFollowing the death of [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Feodorovna]] in 1928, and following a short ceremony in the [[Alexander Nevsky Church, Copenhagen|Alexander Nevsky Church]] in Copenhagen and a [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] ceremony in Roskilde, the coffin of the dowager empress was placed in the chapel close to the tomb of her parents and brother and sister-in-law. In 1957, the coffin was placed in the crypt under the chapel, until September 2006, when it was returned to Russia. It had been the wish of the dowager empress to be buried when possible next to her husband [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] in the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]]. This was possible after extensive negotiations between Queen Margrethe II and President Putin.\n\nFollowing Frederick IX's death in 1972, his coffin was placed in the chapel, draped with his [[Flag of Denmark#Royal Standards|Royal Standard]], guarded by three silver lions from the [[Danish Crown Regalia]], and flanked by a pair of [[candelabra]] in the shape of anchors. After the king's coffin was buried in 1985, only the candelabra remain in the chapel.\n\n==== St Andrew's Chapel and St Bridget's Chapel ====\n[[Image:RoskildeDomkirke-SanktAndreasKapelAltertavle.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The altar in St Andrew's Chapel]]\nThese two chapels, on the north side of the cathedral, are the only remnants of the many medieval chapels that were attached to the original cathedral. St Andrew's chapel was constructed in 1396, and St Bridget's in 1485.\n\nSt Andrew's chapel was completely redecorated in 2010 by artist Peter Brandes, who provided a new altarpiece as well as a latticework separating the chapel from the nave. It is the intention of the parochial church council that in future the chapel will provide a more intimate setting for some of the church functions in the cathedral, such as weddings or baptisms. The chapel has its own small organ for these services.\n\nSince the Reformation, St Bridget's chapel has mainly been used to store various items of church inventory from Catholic times, no longer needed in the Lutheran era. These include the three-seated [[Officiant|celebrant's]] chair, the [[Cantor (church)|cantor's]] chair, and the [[Canon (priest)|canons']] [[letter box]]. The chapel also has the oldest gravestone in the cathedral, dating back to ca. 1250.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kruse|first=Anette|title=Roskilde Domkirke|year=2003|publisher=Roskilde Domkirkes Salgsfond|pages=17, 21}}</ref> [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]] has chosen St Birgitte's Chapel as the future burial site for herself with a sarcophagus created by artist [[Bj\u00f8rn N\u00f8rgaard]].

The reason for the construction was twofold: it had been Frederick IX's wish to be buried outside the cathedral, in view of [[Roskilde Fjord]] (the king was a keen sailor and closely connected to the navy), and in any case there was no space left in the chapel of Christian IX.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bis\u00e6ttes i Roskilde Domkirke|publisher=Politikens Hus|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/3656/3/|language=Danish}}</ref> It was only on the king's death in January 1972 that a debate was opened on how his wish could be granted. A meeting was held in May of the same year, involving the municipality, the parochial church council, the National Museum of Denmark, and a foundation for building and landscaping culture. In 1974 a discussion paper was presented, which spelled out how the area would be preserved and the new burial site established. There was some opposition from members of the parochial council, who insisted that the tradition of burying monarchs inside the cathedral be upheld.<ref>{{cite web|title=Voksende modstand mod det nye gravkammer|publisher=Politikens Hus|url=http://www.e-pages.dk/politiken/24267/8/|language=Danish}}</ref> The zoning plan for the area was finished in 1982 and work on the burial site could begin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fang|first=Lotte|title=By og bibliotek|year=2001|publisher=Roskilde Library|page=47}}</ref>\n\nThe burial site was designed by architect [[Vilhelm Wohlert]] in cooperation with Inger and Johannes Exner, and consists of a simple, uncovered brick octagon with a bronze gate designed by Sven Havsteen-Mikkelsen.

G. Delfin for the [[Philippine National Oil Company]] as part of the surface investigations of the area before exploratory drilling and well testing for [[geothermal energy]] sources in 1988 to 1990.

Much of the rugged land around the present volcano consists of remnants of \"ancestral\" Pinatubo. It was an [[andesite]] and [[dacite]] [[stratovolcano]] whose eruptive activity was much less explosive than modern Pinatubo. Its center was roughly where the current volcano is. The projected height of the mountain is up to {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}}, or 1.43 miles above [[sea level]] if it were a lone peak, based on a profile fitting to the remaining lower slopes, or lower if it had more than one peak.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nThe old volcano is exposed in the walls of an old {{convert|3.5|x|4.5|km|abbr=on}} wide [[caldera]], referred to as ''Tayawan Caldera'' by Delfin. Some of the nearby peaks are the remnants of ancestral Pinatubo, left behind when the softer parts of the old mountain slopes were eroded by [[weathering]]. Ancestral Pinatubo is a [[somma volcano]] with modern Pinatubo as the new cone.\nMount Dorst, to the east, is part of the dip slope of the ancestral Pinatubo. Several mountains near modern Pinatubo are old satellite vents of ancestral Pinatubo, forming [[volcanic plug]]s and lava domes. These satellite vents were probably active around the same time as the ancestral volcano and include the domes of Mount Negron, Mount Cuadrado, Mount Mataba and the Bituin and Tapungho plugs.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\n===Modern Pinatubo===\n* c. 33,000 BC: After a long period of [[dormant volcano|dormancy]], Modern Pinatubo was born in Ancestral Pinatubo's cataclysmic and most explosive eruptions, estimated to be five times larger than the June 1991 eruption. It deposited all around the volcano up to {{convert|25|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of [[pyroclastic surge]] material up to {{convert|100|m}} thick. The total volume of volcanic material ejected during the eruptions is unknown. The removal of so much material from the underlying [[magma chamber]] resulted in the Tayawan [[caldera]]. The violent eruptive period started by the eruption is referred to by Delfin as the ''Inararo Eruptive Period'', named after a village that was destroyed in the 1991 eruption.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nLater eruptions of modern Pinatubo occurred episodically and lasted for periods much shorter than the repose intervals between them. Subsequent eruptions and eruptive period occurred about:\n*c. 15,000 BC (Sacobia Eruptive Period)\n*c. 7000 BC (Pasbul Eruptive Period). Its eruptions were as energetic, if not as voluminous as the Inararo eruptions. \n*c. 4000\u20133000 BC (Crow Valley Eruptive Period). This and the Mara-unot period's eruptions were smaller than the Inararo eruptions but about two to three times as big as that of 1991 based on the pyroclastic flow runout distances and depths of valley filling.\n*c. 1900\u2013300 BC (Maraunot Eruptive Period)\n*c. AD 1500 (Buag Eruptive Period). Its eruptions were roughly the same size as those of 1991.\n\nEach of these eruptions seems to have been very large, ejecting more than {{cvt|10|km3||}} of material and covering large parts of the surrounding areas with pyroclastic flow deposits. Some eruptive periods have lasted decades and perhaps as much as several centuries and might appear to include multiple large explosive eruptions.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nThe maximum size of eruptions in each eruptive period though has been getting smaller through the more than 35,000-year history of modern Pinatubo, but this might be an artifact of erosion and burial of older deposits. The oldest eruption of modern Pinatubo, Inararo, was also its largest.\n\nThe 1991 eruption was among the smallest documented in its geologic record.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nThe volcano has never grown very large between eruptions, because it produces mostly unwelded, easily erodible deposits and periodically destroys the viscous domes that fill its vents. After the Buag eruption (c. 1500 AD), the volcano lay dormant, its slopes becoming completely covered in dense [[rainforest]] and eroded into gullies and ravines. The c. 500-year repose though between the Buag and present eruptive periods is among the shorter repose periods recognized in its geologic history.<ref name=\"Newhall\">{{cite book|editor-first1=Christopher G.|editor-last1=Newhall|editor-last2=Punongbayan|editor-first2=Raymundo S.|chapter=Eruptive history of Mount Pinatubo|chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/newhall/index.html |title=FIRE and MUD: Eruptions and Lahars of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Philippines/Pinatubo/Publications/FireMud/about_the_book.html|publisher=Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology; University of Washington Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-295-97585-6 }}</ref>\n\n====1991 eruption====\n{{main article|1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo}}\nIn March and April 1991, magma rising toward the surface from more than {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} beneath Pinatubo triggered small [[volcano tectonic earthquake]]s and caused powerful [[phreatic eruption|steam explosions]] that blasted three [[volcanic crater|craters]] on the north flank of the volcano.

Because it had lost most of the gas contained in it on the way to the surface, the magma oozed out to form a lava dome but did not cause an explosive eruption. However, on June 12, millions of cubic yards of gas-charged magma reached the surface and exploded in the reawakening volcano\u2019s first spectacular eruption.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\nWhen even more highly gas-charged magma reached Pinatubo\u2019s surface on June 15, the volcano exploded in a cataclysmic eruption that ejected more than {{Convert|5|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} of material. The [[eruption column|ash cloud]] from this climactic eruption rose {{Convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere. At lower altitudes, the [[volcanic ash]] was blown in all directions by the intense cyclonic winds of a coincidentally occurring typhoon, and winds at higher altitudes blew the ash southwestward. A blanket of ash and larger [[pumice]] [[lapilli]] blanketed the countryside. Fine ash fell as far away as the [[Indian Ocean]] and satellites tracked the ash cloud several times around the globe.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\nHuge pyroclastic flows roared down the flanks of Mount Pinatubo, filling once-deep valleys with fresh volcanic deposits as much as {{Convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. The eruption removed so much magma and rock from below the volcano that the summit collapsed to form a {{Convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide caldera.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\nFollowing the climactic eruption of June 15, 1991, activity at the volcano continued at a much lower level, with continuous ash eruptions lasting until August 1991 and episodic eruptions continuing for another month.\n\n====Later eruptions====\n[[File:Mount Pinatubo 20081229 01.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Pinatubo]], the crater lake resulting from the 1991 eruption, pictured here in 2008]]\n[[File:Mount Pinatubo 6.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Mt. Pinatubo and [[Lake Pinatubo]] in 2006]]\nActivity at the volcano remained low until July 1992 when a new lava dome started growing in the [[caldera]]. Volcanologists suspected that further violent eruptions could be possible, and some areas were evacuated. However, the eruption was only minor. The last eruption from Mount Pinatubo took place in 1993.<ref name=\"SI\"/>\n\n====Lake Pinatubo====\n{{main article|Lake Pinatubo}}\nThe 1991 caldera afterwards filled with water from annual monsoon rains and a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]], [[Lake Pinatubo]], was formed. In 1992, a growing lava dome formed an island, which was eventually submerged by the lake. Initially, the lake was hot and highly [[acid]]ic, with a minimum [[pH]] of 2 and a temperature of about {{convert|40|C|F}}. Subsequent rainfall cooled and diluted the lake, lowering the temperature to {{convert|26|C|F}} and raising the pH to 5.5 by 2003.\n\nThe lake deepened by about {{convert|1|m|ft|spell=in}} per month on average, eventually submerging the lava dome, until September 2001, when fears that the walls of the crater might be unstable prompted the Philippine government to order a controlled draining of the lake. An estimated 9,000&nbsp;people were once again evacuated from surrounding areas in case a large [[flood]] was accidentally triggered.

There is a local oral tradition suggestive of a folk memory of earlier large eruptions. An ancient legend tells of Bacobaco, a terrible spirit of the sea, who could metamorphose into a huge turtle and throw fire from his mouth. In the legend, when being chased by the spirit hunters, Bacobaco flees to the mountain and digs a great hole in its summit showering the surrounding land with rock, mud, dust and fire for three days; howling so loudly that the earth shakes.<ref>Rodolfo, K.S. & Umbal, J.V.

Ancestral Pinatubo is a [[somma volcano]] with modern Pinatubo as the new cone.\nMount Dorst, to the east, is part of the dip slope of the ancestral Pinatubo. Several mountains near modern Pinatubo are old satellite vents of ancestral Pinatubo, forming [[volcanic plug]]s and lava domes. These satellite vents were probably active around the same time as the ancestral volcano and include the domes of Mount Negron, Mount Cuadrado, Mount Mataba and the Bituin and Tapungho plugs.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\n===Modern Pinatubo===\n* c. 33,000 BC: After a long period of [[dormant volcano|dormancy]], Modern Pinatubo was born in Ancestral Pinatubo's cataclysmic and most explosive eruptions, estimated to be five times larger than the June 1991 eruption. It deposited all around the volcano up to {{convert|25|km3|cumi|abbr=on}} of [[pyroclastic surge]] material up to {{convert|100|m}} thick. The total volume of volcanic material ejected during the eruptions is unknown. The removal of so much material from the underlying [[magma chamber]] resulted in the Tayawan [[caldera]]. The violent eruptive period started by the eruption is referred to by Delfin as the ''Inararo Eruptive Period'', named after a village that was destroyed in the 1991 eruption.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nLater eruptions of modern Pinatubo occurred episodically and lasted for periods much shorter than the repose intervals between them. Subsequent eruptions and eruptive period occurred about:\n*c. 15,000 BC (Sacobia Eruptive Period)\n*c. 7000 BC (Pasbul Eruptive Period). Its eruptions were as energetic, if not as voluminous as the Inararo eruptions. \n*c. 4000\u20133000 BC (Crow Valley Eruptive Period). This and the Mara-unot period's eruptions were smaller than the Inararo eruptions but about two to three times as big as that of 1991 based on the pyroclastic flow runout distances and depths of valley filling.\n*c. 1900\u2013300 BC (Maraunot Eruptive Period)\n*c. AD 1500 (Buag Eruptive Period). Its eruptions were roughly the same size as those of 1991.\n\nEach of these eruptions seems to have been very large, ejecting more than {{cvt|10|km3||}} of material and covering large parts of the surrounding areas with pyroclastic flow deposits. Some eruptive periods have lasted decades and perhaps as much as several centuries and might appear to include multiple large explosive eruptions.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nThe maximum size of eruptions in each eruptive period though has been getting smaller through the more than 35,000-year history of modern Pinatubo, but this might be an artifact of erosion and burial of older deposits. The oldest eruption of modern Pinatubo, Inararo, was also its largest.\n\nThe 1991 eruption was among the smallest documented in its geologic record.<ref name=\"Newhall\"/>\n\nThe volcano has never grown very large between eruptions, because it produces mostly unwelded, easily erodible deposits and periodically destroys the viscous domes that fill its vents. After the Buag eruption (c. 1500 AD), the volcano lay dormant, its slopes becoming completely covered in dense [[rainforest]] and eroded into gullies and ravines. The c. 500-year repose though between the Buag and present eruptive periods is among the shorter repose periods recognized in its geologic history.<ref name=\"Newhall\">{{cite book|editor-first1=Christopher G.|editor-last1=Newhall|editor-last2=Punongbayan|editor-first2=Raymundo S.|chapter=Eruptive history of Mount Pinatubo|chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pinatubo/newhall/index.html |title=FIRE and MUD: Eruptions and Lahars of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines |url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Volcanoes/Philippines/Pinatubo/Publications/FireMud/about_the_book.html|publisher=Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology; University of Washington Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-295-97585-6 }}</ref>\n\n====1991 eruption====\n{{main article|1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo}}\nIn March and April 1991, magma rising toward the surface from more than {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=on}} beneath Pinatubo triggered small [[volcano tectonic earthquake]]s and caused powerful [[phreatic eruption|steam explosions]] that blasted three [[volcanic crater|craters]] on the north flank of the volcano. Thousands of small earthquakes occurred beneath Pinatubo through April, May and early June and many thousand of tons of noxious [[sulfur dioxide]] gas were also emitted by the volcano.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\n[[File:Pinatubo ash plume 910612.jpg|thumb|left|Eruption column on June 12, 1991]]\n\nFrom June 7 to 12, the first magma reached the surface of Mount Pinatubo. Because it had lost most of the gas contained in it on the way to the surface, the magma oozed out to form a lava dome but did not cause an explosive eruption. However, on June 12, millions of cubic yards of gas-charged magma reached the surface and exploded in the reawakening volcano\u2019s first spectacular eruption.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\nWhen even more highly gas-charged magma reached Pinatubo\u2019s surface on June 15, the volcano exploded in a cataclysmic eruption that ejected more than {{Convert|5|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} of material. The [[eruption column|ash cloud]] from this climactic eruption rose {{Convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} into the atmosphere. At lower altitudes, the [[volcanic ash]] was blown in all directions by the intense cyclonic winds of a coincidentally occurring typhoon, and winds at higher altitudes blew the ash southwestward. A blanket of ash and larger [[pumice]] [[lapilli]] blanketed the countryside. Fine ash fell as far away as the [[Indian Ocean]] and satellites tracked the ash cloud several times around the globe.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\nHuge pyroclastic flows roared down the flanks of Mount Pinatubo, filling once-deep valleys with fresh volcanic deposits as much as {{Convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} thick. The eruption removed so much magma and rock from below the volcano that the summit collapsed to form a {{Convert|2.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide caldera.<ref name=\"Pinatubo1991\"/>\n\nFollowing the climactic eruption of June 15, 1991, activity at the volcano continued at a much lower level, with continuous ash eruptions lasting until August 1991 and episodic eruptions continuing for another month.\n\n====Later eruptions====\n[[File:Mount Pinatubo 20081229 01.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Pinatubo]], the crater lake resulting from the 1991 eruption, pictured here in 2008]]\n[[File:Mount Pinatubo 6.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Mt. Pinatubo and [[Lake Pinatubo]] in 2006]]\nActivity at the volcano remained low until July 1992 when a new lava dome started growing in the [[caldera]]. Volcanologists suspected that further violent eruptions could be possible, and some areas were evacuated. However, the eruption was only minor. The last eruption from Mount Pinatubo took place in 1993.<ref name=\"SI\"/>\n\n====Lake Pinatubo====\n{{main article|Lake Pinatubo}}\nThe 1991 caldera afterwards filled with water from annual monsoon rains and a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]], [[Lake Pinatubo]], was formed. In 1992, a growing lava dome formed an island, which was eventually submerged by the lake. Initially, the lake was hot and highly [[acid]]ic, with a minimum [[pH]] of 2 and a temperature of about {{convert|40|C|F}}. Subsequent rainfall cooled and diluted the lake, lowering the temperature to {{convert|26|C|F}} and raising the pH to 5.5 by 2003.\n\nThe lake deepened by about {{convert|1|m|ft|spell=in}} per month on average, eventually submerging the lava dome, until September 2001, when fears that the walls of the crater might be unstable prompted the Philippine government to order a controlled draining of the lake. An estimated 9,000&nbsp;people were once again evacuated from surrounding areas in case a large [[flood]] was accidentally triggered. Workers cut a {{convert|5|m|spell=in|adj=on}} notch in the crater rim and drained about a quarter of the lake's volume.<ref>{{cite news|date=September 7, 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1530182.stm|title=Filipinos return as volcano lake drains|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mt Pinatubo trekking - panoramio (5).jpg|thumb|Mount Pinatubo crater lake in 2012]]\n\n===Recent activity===\nOn July 10, 2002, the west wall of the crater collapsed, slowly releasing approximately {{convert|160|e6m3|e9cuft|abbr=off|}} of water and sediments into the Maraunot River in [[Botolan, Zambales]].<ref>[http://glassiris.info/Timeline.php?srch=collapses Timelines Page @ glassiris.info<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn July 26, 2011, a 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck close to Pinatubo; however, no major damages or casualties were reported.<ref>Gonzaga, Robert and Orejas, Tonette (2011-07-26).

There is a local oral tradition suggestive of a folk memory of earlier large eruptions. An ancient legend tells of Bacobaco, a terrible spirit of the sea, who could metamorphose into a huge turtle and throw fire from his mouth. In the legend, when being chased by the spirit hunters, Bacobaco flees to the mountain and digs a great hole in its summit showering the surrounding land with rock, mud, dust and fire for three days; howling so loudly that the earth shakes.<ref>Rodolfo, K.S. & Umbal, J.V.

The mountain was soon turned into the abode of Apo Namalyari (\"The lord of happenings/events\"), the pagan deity of the [[Sambal people|Sambal]], Aetas and [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]] living on the Zambales range.<ref name=\"hau.edu.ph\">[http://www.hau.edu.ph/kapampangan_center/publication/pdf/singsing/rivers.pdf]</ref>\n\nIt was said to comprise the whole mountain range until Sinukuan of [[Mount Arayat]] (the god of the Kapampangans) became a strong rival of Namalyari.  Their fight, which took place over the center plains, shattered the mountain into smaller bodies and Mount Arayat lost its center peak. Other versions have it that Pinatubo's peak shattered because of Namalyari's immense fury in an attempt to teach humans the meaning of fear and show how misdeeds will be punished.<ref name=\"hau.edu.ph\"/>\n\nAccording to the native elders, Apo Namalyari induced the June 1991 eruption because of displeasure toward illegal loggers and [[Philippine National Oil Company]] executives who performed deep exploratory drilling and well testing on the volcano looking for geothermal heat from 1988 to 1990.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19910721&slug=1295627|title=Natives Who Worship Pinatubo Feel Its Wrath|last=Loeb|first=Vernon|date=1991-07-21|work=[[Seattle Times]]|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref>  Discouraging results from the wells forced the abandonment of the prospect 13 months before the April 2, 1991 explosions.<ref>Delfin Jr.,  F.G., Villarosa, H.G..
