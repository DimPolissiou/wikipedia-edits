Edward V was never crowned, and his brief reign was dominated by the influence of his uncle and [[Lord Protector]], the Duke of Gloucester, who deposed him to reign as [[Richard III]] on 26&nbsp;June 1483; this was confirmed by the [[Act of Parliament|Act]] entitled [[Titulus Regius]], which denounced any further claims through his father's heirs.\n\nEdward and his younger brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]], were the [[Princes in the Tower]] who disappeared after being sent to heavily guarded royal lodgings in the [[Tower of London]]. Responsibility for their deaths is widely attributed to Richard III, but the lack of any solid evidence and conflicting contemporary accounts allow for other possibilities.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Cardinal Boucher urges the mother of Edward V to let her son out of Sanctury by John Z. Bell.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Cardinal Bourchier]] urges the mother of Edward V to let her son [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York|Richard]] out of [[Sanctuary]], by John Z. Bell]]\nEdward was born on 2 November 1470 in Cheyneygates, the medieval house of the [[Abbot of Westminster]] adjoining [[Westminster Abbey]]. His mother, [[Elizabeth Woodville]], had sought [[sanctuary]] there from [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]] who had deposed his father, the [[House of York|Yorkist]] king [[Edward IV]], during the course of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Edward was created [[Prince of Wales]] in June 1471, following Edward IV's restoration to the throne, and in 1473 was established at [[Ludlow Castle]] on the [[Welsh Marches]] as nominal president of a newly created [[Council of Wales and the Marches]]. In 1479, his father conferred the [[Earl of Pembroke|earldom of Pembroke]] on him; it became merged into the crown on his succession.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Pembroke, Earls of|volume=21|page=79}}</ref>\n\nPrince Edward was placed under the supervision of the queen's brother [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers|Anthony, Earl Rivers]], a noted scholar, and in a letter to Rivers, Edward IV set down precise conditions for the upbringing of his son and the management of his household.<ref>Letter from Edward IV to Earl Rivers and the Bishop of Rochester (1473), in [https://books.google.com/books?id=cks8AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage ''Readings in English Social History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1921)], pp. 205\u20138.</ref> The prince was to \"arise every morning at a convenient hour, according to his age\". His day would begin with [[matins]] and then [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], which he was to receive uninterrupted. After breakfast, the business of educating the prince began with \"virtuous learning\". Dinner was served from ten in the morning, and then the prince was to be read \"noble stories ... of virtue, honour, cunning, wisdom, and of deeds of worship\" but \"of nothing that should move or stir him to vice\". Perhaps aware of his own vices, the king was keen to safeguard his son's morals, and instructed Rivers to ensure that no one in the prince's household was a habitual \"swearer, brawler, backbiter, common hazarder, adulterer, [or user of] words of [[wikt:ribaldry|ribaldry]]\". After further study, in the afternoon the prince was to engage in sporting activities suitable for his class, before evensong. Supper was served from four, and curtains were to be drawn at eight. Following this, the prince's attendants were to \"enforce themselves to make him merry and joyous towards his bed\". They would then watch over him as he slept.\n\nKing Edward's diligence appeared to bear fruit, as [[Dominic Mancini]] reported of the young Edward V:\n\n{{quote|In word and deed he gave so many proofs of his liberal education, of polite nay rather scholarly, attainments far beyond his age; ... his special knowledge of literature ... enabled him to discourse elegantly, to understand fully, and to declaim most excellently from any work whether in verse or prose that came into his hands, unless it were from the more abstruse authors. He had such dignity in his whole person, and in his face such charm, that however much they might gaze, he never wearied the eyes of beholders.<ref>Dominic Mancini, ''The Usurpation of Richard III'' (1483), in [https://books.google.com/books?id=jRsLUVOCqbkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage A.

The two were to be married upon their majority, and the devolution of Brittany would have been given to the second child to be born, the first becoming Prince of Wales. Those plans disappeared together with Edward V.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:King-edward-v.jpg|thumb|200px|Edward V as [[Prince of Wales]].

Edward IV's will, which has not survived, nominated his trusted brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], as Protector during the minority of his son.

[[Dominic Mancini]], an Italian who visited England in the 1480s, reports that Edward protested, but the remainder of his entourage was dismissed and Richard escorted him to London.

This had previously happened with [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], who had become king at the age of ten. Another precedent was [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] whose protectorate (which started when he inherited the crown aged 9 months) had ended with his coronation aged seven. Richard, however, repeatedly postponed the coronation.<ref name=Pollard>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=A.J. |title=Richard III and the Princes in the Tower |year=1991 |publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing |isbn=0862996600 }}</ref>\n\nOn 22 June, [[Ralph Shaa]] preached a sermon declaring that Edward IV had already been contracted to marry [[Lady Eleanor Talbot|Lady Eleanor Butler]] when he married [[Elizabeth Woodville]], thereby rendering his marriage to Elizabeth invalid and their children together illegitimate.<ref name=Pollard/> The children of Richard's older brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]], were barred from the throne by their father's [[attainder]], and therefore, on 25 June, an assembly of Lords and Commons declared Richard to be the legitimate king (this was later confirmed by the act of parliament ''[[Titulus Regius]]''). The following day he acceded to the throne as King Richard III.\n\n==Disappearance==\n{{Main|Princes in the Tower}}\n[[File:DelarocheKingEdward.jpg|thumb|King Edward V and the Duke of York in the Tower of London by [[Paul Delaroche]].

During this period Mancini records that Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, \"like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him.\"<ref>\"The Usurpation of Richard the Third\", ''Dominicus Mancinus ad Angelum Catonem de occupatione regni Anglie per Riccardum Tercium libellus''; Translated to English by C.

Edward appears alive in only one scene of the play (Act 3 Scene 1), during which he and his brother are portrayed as bright, precocious children who see through their uncle's ambitions. Edward in particular is portrayed as wiser than his years (something his uncle notes) and ambitious about his kingship. Edward and his brother's deaths are described in the play, but occur offstage. Their ghosts return in one more scene (Act 5 Scene 3) to haunt their uncle's dreams and promise success to his rival, [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]].

His father Edward IV addresses his own brothers thus: \"[[George, Duke of Clarence|Clarence]], and [[Richard III of England|Gloster]], love my lovely queen, And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.\" Gloster, the future Richard III, is at the close of this play already encompassing his nephew's demise, as he mutters in an [[aside]], \"To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master, And cried \u2013 All hail! when as he meant \u2013 all harm.\"<ref>''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', Act 5, Scene VII, Lines 26-27, 33-34.</ref>\n\n==Heraldry==\nAs heir apparent, Edward bore the royal arms (quarterly France and England) differenced by a label of three points argent.

In 1479, his father conferred the [[Earl of Pembroke|earldom of Pembroke]] on him; it became merged into the crown on his succession.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Pembroke, Earls of|volume=21|page=79}}</ref>\n\nPrince Edward was placed under the supervision of the queen's brother [[Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers|Anthony, Earl Rivers]], a noted scholar, and in a letter to Rivers, Edward IV set down precise conditions for the upbringing of his son and the management of his household.<ref>Letter from Edward IV to Earl Rivers and the Bishop of Rochester (1473), in [https://books.google.com/books?id=cks8AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage ''Readings in English Social History'' (Cambridge University Press, 1921)], pp. 205\u20138.</ref> The prince was to \"arise every morning at a convenient hour, according to his age\". His day would begin with [[matins]] and then [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]], which he was to receive uninterrupted. After breakfast, the business of educating the prince began with \"virtuous learning\". Dinner was served from ten in the morning, and then the prince was to be read \"noble stories ... of virtue, honour, cunning, wisdom, and of deeds of worship\" but \"of nothing that should move or stir him to vice\". Perhaps aware of his own vices, the king was keen to safeguard his son's morals, and instructed Rivers to ensure that no one in the prince's household was a habitual \"swearer, brawler, backbiter, common hazarder, adulterer, [or user of] words of [[wikt:ribaldry|ribaldry]]\". After further study, in the afternoon the prince was to engage in sporting activities suitable for his class, before evensong. Supper was served from four, and curtains were to be drawn at eight. Following this, the prince's attendants were to \"enforce themselves to make him merry and joyous towards his bed\". They would then watch over him as he slept.\n\nKing Edward's diligence appeared to bear fruit, as [[Dominic Mancini]] reported of the young Edward V:\n\n{{quote|In word and deed he gave so many proofs of his liberal education, of polite nay rather scholarly, attainments far beyond his age; ... his special knowledge of literature ... enabled him to discourse elegantly, to understand fully, and to declaim most excellently from any work whether in verse or prose that came into his hands, unless it were from the more abstruse authors.

The two were to be married upon their majority, and the devolution of Brittany would have been given to the second child to be born, the first becoming Prince of Wales. Those plans disappeared together with Edward V.\n\n==Reign==\n[[File:King-edward-v.jpg|thumb|200px|Edward V as [[Prince of Wales]].

Edward IV's will, which has not survived, nominated his trusted brother [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]], as Protector during the minority of his son.

This had previously happened with [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], who had become king at the age of ten. Another precedent was [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] whose protectorate (which started when he inherited the crown aged 9 months) had ended with his coronation aged seven. Richard, however, repeatedly postponed the coronation.<ref name=Pollard>{{cite book |last=Pollard |first=A.J. |title=Richard III and the Princes in the Tower |year=1991 |publisher=Alan Sutton Publishing |isbn=0862996600 }}</ref>\n\nOn 22 June, [[Ralph Shaa]] preached a sermon declaring that Edward IV had already been contracted to marry [[Lady Eleanor Talbot|Lady Eleanor Butler]] when he married [[Elizabeth Woodville]], thereby rendering his marriage to Elizabeth invalid and their children together illegitimate.<ref name=Pollard/> The children of Richard's older brother [[George, Duke of Clarence]], were barred from the throne by their father's [[attainder]], and therefore, on 25 June, an assembly of Lords and Commons declared Richard to be the legitimate king (this was later confirmed by the act of parliament ''[[Titulus Regius]]'').

During this period Mancini records that Edward was regularly visited by a doctor, who reported that Edward, \"like a victim prepared for sacrifice, sought remission of his sins by daily confession and penance, because he believed that death was facing him.\"<ref>\"The Usurpation of Richard the Third\", ''Dominicus Mancinus ad Angelum Catonem de occupatione regni Anglie per Riccardum Tercium libellus''; Translated to English by C.

Edward appears alive in only one scene of the play (Act 3 Scene 1), during which he and his brother are portrayed as bright, precocious children who see through their uncle's ambitions. Edward in particular is portrayed as wiser than his years (something his uncle notes) and ambitious about his kingship. Edward and his brother's deaths are described in the play, but occur offstage. Their ghosts return in one more scene (Act 5 Scene 3) to haunt their uncle's dreams and promise success to his rival, [[Henry VII of England|Richmond]].

Promoted to colonel by general [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] himself, and before whom the Liberator would make the promise not to sheathe his sword until Cuba was free.\n\nIn 1823 the \"[[:es:Conspiraci\u00f3n de los Soles y Rayos de Bol\u00edvar|Conspiracy of Rayos y Soles de Bolivar]]\"  was led by the Venezuelan Carlos Aponte, who along with a group of Venezuelans and Cubans arrived in Cuba on an expedition that was discovered in [[Havana]] and executed its members by Spanish colonial forces.\n\nWhen the Spanish army withdrew in defeat to [[Cuba]] after the decisive [[Battle of Lake Maracaibo]] (1823), many Venezuelan royalists were exiliated as colonel [[Narciso Lopez]], [[:es:Marcos Maceo|Marcos Maceo]], who would be father of revolutionary [[Antonio Maceo Grajales|Antonio Maceo]], [[Calixto Garcia de Luna e Izquierdo|Calixto Garcia de Luna]], who would be grandfather of Cuban Independence major general [[Calixto Garcia]]. They continued to serve the Spanish government in several military and administrative posts in Cuba and Spain.  After turned against Spanish rule, they became a partisan of the independist faction in Cuba. In 1848, during an arrest of Cuban revolutionaries, L\u00f3pez fled to the [[United States]] where attempted to liberate the island and make an independent Cuba that would eventually join the United States as a slave state. The modern [[Flag of Cuba]] originates from his first expedition landed in [[Cardenas, Cuba|C\u00e1rdenas]], was designed by Lopez, as well as a local Cuban named [[Miguel Teurbe Tolon]]. In 1851 Lopez and many Americans of the second failed expedition were executed in [[Castillo San Salvador de la Punta|Castle Salvador de La Punta]] of [[Havana]].\n\nDuring the [[Ten Years War]] (1868- 1878), from Venezuela came, among others, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Barreto P\u00e9rez, Manuel Mar\u00eda Garrido P\u00e1ez, [http://anterior.cubaminrex.cu/Patrimonio/Articulos/2008/Realaciones.html Cristobal Mendoza],  Salom\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez, Crist\u00f3bal Acosta, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aurrecoechea Irigoyen and Amadeo Manuit. They all fought for the Independence of Cuba  in several battles standing out for their bravery. Salom\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez died in Cuba because of illness, while  Acosta, Aurrecoechea Irigoyen and  Manuit, drowned the insular soil with their blood, helping to lay the foundations of the growing friendship and solidarity between Cuba and Venezuela. In [[Guaimaro]], [[Carlos Manuel de C\u00e9spedes]], president of the [[Republic in Arms]] on April 12, 1869, designates the Venezuelan [[Crist\u00f3bal Mendoza]], Minister encharged of Foreign Relations, a young man among the Camag\u00fceyans was the first to take up arms. Son of [[Crist\u00f3bal Mendoza]], first President of Venezuela and friend of Bolivar who in 1813, after the defeat of the First Republic wrote to him in the following words: \"Come without delay: come. The country needs it. I will go ahead conquering and you will continue organizing me; Because you are the man of the organization, as I am of the conquest.\" Crist\u00f3bal Mendoza reached the rank of colonel and died in front of the Spanish firing squad on December 30, 1870, two days after falling prisoner in Najasa, Camag\u00fcey.\n\nIn 1871 the president [[Antonio Guzman Blanco]], supported the so-called \"Venezuelan Expedition of the Vanguard\", which landed in the eastern department of Cuba on June 17 commanded by the Cuban Brigadier Rafael de Quesada. In this attempt to liberate Cuba were 200 men, mostly Venezuelans, with 600 weapons, ammunition and 40 mules. In Camag\u00fcey, they fought the successful combat of Sabanas del Ciego, in which the Spanish forces were very decimated. But it was not an obstacle that the Cuban patriot [[Jose Marti]], implying in Venezuelan politics, was expelled by Guzman Blanco in 1881. Marti must hurriedly leave [[Caracas]], where he planned to live his exile, without being able to say farewell to his friends and return to New York.\n\nDescendants of Bolivar and relatives of marechal Antonio Jose de Sucre, they fought in the War of the 95.\n\n==20th century==\n\nIn 1902 under president [[Cipriano Castro]], Venezuela and Cuba established diplomatic relations not long after the latter became independent aftermath the  [[Spanish\u2013American War]].

In fact, after the fall of dictator [[Marcos Perez Jimenez]] on January 23, 1958 a street campaign called \"The March of Bolivar to the Sierra Maestra\",  $220,000 were collected, as well as a lot of arms and ammunition that were taken by Captain Hector Abdelnour Musa on board of a [[C-46]] airplane, purchased for that purpose, which were delivered to Cuban  guerilla. The weapons imported from [[United States]], came from the arsenals of the Venezuelan Army. All this was managed by [[Ren\u00e9 Est\u00e9vez]] with the knowledge and approval of then-President [[Wolfgang Larrazabal]], supported by his brother Carlos and other officers like Hugo Trejo. In turn, Venezuelan broadcasters had the initiative to retransmit the war parts of the [[Radio Rebelde]] through Radio Rumbos and Radio Continent, which allowed to know the advances of the Castro guerillas and the setbacks of the dictator Batista.\n\nWith the triumph of the [[Cuban Revolution]], on January 1, 1959, a new period was opened in Havana-Caracas bilateral relations. On January 3, 1959, the Minister of State of Cuba requested from the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs the recognition of the new Cuban Government, which emerged after the fall of Batista. On January 5, 1959, the Venezuelan Government recognizes the newly established Cuban government in Havana.\n\nOn January 23, 1959 Castro visited Venezuela. It was his first trip abroad after the triumphal entry in Havana on January 6, 1959. During five-day in Caracas Castro was  celebrated as a continental hero by Venezuelan people.

{"title_page": "Protectores Augusti Nostri", "text_new": "''Protector Augusti Nostri'' (''lit'' 'Protector of Our Augustus') was a title given to individual officers of the Roman Army as a mark of their devotion to and approval by the Emperor himself. The term first appears with this meaning in the joint-reign of [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and [[Gallienus]]. [[L. Petronius Taurus Volusianus]] was the first recorded ''Protector'' appointed by [[Gallienus]].\n\n==Imperial Guards of Gallienus==\nIt is indeed the case that the use of the title ''protector'' in the sense of a 'bodyguard of a Great Man' long preceded the appointment of Volusianus. In addition, the title was not only bestowed by Emperors.<ref>Mihailov, citing E. Birley, mentions two examples of men with this title, one appointed by a [[Praetorian Prefect]] and the other by a senatorial ''legatus''. {{cite book| last =Mihailov | first =Georgi| title =''Inscriptiones Graecae in Bulgaria Repertae'' : 3 1570,| publisher =Sophia| year =1966}}.</ref> However, it does seem to be the case that Gallienus was the originator of the particular body of men, the ''Protectores Augusti Nostri'', with which this page is concerned.\n\nIt seems that, when it was first bestowed, this title signified an honour conferred on rather than a function carried out by the recipient. It seems to have been granted to officers who had distinguished themselves serving directly under Gallienus in his wars against barbarian invaders of the Balkan and German provinces and Italy and would-be usurpers in those regions such as [[Ingenuus]] and were marked out for accelerated promotion under his patronage. No doubt its utility as an instrument for adding lustre to newly equestrianised military career structure soon became apparent.\n\nThe first recipients were Tribunes of the Praetorian Cohorts - such as Volusianus - and equestrian commanders of legions such as [[Publius Aelius Aelianus]]. So far as is known it was never bestowed on any officer of senatorial rank - senators were effectively excluded from service in the army soon after the first ''protectores'' appeared. Towards the end of Gallienus's reign centurions too were given this title. By this time it was used exclusively to distinguish officers who had served in units associated with Gallienus's Imperial Field Army, the ''comitatus''<ref>See M. Christol: 'La carri\u00e8re de Traianus Mucianus et l'origine des ''protectores'': Chiron 7, 1977, pp 393 ''ff''.</ref>\n\nCollectively, therefore, the first ''Protectores'' might more properly defined as a ''collegio'' (i.e. a guild) rather than a military unit serving a specific military purpose.  There is contemporary reference to a ''Princeps Protectorum'', but it is likely that this officer's functions related to ceremonial than to leadership in battle.<ref>One of the first known ''princeps protectorum'' was [[Traianus Mucianus]] - see Mihailov ''op.cit.''. As far as can be determined that officer had no substantive office when he held the title and Christol (''op.cit.'') infers that his was a purely nominal posting while he waited for promotion to the rank of ''[[primus pilus]]''.</ref> Holding commissioned rank in a unit attached to the ''comitatus'' seems to have been the ''sine qua non'' of admission to the body. These were men noticed by the Emperor likely to receive accelerated promotion in his service.\n\nThe purpose of the ''Protectores'' at this time seems to have been two-fold: (i) to encourage a personal loyalty to the ''Augusti'' (particularly Gallienus: there is no reason to suppose that Valerian had any real interest in this innovation) among the most energetic and charismatic officers of the Imperial Field Army and thus combat the spirit of military dissent that was tearing the Empire apart at this time; (ii) to promote ambition among the officer ''cadres'' of provincial garrisons - which would, of course, serve the same purpose.\n\n==After Gallienus==\nAfter the death of Gallienus the ''Protectores'' seem to have evolved into a military unit. It was as commander of this body that the future Emperor [[Diocletian]] made his successful bid for the purple in 284 AD, challenging the [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Lucius Flavius Aper|Aper]] whose power-base was the [[Praetorian Guard]]. However, membership of the corps still seems to have continued to be reserved for young soldiers marked out for rapid promotion. [[Constantine I]] was probably a member at the court of [[Galerius]] and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] got his first step on the ladder of promotion in this capacity. Thus by that time day it had acquired some of the characteristics of an Imperial staff college.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine |last=Southern |first=Pat |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=London }}\n\n[[Category:Military ranks of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Ancient Roman titles]]\n", "text_old": "''Protector Augusti Nostri'' (''lit'' 'Protector of Our Augustus') was a title given to individual officers of the Roman Army as a mark of their devotion to and approval by the Emperor himself.

Birley, mentions two examples of men with this title, one appointed by a [[Praetorian Prefect]] and the other by a senatorial ''legatus''. {{cite book| last =Mihailov | first =Georgi| title =''Inscriptiones Graecae in Bulgaria Repertae'' : 3 1570,| publisher =Sophia| year =1966}}.</ref> However, it does seem to be the case that Gallienus was the originator of the particular body of men, the ''Protectores Augusti Nostri'', with which this page is concerned.\n\nIt seems that, when it was first bestowed, this title signified an honour conferred on rather than a function carried out by the recipient. It seems to have been granted to officers who had distinguished themselves serving directly under Gallienus in his wars against barbarian invaders of the Balkan and German provinces and Italy and would-be usurpers in those regions such as [[Ingenuus]] and were marked out for accelerated promotion under his patronage. No doubt its utility as an instrument for adding lustre to newly equestrianised military career structure soon became apparent.\n\nThe first recipients were Tribunes of the Praetorian Cohorts - such as Volusianus - and equestrian commanders of legions such as [[Publius Aelius Aelianus]]. So far as is known it was never bestowed on any officer of senatorial rank - senators were effectively excluded from service in the army soon after the first ''protectores'' appeared. Towards the end of Gallienus's reign centurions too were given this title. By this time it was used exclusively to distinguish officers who had served in units associated with Gallienus's Imperial Field Army, the ''comitatus''<ref>See M. Christol: 'La carri\u00e8re de Traianus Mucianus et l'origine des ''protectores'': Chiron 7, 1977, pp 393 ''ff''.</ref>\n\nCollectively, therefor, the first ''Protectores'' might more properly defined as a ''collegio'' (i.e. a guild) rather than a military unit serving a specific military purpose.  There is contemporary reference to a ''Princeps Protectorum'', but it is likely that this officer's functions related to ceremonial than to leadership in battle.<ref>One of the first known ''princeps protectorum'' was [[Traianus Mucianus]] - see Mihailov ''op.cit.''. As far as can be determined that officer had no substantive office when he held the title and Christol (''op.cit.'') infers that his was a purely nominal posting while he waited for promotion to the rank of ''[[primus pilus]]''.</ref> Holding commissioned rank in a unit attached to the ''comitatus'' seems to have been the ''sine qua non'' of admission to the body. These were men noticed by the Emperor likely to receive accelerated promotion in his service.\n\nThe purpose of the ''Protectores'' at this time seems to have been two-fold: (i) to encourage a personal loyalty to the ''Augusti'' (particularly Gallienus: there is no reason to suppose that Valerian had any real interest in this innovation) among the most energetic and charismatic officers of the Imperial Field Army and thus combat the spirit of military dissent that was tearing the Empire apart at this time; (ii) to promote ambition among the officer ''cadres'' of provincial garrisons - which would, of course, serve the same purpose.\n\n==After Gallienus==\nAfter the death of Gallienus the ''Protectores'' seem to have evolved into a military unit. It was as commander of this body that the future Emperor [[Diocletian]] made his successful bid for the purple in 284 AD, challenging the [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Lucius Flavius Aper|Aper]] whose power-base was the [[Praetorian Guard]]. However, membership of the corps still seems to have continued to be reserved for young soldiers marked out for rapid promotion. [[Constantine I]] was probably a member at the court of [[Galerius]] and [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] got his first step on the ladder of promotion in this capacity. Thus by that time day it had acquired some of the characteristics of an Imperial staff college.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire from Severus to Constantine |last=Southern |first=Pat |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=London }}\n\n[[Category:Military ranks of ancient Rome]]\n[[Category:Ancient Roman titles]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eImperial Guards of Gallienus:Typo fixing, replaced: therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectores_Augusti_Nostri"}

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015). [https://www.onepetro.org/download/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS?id=conference-paper%2FSPE-176457-MS Is Epoxy-Based Polymer Suitable for Water Shut-Off Application?] SPE-176457-MS. SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide.

The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic.\n\nEpoxy resins have several flooring applcations. They are used for protection again mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing in places such as industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments. They can also have decorative applications, such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\n\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater.

These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers' metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n[[File:Nicholas-doherty-pONBhDyOFoM-unsplash.jpg|thumb|Offshore Wind Farm]]\n=== Wind turbine composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Photo-1565992441121-4367c2967103.jpg|thumb|Exemplary epoxy application in sports industry]]\n===Leisure and marine===\nHigh strength and weight reduction are the main performance criteria for manufacturers of sport components. Skis, snowboards, surf and kite boards are fiber reinforced epoxy applications. Epoxy resin systems in combination with multi-axial, unidirectional, woven fabrics and variety of core materials play also a key role to manufacture high performance boats, yachts and commercial and military vessels. \n[https://www.thoughtco.com/composite-materials-in-boats-820410/ composite boats]\n\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n[[File:Glider photo by Phliar on Flikr.jpg|thumb|Power Glider]]\n=== Aerospace ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\nGlider and small aircraft designers considered epoxy based composites in an early date.

The use of composite leaf springs in particular in light trucks increases the cargo load. [https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-leaf-springs-saving-weight-in-production-suspension-systems/ Composite LEaf Springs]  50 % mass reduction is achievable when replacing steel for the manufacture of coil springs by fiber reinforced Epoxy.  New generation, in particular of electrically driven cars, require chassis and other significant load bearing structures made from CFRP. But, mass-production requires adequate automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, the poly-addition reaction of epoxy with curatives is more time consuming than metal forming or unsaturated polyester cure. But fast processing and higher thermo-mechanical resistance is required. In numbers, coming from low double digit minutes for cure to single digits and increasing the thermo-mechanical resistance from 130\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and higher.

Such epoxy resin formulations are relevant to the electrical and electronics industry in voltage ranges from 400 kV down to  >1V.The purpose of the products is to insulate, protect or shield the environment from electric current or the devices from the environment. Formulated bisphenol-based epoxy resins, cured with dicarboxylic anhydrides or amines are used for indoor applications. Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, preferably 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ester, in combination with cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic anhydrides and silanised silica flour are the base for outdoor-resistant electrical insulation, e.g. production of insulators, bushings, instrument transformers.\nMost common processing technologies are Vacuum Pressure Impregnation for power generators, Vacuum Casting and Automatic Pressure Gelation  for medium voltage equipment and potting under vacuum for e.g. ignition coils and small transformers or potting under ambient pressure for e.g. capacitors.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\nIn the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards. Since these applications require self-extinguishing properties, flame retardant epoxy resins or epoxy formulations with flame retardant additives are utilized.\n\n=== Petroleum and petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine.

The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region. China is the major producer and consumer globally, contributing to almost 50% of the global resin global capacity in 2018. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, the largest markets for epoxy resins are Germany, Italy, France and the UK.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\n\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic/mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nAnother group of hardeners which have come into the regulatory focus over recent years are dicarboxylic anhydrides, namely Hexahydropthalic-Anhydride (HHPA) and Methyl-Hexahydrophthalic-Anhydride (m-HHPA). Both substances have been identified under REACH as substances of equivalent concern due to the potential risk of respiratory sensitization. This SVHC identification implies that both substances are listed on the REACH candidate list for further regulatory measures.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.[21] Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). There is some incidence that use of epoxy resin systems may cause sensitizer-induced occupational asthma in some exposed workers. However, this may apply to specific application technologies, e.g. spray application, insufficient use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the use of volatile components, e.g. amine-based curing agents. Most epoxy resins have due to their high(er) molecular weight a low vapor pressure, thus do not vaporize easily.  \n[[Bisphenol-A]], which is a major building block to manufacture Bis-A- epoxy resins, has been identified as an endocrine disruptor for human health and the environment under REACH. The concept of endocrine disruption is not without controversy within the scientific community. Substances which are typically quoted in the context of endocrine disruption are xeno- and phytoestrogens, i.e. substances which mimic the effects of the human female sex hormone estrogen. The strength of a physiological response to natural estrogen or xenoestrogen is dependent on the affinity to bind to estrogen receptors on the cell surface of target organs or tissues. Human estrogen has a high binding affinity to estrogen receptors and thus elicits a physiological response at very low concentrations at nanomolar or sub-nanomolar level.\nXeno- or phytoestrogens however, have a much lower binding affinity to the estrogen receptors and as such require a much higher concentration to elicit a similar physiological response as natural estrogen. The uptake of such concentrations via food ingestion does not seem plausible for most xenoestrogens such as BPA, as it would require ingesting vast quantities of canned food stuffs or beverages to induce an appreciable effect. Consequently, the risk of adverse effects for BPA exposure via a normal diet is considered to be relatively insignificant.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the thermoset plastic materials|the chemical group|epoxide}}\n{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:FiveMinEpoxy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A syringe of \"5-minute\" epoxy glue, containing separate compartments for the epoxy resin and the hardener.]]\n[[File:Epoxide_generic.png|thumb|Structure of the epoxide group, a reactive functional group present in all epoxy resins.]]\n'''Epoxy''' refers to any of the basic components or [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] end products of '''epoxy resins''', as well as a colloquial name for the [[epoxide]] functional group.<ref name=\"May2018\">{{cite book |author=Clayton May |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology (Second Edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XlaDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA64&lpg=RA2-PA64&focus=viewport&vq=%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed%22&dq=may+Epoxy+Resins:+Chemistry+and+Technology+Second+Edition,+%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed+for+electrical+and+electronic+applications%22#v=onepage&q=%22Epoxies%20are%20the%20resins%20most%20commonly%20employed%22&f=false |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-351-44995-3 |page=65 |quote=Epoxies are the resins most commonly employed for electrical and electronic applications.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J. Marks |title=Epoxy Resins|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |doi=10.1002/14356007.a09_547.pub2 |year=2005}}</ref>\n\nReaction of phenols with formaldehyde and subsequent glycidylation with epichlorohydrin produces epoxidised novolacs, such as epoxy phenol novolacs (EPN) and epoxy cresol novolacs (ECN). These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015). [https://www.onepetro.org/download/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS?id=conference-paper%2FSPE-176457-MS Is Epoxy-Based Polymer Suitable for Water Shut-Off Application?] SPE-176457-MS. SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic.\n\nEpoxy resins have several flooring applcations. They are used for protection again mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing in places such as industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments. They can also have decorative applications, such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\n\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers' metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n[[File:Nicholas-doherty-pONBhDyOFoM-unsplash.jpg|thumb|Offshore Wind Farm]]\n=== Wind turbine composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Photo-1565992441121-4367c2967103.jpg|thumb|Exemplary epoxy application in sports industry]]\n===Leisure and marine===\nHigh strength and weight reduction are the main performance criteria for manufacturers of sport components. Skis, snowboards, surf and kite boards are fiber reinforced epoxy applications. Epoxy resin systems in combination with multi-axial, unidirectional, woven fabrics and variety of core materials play also a key role to manufacture high performance boats, yachts and commercial and military vessels. \n[https://www.thoughtco.com/composite-materials-in-boats-820410/ composite boats]\n\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\nGlider and small aircraft designers considered epoxy based composites in an early date.

As a consequence, modern aircraft show better fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions.[https://epoxy-europe.eu/application/aerospace/ environmental-impact] Jetliners like Boeing 787 and Airbus A 350 consist of more than 50% composites where epoxy materials play the dominant role.

New generation, in particular of electrically driven cars, require chassis and other significant load bearing structures made from CFRP. But, mass-production requires adequate automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, the poly-addition reaction of epoxy with curatives is more time consuming than metal forming or unsaturated polyester cure. But fast processing and higher thermo-mechanical resistance is required. In numbers, coming from low double digit minutes for cure to single digits and increasing the thermo-mechanical resistance from 130\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and higher.

Such epoxy resin formulations are relevant to the electrical and electronics industry in voltage ranges from 400 kV down to  >1V.The purpose of the products is to insulate, protect or shield the environment from electric current or the devices from the environment. Formulated bisphenol-based epoxy resins, cured with dicarboxylic anhydrides or amines are used for indoor applications. Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, preferably 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ester, in combination with cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic anhydrides and silanised silica flour are the base for outdoor-resistant electrical insulation, e.g. production of insulators, bushings, instrument transformers.\nMost common processing technologies are Vacuum Pressure Impregnation for power generators, Vacuum Casting and Automatic Pressure Gelation  for medium voltage equipment and potting under vacuum for e.g. ignition coils and small transformers or potting under ambient pressure for e.g. capacitors.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\nIn the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards. Since these applications require self-extinguishing properties, flame retardant epoxy resins or epoxy formulations with flame retardant additives are utilized.\n\n=== Petroleum and petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine.

The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region. China is the major producer and consumer globally, contributing to almost 50% of the global resin global capacity in 2018. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, the largest markets for epoxy resins are Germany, Italy, France and the UK.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\n\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic/mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nAnother group of hardeners which have come into the regulatory focus over recent years are dicarboxylic anhydrides, namely Hexahydropthalic-Anhydride (HHPA) and Methyl-Hexahydrophthalic-Anhydride (m-HHPA). Both substances have been identified under REACH as substances of equivalent concern due to the potential risk of respiratory sensitization. This SVHC identification implies that both substances are listed on the REACH candidate list for further regulatory measures.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.[21] Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). There is some incidence that use of epoxy resin systems may cause sensitizer-induced occupational asthma in some exposed workers. However, this may apply to specific application technologies, e.g. spray application, insufficient use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the use of volatile components, e.g. amine-based curing agents. Most epoxy resins have due to their high(er) molecular weight a low vapor pressure, thus do not vaporize easily.  \n[[Bisphenol-A]], which is a major building block to manufacture Bis-A- epoxy resins, has been identified as an endocrine disruptor for human health and the environment under REACH. The concept of endocrine disruption is not without controversy within the scientific community. Substances which are typically quoted in the context of endocrine disruption are xeno- and phytoestrogens, i.e. substances which mimic the effects of the human female sex hormone estrogen. The strength of a physiological response to natural estrogen or xenoestrogen is dependent on the affinity to bind to estrogen receptors on the cell surface of target organs or tissues. Human estrogen has a high binding affinity to estrogen receptors and thus elicits a physiological response at very low concentrations at nanomolar or sub-nanomolar level.\nXeno- or phytoestrogens however, have a much lower binding affinity to the estrogen receptors and as such require a much higher concentration to elicit a similar physiological response as natural estrogen. The uptake of such concentrations via food ingestion does not seem plausible for most xenoestrogens such as BPA, as it would require ingesting vast quantities of canned food stuffs or beverages to induce an appreciable effect. Consequently, the risk of adverse effects for BPA exposure via a normal diet is considered to be relatively insignificant.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "name_user": "HGChemEng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAerospace:photo was added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"}

Following the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455, it was the culmination of lengthy negotiations initiated by [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] to resolve the lords' rivalries. English politics had become increasingly factional during his reign, and was exacerbated in 1453 when he became [[Catatonia|catatonic]]. This effectively left the government leaderless, and eventually the King's cousin, and at the time [[Heir presumptive|heir to the throne]], [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], was appointed Protector during the King's illness. Alongside York were his allies from the politically and militarily powerful [[House of Neville|Neville]] family, led by [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard, Earl of Salisbury]], and his eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]]. When the King returned to health a year later, the protectorship ended but partisanship within the government did not. \n\nSupporters of King Henry and his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], have been loosely called \"Lancastrians\", the King being head of the [[House of Lancaster]], while the duke and his party are considered \"Yorkists\", after his title of [[Duke of York]].{{Refn|The labels \"York and Lancaster\", are, however, considered by historians to oversimplify the complex networks of loyalties and connections by which the [[English peerage|English nobility]] was interlinked. Simply, at the beginning of the Wars of the Roses, the House of Lancaster\u2014whose supporters have been labelled \"Lancastrian\"\u2014was the ruling, governing dynasty founded by [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]. His primary title had been [[Duke of Lancaster]], and in 1399 he [[usurped]] the throne and deposed his cousin, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. The ancestors of the Duke of York accepted the new political paradigm throughout the reign of Henry IV and his son [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], as did York himself throughout most of Henry VI's reign. He was both inept as a ruler and manipulable by powerful noble advisors, and they gradually alienated the Duke from central government. Those who gathered around him in opposition to these favourites\u2014and later the King and Queen themselves\u2014were known as \"Yorkists\".{{sfn|Hicks|2010|pp=43\u201345, 12\u201313}}|name=|group=note}} By the 1450s, York felt increasingly excluded from government, and, in May 1455\u2014possibly fearing an ambush by his enemies\u2014led an army against the King at the [[First Battle of St Albans]]. There, in what has been called more of a series of assassinations than a battle, the personal enemies of York and the Nevilles\u2014the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford|Lord Clifford]]\u2014perished.\n\nIn 1458 the King attempted to unite his feuding nobles with a public display of friendship under the auspices of the Church at [[St Paul's Cathedral#Old St Paul's|St Paul's Cathedral]]. Following much discussion and negotiation, and amid the presence of large, armed, noble retinues which almost led to another outbreak of war, a compromise was announced. To celebrate, a procession was held by all the major participants, who walked hand-in-hand from [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Palace]] to [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Queen Margaret was partnered with York, and other adversaries were paired off accordingly, and the sons of the dead [[Lancastrianism|Lancastrian]] lords took their fathers' places. Certain reparations were ordained, all by the [[House of York|Yorkist]] lords, who for their part accepted full responsibility for the Battle of St Albans. They were ordered to make payments to the dead lords' widows and sons, and [[Mass in the Catholic Church|masses]] were paid for the souls of all who had died. Contemporaries varied in their views of the accord. Some wrote verses expressing hope that it would lead to a new-found peace and prosperity; others were more pessimistic as to its value.\n\nIn the long run, the King's Loveday and its agreements had no long-lasting benefit. Within a few months, petty violence between the lords had broken out again and, within the year, York and Lancaster faced each other at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]]. Historians debate who\u2014if anyone\u2014actually gained from the 1458 Loveday. On the one hand, the crown publicised its role as the ultimate court of appeal but, conversely, although the Yorkists were bound to pay large sums in compensation, this was done with money already owed by the government. Fundamentally, factional discord was highlighted on the public stage, and the war it was intended to prevent was only deferred.\n\n==Political background==\nBy the middle of the 15th century, English politics had become increasingly factional. [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] and his [[House of Neville|Neville]] allies\u2014[[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard, Earl of Salisbury]] and his son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], with their cousin [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk]]\u2014were in opposition to the government of [[King Henry VI]]. The King was weak-willed and easily led, and his government was effectively controlled by his [[favourite]], [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} Further weakening the government, King Henry had become mentally incapacitated in August 1453, becoming comatose, unable to feed himself or recognise any of his companions.{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|p=715}}{{refn|Historians have speculated upon Henry's illness. Its precise nature is unknown,{{sfn|Rushton|2010|pp=147\u2013148}} but Griffiths describes it as \"a severe mental collapse, accompanied by a crippling physical disablement\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|p=715}} Its cause is equally hard to determine. Wolffe speculates that it could have been a response to news of the [[Battle of Castillon]] a few days earlier which presaged the final fall of Lancastrian France as well as seeing the death of the English commander, \"[[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|old Talbot]]\". His illness may also have had a genetic element, as Henry's grandfather, [[Charles VI of France]], had suffered extreme bouts of insanity in his later years.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=270, 276}}|group=note}} \n\nAt the time, a [[Percy\u2013Neville feud|major feud]] was taking place in the [[North of England]] between the powerful [[House of Percy|Percy]] and Neville families. The former was led by [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland]]'s son, [[Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont|Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont]], while the Neville family was headed by Salisbury.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=134}} In March 1454, the King still being ill, parliament authorised a [[Lord Protector|protectorate]] to rule in the King's stead. The [[House of Lords]] chose the Duke of York\u2014as the King's closest adult relative\u2014as Protector. York and the Nevilles cemented an alliance during the protectorate when York appointed Salisbury his [[Lord Chancellor]].{{sfn|Pollard|1990|pp=257\u2013258}}{{refn|Modern historians view Salisbury's appointment as a clear break with tradition. For example, Carpenter describes his appointment as \"highly unusual\";{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=129}} while Hicks questions whether Salisbury was the genuinely most suitable candidate available;{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=109}} and Johnson comments that \"his selection in such sensitive political circumstances was little short of sensational\".{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=134}} Traditionally, the post had been exclusively the preserve of an [[ecclesiast]].{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=134}} The last lay appointment to the office had been that of [[Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter|Sir Thomas Beaufort]] between 1410 and 1411.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=141}}{{sfn|Fryde|Powicke|1961|p=85}}|group=note}} York's protectorate had given the Nevilles a useful advantage over their rivals, and in November 1454, Thomas Percy and his brothers, [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Henry]] and [[Ralph Percy|Ralph]], were captured in battle. They received massive fines.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=622}}{{Refn|The defeated Percies were [[arraigned]] before a commission of [[oyer and terminer]] at York. This commission bound them over for 8,000 marks payable to the Earl of Salisbury, and including fines towards his countess and sons, to a total of 16,800 marks. It was, says Professor Storey, \"a staggering sum\"{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=149}} which Egremont \"could never hope to pay, nor, indeed, did he try\".{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=149}} This guaranteed his imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]]. The Percies were too politically favoured for the Nevilles to expect anything other than the King to pardon the Percies for their political offences, whereas they could not hope to avoid the consequences of failing to discharge legally-binding debts.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=149}}{{sfn|Griffiths|2004}} The Griffiths has described this as Salisbury's \"reckoning\" of all the damage caused to his estates during the course of the feud with the Percies.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=622}} To put these sums in context, Storey has estimated Egremont's annual income to have been less than \u00a3100 per annum.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=148\u2013149}}|group=note}} The following January, the King regained his health, and York was no longer required as Protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=622}} York and the Nevilles retreated to their northern estates, and Mowbray did likewise to [[East Anglia]], in an attempt to distance themselves from factional politics.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} From this point, argues the [[medievalist]] [[A. J. Pollard]], power \"shifted back into the hands of [York\u2019s] enemies, now given a lead by the Queen\" rather than the King.{{Sfn|Pollard|2004|p=}}\n\n=== Yorkist demands ===\n[[File:Richard of York Talbot Shrewsbury Book.jpeg|alt=Richard, Duke of York, depicted in a contemporary manuscript|thumb|Richard, Duke of York, leader of the Yorkist faction and bitter enemy of the King's favourites, the Dukes of Suffolk and Somerset, whom he believed had excluded him from his rightful position in government.]]\nAn uneasy peace existed between the court and the Yorkists until April 1455, when the King summoned a [[Great council of peers|great council]] to meet at [[Leicester]] the following month. The Duke of York feared that the purpose of this council was to destroy him; several chroniclers of the day suggest that Somerset was influencing the King against the Duke with \"subtile meanes\".{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} York and the Nevilles raised an army from their northern estates.{{refn|The contemporary Abbot of St Albans, [[John Whethamstede]], emphasised the degree to which northerners comprised the Yorkist army in his chronicle.{{sfn|Jewell|1994|p=45}}|group=note}} They wrote to Henry regarding their fears, and emphasised their loyalty to him. This was in spite of what they called the \"doubtes and ambiguitees [and] jealousie\" spread by their enemies.{{Sfn|Hicks|2000|p=170}} The Yorkist lords also expressed their fears that their lives were in danger from those who hid \"undre the wynge of your Mageste Roiall\".{{Sfn|Hicks|2000|p=171}} This, they said, was the reason they felt the need to travel accompanied by large retinues.;{{Sfn|Hicks|2000|p=170}} The Yorkists' solution was that the King dismiss those who kept the King's true liegemen (i.e., them) from him and that the malicious advisers be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{Sfn|Hicks|2000|pp=170\u2013171}}  \n\nIt is unknown whether the King received the Yorkist lords' letters, although the historian [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] believes that \"there is no convincing evidence\" that he did not.{{Sfn|Hicks|2000|p=182}} Henry and a small force left London for Leicester on 20 May; the Yorkists approached from the north with a speed calculated to surprise.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=741}} In a [[pre-emptive strike]], York and his allies intercepted the royal army at [[First Battle of St Albans|St Albans]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=798}} Fighting in the streets lasted only a short time, and though there were very few fatalities among the common soldiery, the chief Lancastrian captains\u2014Northumberland, Somerset and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Thomas, Lord Clifford]]\u2014were all killed. They were not only three of the King's most loyal and powerful supporters, but Northumberland and Somerset were bitter enemies of the Nevilles and York.{{Sfn|Hicks|2010|p=110}} Because of this, the clash has been described more akin to a series of targeted assassinations than a fully-fledged battle.{{Sfn|Armstrong|1960|p=35}}{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=289}} On the 22nd, Henry was escorted, under guard, back to London: \"all honour was shown to him\" by York, Salisbury and Warwick, notes Griffiths, and a ceremony\u2014intending to establish the new-found friendship between the King and the Yorkists\u2014was held in St Paul's the following day.{{Sfn|Goodman|1996|p=24}}{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=746}}\n\nThe period between St Albans and the Loveday, says Pollard, is one of the most poorly recorded of the entire century,{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} although what is known has enabled historians to piece together the basic chronology. By 1458, Henry's government urgently needed to deal with the unfinished problem that the Battle of St Albans had created, summarised by the scholar [[Ralph Griffiths]] as the \"craving of the younger magnates for revenge on those who had killed their fathers\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=805}} But Henry also wanted to bring the Yorkists back into the fold.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=151}} Taking the initiative,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=187}} the Loveday was intended to be his personal contribution to a lasting peace.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=819}}{{refn|Although Watts has suggested otherwise, suggesting that \"it was surely the work of [the] council, rather than the whimsy of the King, that the inspiration for the famous Loveday of March 1458 is to be found\".{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=343}}|group=note}} Another motive for achieving a united magnatial front was the French: intelligence had been received suggesting they planned to attack [[Calais]].{{Refn|Calais, although on the northern coast of France, had been an English possession since 1346. France had ceded Calais to England following the latter's victory at the [[Battle of Crecy]].{{sfn|Grummitt|2008|p=1}}|group=note}} In the event, this never occurred,{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=184}} but the previous year the French had been able to land at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] in Kent, which they [[Looting|sacked]], taking many prisoners.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=144}} This alone was reason enough to bring the warring parties together.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=151}}\n\n== Lovedays as arbitration ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nIn the context of a 'loveday', 'love' meant [[pact|concord]] or a settlement;{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=357}} likewise, in law, a 'day' indicated a case-opening rather than a twenty-four hour period.{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=354 n.19}} There were few, if any restrictions on the kind of business that a loveday could address, as long as the court had authorised it,{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=355}} and this included cases that were pending at a higher court.{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=356}} Arbitration, argues the [[Legal history|legal historian]] [[Anthony Musson]], was not a resource restricted to one particular group of people, rather  a universal phenomenon, occurring at every level and among all orders of society\".{{Sfn|Musson|2001|p=91}} \n\n===Mechanics===\nThe ritualistic reconciliations that contemporaries called lovedays{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} have been described by the scholar [[B.

York's biographer, [[Paul Johnson (historian)|Paul Johnson]], suggests that, in doing so, Henry damaged any subsequent chance for the attendees to reach a \"broad-based accommodation\", as now they had no-one to adjudicate their arguments.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=182}} Also, he suggests that, with the Yorkists effectively confined to the City, the Lancastrian lords could travel unhindered from their lodgings. And travel they did. While the King dwelt in Berkhampstead, Somerset, Exeter, Clifford and Egremont visited him on 23 February. It is not known whether their visit was regarding the imminent arbitration, but Johnson suggests that it was unwise of Henry to see them, in case it was perceived as breaching his perceived neutrality.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=182}} Meanwhile, the council, says Wolffe, instead of commencing negotiations, \"does not appear to have done anything until the middle of March\", when the King returned to Westminster.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=311}} \n\nFrom that point on discussions,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}}\u2014led by Henry and certain impartial councillors{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=311}}\u2014began in earnest. These negotiations, says Griffiths, \"were long and doubtless acrimonious\". The King prayed and prayed again for a settlement. Eventually{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}}\u2014perhaps inevitably{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=21}}\u2014one was reached, although the presence of so many armed men probably facilitated the process.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} Deliberations were carried out through intermediaries. Henry's councillors met the Yorkists in the City, at the [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], in the mornings; in the afternoons, they met the Lancastrian lords at the [[Whitefriars, London|Whitefriars]] on Fleet Street.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=311}} During the council's sittings, other policy issues were addressed. The question of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|governorship of Ireland]] probably arose,{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=182}} and the Earl of Warwick was appointed [[Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom|admiral of the seas]]. This office had previously been held by the Duke of Exeter, further damaging relations between the two men.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=637}} These were, however, peripheral issues: the Battle of St Albans was the topic of overriding importance.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=182}}\n\nOn 24 March the King announced his decision.

Pugh]]. Throughout the 15th century, it was becoming increasingly common to levy \"fines of fantastic proportions\" on those who failed to hold prisoners, ranging from \u00a3400 to \u00a34,000 depending on the individual's rank. Pugh notes that Egremont's gaoler had been threatened with a fine of \u00a32,000. {{sfn|Pugh|2008|p=240}}|group=note}}\n\nWolffe has argued that Henry's decision was no more than \"a formal accord on the limited issue of atonement and compensation\".{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=312}} Changing the attitudes of individuals towards their enemies was considered more important than the question of compensation, important though that was.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=182}} Furthermore, York and Warwick's payments to the families of their enemies were not in cash; rather, they were to renounce debts owed them by the crown which amounted to similar sums.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=184}} To fulfil their obligations, York and the Nevilles merely had to return government-issued [[Tally stick|tallies]] which entitled them to receive the required sum.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} The Yorkists, for their part, were declared to be the King's \"true lieges\", although any reassurance they took from this, comments the medievalist [[John Watts (historian)|John Watts]], may have been tempered by the knowledge that so also had been the three dead lords of St Albans.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=344}}\n\nThe Yorkists agreed to endow [[St Albans Abbey]] with a new [[chantry]]{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=185}} and [[\u00a3]]45 a year for two years for the monks to say masses for the slain.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} The Lancastrian lords, as the injured parties, had to make no reciprocal concessions to York and his allies. Egremont was required to make an independent [[Binding over|bond]] of 4,000 marks towards the Nevilles to keep the peace with them in [[Yorkshire]] for ten years.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} Thus, says the scholar [[Helen Maurer]], the crown implicitly recognised that bad blood had existed between the Nevilles and Egremont even before St Albans.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} One contemporary observed in a [[Paston Letters|Paston letter]] that the final settlement was a \"throw [sic: ''thorough''] peace final[ised] by means of all the Lords\".{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=345}}\n\n== The Loveday ==\n[[File:Richard_Neville,_5th_Earl_of_Salisbury_seule.jpg|alt=Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, depicted on a contemporary manuscript|thumb|Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury; York's closest political ally and head of the powerful northern Neville family.]]\nThe pact was announced on 25 March, or Lady Day (the Feast of the [[Annunciation of the Virgin]]). Henry\u2014\"thanking God for their having reaching accord\"\u2014joined his wife and nobles on a celebratory procession{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} from Westminster to London.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} Leading the parade were Somerset and Salisbury\u201436 years older than the duke\u2014followed by Exeter with Warwick, then \"the King alone, wearing his crown and royal robes\"{{sfn|Sadler|2010|p=70}} between them all. Finally came York and Queen Margaret. All parties held hands: a later chronicle described how \"one of the one faction, and another of the other sect, and behind the King, the Duke of Yorke led the Queene with great familiaritie to all mens sighte\".{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=361}} Although no contemporary records now survive to provide the physical details of the Loveday procession itself, scholars are aware of the general nature of medieval urban processions. The scholar Kathleen Ashley has highlighted how they presented what she has called a \"offered a \"fusion of sensory experiences, or [[synaesthesia]]\" for both the participants and observers, who would often amount to as many people as could physically attend, on account of the holiday atmosphere that accompanied them.{{sfn|Ashley|2001|p=13}}\n\nHistorians have noted multiple interpretations of the symbolism favoured by Henry. It was \"a symbolic series of gestures\", says [[John Sadler (historian)|John Sadler]],{{sfn|Sadler|2010|p=70}} perhaps a show of \"friendly and modest intimacies\"{{sfn|Ingham|1996|p=28}} suggests [[Patricia Ingham]]. Or it may have been mere rhetoric, bordering on a charade, suggests Pollard.{{sfn|Ingham|1996|p=28}} At the time, physical intimacy was an essential element of concord{{sfn|Santiuste|2011}} and the intention was clearly to demonstrate both their agreement and their willingness to agree.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} The Queen holding York's hand (rather than him holding Somerset's), says Watts, was an acknowledgement of her close involvement in the affairs of central government and her higher political profile in the post-St Albans [[body politic]].{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=344}} The Loveday was a combination, says Griffiths, of \"elaborate ceremonial, royal prayer and example, monetary payments and the holding of hands...[between] bitter enemies\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=806\u2013807}} The assembled lords were taking no more chances now than they had when they first arrived in London: Salisbury, for example, attended the concomitant religious ceremony at St Paul's with his retinue of 400 men, which included 80 knights and esquires, waiting in the churchyard.{{sfn|Hicks|2013|p=145}} It may have been called a Loveday, comments Sadler, yet \"the title is ironic, as there was little of love in the air\".{{sfn|Sadler|2010|p=70}} The closing event was the presentation of a new translation of the contemporary verse paraphrase, ''[[Knyghthode and Bataile]]'' to the King. This was a recent adaption of ''[[De re militari]]'', and celebrates the martial exploits of the noble class in a classic [[Chivalric romance|chivalric form]].{{sfn|Ingham|1996|p=26}} \n\nThe immediate aftermath of the Loveday, however, was positive, not least for the Nevilles, as the King granted Egremont permission to go on a pilgrimage in June 1458. From the government's perspective, this was an opportunity to physically remove one of the parties to a dispute. Pollard Casts some doubt on whether Egremont actually wanted to go on pilgrimage, arguing that \"no doubt he had been persuaded\" to do so, as previous attempts to quieten him in the north\u2014through French service in 1453 and imprisonment in 1456\u2014had failed.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} The King and his council seem to have also concluded by now that the Percies and the Nevilles' feud in the north was the primary cause of St Albans, and their treatment of Egremont reflected that. If this was the case, notes Watts, such a policy made the mistake of ignoring the enmity between other parties, for instance, York and Somerset.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=344}}\n\nThe King went on his own pilgrimage to St Albans at Easter the same year. This, says Griffiths, \"demonstrated that the site of the battle in which he had been wounded and his ministers slain no longer stirred fearful memories in his mind\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=807}} The appearance of amity was maintained publicly with \"with a royal round of jousts, feasting, and other entertainments until May\" that year.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} These festivities took place both at the [[Tower of London]] and at the Queen's [[Greenwich Palace|Palace at Greenwich]], further emphasising her involvement in the proceedings.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=807}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Earl of Salisbury subsequently had an [[exemplification]] copy of the Loveday agreement made. This, to Hicks, suggests that he saw the award as to his benefit, notwithstanding the recompenses he was ordered to make.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=136}} All Salisbury had to do was\u2014in Storey's words\u2014\"give up bad debts\".{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=184\u2013185}} Another probable consequence of the Loveday deliberations may have been that in May, Salisbury's son [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|Sir John Neville]] was betrothed to a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the Queen. This was Isabella Ingaldsthorpe,{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=346 n.357}}{{refn|Isabel Ingoldsthorpe is occasionally also referred to as Elizabeth in [[Exchequer]] records.{{sfn|Selden Society|1933|pp=138\u201340}}|group=note}} the heiress of her maternal uncle, [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|John Tiptoft]] and his [[Earl of Worcester|earldom of Worcester]],{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=25}} and the [[betrothal]] would not have been possible without Margaret's permission.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=147}} The crown itself benefited from the Loveday as its role as arbiter-in-chief\u2014\"the cement of the political fabric\",{{sfn|Gross|1996|p=44}} wrote Anthony Gross\u2014was reaffirmed in a blaze of publicity.{{sfn|Gross|1996|p=44}} Johnson argues that the traditional and probably definitive way of uniting the nobility was war, and this was too firmly disapproved of by the King ever to be an option.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=180}}\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThere is some disagreement among historians as to who won or lost at the Loveday. Hicks considers it to have been a \"reasonable compromise\",{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} while Griffiths saw it as being punitive to the Yorkists.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=808}} Watts suggests that it indicates that, notwithstanding St Albans, \"York and the Nevilles were regarded as acceptable by the ruling lords\".{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=346 n.357}} Johnson argues that York, at the least, did \"very well\" out of it.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} To the scholar [[David Grummitt]], this Loveday illustrated the \"essentially private and personal nature of the dispute\" between the Yorkists and their enemies.{{sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=52}} More broadly, though, the personal basis for their enmity was in the long term disadvantageous to the Yorkists. By focussing on, and emphasising, the personal quarrels between York and Somerset\u2014or Salisbury and Northumberland for example\u2014the award ignored and sidelined the original complaints of the Yorkists that they had argued led to the battle.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=343}}{{refn|As recent scholarship expresses it, the Loveday \"assisted in the propagation of this negative view of Yorkist activity. By presenting St Albans as a simple quarrel amongst magnates, rather than a clash between the King's good and bad counsellors (as the Yorkist version of events suggested), the terms of the royal award effectively deprived the Yorkists of their justification for having risen in arms\".{{sfn|Vale|1995|p=26 n. 97}} The agreement sought, says the medievalist [[G. L. Harriss]], to \"bury the past rather than rewrite it\", and made no provision for a future settlement either.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=637}}|group=note}}  Furthermore, he says, if any part of the nobility were united by the Loveday, it was the Yorkist lords.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=346}} The researcher Christine Carpenter has suggested that the King wanted to keep the occasion one of \"general reconciliation and restoration of magnate unity\".{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}} She argues that not highlighting the degree to which the nobility was divided was a deliberate policy, but the involvement of the Queen meant there had to be \"a formal recognition...that there were two opposing camps\".{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}}\n\nThe Loveday saw the Yorkists\u2014for the first time\u2014acknowledge their wrongdoing and accept culpability for St Albans. This was something they had denied immediately after the battle and in the years following, but was insufficient in the long term, says Pollard, because it did not contain the one thing that the new Lancastrian lords most wanted\u2014revenge for their fathers. It was not, therefore, \"a satisfying long-term solution\" that guaranteed future peace as intended.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=36}} \n[[File:Funeral Procession - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|alt=A 15th-century illustration of the medieval St Paul's Cathedral|thumb|A contemporary illustration of a procession entering the medieval St Paul's Cathedral\u2014in the background\u2014where the nobility gathered on 25 March 1458.{{sfn|British Library|1440|p=194r}}{{sfn|Benham|1902|p=10}}]]\n\n===Contemporary reaction=== \nThe historian [[Cora Scofield]] suggests that the Loveday procession to St Paul's was \"doubtless an edifying spectacle, but it had little real meaning and probably deceived no-one\".{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=27}} Not long after the Loveday, an anonymous poem was published entitled ''Take Good Heed''; this offers the Yorkist lords advice and anxious support for the years ahead, which, the author recognises, will be difficult ones for all.{{sfn|Scattergood|1971|p=181}} Other writers were more optimistic. The poem ''Reconciliation of Henry VI and the Yorkists'' repeats the refrain, \"rejoise, Angleonde to concorde and unit\u00e9\",{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=361}} suggesting that the author expects the kingdom to be strong and unified going forward.{{sfn|Baker|2013|p=258}} The author of the ''Reconciliation'' emphasises how \"ther was bytwyn hem lovely contynaunce / Whiche was gret ioy to all that ther were\".{{sfn|Baker|2013|p=258}} The author expands on his theme:{{sfn|Hope Robbins|1959|pp=21\u201324}} \n\n<poem>In Yorke, In Somerset, as I understonde,\nIn Warrewik also is loue & charite,\nIn Sarisbury eke, & in Northumbreland,\nThat euery man may reioise in concord & unite.{{sfn|Hope Robbins|1959|pp=21\u201324}}</poem>\n\nNot all commentators were impressed: a [[Coventry]] [[preacher]], one William Ive, said caustically that the King \"made Lovedays as Judas made with a kiss with Christ\".{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=21}} Enemies may have marched together that day, argues Scofield, but they trusted each other no more after the procession than they had before.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=26}} This was the view of [[Thomas Malory]] in his mid-century ''[[Morte darthur]]'', which expresses a cynicism regarding Lovedays as a means of settling feuds. Malory's pessimism was probably caused by his view of the 1458 ceremony.{{sfn|Baker|2013|p=258}} Malory portrays [[Lancelot]] as attempting to atone for the murders of his enemies through the building of chapels\u2014\"penitence as a remedy for war\", suggests literary scholar Robert L. Kelly. But Lancelot's, like Henry's, attempts are in vain: \"Lo what meschef lyth in variaunce / Amonge lordis, whan \u00feei nat accorde\", comments Malory on both.{{sfn|Kelly|1994|pp=111\u2013112, 124}}\n\n==Failure to prevent crisis==\nThe peace ordained at the Loveday, says Pollard, \"was shallow and shortlived\".{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} Having failed to solve the underlying crisis in the long term, \"the atmosphere of distrust and intrigue still continued\".{{sfn|Allen|1981|p=110}} Indeed, the Loveday itself may have contributed to a heightening of tensions within the nobility. It reopened the very question as to what actually happened at St Albans; but, having opened it, not only failed to provide an answer but highlighted existing divisions.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=343}} The government, for its part, contributed to the decline in relations with the Yorkists. This was because by releasing the Percies from their constraints, old rivalries were reawakened. The Loveday's undermining of the Nevilles in Yorkshire now shifted the regional balance of power.{{sfn|Pushon|2002|p=200}}\n\nIn November 1458,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=799}} there was an ugly brawl at Westminster{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=22}} between the Earl of Warwick's men and those of the Duke of Somerset, which the earl saw as another attempted assassination. He had to fight his way clear of the Palace,{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} and escaped to Calais.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} At the same time, York and the Nevilles were increasingly isolated by the Queen's party politically.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=807}} Law and order also declined, and in December 1458 1,000 pikes and clubs were ordered for the Royal Household's protection of the King.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=315}} \n\nHenry's organisation of the 1458 Loveday negotiations was one of the last occasions of his reign in which he showed either an interest in or a commitment towards affairs of state.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=315}} From that point on, Queen Margaret began subtly, but clearly, asserting the control of herself and her adherents in government. The Duke of York retired to his [[Welsh Marches|marcher estates]], and the Earl of Salisbury to his in the north.{{sfn|Pollard|2004}} Carpenter has posited that\u2014\"ironically at the most overt moment of conciliation\"{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}}\u2014the Loveday represents the point at which magnate disunity could no longer be denied, and, therefore, when the [[Wars of the Roses]] actually begun.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}} The few months following the Loveday are obscure.{{sfn|Lander|1980|p=200}} The following year, armed conflict broke out again when the Salisbury's army was ambushed at [[Battle of Blore Heath|Blore Heath]] by a Lancastrian army.{{Sfn|Hicks|2010|pp=141\u2013143}} He and the other Yorkists lords were indicted for treason in the [[Parliament of Devils|Coventry Parliament]],{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} at the Queen's instigation.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=638}} At this time, the Yorkists were still, supposedly, paying their dues to their opponents from 1455.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=155}} Within three years of King Henry's Loveday, however, he had been deposed, the Duke of York [[Battle of Wakefield|killed in battle]] and his son [[Edward IV of England|Edward]] crowned the first Yorkist King of England.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=41}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Allen |first=A.

Following the outbreak of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1455, it was the culmination of lengthy negotiations initiated by [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] in an attempt to resolve the lords' rivalries. English politics had become increasingly factional during his reign, and was exacerbated in 1453 when he became [[Catatonia|catatonic]]. This effectively left the government leaderless, and eventually the King's cousin, and at the time [[Heir presumptive|heir to the throne]], [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] was appointed Protector during the King's illness. Alongside York were his allies from the politically and militarily powerful [[House of Neville|Neville]] family, led by [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard, Earl of Salisbury]], and his eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]]. When the King returned to health a year later, the protectorship ended but partisanship within the government did not. \n\nSupporters of King Henry and his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], have been loosely called \"Lancastrians\", the King being head of the [[House of Lancaster]], while the duke and his party are considered \"Yorkists\", after his title of [[Duke of York]].{{Refn|The labels \"York and Lancaster\", are, however, considered by historians to oversimplify the complex networks of loyalties and connections by which the [[English peerage|English nobility]] was interlinked. Simply, at the beginning of the Wars of the Roses, the House of Lancaster\u2014whose supporters have been labelled \"Lancastrian\"\u2014was the ruling, governing dynasty founded by [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]. His primary title had been [[Duke of Lancaster]], and in 1399 he [[usurped]] the throne and deposed his cousin, [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. The ancestors of the Duke of York accepted the new political paradigm throughout the reign of Henry IV and his son [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], as did York himself throughout most of Henry VI's reign. He was both inept as a ruler and manipulable by powerful noble advisors, and they gradually alienated the Duke from central government. Those who gathered around him in opposition to these favourites\u2014and later the King and Queen themselves\u2014were known as \"Yorkists\".{{sfn|Hicks|2010|pp=43\u201345, 12\u201313}}|name=|group=note}} By the 1450s, York felt increasingly excluded from government, and, in May 1455\u2014possibly fearing an ambush by his enemies\u2014led an army against the King at the [[First Battle of St Albans]]. There, in what has been called more of a series of assassinations than a battle, the personal enemies of York and the Nevilles\u2014the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron Clifford|Lord Clifford]]\u2014perished.\n\nIn 1458 the King attempted to unite his feuding nobles with a public display of friendship under the auspices of the Church at [[St Paul's Cathedral#Old St Paul's|St Paul's Cathedral]]. Following much discussion and negotiation, and amid the presence of large, armed, noble retinues which almost led to another outbreak of war, a compromise was announced. To celebrate, a procession was held by all the major participants, who walked hand-in-hand from [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Palace]] to [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Queen Margaret was partnered with York, and other adversaries were paired off accordingly, and the sons of the dead [[Lancastrianism|Lancastrian]] lords took their fathers' places. Certain reparations were ordained, all by the [[House of York|Yorkist]] lords, who for their part accepted full responsibility for the Battle of St Albans. They were ordered to make payments to the dead lords' widows and sons, and [[Mass in the Catholic Church|masses]] were paid for the souls of all who had died. Contemporaries varied in their views of the accord. Some wrote verses expressing hope that it would lead to a new-found peace and prosperity, while others were more pessimistic as to its value.\n\nIn the long run, the King's Loveday and its agreements had no long-lasting benefit. Within a few months, petty violence between the lords had broken out again, and within the year, York and Lancaster faced each other at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]]. Historians debate who\u2014if anyone\u2014actually gained from the 1458 Loveday. On the one hand, the crown publicised its role as the ultimate court of appeal, but conversely, although the Yorkists were bound to pay large sums in compensation, this was done with money already owed by the government. Fundamentally, factional discord was highlighted on the public stage, and the war it was intended to prevent was only deferred.      \n\n==Political background==\nBy the middle of the 15th century, English politics had become increasingly factional. [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] and his [[House of Neville|Neville]] allies\u2014[[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard, Earl of Salisbury]] and his son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], with their cousin [[John Mowbray, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk]]\u2014were in opposition to the government of [[King Henry VI]]. The King was weak-willed and easily led, and his government was effectively controlled by his [[favourite]], [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]].{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} Further weakening the government, King Henry had become mentally incapacitated in August 1453, becoming comatose, unable to feed himself or recognise any of his companions.{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|p=715}}{{refn|Historians have speculated upon Henry's illness. Its precise nature is unknown,{{sfn|Rushton|2010|pp=147\u2013148}} but Griffiths describes it as \"a severe mental collapse, accompanied by a crippling physical disablement\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1980|p=715}} Its cause is equally hard to determine. Wolffe speculates that it could have been a response to news of the [[Battle of Castillon]] a few days earlier which presaged the final fall of Lancastrian France as well as seeing the death of the English commander, \"[[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|old Talbot]]\". His illness may also have had a genetic element, as Henry's grandfather, [[Charles VI of France]], had suffered extreme bouts of insanity in his later years.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=270, 276}}|group=note}} \n\nAt the time, a [[Percy\u2013Neville feud|major feud]] was taking place in the [[North of England]] between the powerful [[House of Percy|Percy]] and Neville families. The former was led by [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland]]'s son, [[Thomas Percy, 1st Baron Egremont|Thomas Percy, Lord Egremont]], while the Neville family was headed by Salisbury.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=134}} In March 1454, the King still being ill, parliament authorised a [[Lord Protector|protectorate]] to rule in the King's stead. The [[House of Lords]] chose the Duke of York\u2014as the King's closest adult relative\u2014as Protector. York and the Nevilles cemented an alliance during the protectorate when York appointed Salisbury his [[Lord Chancellor]].{{sfn|Pollard|1990|pp=257\u2013258}}{{refn|Modern historians view Salisbury's appointment as a clear break with tradition.

They received massive fines.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=622}}{{Refn|The defeated Percies were [[arraigned]] before a commission of [[oyer and terminer]] at York. This commission bound them over for 8,000 marks payable to the Earl of Salisbury, and including fines towards his countess and sons, to a total of 16,800 marks. It was, says Professor Storey, \"a staggering sum\"{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=149}} which Egremont \"could never hope to pay, nor, indeed, did he try\".{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=149}} This guaranteed his imprisonment in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate]]. The Percies were too politically favoured for the Nevilles to expect anything other than the King to pardon the Percies for their political offences, whereas they could not hope to avoid the consequences of failing to discharge legally-binding debts.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=149}}{{sfn|Griffiths|2004}} The Griffiths has described this as Salisbury's \"reckoning\" of all the damage caused to his estates during the course of the feud with the Percies.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=622}} To put these sums in context, Storey has estimated Egremont's annual income to have been less than \u00a3100 per annum.{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=148\u2013149}}|group=note}} The following January, the King regained his health, and York was no longer required as Protector.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=622}} York and the Nevilles retreated to their northern estates, and Mowbray did likewise to [[East Anglia]], in an attempt to distance themselves from factional politics.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=740}} From this point, argues the [[medievalist]] [[A.

They were not only three of the King's most loyal and powerful supporters, but Northumberland and Somerset were bitter enemies of the Nevilles and York.{{Sfn|Hicks|2010|p=110}} Because of this, the clash has been described more akin to a series of targeted assassinations than a fully-fledged battle.{{Sfn|Armstrong|1960|p=35}}{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=289}} On the 22nd, Henry was escorted, under guard, back to London: \"all honour was shown to him\" by York, Salisbury and Warwick, notes Griffiths, and a ceremony\u2014intending to establish the new-found friendship between the King and the Yorkists\u2014was held in St Paul's the following day.{{Sfn|Goodman|1996|p=24}}{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=746}}\n\nThe period between St Albans and the Loveday, says Pollard, is one of the most poorly recorded of the entire century,{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} although what is known has enabled historians to piece together the basic chronology.

On the other hand, says Griffiths, Warwick's younger brothers, Thomas and John, personally \"spearheaded the Neville retaliation against the Percies\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=628}}|group=note}} to pay 12,000 marks to Eleanor Neville, Dowager Countess of Northumberland.{{refn|Eleanor Neville was also Salisbury's elder sister.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=35}}|group=note}} She and her son, the new Earl, in turn pledged themselves to keep the peace with the Nevilles.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=628}} The financial obligations that had been imposed on many Percy tenants after the feud with the Nevilles were also lifted.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=34}} Further\u2014because Egremont had escaped from [[Newgate]] in 1456\u2014Salisbury also swore not to take any action against the Newgate sheriffs whose negligence was presumed to have enabled it.{{sfn|Griffiths|1968|p=628}}{{Refn|This was not an unusual policy, notes the historian [[Ralph B. Pugh]]. Throughout the 15th century, it was becoming increasingly common to levy \"fines of fantastic proportions\" on those who failed to hold prisoners, ranging from \u00a3400 to \u00a34,000 depending on the individual's rank. Pugh notes that Egremont's gaoler had been threatened with a fine of \u00a32,000. {{sfn|Pugh|2008|p=240}}|group=note}}\n\nWolffe has argued that Henry's decision was no more than \"a formal accord on the limited issue of atonement and compensation\".{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=312}} Changing the attitudes of individuals towards their enemies was considered more important than the question of compensation, important though that was.{{Sfn|Johnson|1988|p=182}} Furthermore, York and Warwick's payments to the families of their enemies were not in cash; rather, they were to renounce debts owed them by the crown which amounted to similar sums.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=184}} To fulfil their obligations, York and the Nevilles merely had to return government-issued [[Tally stick|tallies]] which entitled them to receive the required sum.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} The Yorkists, for their part, were declared to be the King's \"true lieges\", although any reassurance they took from this, comments the medievalist [[John Watts (historian)|John Watts]], may have been tempered by the knowledge that so also had been the three dead lords of St Albans.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=344}}\n\nThe Yorkists agreed to endow [[St Albans Abbey]] with a new [[chantry]]{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=185}} and [[\u00a3]]45 a year for two years for the monks to say masses for the slain.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} The Lancastrian lords, as the injured parties, had to make no reciprocal concessions to York and his allies. Egremont was required to make an independent [[Binding over|bond]] of 4,000 marks towards the Nevilles to keep the peace with them in [[Yorkshire]] for ten years.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} Thus, says the scholar [[Helen Maurer]], the crown implicitly recognised that bad blood had existed between the Nevilles and Egremont even before St Albans.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} One contemporary observed in a [[Paston Letters|Paston letter]] that the final settlement was a \"throw [sic: ''thorough''] peace final[ised] by means of all the Lords\".{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=345}}\n\n== The Loveday ==\n[[File:Richard_Neville,_5th_Earl_of_Salisbury_seule.jpg|alt=Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, depicted on a contemporary manuscript|thumb|Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury; York's closest political ally and head of the powerful northern Neville family.]]\nThe pact was announced on 25 March, or Lady Day (the Feast of the [[Annunciation of the Virgin]]). Henry\u2014\"thanking God for their having reaching accord\"\u2014joined his wife and nobles on a celebratory procession{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} from Westminster to London.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=806}} Leading the parade were Somerset and Salisbury\u201436 years older than the duke\u2014followed by Exeter with Warwick, then \"the King alone, wearing his crown and royal robes\"{{sfn|Sadler|2010|p=70}} between them all. Finally came York and Queen Margaret. All parties held hands: a later chronicle described how \"one of the one faction, and another of the other sect, and behind the King, the Duke of Yorke led the Queene with great familiaritie to all mens sighte\".{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=361}} Although no contemporary records now survive to provide the physical details of the Loveday procession itself, scholars are aware of the general nature of medieval urban processions. The scholar Kathleen Ashley has highlighted how they presented what she has called a \"offered a \"fusion of sensory experiences, or [[synaesthesia]]\" for both the participants and observers, who would often amount to as many people as could physically attend, on account of the holiday atmosphere that accompanied them.{{sfn|Ashley|2001|p=13}}\n\nHistorians have noted multiple interpretations of the symbolism favoured by Henry. It was \"a symbolic series of gestures\", says [[John Sadler (historian)|John Sadler]],{{sfn|Sadler|2010|p=70}} perhaps a show of \"friendly and modest intimacies\"{{sfn|Ingham|1996|p=28}} suggests [[Patricia Ingham]]. Or it may have been mere rhetoric, bordering on a charade, suggests Pollard.{{sfn|Ingham|1996|p=28}} At the time, physical intimacy was an essential element of concord{{sfn|Santiuste|2011}} and the intention was clearly to demonstrate both their agreement and their willingness to agree.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} The Queen holding York's hand (rather than him holding Somerset's), says Watts, was an acknowledgement of her close involvement in the affairs of central government and her higher political profile in the post-St Albans [[body politic]].{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=344}} The Loveday was a combination, says Griffiths, of \"elaborate ceremonial, royal prayer and example, monetary payments and the holding of hands...[between] bitter enemies\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=806\u2013807}} The assembled lords were taking no more chances now than they had when they first arrived in London: Salisbury, for example, attended the concomitant religious ceremony at St Paul's with his retinue of 400 men, which included 80 knights and esquires, waiting in the churchyard.{{sfn|Hicks|2013|p=145}} It may have been called a Loveday, comments Sadler, yet \"the title is ironic, as there was little of love in the air\".{{sfn|Sadler|2010|p=70}} The closing event was the presentation of a new translation of the contemporary verse paraphrase, ''[[Knyghthode and Bataile]]'' to the King. This was a recent adaption of ''[[De re militari]]'', and celebrates the martial exploits of the noble class in a classic [[Chivalric romance|chivalric form]].{{sfn|Ingham|1996|p=26}} \n\nThe immediate aftermath of the Loveday, however, was positive, not least for the Nevilles, as the King granted Egremont permission to go on a pilgrimage in June 1458. From the government's perspective, this was an opportunity to physically remove one of the parties to a dispute. Pollard Casts some doubt on whether Egremont actually wanted to go on pilgrimage, arguing that \"no doubt he had been persuaded\" to do so, as previous attempts to quieten him in the north\u2014through French service in 1453 and imprisonment in 1456\u2014had failed.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} The King and his council seem to have also concluded by now that the Percies and the Nevilles' feud in the north was the primary cause of St Albans, and their treatment of Egremont reflected that. If this was the case, notes Watts, such a policy made the mistake of ignoring the enmity between other parties, for instance, York and Somerset.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=344}}\n\nThe King went on his own pilgrimage to St Albans at Easter the same year. This, says Griffiths, \"demonstrated that the site of the battle in which he had been wounded and his ministers slain no longer stirred fearful memories in his mind\".{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=807}} The appearance of amity was maintained publicly with \"with a royal round of jousts, feasting, and other entertainments until May\" that year.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} These festivities took place both at the [[Tower of London]] and at the Queen's [[Greenwich Palace|Palace at Greenwich]], further emphasising her involvement in the proceedings.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=807}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Earl of Salisbury subsequently had an [[exemplification]] copy of the Loveday agreement made. This, to Hicks, suggests that he saw the award as to his benefit, notwithstanding the recompenses he was ordered to make.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=136}} All Salisbury had to do was\u2014in Storey's words\u2014\"give up bad debts\".{{sfn|Storey|1999|pp=184\u2013185}} Another probable consequence of the Loveday deliberations may have been that in May, Salisbury's son [[John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu|Sir John Neville]] was betrothed to a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the Queen. This was Isabella Ingaldsthorpe,{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=346 n.357}}{{refn|Isabel Ingoldsthorpe is occasionally also referred to as Elizabeth in [[Exchequer]] records.{{sfn|Selden Society|1933|pp=138\u201340}}|group=note}} the heiress of her maternal uncle, [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester|John Tiptoft]] and his [[Earl of Worcester|earldom of Worcester]],{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=25}} and the [[betrothal]] would not have been possible without Margaret's permission.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=147}} The crown itself benefited from the Loveday as its role as arbiter-in-chief\u2014\"the cement of the political fabric\",{{sfn|Gross|1996|p=44}} wrote Anthony Gross\u2014was reaffirmed in a blaze of publicity.{{sfn|Gross|1996|p=44}} Johnson argues that the traditional and probably definitive way of uniting the nobility was war, and this was too firmly disapproved of by the King ever to be an option.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=180}}\n\n=== Legacy ===\nThere is some disagreement among historians as to who won or lost at the Loveday. Hicks considers it to have been a \"reasonable compromise\",{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} while Griffiths saw it as being punitive to the Yorkists.{{Sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=808}} Watts suggests that it indicates that, notwithstanding St Albans, \"York and the Nevilles were regarded as acceptable by the ruling lords\".{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=346 n.357}} Johnson argues that York, at the least, did \"very well\" out of it.{{sfn|Maurer|2003|p=156}} To the scholar [[David Grummitt]], this Loveday illustrated the \"essentially private and personal nature of the dispute\" between the Yorkists and their enemies.{{sfn|Grummitt|2013|p=52}} More broadly, though, the personal basis for their enmity was in the long term disadvantageous to the Yorkists. By focussing on, and emphasising, the personal quarrels between York and Somerset\u2014or Salisbury and Northumberland for example\u2014the award ignored and sidelined the original complaints of the Yorkists that they had argued led to the battle.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=343}}{{refn|As recent scholarship expresses it, the Loveday \"assisted in the propagation of this negative view of Yorkist activity. By presenting St Albans as a simple quarrel amongst magnates, rather than a clash between the King's good and bad counsellors (as the Yorkist version of events suggested), the terms of the royal award effectively deprived the Yorkists of their justification for having risen in arms\".{{sfn|Vale|1995|p=26 n. 97}} The agreement sought, says the medievalist [[G. L. Harriss]], to \"bury the past rather than rewrite it\", and made no provision for a future settlement either.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=637}}|group=note}}  Furthermore, he says, if any part of the nobility were united by the Loveday, it was the Yorkist lords.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=346}} The researcher Christine Carpenter has suggested that the King wanted to keep the occasion one of \"general reconciliation and restoration of magnate unity\".{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}} She argues that not highlighting the degree to which the nobility was divided was a deliberate policy, but the involvement of the Queen meant there had to be \"a formal recognition...that there were two opposing camps\".{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}}\n\nThe Loveday saw the Yorkists\u2014for the first time\u2014acknowledge their wrongdoing and accept culpability for St Albans. This was something they had denied immediately after the battle and in the years following, but was insufficient in the long term, says Pollard, because it did not contain the one thing that the new Lancastrian lords most wanted\u2014revenge for their fathers. It was not, therefore, \"a satisfying long-term solution\" that guaranteed future peace as intended.{{sfn|Pollard|2007|p=36}} \n[[File:Funeral Procession - 15th Century - Project Gutenberg eText 16531.jpg|alt=A 15th-century illustration of the medieval St Paul's Cathedral|thumb|A contemporary illustration of a procession entering the medieval St Paul's Cathedral\u2014in the background\u2014where the nobility gathered on 25 March 1458.{{sfn|British Library|1440|p=194r}}{{sfn|Benham|1902|p=10}}]]\n\n===Contemporary reaction=== \nThe historian [[Cora Scofield]] suggests that the Loveday procession to St Paul's was \"doubtless an edifying spectacle, but it had little real meaning and probably deceived no-one\".{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=27}} Not long after the Loveday, an anonymous poem was published entitled ''Take Good Heed''; this offers the Yorkist lords advice and anxious support for the years ahead, which, the author recognises, will be difficult ones for all.{{sfn|Scattergood|1971|p=181}} Other writers were more optimistic. The poem ''Reconciliation of Henry VI and the Yorkists'' repeats the refrain, \"rejoise, Angleonde to concorde and unit\u00e9\",{{sfn|Bennett|1958|p=361}} suggesting that the author expects the kingdom to be strong and unified going forward.{{sfn|Baker|2013|p=258}} The author of the ''Reconciliation'' emphasises how \"ther was bytwyn hem lovely contynaunce / Whiche was gret ioy to all that ther were\".{{sfn|Baker|2013|p=258}} The author expands on his theme:{{sfn|Hope Robbins|1959|pp=21\u201324}} \n\n<poem>In Yorke, In Somerset, as I understonde,\nIn Warrewik also is loue & charite,\nIn Sarisbury eke, & in Northumbreland,\nThat euery man may reioise in concord & unite.{{sfn|Hope Robbins|1959|pp=21\u201324}}</poem>\n\nNot all commentators were impressed: a [[Coventry]] [[preacher]], one William Ive, said caustically that the King \"made Lovedays as Judas made with a kiss with Christ\".{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=21}} Enemies may have marched together that day, argues Scofield, but they trusted each other no more after the procession than they had before.{{sfn|Scofield|1923|p=26}} This was the view of [[Thomas Malory]] in his mid-century ''[[Morte darthur]]'', which expresses a cynicism regarding Lovedays as a means of settling feuds. Malory's pessimism was probably caused by his view of the 1458 ceremony.{{sfn|Baker|2013|p=258}} Malory portrays [[Lancelot]] as attempting to atone for the murders of his enemies through the building of chapels\u2014\"penitence as a remedy for war\", suggests literary scholar Robert L. Kelly. But Lancelot's, like Henry's, attempts are in vain: \"Lo what meschef lyth in variaunce / Amonge lordis, whan \u00feei nat accorde\", comments Malory on both.{{sfn|Kelly|1994|pp=111\u2013112, 124}}\n\n==Failure to prevent crisis==\nThe peace ordained at the Loveday, says Pollard, \"was shallow and shortlived\".{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} Having failed to solve the underlying crisis in the long term, \"the atmosphere of distrust and intrigue still continued\".{{sfn|Allen|1981|p=110}} Indeed, the Loveday itself may have contributed to a heightening of tensions within the nobility. It reopened the very question as to what actually happened at St Albans; but, having opened it, not only failed to provide an answer but highlighted existing divisions.{{sfn|Watts|1999|p=343}} The government, for its part, contributed to the decline in relations with the Yorkists. This was because by releasing the Percies from their constraints, old rivalries were reawakened. The Loveday's undermining of the Nevilles in Yorkshire now shifted the regional balance of power.{{sfn|Pushon|2002|p=200}}\n\nIn November 1458,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=799}} there was an ugly brawl at Westminster{{sfn|Santiuste|2011|p=22}} between the Earl of Warwick's men and those of the Duke of Somerset, which the earl saw as another attempted assassination. He had to fight his way clear of the Palace,{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} and escaped to Calais.{{sfn|Pollard|1990|p=269}} At the same time, York and the Nevilles were increasingly isolated by the Queen's party politically.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=807}} Law and order also declined, and in December 1458 1,000 pikes and clubs were ordered for the Royal Household's protection of the King.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=315}} \n\nHenry's organisation of the 1458 Loveday negotiations was one of the last occasions of his reign in which he showed either an interest in or a commitment towards affairs of state.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=315}} From that point on, Queen Margaret began subtly, but clearly, asserting the control of herself and her adherents in government. The Duke of York retired to his [[Welsh Marches|marcher estates]], and the Earl of Salisbury to his in the north.{{sfn|Pollard|2004}} Carpenter has posited that\u2014\"ironically at the most overt moment of conciliation\"{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}}\u2014the Loveday represents the point at which magnate disunity could no longer be denied, and, therefore, when the [[Wars of the Roses]] actually begun.{{sfn|Carpenter|1997|p=143}} The few months following the Loveday are obscure.{{sfn|Lander|1980|p=200}} The following year, armed conflict broke out again when the Salisbury's army was ambushed at [[Battle of Blore Heath|Blore Heath]] by a Lancastrian army.{{Sfn|Hicks|2010|pp=141\u2013143}} He and the other Yorkists lords were indicted for treason in the [[Parliament of Devils|Coventry Parliament]],{{sfn|Pollard|2001|p=22}} at the Queen's instigation.{{sfn|Harriss|2005|p=638}} At this time, the Yorkists were still, supposedly, paying their dues to their opponents from 1455.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=155}} Within three years of King Henry's Loveday, however, he had been deposed, the Duke of York [[Battle of Wakefield|killed in battle]] and his son [[Edward IV of England|Edward]] crowned the first Yorkist King of England.{{Sfn|Ross|1997|p=41}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|2|indent=yes}}\n* {{cite thesis |degree=PhD |last=Allen |first=A.

{"title_page": "Process duct work", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2011}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=September 2018|Article devolves into jargon near the end, with many style errors, and unclear references to images}}\n'''Process duct work''' conveys large volumes of hot, dusty air from [[Process engineering|processing equipment]] to mills, baghouses to other process equipment. Process [[Duct (industrial exhaust)|duct work]] may be round or rectangular. Although round duct work costs more to fabricate than rectangular duct work, it requires fewer stiffeners and is favored in many applications over rectangular ductwork.\n\nThe air in process duct work may be at ambient conditions or may operate at up to {{convert|900|\u00b0F}}. Process ductwork varies in size from 2&nbsp;ft diameter to 20&nbsp;ft diameter or to perhaps 20&nbsp;ft by 40&nbsp;ft rectangular.\n\nLarge process ductwork may fill with dust, depending on slope, to up to 30% of cross section, which can weigh 2 to 4 tons per linear foot.\n\nRound ductwork is subject to duct suction collapse, and requires stiffeners to minimize this, but is more efficient in material than rectangular duct work.\n\nThere are no comprehensive, design references for process duct work design. The ASCE reference for the design of power plant duct design gives some general guidance on duct design, but does not specifically give designers sufficient information to design process duct work.\n\n==Structural process ductwork==\nStructural process ductwork carries large volumes of high temperature, dusty air, between pieces of process equipment. The design of this ductwork requires an understanding of the interaction of heat softening of [[metal]]s, potential effects of dust buildup in large ductwork, and [[structural design]] principles. There are two basic shapes for structural process ductwork: rectangular and round. Rectangular ductwork is covered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] \"The Structural Design of Air & Gas Ducts for Process Power Stations and Industrial Applications\".\n\nIn the practical design of primarily round structural process ductwork in the [[cement]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[lead]] industries, the duct size involved ranges from 18&nbsp;inches (45&nbsp;cm) to 30&nbsp;feet (10&nbsp;m). The air temperature may vary from ambient to 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F (515&nbsp;\u00b0C). Process ductwork is subject to large loads due to dust buildup, fan suction pressure, wind, and [[earthquake]] forces. {{As of|2009}} 30&nbsp;ft diameter process ductwork may cost $7,000 per ton. Failure to properly integrate design forces may lead to catastrophic duct collapse. Overdesign of ductwork is expensive.\n\n===Round and rectangular duct structural design===\nThe structural design of ductwork plate is based on buckling of the plate element. Round ductwork plate design is based on diameter to duct plate thickness ratios, and the allowable stresses are contained in multiple references such as ''US Steel Plate'', ASME/ANSI STS-1,SMNACA, ''Tubular Steel Structures'', and other references. In actuality round ductwork bent in bending is approximately 30% stronger than a similar shape in compression, however one uses the same allowable stresses in bending as we do for compression.\n\nRound ducts require typical stiffeners at roughly 3 diameter spacing, or roughly 20&nbsp;ft. O.C. for wind ovaling and fabrication and truck shipping requirements. Round ducts, larger than {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in diameter (1/4\" plate) require support ring stiffeners. Smaller-diameter ducts may not require support ring stiffeners, but may be designed with saddle supports. When stiffener rings are required they are traditionally designed based on \"Roark\", although this reference is quite conservative.\n\nRound duct elbow allowable stresses are lower than the allowable stresses for straight duct  by a K factor = 1.65/(h 2/3power) where [h = t (duct) * R (elbow) /(r(duct)*r (duct). This equation, or similar equations is found in ''Tubular Steel Structures'' section 9.9.\n\nRectangular ductwork design properties is based on width-to-thickness ratios. This is simplified, normally to width=t/16, from corner elements or corner angle stiffeners, although in reality, the entire duct top & side plate does participate, somewhat in duct section properties.\n\n===Duct logic===\n\nDuct logic is the process of planning for duct thermal movement, combined with planning to minimize duct dust dropout.\n\nDucts move with changes in internal temperature. Ducts are assumed to have the same temperature as their internal gasses, which may be up to 900&nbsp;\u00b0F. If the internal duct temperature exceeds 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F, refractory lining is used to minimize the duct surface temperature. At 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F, ducts may grow approximately 5/8 inch per 10 feet of length. This movement must be carefully planned for, with cloth (or metal) expansion joints at each equipment flange, and one joint per each straight section of ductwork.\n\nSloping ductwork at or above the duct dust angle of repose will minimize dust buildup. Therefore, many ducts carrying high dust loads slope at 30 degrees, or steeper.\n\n===Duct elbow geometry===\n\nTo minimize pressure loss in duct elbows, the typical elbow radius is 1&nbsp;1/2 times the duct diameter. In cases where this elbow radius is not feasible, turning vanes are added to the duct.\n\n[[File:Stack Inlet Transition.jpg|thumbnail|Stack transition at concrete stack]]\n\n===Duct transition and elbow layout===\n\nProcess ductwork is often large (6-foot diameter to 18-foot diameter), carrying large volumes of hot dirty gasses, at velocities of 3000 to 4500 feet per minute. The fans used to move these gasses are also large, 250 to 4000 horsepower. Therefore minimizing duct pressure drop by minimizing turbulence at elbows and transitions is of importance. Duct elbow radius is usually 1&nbsp;1/2 to 2 times the duct size. The side slopes of transitions are typically 10 to 30 degrees.\n\nNote: the duct gas velocity is chosen to minimize duct dust dropout. Cement and lime plant duct velocity at normal operations is 3000 to 3200 foot per minute, lead plant velocities are 4000 to 4500 foot per minute, as the dust is heavier. Other industries, such as grain have lower gas velocities. Higher duct gas velocity may require more powerful fans than lower duct velocities.\n\n===Duct support types===\n* Fixed supports typically are designed to resist lateral movement of the duct. Depending on the support geometry, fixed supports may also resist rotation of the duct art the support.\n* Sliding supports are typically supported on Teflon, (or other material) pads, isolated from the duct so that temperature and dust does not damage the sliding surface.\n* Link supports  are often \"bents\", or braced frames down from the duct support ring (frame) to a foundation or support plane. if the bent is long enough, hinges are not required to allow for duct thermal growth.\n* Rod or hanger supports are similar to link supports, but due to the flexibility of the rod supports, that are easier to design and detail.\n* Guide supports: Often rings inside a structural frame, with angle guides, that allow the duct to grow vertically while restraining the duct laterally for wind loads.\n* Unusual \"support\" conditions (details):\n** Hinges at expansion joints\n** Tension ties across dual fixed supports\n** Designs that allowing duct elbows to flex under unusual support conditions\n** Other unusual design models.\n\n===Duct design loads===\n\nFor cement plant and Lime plant process ductwork, duct loads are a combination of:\n# Duct dead loads: are often simplified (in Cement plant usage) by using duct plate weight, multiplied by 1.15 as a stiffener allowance, as duct stiffeners usually weigh less than 15% times the duct plate weight. Duct stiffener allowance for rectangular power plants ductwork may be 50% to 100% of the duct plate weight.\n# Duct internal dust loads (bottom of duct): which vary considerably with duct slope. These loads need to be approved by the client, but are often used as follows:\nFor duct sloping 0 degrees to 30 degrees, duct internal dust is 25% of duct cross section. For duct sloping 30 degrees to  45 degrees duct dust loads are reduced to 15% of cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping 45 degrees to 85 degrees, duct internal dust is 5% of duct cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping over 85 degrees.\nBecause of the potential for high dust loading, most process ductwork is run at a 30 to 45 degree slope.\n\n2a) Duct dust loading in non-process ducts (2-foot diameter and smaller), such as conveyor venting ducts are sometimes run horizontally and can be filled to 100% of cross section.\n\n2b) Power plant internal duct dust loads are coordinated with the client, and are sometimes used at 1 to 2 foot of internal ash loadings.\n\n3) Duct internal, coating dust loads, which sometimes are used as a 2\" (50&nbsp;mm) coating of dust on the internal perimeter.\n\n4) Duct suction pressure loads. Most process duct loads have design pressures of 25 inches (600&nbsp;mm) to 40 inches (1000&nbsp;mm) of water pressure. This suction pressure operates to cause suction pressure collapse on the duct side walls. Also this pressure operates perpendicular to the duct \"expansion joints\" to create an additional load on the duct supports that adds to dead, and live loads. Please note: duct pressure loads vary with temperature, as the gas density varies with temperature. A duct pressure of 25 inches of H2O, at room temperature may become 12 inches to 6 inches at duct operating pressures.\n\n5) Duct wind loads\n\n6) Duct Seismic loads\n\n7) Duct Snow loads, normally inconsequential, as snow will melt quickly unless the plant is in shutdown mode.\n\n8) Top of duct dust loads, often used as zero, since plant dust generation is much less now, than in the past.\n\n9) Duct suction pressure loads, act perpendicular to end of duct cross section, and can be significant. For a duct designed for 25\" of water at a startup temperature of 70 degree F, on an 8 foot in diameter duct, this is equal to 8000 pounds at each end of the duct.\n\n[[File:Copy of Duct Fixed Suport.jpg|thumbnail|Duct fixed support]]\n\n==Round ductwork==\n\nThe majority of cement plant process ductwork is round. This is because the round duct shape does not bend between circumferential stiffeners. Therefore bending stiffeners are not required, and round ductwork requires fewer and lighter intermediate stiffeners than rectangular ductwork. Round cement plant duct stiffeners are sometimes about 5% duct plate weight. Rectangular cement plant duct stiffeners are 15 to 20% times duct plate weight. Power plant ductwork is often larger. Power plant ductwork is usually rectangular, with stiffener weights of 50% (or more) times duct plate weight. (this is based on personal experience, and my vary with loads, duct size, and industry standards)\n\nLarge, round process ductwork is usually [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from 1/4-inch (6&nbsp;mm) mild steel plate, with ovaling stiffening rings at 15 to 20&nbsp;ft (5 to 6 M) on center, regardless of diameter. These lengths allow for resistance to wind ovaling and resistance to out of round when shipping by truck. This also works well with fabricator equipment.\n\nThe typical intermediate rings are designed for wind bending [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], reduced as required by the [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]] reduction at working temperatures. The typical rings are fabricated from rolled steel plate, angles or tees's welded together to create the ring cross section required. Rings are fabricated from any combination of plate, tee or W shape that the shop can roll. Rings are usually mild carbon steel, ASTM A36 plate, or equivalent. The location of ring butt welds should preferably be offset 15 degrees(+/-)from point of maximum stress to minimize the effect of weld porosity on weld allowable stress.\n\nSee [[U.S. Steel|US Steel]] Plate, volume II for empirical ring spacing, and wind bending stress:\nSpacing = Ls = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)]\nSection = p * L (spacing, ft) * Do (ft) * Do (ft)/Fb (20,000 at ambient T)\nThis reference is older, but a good starting point for duct design.\n\nSMACNA, (2ND Edition) chapter 4 has many useful formulas for round ducts, allowable stresses, ring spacing, effect of dust, ice, and live loads. The basic factor of safety for SMACNA, 3, is larger than typically used on typical structural engineering projects, of 1.6.\nUnder SMACNA the critical ring spacing for rings is L = 1.25 * D (ft) sqrt (D(ft)/t(inches)), which is similar to tubular steel structures, L = 3.13 * R sqrt (R/t). In effect, using Spacing = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)] is conservative.\n\nAllowable bending and compression stress in ducts can come from several sources.\n\nSee API 560 for design of wind ovaling stiffeners\n\nSee Tubular Steel structures, chapter 2, 9 & 12 for the allowable stresses for thin, round ducts, their allowable stresses, elbows, elbow softening coefficients, and some procedures for the design of duct support rings. These allowable stresses can be verified with select review of chapters of US Steel Plate, Blodgett Design of plate structures, Roark & Young, or API 650.\n\nRound duct support rings are spaced, often at three diameters, or as require at up to about 50&nbsp;ft centers (14 m). At this spacing the main support rings are designed for the sum of [[suction pressure]] stresses & support bending moments.\n\nRound ductwork allowable compressive stress is = 662 /(d/t) +339 * Fy (tubular steel structures, chapter 2). Other reference use similar equations.\n\nDuctwork typical cement plant pressure drops are: 60% to 80% of high temperature process duct work [[pressure drop]] occurs in the process equipment, baghouses, mills and cyclones. Since motor 1 (one) horsepower cost roughly $1000/year (US$) (2005), duct efficiency is important. Minimizing duct pressure drop can reduce plan operating costs. most ductwork, non-equipment pressure drop occurs at transitions and changes of directions (elbows). The bests way to minimize duct pressure drop or to minimize plant operating costs, is to use elbows with an elbow radius to duct radius exceeding 1.5. (For a 15-foot duct, the elbow radius would therefore equal, or exceed, 22.5&nbsp;ft.)\n\nProcess duct pressure drops (US practice) are usually measured in inches of water. A typical duct operates at about - 25 inches (160 psf.) total suction pressure, with roughly 75% of the pressure loss in the bag house, and 10% of pressure lost in duct friction, and 15% (nominal)lost in elbow turbulence. A major consideration of duct design is to minimize duct pressure losses, turbulence, as poor duct geometry, increases turbulence, and increases plant electrical usage.\n\nRound duct work suction pressure collapse, in ducts over 6 feet in diameter, is prevented with rings at supports, and roughly 3 diameter centers.\n\nRound duct support rings are traditionally designed from the formula's found in Roark & Young. However this reference is based on point loads on rings, while actual duct ring loads are based on almost uniform bottom dust. Therefore, these formulars can be shown with Ram, or other analysis methods to have conservatism factor of roughly 2 above the stresses given In Roark. The duct ring force dead, live and dust forces need to be combined with suction pressure stresses. Suction pressure forces concentrate on the rings, as they are the stiffest element present.\n\nRound ductwork elbow allowable stresses are reduced due to the elbow curvature. Various references give similar results for this reduction. Tubular steel structures, Section 9.9 gives the (Beskin) reduction factor of K= 1.65/(h (2/3 power)) where h= t (plate) *R(elbow)/ r (duct) (where suction pressures are smaller). This K reduces the I factor of the duct  I effective = I/K.\n\nRound duct rings are fabricated from rolled tees, angles, or plates, welded into the shape required. Typically these are designed with ASTM A-36 properties.\n\n===Factors of safety===\n\nTypical duct round plate factor of safety (traditional factor of safety) should be 1.6, because duct plate bending, and buckling is mostly controlled by typical intermediate ring design.\n\nTypical intermediate ring factor of safety should be 1.6, because there is ample evidence in various codes, (API 360, etc.) that intermediate rings designed for wind ovaling and suction pressure combinations are safe.\n\nTypical main support ring factor of safety, if designed by \"Roark\" formulas should be 1.6, (If constructed to the Roark normal 1% out of round standard tolerance) because it can be shown by various methods that these formulas are at least a factor of two, above three D duct ring analysis results etc..\n\nTypical duct elbow factor of safety should be above 1.6, because it can be difficult to show that shipping out of round for elbows corresponds to the normal 1% out of round standard tolerance. (various code and reference notes).\n\n==Round structural conveyor tubes==\n\nRound structural tubes are sometimes used to support and contain conveyors transporting coal, lead concentrate, or other dusty material over county roads, plant access roads, or river barge loading facilities. When tubes are used for these purposes they may be 10'-6\" to 12 foot diameter, and up to 250 foot long, using up to 1/2\" plate and ovaling ring stiffeners at 8 foot (to 20 foot centers). On one such project My firm added L8x8x3/4  at the top 45 degree  location to stiffen the plate near the point of maximum stress for tubes (as per Timoshenko, and others).\n\nSome vendor provide conveyor galleries for the same purpose.\n\n==Rectangular ductwork==\n\nRectangular cement plant ductwork is often 1/4\" (6&nbsp;mm) duct plate, with stiffeners spaced at about 2'-6\", depending on suction pressure and temperature. Thinner plate requires a closer stiffener spacing. The stiffeners are usually considered pinned end. Power plant ductwork can be 5/16\" thick duct plate, with \"fixed end\" W stiffeners at roughly 2'-5\" spacing. Because rectangular duct plate bends, stiffeners are required at reasonably close spacing. Duct plate 3/16\", or thinner, may dishpan, or make noise, and should be avoided.\n\nRectangular duct section properties are calculated from the distance between the upper to lower duct corners of the ductwork The flanges areas are based on the size of corner angles plus duct plate width based on the plate thickness ratio of 16*t. (see AISC structural duct design below) For section properties the \"web\" plate is ignored.\n\nThe typical stiffener spacing for cement plant duct work is usually based on duct plate bending M = W * L * L / 8. This is because using a fixed-fixed condition requires difficult to design plate attachments. Power plant, and other larger ductwork,  usually goes thru the expense of creating \"fixed End\" corner moment. all stiffeners for rectangular ductwork requires consideration of lateral torsional bracing stiffeners.\n\n==Effect of temperature on duct yield stress==\nDucts are usually designed as if the duct plate and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For mild carbon steels (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300&nbsp;\u00b0F is 84% of room temperature stress. At 500&nbsp;\u00b0F, the design yield stress ratio is 77% of room temperature stress. At 700&nbsp;\u00b0F, the design yield stress ratio is about 71% of room temperature stress. Temperatures above 800&nbsp;\u00b0F may cause mild carbon steel to warp. This is because, in this temperature range, the crystal lattice structure of mild carbon steel changes with temperatures above about 800 degrees F (reference, US Steel Plate, elevated temperature steel).\n\nFor ductwork operating above 800 degrees F, duct plate material should resist warping. Either Core-ten or ASTM A304 stainless steel may be used for duct plate between 800&nbsp;\u00b0F and 1200&nbsp;\u00b0F, Core-ten plate is less expensive than stainless steel.\n\nCorten steels have essentially the same yield stress ratios as Corten through 700&nbsp;\u00b0F. At 900&nbsp;\u00b0F, the yield stress ratio is 63%. At 1100&nbsp;\u00b0F, the yield stress ratio is 58% (AISC tables). Corten steels should not be used above 1100&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nUnless the duct and its stiffeners are insulated, the stiffeners can be designed in ASTM A36 steels, even at a duct temperature of 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F. This is because the stiffener temperature is cooler than the duct gas temperature by several hundred degrees (F). Duct stiffener temperatures are assumed to drop about 100&nbsp;\u00b0F per inch of depth (when uninsulated) (no reference available).\n\n==Corrosion and wear resistance==\n\n===Corrosion===\nAs reducing the loss of heat at plants has changed over the years, ductwork now connects more pieces of equipment than ever before. Care needs to be taken to avoid condensation of moisture in plant ductwork. Once condensation occurs, the condensation may absorb CO2, other components in the gas stream, and become corrosive on low carbon steel. Methods to avoid this problem may include\n# Duct insulation\n# specialty steels, such as COR-10 steels or A304 SS or A316L SS,\n# Duct internal coatings. Duct internal coatings are expensive, and may cost more than the stack plate they protect. Uncoated stacks cement plant stacks, with condensation, have been noted to last less than two years.\n\nSulfuric acid attack may require stainless steel ducts, fiberglass ducts, etc.\n\n===Wear resistance===\nMany plant exhaust gasses contain dusts with high wear potential. Typically wear resistant steels are not useful in resisting duct wear, particularly at higher temperatures. Wear resistant steel ducts are hard to fabricate, and refractory coatings are usually less expensive than wear resistant steel ductwork. Each industry may have different approaches to resist duct wear.\n\nCement plant clinker dust is more abrasive than sand. In high temperature ducts, or ducts with wear potential, 2 1/2-inch refractory, is often anchored to the duct plate with V anchors at 6\" O.C. (+/-) to resist a) temperature, or b) wear at elbows or a combination of these effects. Occasionally ceramic tiles or ceramic mortars are anchored to ductwork to resist temperature and wear.\n\nGrain plant hulls are also very abrasive. Sometimes plastic liners are used to resist wear in grain facilities, where temperatures are lower than in mineral processing facilities.\n\n==Expansion joint types==\n\nDuct segments are typically separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen to separate the duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than metal joints. Also metal joints place an additional loads onto duct segments. Metal joints prefer axial movements, and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments.  fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of joint (2010). Metal joints can cost twice this amount.\n\nfabric expansion duct forces are assumed to be 0 #/inch. Metal expansion joint forces for metal joints a 24-inch diameter duct are on the order of 850#/ inch of movement for axial spring rate, and 32,500 #/inch for lateral movement. These coefficients will vary with duct size, joint thickness, and becomes larger for rectangular ducts (based on one recent job).\n\nFabric expansion joint life is about 5 years under field conditions. Many plants prefer access platforms near the joints for replacing the joint fabric.\n\n==Finite element software==\n\nCurrently software is available to model ductwork in 3D. This software needs to be used with care, as the design rules for width to thickness and elbow softening coefficients, etc., may not be input into the design program.\n\n[[File:Duct Y Split & reinforcing.jpg|thumbnail|Duct transition and reinforcing]]\n\n==Drawing presentation and dimensioning==\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}\n\nIt is easy to draw ducts in 3D without correct dimensioning. Drawings should be laid out with:\n\n* Work points, with elevations, and plan dimensioning.\n* Elbow radius, duct diameters, or width and thickness dimensions, elbow tangent dimensions (true view and plan and elevation views)\n* Column grids, dimensions between supports, showing work points\n* Lack of dimensions in 3D generated drawings makes drawings hard to follow.\n* supports need to be coordinated with elevations.\n\n==Special duct loading conditions==\n\nSpecial duct loading conditions may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, and to some extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5&nbsp;ft. to 15&nbsp;ft. in diameter, and 20&nbsp;ft. to 30&nbsp;ft. long. Therefore, access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.\n\n[[File:Large Baghouse Inlet & Outlet Ductwork.jpg|thumbnail|Large baghouse inlet and outlet ductwork]]\n\n==Duct details==\n\nDucts are shipped from fabricating facility to job sites on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating the mode of transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. Flanges may be difficult to design for the duct plate forces. Flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that make their ability to carry forces problematic. Therefore, weld straps (short steel straps) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.\n\n==Various duct photos==\nA close look at the fixed duct support photo shows several properties or round ring supports. There are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from two rolled WTs, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4\" bolts at 6\" nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16\" or 3/8\" angle thicknesses are common.    \n  \nSee above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius is from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo.\n\nThe adjacent photo also shows several principles of process ductwork. It shows a large baghouse inlet ductwork. The inlet duct is tapered to minimize dust dropout. A shallow taper such at this also reduces pressure losses when changing duct diameters. Note the rectangular duct ring spacing is roughly 2'-6\" on center. The round duct is stiffened near each branch duct.\n\n== Resources ==\nThere are several references for process duct work. These references are worked together to review duct design processes. Other references are often used for duct design, but they give similar results. Finite element design of process duct work is possible, but a requirement of design theory and allowable stresses is required to properly interpret the finite element model.\n\n* ASCE - [[Structural design|Structural Design]] of Air & Gas Ducts for Power Stations and Industrial Boiler Applications\n* Roark & Young.

Often the design temperature of the duct, or the abrasiveness of the dust, prevents the use of abrasive resisting steels. In these cases refractory can be anchored inside the duct, or abrasive resisting tiles, with weld nuts, are welded to the inside of the ductwork.\n \nDuct Thermal Movement\n\nDuct steels expand with temperature. Each type of steel may have a different coefficient of thermal expansion, typical mild carbon steels expand with the coefficient of 0.0000065 (See AISC).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{HVAC}}\n\n[[Category:Building engineering]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=April 2011}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=September 2018|Article devolves into jargon near the end, with many style errors, and unclear references to images}}\n'''Process duct work''' conveys large volumes of hot, dusty air from [[Process engineering|processing equipment]] to mills, baghouses to other process equipment. Process [[Duct (industrial exhaust)|duct work]] may be round or rectangular. Although round duct work costs more to fabricate than rectangular duct work, it requires fewer stiffeners and is favored in many applications over rectangular ductwork.\n\nThe air in process duct work may be at ambient conditions or may operate at up to {{convert|900|\u00b0F}}. Process ductwork varies in size from 2&nbsp;ft diameter to 20&nbsp;ft diameter or to perhaps 20&nbsp;ft by 40&nbsp;ft rectangular.\n\nLarge process ductwork may fill with dust, depending on slope, to up to 30% of cross section, which can weigh 2 to 4 tons per linear foot.\n\nRound ductwork is subject to duct suction collapse, and requires stiffeners to minimize this, but is more efficient in material than rectangular duct work.\n\nThere are no comprehensive, design references for process duct work design. The ASCE reference for the design of power plant duct design gives some general guidance on duct design, but does not specifically give designers sufficient information to design process duct work.\n\n==Structural process ductwork==\nStructural process ductwork carries large volumes of high temperature, dusty air, between pieces of process equipment. The design of this ductwork requires an understanding of the interaction of heat softening of [[metal]]s, potential effects of dust buildup in large ductwork, and [[structural design]] principles. There are two basic shapes for structural process ductwork: rectangular and round. Rectangular ductwork is covered by the [[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] \"The Structural Design of Air & Gas Ducts for Process Power Stations and Industrial Applications\".\n\nIn the practical design of primarily round structural process ductwork in the [[cement]], [[Lime (material)|lime]] and [[lead]] industries, the duct size involved ranges from 18&nbsp;inches (45&nbsp;cm) to 30&nbsp;feet (10&nbsp;m). The air temperature may vary from ambient to 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F (515&nbsp;\u00b0C). Process ductwork is subject to large loads due to dust buildup, fan suction pressure, wind, and [[earthquake]] forces. {{As of|2009}} 30&nbsp;ft diameter process ductwork may cost $7,000 per ton. Failure to properly integrate design forces may lead to catastrophic duct collapse. Overdesign of ductwork is expensive.\n\n===Round and rectangular duct structural design===\nThe structural design of ductwork plate is based on buckling of the plate element. Round ductwork plate design is based on diameter to duct plate thickness ratios, and the allowable stresses are contained in multiple references such as ''US Steel Plate'', ASME/ANSI STS-1,SMNACA, ''Tubular Steel Structures'', and other references. In actuality round ductwork bent in bending is approximately 30% stronger than a similar shape in compression, however one uses the same allowable stresses in bending as we do for compression.\n\nRound ducts require typical stiffeners at roughly 3 diameter spacing, or roughly 20&nbsp;ft. O.C. for wind ovaling and fabrication and truck shipping requirements. Round ducts, larger than {{convert|6|ft|6|in}} in diameter (1/4\" plate) require support ring stiffeners. Smaller-diameter ducts may not require support ring stiffeners, but may be designed with saddle supports. When stiffener rings are required they are traditionally designed based on \"Roark\", although this reference is quite conservative.\n\nRound duct elbow allowable stresses are lower than the allowable stresses for straight duct  by a K factor = 1.65/(h 2/3power) where [h = t (duct) * R (elbow) /(r(duct)*r (duct). This equation, or similar equations is found in ''Tubular Steel Structures'' section 9.9.\n\nRectangular ductwork design properties is based on width-to-thickness ratios. This is simplified, normally to width=t/16, from corner elements or corner angle stiffeners, although in reality, the entire duct top & side plate does participate, somewhat in duct section properties.\n\n===Duct logic===\n\nDuct logic is the process of planning for duct thermal movement, combined with planning to minimize duct dust dropout.\n\nDucts move with changes in internal temperature. Ducts are assumed to have the same temperature as their internal gasses, which may be up to 900&nbsp;\u00b0F. If the internal duct temperature exceeds 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F, refractory lining is used to minimize the duct surface temperature. At 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F, ducts may grow approximately 5/8 inch per 10 feet of length. This movement must be carefully planned for, with cloth (or metal) expansion joints at each equipment flange, and one joint per each straight section of ductwork.\n\nSloping ductwork at or above the duct dust angle of repose will minimize dust buildup. Therefore, many ducts carrying high dust loads slope at 30 degrees, or steeper.\n\n===Duct elbow geometry===\n\nTo minimize pressure loss in duct elbows, the typical elbow radius is 1&nbsp;1/2 times the duct diameter. In cases where this elbow radius is not feasible, turning vanes are added to the duct.\n\n[[File:Stack Inlet Transition.jpg|thumbnail|Stack transition at concrete stack]]\n\n===Duct transition and elbow layout===\n\nProcess ductwork is often large (6-foot diameter to 18-foot diameter), carrying large volumes of hot dirty gasses, at velocities of 3000 to 4500 feet per minute. The fans used to move these gasses are also large, 250 to 4000 horsepower. Therefor minimizing duct pressure drop by minimizing turbulence at elbows and transitions is of importance. Duct elbow radius is usually 1&nbsp;1/2 to 2 times the duct size. The side slopes of transitions are typically 10 to 30 degrees.\n\nNote: the duct gas velocity is chosen to minimize duct dust dropout. Cement and lime plant duct velocity at normal operations is 3000 to 3200 foot per minute, lead plant velocities are 4000 to 4500 foot per minute, as the dust is heavier. Other industries, such as grain have lower gas velocities. Higher duct gas velocity may require more powerful fans than lower duct velocities.\n\n===Duct support types===\n* Fixed supports typically are designed to resist lateral movement of the duct. Depending on the support geometry, fixed supports may also resist rotation of the duct art the support.\n* Sliding supports are typically supported on Teflon, (or other material) pads, isolated from the duct so that temperature and dust does not damage the sliding surface.\n* Link supports  are often \"bents\", or braced frames down from the duct support ring (frame) to a foundation or support plane. if the bent is long enough, hinges are not required to allow for duct thermal growth.\n* Rod or hanger supports are similar to link supports, but due to the flexibility of the rod supports, that are easier to design and detail.\n* Guide supports: Often rings inside a structural frame, with angle guides, that allow the duct to grow vertically while restraining the duct laterally for wind loads.\n* Unusual \"support\" conditions (details):\n** Hinges at expansion joints\n** Tension ties across dual fixed supports\n** Designs that allowing duct elbows to flex under unusual support conditions\n** Other unusual design models.\n\n===Duct design loads===\n\nFor cement plant and Lime plant process ductwork, duct loads are a combination of:\n# Duct dead loads: are often simplified (in Cement plant usage) by using duct plate weight, multiplied by 1.15 as a stiffener allowance, as duct stiffeners usually weigh less than 15% times the duct plate weight. Duct stiffener allowance for rectangular power plants ductwork may be 50% to 100% of the duct plate weight.\n# Duct internal dust loads (bottom of duct): which vary considerably with duct slope. These loads need to be approved by the client, but are often used as follows:\nFor duct sloping 0 degrees to 30 degrees, duct internal dust is 25% of duct cross section. For duct sloping 30 degrees to  45 degrees duct dust loads are reduced to 15% of cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping 45 degrees to 85 degrees, duct internal dust is 5% of duct cross section, plus internal duct coating loads. For ducts sloping over 85 degrees.\nBecause of the potential for high dust loading, most process ductwork is run at a 30 to 45 degree slope.\n\n2a) Duct dust loading in non-process ducts (2-foot diameter and smaller), such as conveyor venting ducts are sometimes run horizontally and can be filled to 100% of cross section.\n\n2b) Power plant internal duct dust loads are coordinated with the client, and are sometimes used at 1 to 2 foot of internal ash loadings.\n\n3) Duct internal, coating dust loads, which sometimes are used as a 2\" (50&nbsp;mm) coating of dust on the internal perimeter.\n\n4) Duct suction pressure loads. Most process duct loads have design pressures of 25 inches (600&nbsp;mm) to 40 inches (1000&nbsp;mm) of water pressure. This suction pressure operates to cause suction pressure collapse on the duct side walls. Also this pressure operates perpendicular to the duct \"expansion joints\" to create an additional load on the duct supports that adds to dead, and live loads. Please note: duct pressure loads vary with temperature, as the gas density varies with temperature. A duct pressure of 25 inches of H2O, at room temperature may become 12 inches to 6 inches at duct operating pressures.\n\n5) Duct wind loads\n\n6) Duct Seismic loads\n\n7) Duct Snow loads, normally inconsequential, as snow will melt quickly unless the plant is in shutdown mode.\n\n8) Top of duct dust loads, often used as zero, since plant dust generation is much less now, than in the past.\n\n9) Duct suction pressure loads, act perpendicular to end of duct cross section, and can be significant. For a duct designed for 25\" of water at a startup temperature of 70 degree F, on an 8 foot in diameter duct, this is equal to 8000 pounds at each end of the duct.\n\n[[File:Copy of Duct Fixed Suport.jpg|thumbnail|Duct fixed support]]\n\n==Round ductwork==\n\nThe majority of cement plant process ductwork is round. This is because the round duct shape does not bend between circumferential stiffeners. Therefore bending stiffeners are not required, and round ductwork requires fewer and lighter intermediate stiffeners than rectangular ductwork. Round cement plant duct stiffeners are sometimes about 5% duct plate weight. Rectangular cement plant duct stiffeners are 15 to 20% times duct plate weight. Power plant ductwork is often larger. Power plant ductwork is usually rectangular, with stiffener weights of 50% (or more) times duct plate weight. (this is based on personal experience, and my vary with loads, duct size, and industry standards)\n\nLarge, round process ductwork is usually [[Fabrication (metal)|fabricated]] from 1/4-inch (6&nbsp;mm) mild steel plate, with ovaling stiffening rings at 15 to 20&nbsp;ft (5 to 6 M) on center, regardless of diameter. These lengths allow for resistance to wind ovaling and resistance to out of round when shipping by truck. This also works well with fabricator equipment.\n\nThe typical intermediate rings are designed for wind bending [[Stress (mechanics)|stresses]], reduced as required by the [[Yield (engineering)|yield stress]] reduction at working temperatures. The typical rings are fabricated from rolled steel plate, angles or tees's welded together to create the ring cross section required. Rings are fabricated from any combination of plate, tee or W shape that the shop can roll. Rings are usually mild carbon steel, ASTM A36 plate, or equivalent. The location of ring butt welds should preferably be offset 15 degrees(+/-)from point of maximum stress to minimize the effect of weld porosity on weld allowable stress.\n\nSee [[U.S. Steel|US Steel]] Plate, volume II for empirical ring spacing, and wind bending stress:\nSpacing = Ls = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)]\nSection = p * L (spacing, ft) * Do (ft) * Do (ft)/Fb (20,000 at ambient T)\nThis reference is older, but a good starting point for duct design.\n\nSMACNA, (2ND Edition) chapter 4 has many useful formulas for round ducts, allowable stresses, ring spacing, effect of dust, ice, and live loads. The basic factor of safety for SMACNA, 3, is larger than typically used on typical structural engineering projects, of 1.6.\nUnder SMACNA the critical ring spacing for rings is L = 1.25 * D (ft) sqrt (D(ft)/t(inches)), which is similar to tubular steel structures, L = 3.13 * R sqrt (R/t). In effect, using Spacing = 60 sqrt [Do (ft) * t plate (in) /wind pressure (psf)] is conservative.\n\nAllowable bending and compression stress in ducts can come from several sources.\n\nSee API 560 for design of wind ovaling stiffeners\n\nSee Tubular Steel structures, chapter 2, 9 & 12 for the allowable stresses for thin, round ducts, their allowable stresses, elbows, elbow softening coefficients, and some procedures for the design of duct support rings. These allowable stresses can be verified with select review of chapters of US Steel Plate, Blodgett Design of plate structures, Roark & Young, or API 650.\n\nRound duct support rings are spaced, often at three diameters, or as require at up to about 50&nbsp;ft centers (14 m). At this spacing the main support rings are designed for the sum of [[suction pressure]] stresses & support bending moments.\n\nRound ductwork allowable compressive stress is = 662 /(d/t) +339 * Fy (tubular steel structures, chapter 2). Other reference use similar equations.\n\nDuctwork typical cement plant pressure drops are: 60% to 80% of high temperature process duct work [[pressure drop]] occurs in the process equipment, baghouses, mills and cyclones. Since motor 1 (one) horsepower cost roughly $1000/year (US$) (2005), duct efficiency is important. Minimizing duct pressure drop can reduce plan operating costs. most ductwork, non-equipment pressure drop occurs at transitions and changes of directions (elbows). The bests way to minimize duct pressure drop or to minimize plant operating costs, is to use elbows with an elbow radius to duct radius exceeding 1.5. (For a 15-foot duct, the elbow radius would therefore equal, or exceed, 22.5&nbsp;ft.)\n\nProcess duct pressure drops (US practice) are usually measured in inches of water. A typical duct operates at about - 25 inches (160 psf.) total suction pressure, with roughly 75% of the pressure loss in the bag house, and 10% of pressure lost in duct friction, and 15% (nominal)lost in elbow turbulence. A major consideration of duct design is to minimize duct pressure losses, turbulence, as poor duct geometry, increases turbulence, and increases plant electrical usage.\n\nRound duct work suction pressure collapse, in ducts over 6 feet in diameter, is prevented with rings at supports, and roughly 3 diameter centers.\n\nRound duct support rings are traditionally designed from the formula's found in Roark & Young. However this reference is based on point loads on rings, while actual duct ring loads are based on almost uniform bottom dust. Therefore, these formulars can be shown with Ram, or other analysis methods to have conservatism factor of roughly 2 above the stresses given In Roark. The duct ring force dead, live and dust forces need to be combined with suction pressure stresses. Suction pressure forces concentrate on the rings, as they are the stiffest element present.\n\nRound ductwork elbow allowable stresses are reduced due to the elbow curvature. Various references give similar results for this reduction. Tubular steel structures, Section 9.9 gives the (Beskin) reduction factor of K= 1.65/(h (2/3 power)) where h= t (plate) *R(elbow)/ r (duct) (where suction pressures are smaller). This K reduces the I factor of the duct  I effective = I/K.\n\nRound duct rings are fabricated from rolled tees, angles, or plates, welded into the shape required. Typically these are designed with ASTM A-36 properties.\n\n===Factors of safety===\n\nTypical duct round plate factor of safety (traditional factor of safety) should be 1.6, because duct plate bending, and buckling is mostly controlled by typical intermediate ring design.\n\nTypical intermediate ring factor of safety should be 1.6, because there is ample evidence in various codes, (API 360, etc.) that intermediate rings designed for wind ovaling and suction pressure combinations are safe.\n\nTypical main support ring factor of safety, if designed by \"Roark\" formulas should be 1.6, (If constructed to the Roark normal 1% out of round standard tolerance) because it can be shown by various methods that these formulas are at least a factor of two, above three D duct ring analysis results etc..\n\nTypical duct elbow factor of safety should be above 1.6, because it can be difficult to show that shipping out of round for elbows corresponds to the normal 1% out of round standard tolerance. (various code and reference notes).\n\n==Round structural conveyor tubes==\n\nRound structural tubes are sometimes used to support and contain conveyors transporting coal, lead concentrate, or other dusty material over county roads, plant access roads, or river barge loading facilities. When tubes are used for these purposes they may be 10'-6\" to 12 foot diameter, and up to 250 foot long, using up to 1/2\" plate and ovaling ring stiffeners at 8 foot (to 20 foot centers). On one such project My firm added L8x8x3/4  at the top 45 degree  location to stiffen the plate near the point of maximum stress for tubes (as per Timoshenko, and others).\n\nSome vendor provide conveyor galleries for the same purpose.\n\n==Rectangular ductwork==\n\nRectangular cement plant ductwork is often 1/4\" (6&nbsp;mm) duct plate, with stiffeners spaced at about 2'-6\", depending on suction pressure and temperature. Thinner plate requires a closer stiffener spacing. The stiffeners are usually considered pinned end. Power plant ductwork can be 5/16\" thick duct plate, with \"fixed end\" W stiffeners at roughly 2'-5\" spacing. Because rectangular duct plate bends, stiffeners are required at reasonably close spacing. Duct plate 3/16\", or thinner, may dishpan, or make noise, and should be avoided.\n\nRectangular duct section properties are calculated from the distance between the upper to lower duct corners of the ductwork The flanges areas are based on the size of corner angles plus duct plate width based on the plate thickness ratio of 16*t. (see AISC structural duct design below) For section properties the \"web\" plate is ignored.\n\nThe typical stiffener spacing for cement plant duct work is usually based on duct plate bending M = W * L * L / 8. This is because using a fixed-fixed condition requires difficult to design plate attachments. Power plant, and other larger ductwork,  usually goes thru the expense of creating \"fixed End\" corner moment. all stiffeners for rectangular ductwork requires consideration of lateral torsional bracing stiffeners.\n\n==Effect of temperature on duct yield stress==\nDucts are usually designed as if the duct plate and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For mild carbon steels (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300&nbsp;\u00b0F is 84% of room temperature stress. At 500&nbsp;\u00b0F, the design yield stress ratio is 77% of room temperature stress. At 700&nbsp;\u00b0F, the design yield stress ratio is about 71% of room temperature stress. Temperatures above 800&nbsp;\u00b0F may cause mild carbon steel to warp. This is because, in this temperature range, the crystal lattice structure of mild carbon steel changes with temperatures above about 800 degrees F (reference, US Steel Plate, elevated temperature steel).\n\nFor ductwork operating above 800 degrees F, duct plate material should resist warping. Either Core-ten or ASTM A304 stainless steel may be used for duct plate between 800&nbsp;\u00b0F and 1200&nbsp;\u00b0F, Core-ten plate is less expensive than stainless steel.\n\nCorten steels have essentially the same yield stress ratios as Corten through 700&nbsp;\u00b0F. At 900&nbsp;\u00b0F, the yield stress ratio is 63%. At 1100&nbsp;\u00b0F, the yield stress ratio is 58% (AISC tables). Corten steels should not be used above 1100&nbsp;\u00b0F.\n\nUnless the duct and its stiffeners are insulated, the stiffeners can be designed in ASTM A36 steels, even at a duct temperature of 1000&nbsp;\u00b0F. This is because the stiffener temperature is cooler than the duct gas temperature by several hundred degrees (F). Duct stiffener temperatures are assumed to drop about 100&nbsp;\u00b0F per inch of depth (when uninsulated) (no reference available).\n\n==Corrosion and wear resistance==\n\n===Corrosion===\nAs reducing the loss of heat at plants has changed over the years, ductwork now connects more pieces of equipment than ever before. Care needs to be taken to avoid condensation of moisture in plant ductwork. Once condensation occurs, the condensation may absorb CO2, other components in the gas stream, and become corrosive on low carbon steel. Methods to avoid this problem may include\n# Duct insulation\n# specialty steels, such as COR-10 steels or A304 SS or A316L SS,\n# Duct internal coatings. Duct internal coatings are expensive, and may cost more than the stack plate they protect. Uncoated stacks cement plant stacks, with condensation, have been noted to last less than two years.\n\nSulfuric acid attack may require stainless steel ducts, fiberglass ducts, etc.\n\n===Wear resistance===\nMany plant exhaust gasses contain dusts with high wear potential. Typically wear resistant steels are not useful in resisting duct wear, particularly at higher temperatures. Wear resistant steel ducts are hard to fabricate, and refractory coatings are usually less expensive than wear resistant steel ductwork. Each industry may have different approaches to resist duct wear.\n\nCement plant clinker dust is more abrasive than sand. In high temperature ducts, or ducts with wear potential, 2 1/2-inch refractory, is often anchored to the duct plate with V anchors at 6\" O.C. (+/-) to resist a) temperature, or b) wear at elbows or a combination of these effects. Occasionally ceramic tiles or ceramic mortars are anchored to ductwork to resist temperature and wear.\n\nGrain plant hulls are also very abrasive. Sometimes plastic liners are used to resist wear in grain facilities, where temperatures are lower than in mineral processing facilities.\n\n==Expansion joint types==\n\nDuct segments are typically separated with metal or fabric expansion joints. These joints are designed and detailed for the duct suction pressure, temperatures, and movements between duct segments. Fabric joints are often chosen to separate the duct segments because they usually cost 40% less than metal joints. Also metal joints place an additional loads onto duct segments. Metal joints prefer axial movements, and provide significant lateral loads onto duct segments.  fabric joints cost $100 to $200 per square foot of joint (2010). Metal joints can cost twice this amount.\n\nfabric expansion duct forces are assumed to be 0 #/inch. Metal expansion joint forces for metal joints a 24-inch diameter duct are on the order of 850#/ inch of movement for axial spring rate, and 32,500 #/inch for lateral movement. These coefficients will vary with duct size, joint thickness, and becomes larger for rectangular ducts (based on one recent job).\n\nFabric expansion joint life is about 5 years under field conditions. Many plants prefer access platforms near the joints for replacing the joint fabric.\n\n==Finite element software==\n\nCurrently software is available to model ductwork in 3D. This software needs to be used with care, as the design rules for width to thickness and elbow softening coefficients, etc., may not be input into the design program.\n\n[[File:Duct Y Split & reinforcing.jpg|thumbnail|Duct transition and reinforcing]]\n\n==Drawing presentation and dimensioning==\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2018|section}}\n\nIt is easy to draw ducts in 3D without correct dimensioning. Drawings should be laid out with:\n\n* Work points, with elevations, and plan dimensioning.\n* Elbow radius, duct diameters, or width and thickness dimensions, elbow tangent dimensions (true view and plan and elevation views)\n* Column grids, dimensions between supports, showing work points\n* Lack of dimensions in 3D generated drawings makes drawings hard to follow.\n* supports need to be coordinated with elevations.\n\n==Special duct loading conditions==\n\nSpecial duct loading conditions may occur outside of dead, live, dust and temperature conditions. Ductwork associated with coal mills, coke grinding facilities, and to some extent grain processing facilities, may be subject to explosive dusts. Ductwork designed for explosive dust is typically designed for 50 psi internal pressure, and will typically have one explosion relief one vent per duct section. the likelihood of a dust explosion on an indirect coal mill system is 100%, over time. This can generate a plum of fire 5&nbsp;ft. to 15&nbsp;ft. in diameter, and 20&nbsp;ft. to 30&nbsp;ft. long. Therefore, access to areas surrounding explosion vents shall limit personal access with locked access.\n\n[[File:Large Baghouse Inlet & Outlet Ductwork.jpg|thumbnail|Large baghouse inlet and outlet ductwork]]\n\n==Duct details==\n\nDucts are shipped from fabricating facility to job sites on trucks, by rail, or on barges in lengths accommodating the mode of transport, often in 20 foot sections. These sections are connected with flanges, or weld straps. Flanges are provided at expansion joints, or to join low stress duct sections. Flanges may be difficult to design for the duct plate forces. Flange gaskets add flexibility to the flanges that make their ability to carry forces problematic. Therefore, weld straps (short steel straps) are commonly used for higher stress duct plate connections.\n\n==Various duct photos==\nA close look at the fixed duct support photo shows several properties or round ring supports. There are stiffeners at roughly 60 degrees on center. This duct ring is fabricated from two rolled WTs, welded at the center. This is a smaller duct, with light loads, so that the bottom flange was slightly modified by support clearance requirements. A small gap is shown for placing the duct PTFE slide bearing, although a fixed support could also be inserted in this gap. In the background of this photo is a duct flange. The duct flange normally has 3/4\" bolts at 6\" nominal; spacing. Duct flange angle thickness needs to be designed for duct plate tensile stresses, as flanges will bend. 5/16\" or 3/8\" angle thicknesses are common.    \n  \nSee above photo of round duct elbows, transitions, and stiffeners. The duct elbow radius is from 1 1/2 to 2 times the duct diameter. The round duct has ovaling, and shipping rings at 20 foot nominal spacing, and larger support rings at supports. The Y split has suction stiffeners at the duct intersection. Note the 3000 HP fan inlet transition and stack inlet transition also shown in this photo.\n\nThe adjacent photo also shows several principles of process ductwork. It shows a large baghouse inlet ductwork. The inlet duct is tapered to minimize dust dropout. A shallow taper such at this also reduces pressure losses when changing duct diameters. Note the rectangular duct ring spacing is roughly 2'-6\" on center. The round duct is stiffened near each branch duct.\n\n== Resources ==\nThere are several references for process duct work. These references are worked together to review duct design processes. Other references are often used for duct design, but they give similar results. Finite element design of process duct work is possible, but a requirement of design theory and allowable stresses is required to properly interpret the finite element model.\n\n* ASCE - [[Structural design|Structural Design]] of Air & Gas Ducts for Power Stations and Industrial Boiler Applications\n* Roark & Young.

Often the design temperature of the duct, or the abrasiveness of the dust, prevents the use of abrasive resisting steels. In these cases refractory can be anchored inside the duct, or abrasive resisting tiles, with weld nuts, are welded to the inside of the ductwork.\n \nDuct Thermal Movement\n\nDuct steels expand with temperature. Each type of steel may have a different coefficient of thermal expansion, typical mild carbon steels expand with the coefficient of 0.0000065 (See AISC).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{HVAC}}\n\n[[Category:Building engineering]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDuct transition and elbow layout:Typo fixing, replaced: Therefor \u2192 Therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_duct_work"}

King, ''Silk and Empire''</ref>\n\n==Origins and influences==\n===Design reform===\nThe Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid-19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items that they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]] which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial, and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used. Art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] writes that the exhibits showed \"ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface\", as well as displaying \"vulgarity in detail\".<ref name=pevsner/> Design reform began with Exhibition organizers [[Henry Cole]] (1808\u20131882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809\u20131874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820\u20131877), and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804\u20131888),<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&A, \"Wallpaper Design Reform\"]</ref> all of whom deprecated excessive ornament and impractical or badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organizers were \"unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that \"the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter\" produced \"novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analyzed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for \"more logic in the application of decoration.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein, such as Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' (\"Science, Industry and Art\") (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876), and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}\n\nJones declared that ornament \"must be secondary to the thing decorated\", that there must be \"fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented\", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns \"suggestive of anything but a level or plain\".<ref>Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''</ref> A fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, whereas these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that \"style\" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. \"''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}\n\n[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|upright|''The Nature of Gothic'' by John Ruskin, printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in 1892 in his [[Golden Type]] inspired by 15th century printer [[Nicolas Jenson]]. This chapter from ''The Stones of Venice'' was a sort of manifesto for the Arts and Crafts movement.]]\n\nHowever, the design reformers of the mid-19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement. They were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticize industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform, and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.\n\n===A. W. N. Pugin===\n[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house \"The Grange\" in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement.]]\n\nSome of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A. W. N. Pugin]] (1812\u20131852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he advocated truth to material, structure, and function, as did the Arts and Crafts artists.<ref name=V&A /> Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society with the Middle Ages,<ref name=hill>Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007</ref> such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor\u2014a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris, and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that he \"reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmanship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail.\" She describes the spare furnishings which he specified for a building in 1841, \"rush chairs, oak tables\", as \"the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo.\"<ref name=hill />\n\n===John Ruskin===\nThe Arts and Crafts philosophy was derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s \nsocial criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of its work. Ruskin considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be \"servile labour\", and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things that they made. He believed factory-made works to be \"dishonest,\" and that handwork and craftsmanship merged dignity with labor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts-crafts.com/archive/jruskin.shtml|title=John Ruskin - Artist Philosopher Writer - Arts & Crafts Leader|website=www.arts-crafts.com|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself.<ref name=sarsby>Jacqueline Sarsby\" Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds\", ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375\u2013397</ref> William Morris's idea of \"handicraft\" was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.<ref name=pye>David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press,\n 1968</ref>\n\n===William Morris===\n[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, the main influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement]]\n[[William Morris]] (1834\u20131896) was the towering figure in late 19th century design and the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the movement grew out of ideas that he developed in the 1850s with the [[Birmingham Set]] \u2013 a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]] including [[Edward Burne-Jones]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96\u201397}} By 1855, they had discovered Ruskin. The medievalism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In Burne-Jones' words, they intended to \"wage Holy warfare against the age\".{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}\n\n[[File:The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in Bexleyheath, designed by Philip Webb and completed in 1860; one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts Movement<ref>[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, \"Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris\"]</ref>]]\n\nMorris began experimenting with various crafts and designing furniture and interiors.{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging. Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that \"without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life\".{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}\n\n[[File:Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris & Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]\n\nIn 1861, Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modeling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colors. His patterns were based on flora and fauna, and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. Some were deliberately left unfinished in order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, thus creating a rustic appearance. Morris strove to unite all the arts within the decoration of the home, emphasizing nature and simplicity of form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm|title=The Arts and Crafts Movement in America|date=2019|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Social and design principles==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |  \nUnlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819\u20131900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'\n\n\u2014 Alan Crawford, \"[[William Arthur Smith Benson|W. A. S. Benson]], Machinery, and the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain\"<ref>Alan Crawford, \"W. A. S. Benson, Machinery, and the Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain\", ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', Vol. 24, Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection (2002), pp. 94\u2013117</ref>\n|}\n\n===Critique of industry===\nWilliam Morris shared Ruskin's critique of industrial society and at one time or another attacked the modern factory, the use of machinery, the division of labour, capitalism and the loss of traditional craft methods. But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was \"altogether an evil\",<ref name=pevsner/> but at others times, he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines.<ref>Graeme Shankland, \"William Morris - Designer\", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}</ref> Morris said that in a \"true society\", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.<ref>William Morris, \"Useful Work versus Useless Toil\", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}</ref> Fiona MacCarthy says that \"unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed.\"{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}\n\nMorris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand<ref name=pevsner/> and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. \"Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work\", he wrote, \"the Middle Ages was a period of greatness in the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches&nbsp;\u2013 each one a masterpiece&nbsp;\u2014 were built by unsophisticated peasants.\"<ref name=mingei/> Medieval art was the model for much of Arts and Crafts design, and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.\n\nMorris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. For example, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&nbsp;R. Ashbee]], a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, said in 1888, that, \"We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered.\"<ref name=pevsner/><ref>Ashbee, C.&nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.</ref> After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that \"Modern civilization rests on machinery\",<ref name=pevsner/> but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called \"mechanism\", saying that \"the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares.\"<ref>\"C.&nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)</ref>  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)\n\nMorris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.<ref>[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]</ref>  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that \"The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms.\"<ref name=floud>Peter Floud, \"The crafts then and now\", ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127</ref> The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived \"not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]\".<ref name=floud/>\n\n===Socialism===\nMany of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], and [[A.H.Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s, Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen called the Guild of Handicraft in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].<ref name=crawford/> Those adherents who were not socialists, such as [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],<ref name=sarsby/> advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]] was another successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer who was not a socialist, despite his long friendship with Crane.\n\n===Association with other reform movements===\nIn Britain the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&A, \"Victorian Dress at the V&A\"]</ref> [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]<ref name=maccarthy2014>Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}</ref> and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of \"the Simple Life\".<ref>Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981</ref> In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://64.130.23.120/history-of-art/arts-and-crafts.htm | title=Arts and Crafts movement | accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nMorris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris & Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.\n\nThe spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}\n\nIn 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}\n\nIn 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}\n\nIn 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]].

The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.<ref name=V&A/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129132321/http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |archive-date=2010-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[C.F.A.

The architecture of the style is represented by the [[Honan Chapel]] (1916) in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the grounds of [[University College Cork]]. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks ([[Malahide Castle]] estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.\n\n===Scotland===\n\nThe beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808\u201377). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838\u201391), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.<ref>M.

In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), the discovery of the vernacular was associated with the assertion of national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was to be found in the medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.<ref>Andrej Szczerski, \"Central Europe\", in Karen Livingstone and Linda Parry (eds.), ''International Arts and Crafts'', London: V&A Publications, 2005</ref>\n\n[[File:Till en liten vira.jpg|thumb|The Swedish artists [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Karin Berg\u00f6\u00f6 Larsson]] were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement when designing their home.]]\nWidely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like [[Henry van de Velde]] and styles such as [[Art Nouveau]], the Dutch [[De Stijl]] group, [[Vienna Secession]], and eventually the [[Bauhaus]] style.

The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Association of Craftsmen) was formed in 1907 as an association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists to improve the global competitiveness of German businesses and became an important element in the development of [[modern architecture]] and industrial design through its advocacy of standardized production. However, its leading members, van de Velde and [[Hermann Muthesius]], had conflicting opinions about standardization. Muthesius believed that it was essential were Germany to become a leading nation in trade and culture. Van de Velde, representing a more traditional Arts and Crafts attitude, believed that artists would forever \"protest against the imposition of orders or standardization,\" and that \"The artist ... will never, of his own accord, submit to a discipline which imposes on him a canon or a type.\" {{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=189}}\n\nIn Finland, an idealistic artists' colony in [[Helsinki]] was designed by [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]],<ref name=\"grove\"/> who worked in the [[National Romantic style]], akin to the British [[Gothic Revival]].\n\nIn [[Hungary]], under the influence of Ruskin and Morris, a group of artists and architects, including [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]], [[Alad\u00e1r K\u00f6r\u00f6sf\u0151i-Kriesch]] and Ede Toroczkai Wigand, discovered the [[folk art]] and vernacular architecture of [[Transylvania]].

These included the \"Craftsman\"-style architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts such as designs promoted by [[Gustav Stickley]] in his magazine, ''The Craftsman'' and designs produced on the Roycroft campus as publicized in Elbert Hubbard's ''The Fra''.  Both men used their magazines as a vehicle to promote the goods produced with the Craftsman workshop in Eastwood, NY and Elbert Hubbard's [[Roycroft]] campus in [[East Aurora, NY]]. A host of imitators of Stickley's furniture (the designs of which are often mislabelled the \"[[American Craftsman|Mission Style]]\") included three companies established by his brothers.\n\nThe terms ''[[American Craftsman]]'' or ''Craftsman style'' are often used to denote the style of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts that prevailed between the dominant eras of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] in the US, or approximately the period from 1910 to 1925.  The movement was particularly notable for the professional opportunities it opened up for women as artisans, designers and entrepreneurs who founded and ran, or were employed by, such successful enterprises as the [[Kalo Shops]], [[Rookwood Pottery]], and [[Tiffany Studios]]. In Canada, the term ''Arts and Crafts'' predominates, but ''Craftsman'' is also recognized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Monica Obniski, \"The Arts and Crafts Movement in America\" |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=1972-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Europeans tried to recreate the virtuous crafts being replaced by industrialisation, Americans tried to establish a new type of virtue to replace heroic craft production: well-decorated middle-class homes. They claimed that the simple but refined aesthetics of Arts and Crafts decorative arts would ennoble the new experience of industrial consumerism, making individuals more rational and society more harmonious. The American Arts and Crafts movement was the aesthetic counterpart of its contemporary political philosophy, [[progressivism]]. Characteristically, when the Arts and Crafts Society began in October 1897 in Chicago, it was at [[Hull House]], one of the first American [[settlement house]]s for social reform.<ref name=\"Obniski\">Obniski.</ref>\n\nArts and Crafts ideals disseminated in America through journal and newspaper writing were supplemented by societies that sponsored lectures.<ref name=\"Obniski\"/> The first was organized in Boston in the late 1890s, when a group of influential architects, designers, and educators determined to bring to America the design reforms begun in Britain by William Morris; they met to organize an exhibition of contemporary craft objects. The first meeting was held on January 4, 1897, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston to organize an exhibition of contemporary crafts. When craftsmen, consumers, and manufacturers realised the aesthetic and technical potential of the applied arts, the process of design reform in Boston started. Present at this meeting were General Charles Loring, Chairman of the Trustees of the MFA; [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and [[Denman Ross]], collectors, writers and MFA trustees; Ross Turner, painter; [[Sylvester Baxter]], art critic for the ''Boston Transcript''; Howard Baker, [[Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.|A.W. Longfellow Jr.]]; and Ralph Clipson Sturgis, architect.\n\nThe first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition began on April 5, 1897, at [[Copley Hall, Boston]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring more than 1000 objects made by 160 craftsmen, half of whom were women. Some of the advocates of the exhibit were Langford Warren, founder of Harvard's School of Architecture; Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt; Arthur Astor Carey and Edwin Mead, social reformers; and [[Will H. Bradley]], graphic designer. The success of this exhibition resulted in the incorporation of The Society of Arts and Crafts (SAC), on June 28, 1897, with a mandate to \"develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts.\" The 21 founders claimed to be interested in more than sales, and emphasized encouragement of artists to produce work with the best quality of workmanship and design. This mandate was soon expanded into a credo, possibly written by the SAC's first president, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], which read:\n\n<blockquote>This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.<ref>Brandt, Beverly Kay.

Dow, who taught at [[Columbia University]] and founded the Ipswich Summer School of Art, published in 1899 his landmark ''Composition'', which distilled into a distinctly American approach the essence of Japanese composition, combining into a decorative harmonious amalgam three elements: simplicity of line, \"notan\" (the balance of light and dark areas), and symmetry of color.<ref name=\"green\">{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=Nancy E. and Jessie Poesch| title=Arthur Wesley Dow and American arts & crafts| date=1999|publisher=Harry N.

This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.<ref>[http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf Charles Harvey and Jon Press, \"William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction\", ''Journal of the William Morris Society''  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132211/http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf |date=2015-01-05 }}</ref> The first school to make this change was the [[Birmingham Art School|Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts]], which \"led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper).

Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the [[Manchester School of Art]] and subsequently the [[Royal College of Art]]; F.M. Simpson, [[Robert Anning Bell]] and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at [[Liverpool School of Art]]; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; [[W. R. Lethaby]] and [[George Frampton]] were inspectors and advisors to the [[London County Council]]'s (LCC) education board and in 1896, largely as a result of their work, the LCC set up the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and made them joint principals.<ref name=macdonald/> Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=179}} Shortly after its foundation, the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.\n\nAs head of the Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane tried to reform it along more practical lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]], who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan.

King, ''Silk and Empire''</ref>\n\n==Origins and influences==\n===Design reform===\nThe Arts and Crafts movement emerged from the attempt to reform design and decoration in mid-19th century Britain. It was a reaction against a perceived decline in standards that the reformers associated with machinery and factory production. Their critique was sharpened by the items that they saw in [[the Great Exhibition of 1851]] which they considered to be excessively ornate, artificial, and ignorant of the qualities of the materials used. Art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] writes that the exhibits showed \"ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, the integrity of the surface\", as well as displaying \"vulgarity in detail\".<ref name=pevsner/> Design reform began with Exhibition organizers [[Henry Cole]] (1808\u20131882), [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] (1809\u20131874), [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] (1820\u20131877), and [[Richard Redgrave]] (1804\u20131888),<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/w/wallpaper-design-reform/ V&A, \"Wallpaper Design Reform\"]</ref> all of whom deprecated excessive ornament and impractical or badly made things.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The organizers were \"unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} Owen Jones, for example, complained that \"the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter\" produced \"novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=20}} From these criticisms of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's ''Supplementary Report on Design'' (1852) analyzed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for \"more logic in the application of decoration.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} Other works followed in a similar vein, such as Wyatt's ''Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century'' (1853), [[Gottfried Semper]]'s ''Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst'' (\"Science, Industry and Art\") (1852), [[Ralph Wornum]]'s ''Analysis of Ornament'' (1856), Redgrave's ''Manual of Design'' (1876), and Jones's ''Grammar of Ornament'' (1856).{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}} The ''Grammar of Ornament'' was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=21}}\n\nJones declared that ornament \"must be secondary to the thing decorated\", that there must be \"fitness in the ornament to the thing ornamented\", and that wallpapers and carpets must not have any patterns \"suggestive of anything but a level or plain\".<ref>Quoted in Nikolaus Pevsner, ''Pioneers of Modern Design''</ref> A fabric or wallpaper in the Great Exhibition might be decorated with a natural motif made to look as real as possible, whereas these writers advocated flat and simplified natural motifs. Redgrave insisted that \"style\" demanded sound construction before ornamentation, and a proper awareness of the quality of materials used. \"''Utility'' must have precedence over ornamentation.\"{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}}\n\n[[File:Kelmscott Press - The Nature of Gothic by John Ruskin (first page).jpg|thumb|upright|''The Nature of Gothic'' by John Ruskin, printed by William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in 1892 in his [[Golden Type]] inspired by 15th century printer [[Nicolas Jenson]]. This chapter from ''The Stones of Venice'' was a sort of manifesto for the Arts and Crafts movement.]]\n\nHowever, the design reformers of the mid-19th century did not go as far as the designers of the Arts and Crafts Movement. They were more concerned with ornamentation than construction, they had an incomplete understanding of methods of manufacture,{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=22}} and they did not criticize industrial methods as such. By contrast, the Arts and Crafts movement was as much a movement of social reform as design reform, and its leading practitioners did not separate the two.\n\n===A. W. N. Pugin===\n[[File:The Grange, Ramsgate 1.jpg|thumb|right|Pugin's house \"The Grange\" in Ramsgate, 1843. Its simplified Gothic style, adapted to domestic building, helped shape the architecture of the Arts and Crafts Movement.]]\n\nSome of the ideas of the movement were anticipated by [[A. W. N. Pugin]] (1812\u20131852), a leader in the [[Gothic revival architecture|Gothic revival in architecture]]. For example, he advocated truth to material, structure, and function, as did the Arts and Crafts artists.<ref name=V&A /> Pugin articulated the tendency of social critics to compare the faults of modern society with the Middle Ages,<ref name=hill>Rosemary Hill, ''God's Architect: Pugin and the Building of Romantic Britain'', London: Allen Lane, 2007</ref> such as the sprawling growth of cities and the treatment of the poor\u2014a tendency that became routine with Ruskin, Morris, and the Arts and Crafts movement. His book ''Contrasts'' (1836) drew examples of bad modern buildings and town planning in contrast with good medieval examples, and his biographer [[Rosemary Hill]] notes that he \"reached conclusions, almost in passing, about the importance of craftsmanship and tradition in architecture that it would take the rest of the century and the combined efforts of Ruskin and Morris to work out in detail.\" She describes the spare furnishings which he specified for a building in 1841, \"rush chairs, oak tables\", as \"the Arts and Crafts interior in embryo.\"<ref name=hill />\n\n===John Ruskin===\nThe Arts and Crafts philosophy was derived in large measure from [[John Ruskin]]'s social criticism, which related the moral and social health of a nation to the qualities of its architecture and to the nature of its work. Ruskin considered the sort of mechanized production and division of labour that had been created in the [[industrial revolution]] to be \"servile labour\", and he thought that a healthy and moral society required independent workers who designed the things that they made. He believed factory-made works to be \"dishonest,\" and that handwork and craftsmanship merged dignity with labor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arts-crafts.com/archive/jruskin.shtml|title=John Ruskin - Artist Philosopher Writer - Arts & Crafts Leader|website=www.arts-crafts.com|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref> His followers favoured craft production over industrial manufacture and were concerned about the loss of traditional skills, but they were more troubled by the effects of the [[factory system]] than by machinery itself.<ref name=sarsby>Jacqueline Sarsby\" Alfred Powell: Idealism and Realism in the Cotswolds\", ''Journal of Design History'', Vol. 10, No. 4, pp. 375\u2013397</ref> William Morris's idea of \"handicraft\" was essentially work without any division of labour rather than work without any sort of machinery.<ref name=pye>David Pye, ''The Nature and Art of Workmanship'', Cambridge University Press, 1968</ref>\n\n===William Morris===\n[[File:William Morris age 53.jpg|thumb|upright|William Morris, the main influence on the Arts and Crafts Movement]]\n[[William Morris]] (1834\u20131896) was the towering figure in late 19th century design and the main influence on the Arts and Crafts movement. The aesthetic and social vision of the movement grew out of ideas that he developed in the 1850s with the [[Birmingham Set]] \u2013 a group of students at the [[University of Oxford]] including [[Edward Burne-Jones]], who combined a love of [[Romantic literature]] with a commitment to social reform.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|pp=96\u201397}} By 1855, they had discovered Ruskin. The medievalism of [[Mallory]]'s ''[[Morte d'Arthur]]'' set the standard for their early style.{{sfn|Wildman|1998|p=49}} In Burne-Jones' words, they intended to \"wage Holy warfare against the age\".{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=97}}\n\n[[File:The Red House, Bexleyheath.JPG|thumb|William Morris's [[Red House (London)|Red House]] in Bexleyheath, designed by Philip Webb and completed in 1860; one of the most significant buildings of the Arts and Crafts Movement<ref>[https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/red-house#Overview National Trust, \"Iconic Arts and Crafts home of William Morris\"]</ref>]]\n\nMorris began experimenting with various crafts and designing furniture and interiors.{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} He was personally involved in manufacture as well as design,{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}} which was the hallmark of the Arts and Crafts movement. Ruskin had argued that the separation of the intellectual act of design from the manual act of physical creation was both socially and aesthetically damaging. Morris further developed this idea, insisting that no work should be carried out in his workshops before he had personally mastered the appropriate techniques and materials, arguing that \"without dignified, creative human occupation people became disconnected from life\".{{sfn|MacCarthy|2009}}\n\n[[File:Morris and Company Weaving at Merton Abbey.jpg|thumb|The weaving shed in Morris & Co's factory at [[Merton (historic parish)|Merton]], which opened in the 1880s]]\n\nIn 1861, Morris began making furniture and decorative objects commercially, modeling his designs on medieval styles and using bold forms and strong colors. His patterns were based on flora and fauna, and his products were inspired by the vernacular or domestic traditions of the British countryside. Some were deliberately left unfinished in order to display the beauty of the materials and the work of the craftsman, thus creating a rustic appearance. Morris strove to unite all the arts within the decoration of the home, emphasizing nature and simplicity of form.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm|title=The Arts and Crafts Movement in America|date=2019|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2019-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Social and design principles==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"1\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |  \nUnlike their counterparts in the United States, most Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain had strong, slightly incoherent, negative feelings about machinery. They thought of 'the craftsman' as free, creative, and working with his hands, 'the machine' as soulless, repetitive, and inhuman. These contrasting images derive in part from John Ruskin's (1819\u20131900) ''The Stones of Venice'', an architectural history of Venice that contains a powerful denunciation of modern industrialism to which Arts and Crafts designers returned again and again. Distrust for the machine lay behind the many little workshops that turned their backs on the industrial world around 1900, using preindustrial techniques to create what they called 'crafts.'\n\n\u2014 Alan Crawford, \"[[William Arthur Smith Benson|W.

But his attitude to machinery was inconsistent. He said at one point that production by machinery was \"altogether an evil\",<ref name=pevsner/> but at others times, he was willing to commission work from manufacturers who were able to meet his standards with the aid of machines.<ref>Graeme Shankland, \"William Morris - Designer\", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}</ref> Morris said that in a \"true society\", where neither luxuries nor cheap trash were made, machinery could be improved and used to reduce the hours of labour.<ref>William Morris, \"Useful Work versus Useless Toil\", in Asa Briggs (ed.) ''William Morris: Selected Writings and Designs'', Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1980 {{ISBN|0-14-020521-7}}</ref> Fiona MacCarthy says that \"unlike later zealots like [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], William Morris had no practical objections to the use of machinery ''per se'' so long as the machines produced the quality he needed.\"{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|p=351}}\n\nMorris insisted that the artist should be a craftsman-designer working by hand<ref name=pevsner/> and advocated a society of free craftspeople, such as he believed had existed during the Middle Ages. \"Because craftsmen took pleasure in their work\", he wrote, \"the Middle Ages was a period of greatness in the art of the common people. ... The treasures in our museums now are only the common utensils used in households of that age, when hundreds of medieval churches&nbsp;\u2013 each one a masterpiece&nbsp;\u2014 were built by unsophisticated peasants.\"<ref name=mingei/> Medieval art was the model for much of Arts and Crafts design, and medieval life, literature and building was idealised by the movement.\n\nMorris's followers also had differing views about machinery and the factory system. For example, [[Charles Robert Ashbee|C.&nbsp;R. Ashbee]], a central figure in the Arts and Crafts Movement, said in 1888, that, \"We do not reject the machine, we welcome it. But we would desire to see it mastered.\"<ref name=pevsner/><ref>Ashbee, C.&nbsp;R., ''A Few Chapters on Workshop Construction and Citizenship'', London, 1894.</ref> After unsuccessfully pitting his Guild and School of Handicraft guild against modern methods of manufacture, he acknowledged that \"Modern civilization rests on machinery\",<ref name=pevsner/> but he continued to criticize the deleterious effects of what he called \"mechanism\", saying that \"the production of certain mechanical commodities is as bad for the national health as is the production of slave-grown cane or child-sweated wares.\"<ref>\"C.&nbsp;R. Ashbee, ''Should We Stop Teaching Art?'', New York and London: Garland, 1978, p.12 (Facsimile of the 1911 edition)</ref>  [[William Arthur Smith Benson]], on the other hand, had no qualms about adapting the Arts and Crafts style to metalwork produced under industrial conditions. (See quotation box.)\n\nMorris and his followers believed the division of labour on which modern industry depended was undesirable, but the extent to which every design should be carried out by the designer was a matter for debate and disagreement. Not all Arts and Crafts artists carried out every stage in the making of goods themselves, and it was only in the twentieth century that that became essential to the definition of craftsmanship. Although Morris was famous for getting hands-on experience himself of many crafts (including weaving, dying, printing, calligraphy and embroidery), he did not regard the separation of designer and executant in his factory as problematic. Walter Crane, a close political associate of Morris's, took an unsympathetic view of the division of labour on both moral and artistic grounds, and strongly advocated that designing and making should come from the same hand. Lewis Foreman Day, a friend and contemporary of Crane's, as unstinting as Crane in his admiration of Morris, disagreed strongly with Crane. He thought that the separation of design and execution was not only inevitable in the modern world, but also that only that sort of specialisation allowed the best in design and the best in making.<ref>[https://marshallcolman.blogspot.co.uk/2017/06/designer-and-executant-argument-between.html Designer and Executant: An Argument Between Walter Crane and Lewis Foreman Day]</ref>  Few of the founders of the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]] insisted that the designer should also be the maker. Peter Floud, writing in the 1950s, said that \"The founders of the Society ... never executed their own designs, but invariably turned them over to commercial firms.\"<ref name=floud>Peter Floud, \"The crafts then and now\", ''The Studio'', 1953, p.127</ref> The idea that the designer should be the maker and the maker the designer derived \"not from Morris or early Arts and Crafts teaching, but rather from the second-generation elaboration doctrine worked out in the first decade of [the twentieth] century by men such as [[W. R. Lethaby]]\".<ref name=floud/>\n\n===Socialism===\nMany of the Arts and Crafts Movement designers were socialists, including Morris, [[T. J. Cobden Sanderson]], [[Walter Crane]], C.R.Ashbee, [[Philip Webb]], [[Charles Joseph Faulkner|Charles Faulkner]], and [[A.H.Mackmurdo]].{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=109}} In the early 1880s, Morris was spending more of his time on socialist propaganda than on designing and making.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=640-663}} Ashbee established a community of craftsmen called the Guild of Handicraft in east London, later moving to [[Chipping Campden]].<ref name=crawford/> Those adherents who were not socialists, such as [[Alfred Hoare Powell]],<ref name=sarsby/> advocated a more humane and personal relationship between employer and employee. [[Lewis Foreman Day]] was another successful and influential Arts and Crafts designer who was not a socialist, despite his long friendship with Crane.\n\n===Association with other reform movements===\nIn Britain the movement was associated with [[dress reform]],<ref>[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/v/victorian-dress-at-v-and-a/ V&A, \"Victorian Dress at the V&A\"]</ref> [[ruralism]], the [[garden city movement]]<ref name=maccarthy2014>Fiona MacCarthy, ''Anarchy and Beauty: William Morris and his Legacy 1860-1960'', London: National Portrait Gallery, 2014 {{ISBN|978 185514 484 2}}</ref> and [[Cecil Sharp|the folk-song revival]]. All were linked, in some degree, by the ideal of \"the Simple Life\".<ref>Fiona McCarthy. ''The Simple Life'', Lund Humphries, 1981</ref> In continental Europe the movement was associated with the preservation of national traditions in building, the applied arts, domestic design and costume.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://64.130.23.120/history-of-art/arts-and-crafts.htm | title=Arts and Crafts movement | accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nMorris's designs quickly became popular, attracting interest when his company's work was exhibited at the [[1862 International Exhibition]] in London. Much of Morris & Co's early work was for churches and Morris won important interior design commissions at [[St James's Palace]] and the [[South Kensington Museum]] (now the Victoria and Albert Museum). Later his work became popular with the middle and upper classes, despite his wish to create a democratic art, and by the end of the 19th century, Arts and Crafts design in houses and domestic interiors was the dominant style in Britain, copied in products made by conventional industrial methods.\n\nThe spread of Arts and Crafts ideas during the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in the establishment of many associations and craft communities, although Morris had little to do with them because of his preoccupation with socialism at the time. A hundred and thirty Arts and Crafts organisations were formed in Britain, most between 1895 and 1905.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=602|}}\n\nIn 1881, [[Eglantyne Louisa Jebb]], [[Mary Fraser Tytler]] and others initiated the [[Home Arts and Industries Association]] to encourage the working classes, especially those in rural areas, to take up handicrafts under supervision, not for profit, but in order to provide them with useful occupations and to improve their taste. By 1889 it had 450 classes, 1,000 teachers and 5,000 students.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=120}}\n\nIn 1882, architect [[A.H.Mackmurdo]] formed the [[Century Guild of Artists|Century Guild]], a partnership of designers including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Herbert Horne]], Clement Heaton and [[Benjamin Creswick]].{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=591}}{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=115}}\n\nIn 1884, the [[Art Workers Guild]] was initiated by five young architects, [[William Lethaby]], [[Edward Schroeder Prior|Edward Prior]], [[Ernest Newton]], Mervyn Macartney and [[Gerald C. Horsley]], with the goal of bringing together fine and applied arts and raising the status of the latter. It was directed originally by [[George Blackall Simonds]]. By 1890 the Guild had 150 members, representing the increasing number of practitioners of the Arts and Crafts style.{{sfn|MacCarthy|1994|page=593}} It still exists.\n\nThe London department store [[Liberty & Co.]], founded in 1875, was a prominent retailer of goods in the style and of the \"[[artistic dress]]\" favoured by followers of the Arts and Crafts movement.\n\nIn 1887 the [[Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society]], which gave its name to the movement, was formed with [[Walter Crane]] as president, holding its first exhibition in the [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], London, in November 1888.<ref>Parry, Linda, ''William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement: A Sourcebook'', New York, Portland House, 1989 {{ISBN|0-517-69260-0}}</ref> It was the first show of contemporary decorative arts in London since the [[Grosvenor Gallery]]'s Winter Exhibition of 1881.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/arts/essays/Theoretical-Practical-Critical-Ideals/Of-The-Arts-And-Crafts-Movement-Part-4.html |title=Crane, Walter, \"Of the Arts and Crafts Movement\", in ''Ideals In Art: Papers Theoretical Practical Critical'', George Bell & Sons, 1905 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref> [[Morris & Co.]] was well represented in the exhibition with furniture, fabrics, carpets and embroideries.

The guild was a craft co-operative modelled on the medieval guilds and intended to give working men satisfaction in their craftsmanship. Skilled craftsmen, working on the principles of Ruskin and Morris, were to produce hand-crafted goods and manage a school for apprentices. The idea was greeted with enthusiasm by almost everyone except Morris, who was by now involved with promoting [[socialism]] and thought Ashbee's scheme trivial. From 1888 to 1902 the guild prospered, employing about 50 men. In 1902 Ashbee relocated the guild out of London to begin an experimental community in [[Chipping Campden]] in the [[Cotswolds]]. The guild's work is characterized by plain surfaces of hammered silver, flowing wirework and colored stones in simple settings. Ashbee designed jewellery and silver tableware. The guild flourished at Chipping Camden but did not prosper and was liquidated in 1908. Some craftsmen stayed, contributing to the tradition of modern craftsmanship in the area.<ref name=V&A/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utopia-britannica.org.uk/pages/Ashbee.htm |title=Utopia Britannica |publisher=Utopia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |title=Court Barn Museum |publisher=Courtbarn.org.uk |accessdate=2010-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129132321/http://www.courtbarn.org.uk/home |archive-date=2010-01-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[C.F.A.

Leach was an active propagandist for these ideas, which struck a chord with practitioners of the crafts in the inter-war years, and he expounded them in ''A Potter's Book'', published in 1940, which denounced industrial society in terms as vehement as those of Ruskin and Morris. Thus the Arts and Crafts philosophy was perpetuated among British craft workers in the 1950s and 1960s, long after the demise of the Arts and Crafts movement and at the high tide of Modernism. British [[Utility furniture]] of the 1940s also derived from Arts and Crafts principles.<ref>[http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html Designing Britain] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100515141802/http://vads.ahds.ac.uk/learning/designingbritain/html/crd_desref.html |date=May 15, 2010 }}</ref> One of its main promoters, [[Sydney Gordon Russell|Gordon Russell]], chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel, was imbued with Arts and Crafts ideas.

The architecture of the style is represented by the [[Honan Chapel]] (1916) in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the grounds of [[University College Cork]]. Other architects practicing in Ireland included Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (Heywood House in Co. Laois, Lambay Island and the [[Irish National War Memorial Gardens]] in Dublin) and Frederick 'Pa' Hicks ([[Malahide Castle]] estate buildings and round tower). Irish Celtic motifs were popular with the movement in silvercraft, carpet design, book illustrations and hand-carved furniture.\n\n===Scotland===\n\nThe beginnings of the Arts and Crafts movement in Scotland were in the stained glass revival of the 1850s, pioneered by [[James Ballantine]] (1808\u201377). His major works included the great west window of [[Dunfermline Abbey]] and the scheme for [[St. Giles Cathedral]], Edinburgh. In Glasgow it was pioneered by [[Daniel Cottier]] (1838\u201391), who had probably studied with Ballantine, and was directly influenced by [[William Morris]], [[Ford Madox Brown]] and [[John Ruskin]]. His key works included the ''Baptism of Christ'' in [[Paisley Abbey]], (c. 1880). His followers included Stephen Adam and his son of the same name.<ref>M.

In central Europe, where several diverse nationalities lived under powerful empires (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia), the discovery of the vernacular was associated with the assertion of national pride and the striving for independence, and, whereas for Arts and Crafts practitioners in Britain the ideal style was to be found in the medieval, in central Europe it was sought in remote peasant villages.<ref>Andrej Szczerski, \"Central Europe\", in Karen Livingstone and Linda Parry (eds.), ''International Arts and Crafts'', London: V&A Publications, 2005</ref>\n\n[[File:Till en liten vira.jpg|thumb|The Swedish artists [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Karin Berg\u00f6\u00f6 Larsson]] were inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement when designing their home.]]\nWidely exhibited in Europe, the Arts and Crafts style's simplicity inspired designers like [[Henry van de Velde]] and styles such as [[Art Nouveau]], the Dutch [[De Stijl]] group, [[Vienna Secession]], and eventually the [[Bauhaus]] style.

The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Association of Craftsmen) was formed in 1907 as an association of artists, architects, designers, and industrialists to improve the global competitiveness of German businesses and became an important element in the development of [[modern architecture]] and industrial design through its advocacy of standardized production. However, its leading members, van de Velde and [[Hermann Muthesius]], had conflicting opinions about standardization. Muthesius believed that it was essential were Germany to become a leading nation in trade and culture. Van de Velde, representing a more traditional Arts and Crafts attitude, believed that artists would forever \"protest against the imposition of orders or standardization,\" and that \"The artist ... will never, of his own accord, submit to a discipline which imposes on him a canon or a type.\" {{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=189}}\n\nIn Finland, an idealistic artists' colony in [[Helsinki]] was designed by [[Herman Gesellius]], [[Armas Lindgren]] and [[Eliel Saarinen]],<ref name=\"grove\"/> who worked in the [[National Romantic style]], akin to the British [[Gothic Revival]].\n\nIn [[Hungary]], under the influence of Ruskin and Morris, a group of artists and architects, including [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]], [[Alad\u00e1r K\u00f6r\u00f6sf\u0151i-Kriesch]] and Ede Toroczkai Wigand, discovered the [[folk art]] and vernacular architecture of [[Transylvania]].

These included the \"Craftsman\"-style architecture, furniture, and other decorative arts such as designs promoted by [[Gustav Stickley]] in his magazine, ''The Craftsman'' and designs produced on the Roycroft campus as publicized in Elbert Hubbard's ''The Fra''.  Both men used their magazines as a vehicle to promote the goods produced with the Craftsman workshop in Eastwood, NY and Elbert Hubbard's [[Roycroft]] campus in [[East Aurora, NY]]. A host of imitators of Stickley's furniture (the designs of which are often mislabelled the \"[[American Craftsman|Mission Style]]\") included three companies established by his brothers.\n\nThe terms ''[[American Craftsman]]'' or ''Craftsman style'' are often used to denote the style of architecture, interior design, and decorative arts that prevailed between the dominant eras of [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]] in the US, or approximately the period from 1910 to 1925.  The movement was particularly notable for the professional opportunities it opened up for women as artisans, designers and entrepreneurs who founded and ran, or were employed by, such successful enterprises as the [[Kalo Shops]], [[Rookwood Pottery]], and [[Tiffany Studios]]. In Canada, the term ''Arts and Crafts'' predominates, but ''Craftsman'' is also recognized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/acam/hd_acam.htm |title=Metropolitan Museum of Art: Monica Obniski, \"The Arts and Crafts Movement in America\" |publisher=Metmuseum.org |date=1972-02-20 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Europeans tried to recreate the virtuous crafts being replaced by industrialisation, Americans tried to establish a new type of virtue to replace heroic craft production: well-decorated middle-class homes. They claimed that the simple but refined aesthetics of Arts and Crafts decorative arts would ennoble the new experience of industrial consumerism, making individuals more rational and society more harmonious. The American Arts and Crafts movement was the aesthetic counterpart of its contemporary political philosophy, [[progressivism]]. Characteristically, when the Arts and Crafts Society began in October 1897 in Chicago, it was at [[Hull House]], one of the first American [[settlement house]]s for social reform.<ref name=\"Obniski\">Obniski.</ref>\n\nArts and Crafts ideals disseminated in America through journal and newspaper writing were supplemented by societies that sponsored lectures.<ref name=\"Obniski\"/> The first was organized in Boston in the late 1890s, when a group of influential architects, designers, and educators determined to bring to America the design reforms begun in Britain by William Morris; they met to organize an exhibition of contemporary craft objects. The first meeting was held on January 4, 1897, at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] (MFA) in Boston to organize an exhibition of contemporary crafts. When craftsmen, consumers, and manufacturers realised the aesthetic and technical potential of the applied arts, the process of design reform in Boston started. Present at this meeting were General Charles Loring, Chairman of the Trustees of the MFA; [[William Sturgis Bigelow]] and [[Denman Ross]], collectors, writers and MFA trustees; Ross Turner, painter; [[Sylvester Baxter]], art critic for the ''Boston Transcript''; Howard Baker, [[Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.|A.W. Longfellow Jr.]]; and Ralph Clipson Sturgis, architect.\n\nThe first American Arts and Crafts Exhibition began on April 5, 1897, at [[Copley Hall, Boston]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} featuring more than 1000 objects made by 160 craftsmen, half of whom were women. Some of the advocates of the exhibit were Langford Warren, founder of Harvard's School of Architecture; Mrs. Richard Morris Hunt; Arthur Astor Carey and Edwin Mead, social reformers; and [[Will H. Bradley]], graphic designer. The success of this exhibition resulted in the incorporation of The Society of Arts and Crafts (SAC), on June 28, 1897, with a mandate to \"develop and encourage higher standards in the handicrafts.\" The 21 founders claimed to be interested in more than sales, and emphasized encouragement of artists to produce work with the best quality of workmanship and design. This mandate was soon expanded into a credo, possibly written by the SAC's first president, [[Charles Eliot Norton]], which read:\n\n<blockquote>This Society was incorporated for the purpose of promoting artistic work in all branches of handicraft. It hopes to bring Designers and Workmen into mutually helpful relations, and to encourage workmen to execute designs of their own. It endeavors to stimulate in workmen an appreciation of the dignity and value of good design; to counteract the popular impatience of Law and Form, and the desire for over-ornamentation and specious originality. It will insist upon the necessity of sobriety and restraint, or ordered arrangement, of due regard for the relation between the form of an object and its use, and of harmony and fitness in the decoration put upon it.<ref>Brandt, Beverly Kay.

It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which produces shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users. It is a protest against the turning of men into machines, against artificial distinctions in art, and against making the immediate market value, or possibility of profit, the chief test of artistic merit. It also advances the claim of all and each to the common possession of beauty in things common and familiar, and would awaken the sense of this beauty, deadened and depressed as it now too often is, either on the one hand by luxurious superfluities, or on the other by the absence of the commonest necessities and the gnawing anxiety for the means of livelihood; not to speak of the everyday uglinesses to which we have accustomed our eyes, confused by the flood of false taste, or darkened by the hurried life of modern towns in which huge aggregations of humanity exist, equally removed from both art and nature and their kindly and refining influences.\n\n[[Wikisource:Arts and Crafts Essays/Of the Revival of Design and Handicraft|-- Walter Crane, \"Of The Revival of Design and Handicraft\", in ''Arts and Crafts Essays'', by Members of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, 1893]]\n|}\n\nMany of the leaders of the Arts and Crafts movement were trained as architects (e.g. William Morris, A.

This lack of craft training also caused concern in industrial and official circles, and in 1884 a Royal Commission (accepting the advice of William Morris) recommended that art education should pay more attention to the suitability of design to the material in which it was to be executed.<ref>[http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf Charles Harvey and Jon Press, \"William Morris and the Royal Commission on Technical Instruction\", ''Journal of the William Morris Society''  11.1, August 1994, pp. 31-34] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105132211/http://www.morrissociety.org/publications/JWMS/AU94.11.1.HarveyPress.pdf |date=2015-01-05 }}</ref> The first school to make this change was the [[Birmingham Art School|Birmingham School of Arts and Crafts]], which \"led the way in introducing executed design to the teaching of art and design nationally (working in the material for which the design was intended rather than designing on paper).

Members of the Guild held influential positions: Walter Crane was director of the [[Manchester School of Art]] and subsequently the [[Royal College of Art]]; F.M. Simpson, [[Robert Anning Bell]] and C.J.Allen were respectively professor of architecture, instructor in painting and design, and instructor in sculpture at [[Liverpool School of Art]]; Robert Catterson-Smith, the headmaster of the Birmingham Art School from 1902-1920, was also an AWG member; [[W. R. Lethaby]] and [[George Frampton]] were inspectors and advisors to the [[London County Council]]'s (LCC) education board and in 1896, largely as a result of their work, the LCC set up the [[Central School of Arts and Crafts]] and made them joint principals.<ref name=macdonald/> Until the formation of the Bauhaus in Germany, the Central School was regarded as the most progressive art school in Europe.{{sfn|Naylor|1971|p=179}} Shortly after its foundation, the [[Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts]] was set up on Arts and Crafts lines by the local borough council.\n\nAs head of the Royal College of Art in 1898, Crane tried to reform it along more practical lines, but resigned after a year, defeated by the bureaucracy of the [[Board of Education (United Kingdom)|Board of Education]], who then appointed Augustus Spencer to implement his plan.

The series started in 2001 and now sanctions various series including North, South, and National Super Late Model tours and a New England Modified tour.\n\n==History==\nThe Pro All Stars Series started with the PASS North [[Late model|Pro Stock]] in 2001. The class was founded by former stockcar racer Tom Mayberry. The series was a successor to the [[Northeast Pro Stock Association]] and [[International Pro Stock Challenge]]. The first race was held on 20 May 2001 at [[Lee USA Speedway]]. [[Jim McCallum]] qualified his car on pole position. [[Dale Shaw]] beat his 32 rivals in the race over 150 laps.<ref>{{cite web|title=2001 Lee USA 150|url=http://www.thethirdturn.com/wiki/2001_Lee_USA_150|website=The Third Turn|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref> [[Ben Rowe]] won six out of ten races in the season. But due to steady top five finishes [[Sam Sessions (racing driver)|Sam Sessions]] was the first series champion. Rowe won the next two titles in the series.\n\nFor 2004 a new raceclass was introduced. A 'touring style' [[Modified stock car racing|modified racing]] series started at [[White Mountain Motorsports Park]] with ten drivers starting the race. PASS regular Ben Rowe won the first race of the series.<ref>{{cite web|title=PASS Modified:2004-01|url=http://www.thethirdturn.com/wiki/PASS_Modified:2004-01|website=The Third Turn|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref> A further two years later PASS founded the Super Late Model Touring Series South. The series, founded in 2006, was based in [[North Carolina]] but also raced on tracks in [[South Carolina]], [[Virginia]] and other [[Southern United States|southern states]].\n\nNot all ventures of the Pro All Stars Series were highly successful. The PASS Outlaw Late Model series existed for three seasons. The championship was introduced as a breeding ground for new drivers before growing into the Super Late Models. The 2008 season saw very small grids. Nine drivers started the race at [[Speedway 95]], twelve drivers started the race at [[Riverside International Speedway|Riverside Speedway]]. Mayberry stated that the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|economic situation]] and the fact that other local tracks added the outlaw late model class contributed to the small field in the PASS Outlaw Late Models. Therefore Mayberry decided to cancel the season after two races.<ref>{{cite web|title=PASS Cancels Balance of 2008 Outlaw Series Schedule|url=http://www.proallstarsseries.com/2-start-OUTLAW_Late_Models.htm|website=Pro All Stars Series|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref> The PASS Late Model Truck Series was also short lived. The trucks were a support category to the PASS South Super Late Models on short tracks throughout North Carolina. With only six drivers at [[Southern National Raceway Park]] the PASS organisation decided to cancel the series with one round at [[Greenville-Pickens Speedway]] remaining.<ref>{{cite web|title=PASS Late Model Truck  Season Complete;  Davidson Crowned Champion|url=http://www.proallstarsseries.com/SOUTH-HOME-2009.htm|website=Pro All Stars Series|accessdate=8 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn late 2012 Mayberry bought the historic [[Oxford Plains Speedway]].

He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with [[Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 25.<ref name=\"Neill418\">O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), 418</ref>\n\nAlthough his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all [[English poets]]. He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] stated that his first encounter with Keats' work was the most significant literary experience of his life.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges (2000). ''This Craft of Verse''. Harvard University Press, 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nThe poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the [[John Keats's 1819 odes|series of odes]]. This is typical of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through an emphasis on natural imagery. Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature. Some of the most acclaimed works of Keats are \"[[Ode to a Nightingale]]\", \"[[Sleep and Poetry]]\", and the famous sonnet \"[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJohn Keats was born in [[Moorgate]], London, on 31 October 1795 to Thomas Keats and his wife, Frances Jennings. There is little evidence of his exact birthplace.

The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/> In the family atmosphere at Clarke's, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to [[Renaissance]] literature, including [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[George Chapman|Chapman's translations]]. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, \"always in extremes\", given to indolence and fighting. However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\">Gittings (1987), 1\u20133</ref>\n\nIn April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture, suffered when he fell from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school.<ref>''John Keats'', Colvin, S, (1917)</ref> Thomas Keats died [[intestacy|intestate]].

She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, to take care of them. That autumn, Keats left Clarke's school to apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Cowden Clarke, who remained a close friend of Keats, described this period as \"the most placid time in Keats' life.\"<ref>Motion (1999), 46</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nFrom 1814, Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday: \u00a3800 willed by his grandfather John Jennings (about \u00a350,000 in today's money) and a portion of his mother's legacy, \u00a38000 (about \u00a3500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children.<ref group=\"nb\">Keats' share would have increased on the death of his brother Tom in 1818.</ref> It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money.

It seems he did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations.

Within a month of starting, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital, assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Keats' long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/><ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/> He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including [[Henry Stephens (doctor)|Henry Stephens]] who became a famous inventor and ink magnate.<ref>Motion (1998), 74</ref>\n\nHowever, Keats' training took up increasing amounts of his writing time, and he was increasingly ambivalent about his medical career. He felt that he faced a stark choice.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/><ref>Motion (1998), 98</ref> He had written his first extant poem, \"An Imitation of Spenser,\" in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Lord Byron]], and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John \"feared that he should never be a poet, & if he was not he would destroy himself\".<ref>Motion (1997), 94</ref> In 1816, Keats received his [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|apothecary's licence]], which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician, and surgeon, but before the end of the year he announced to his guardian that he was resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/>\n\nAlthough he continued his work and training at Guy's, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet \"O Solitude\" in his magazine, ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', a leading liberal magazine of the day.<ref name=\"hirsch\">Hirsch, Edward (2001)</ref> It was the first appearance in print of Keats' poetry, and [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] described it as his friend's red letter day,<ref>Colvin (2006), 35</ref> the first proof that Keats' ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was ''To My Brothers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemist.com/john-keats/sonnet-viii-to-my-brothers|title=Sonnett VIII. To My Brothers|last=Keats|first=John|publisher=Poemist.com|year=1816|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref> In the summer of that year, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of [[Margate]] to write. There he began \"Calidore\" and initiated the era of his great letter writing. On his return to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself for further study in order to become a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].<ref>Motion (1998), 104\u20135</ref>\n\nIn October 1816, Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of ''Poems'', the first volume of Keats' verse, which included \"I stood tiptoe\" and \"Sleep and Poetry,\" both strongly influenced by Hunt.<ref name=\"hirsch\"/> The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in ''The Champion''.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/> Clarke commented that the book \"might have emerged in Timbuctoo.\"<!---sic---><ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Keats' publishers, [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]], felt ashamed of the book. Keats immediately changed publishers to [[John Taylor (English publisher)|Taylor and Hessey]] on [[Fleet Street]].<ref>Motion proposes that the Olliers suggested Keats leave their publishing lists. See Motion (1997) p156</ref> Unlike the Olliers, Keats' new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of ''Poems'' they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists eventually included [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[John Clare|Clare]], [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg|Hogg]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[Charles Lamb|Lamb]].<ref>Motion (1997), 156</ref>\n\nThrough Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their [[Eton College|Eton]]-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by ''Poems''. Although he noted that Keats could be \"wayward, trembling, easily daunted,\" Woodhouse was convinced of Keats' genius, a poet to support as he became one of England's greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about Keats' poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats' work.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Andrew Motion represents him as [[James Boswell|Boswell]] to Keats' [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]], ceaselessly promoting the writer's work, fighting his corner, and spurring his poetry to greater heights. In later years, Woodhouse was one of the few people to accompany Keats to [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]] to embark on his final trip to Rome.<ref>Motion (1997), 157</ref>\n\nIn spite of the bad reviews of ''Poems'', Hunt published the essay \"Three Young Poets\" ([[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], Keats, and [[John Hamilton Reynolds|Reynolds]]) and the sonnet \"[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]],\" foreseeing great things to come.<ref>Gittings (1968), 155</ref> He introduced Keats to many prominent men in his circle, including the editor of ''[[The Times]]'', [[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]]; the writer [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]]; the conductor [[Vincent Novello]]; and the poet [[John Hamilton Reynolds]], who would become a close friend.<ref>Motion (1997), 116\u2013120</ref> He was also regularly meeting [[William Hazlitt]], a powerful literary figure of the day. It was a decisive turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry.\"<ref>Motion (1997) 130</ref> At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey: \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\"<ref name=\"Neill418\" /><ref>Keats' letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817</ref> This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\": {{\"'}}Beauty is truth, truth beauty' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey that he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training and, despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, had made large loans to friends such as painter [[Benjamin Haydon]]. Keats would go on to lend \u00a3700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/><ref>Bate (1964) p632</ref>\n\nHaving left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of [[Hampstead]] in April 1817. Both John and George nursed their brother Tom, who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. The house was close to Hunt and others from his circle in Hampstead, as well as to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, at that time living in [[Highgate]]. On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had a long walk together on [[Hampstead Heath]]. In a letter to his brother George, Keats wrote that they talked about \"a thousand things,... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics.\"<ref>Motion (1997), 365\u201366</ref> Around this time he was introduced to [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]] and James Rice.<ref>Motion (1997), 364, 184</ref>\n\nIn June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the [[Lake District]] with his friend [[Charles Armitage Brown]]. Keats' brother George and his wife Georgina accompanied them as far as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and then continued to [[Liverpool]], from where the couple emigrated to America. They lived in [[Ohio]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky]], until 1841, when George's investments failed. Like Keats' other brother, they both died penniless and racked by tuberculosis, for which there was no effective treatment until the next century.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1922/07/30/archives/tracing-the-keats-family-in-america-tracing-the-keats-family-in.html ''Tracing the Keats Family in America]'' ''New York Times'' Koch 30 July 1922.

She was born in the hamlet of West End (now in the district of [[West Hampstead]]), on 9 August 1800. Like Keats' grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats' sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent.<ref>Gittings (1968), 268</ref> During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.<ref>Gittings (1968), 264</ref>\n\n[[File:Fannybrawne.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Ambrotype]] of Fanny Brawne taken circa 1850 (photograph on glass)]]\nOn 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke's Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet \"[[Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art|Bright Star]]\" (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued at until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. \"All his desires were concentrated on Fanny\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Gittings (1968), 293\u2013298</ref> From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture.<ref name=Gittings327>Gittings (1968), 327\u2013331</ref> Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his 'star' began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" where love and death both stalk. \"I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;\" he wrote to her, \"...your loveliness, and the hour of my death\".<ref name=Gittings327/>\n\nIn one of his many hundreds of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: \"My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you&nbsp;\u2013 I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again&nbsp;\u2013 my Life seems to stop there&nbsp;\u2013 I see no further. You have absorb'd me.

In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters, although he did correspond with her mother.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> He died there five months later.

The journey was a minor catastrophe: storms broke out followed by a dead calm that slowed the ship's progress.

He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye.<ref Name=\"Walsh\"/> His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's ''Examiner'', which Keats read as a boy.<ref Name= \"Poems18\">Gittings (1987), 18\u201321</ref> Hunt scorned the [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] or \"French\" school, dominated by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. Indeed, during Keats' few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a \"new school\" for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis from the scathing attacks from ''Blackwood's'' and ''The Quarterly''.<ref Name= \"Poems18\"/>\n{{Quote box |width=450px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote =<poem>\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun\nConspiring with him how to load and bless\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\nTo bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,\nUntil they think warm days will never cease,\nFor Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.\n</poem> |source =First stanza of \"[[To Autumn]]\",<ref name=\"PaL157\">Gittings (1987), 157</ref><br />September 1819}}\nBy the time of his death, Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools: the obscurity of the first-wave Romantics and the uneducated affectation of Hunt's \"Cockney School\".

They glitter with humour and critical intelligence.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Born of an \"unself-conscious stream of consciousness,\" they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/> When his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in great detail, the body of letters becoming \"the real diary\" and self-revelation of Keats' life, as well as containing an exposition of his philosophy, and the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats' finest writing and thought.<ref>Gittings (1968), 66</ref> Gittings describes them as akin to a \"spiritual journal\" not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/>\n\nKeats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry, and specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/> In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters\".<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as \"the vale of Soul-making\", <!--- Keats' capitalisation---> anticipating the great odes that he would write some months later.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/><ref>Letter to George Keats, Sunday 14 February 1819</ref> In the letters, Keats coined ideas such as the [[Mansion of Many Apartments]] and the [[Chameleon Poet]], concepts that came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, despite only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence.<ref>Scott, Grant (ed.), Selected Letters of John Keats, Harvard University Press (2002)</ref> The poetical mind, Keats argued:\n<blockquote>\nhas no self \u2013 it is every thing and nothing \u2013 It has no character \u2013 it enjoys light and shade;... What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity \u2013 he is continually in for \u2013 and filling some other Body \u2013 The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute \u2013 the poet has none; no identity \u2013 he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures.\n</blockquote>\nHe used the term [[negative capability]] to discuss the state in which we are \"capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason&nbsp;...[Being] content with half knowledge\" where one trusts in the heart's perceptions.<ref>Wu, Duncan (2005) ''Romanticism: an anthology: Edition: 3, illustrated.'' Blackwell, 2005 p.1351. citing Letter to George Keats. Sunday, 21 December 1817</ref> He wrote later: \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination \u2013 What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth \u2013 whether it existed before or not \u2013 for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty\"<ref>Keats letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817</ref> again and again turning to the question of what it means to be a poet.<ref name=autogenerated4>O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), 419</ref> \"My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk\", Keats notes to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. In September 1819, Keats wrote to [[John Hamilton Reynolds|Reynolds]] \"How beautiful the season is now \u2013 How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it &nbsp;... I never lik'd the stubbled fields as much as now \u2013 Aye, better than the chilly green of spring.

Ay, where are they?\nThink not of them, thou hast thy music too,-\nWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\nAnd touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<ref name=\"PaL157\" />\n</poem></blockquote>\nLater, ''To Autumn'' became one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language.<ref group=\"nb\">Bate p581: \"Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English.\"</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The 1888 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' declared that, \"Of these [odes] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that of to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn\" Baynes, Thomas (Ed.).

He mentions little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is a total absence of any reference to his parents.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions. The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 focused on this period and emphasised this tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|John Keats bibliography}}\n* ''Keats's Poetry and Prose.''

He was one of the main figures of the second generation of Romantic poets, along with [[Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], despite his works having been in publication for only four years before his death from [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 25.<ref name=\"Neill418\">O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), 418</ref>\n\nAlthough his poems were not generally well received by critics during his lifetime, his reputation grew after his death, and by the end of the 19th century, he had become one of the most beloved of all [[English poets]]. He had a significant influence on a diverse range of poets and writers. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] stated that his first encounter with Keats' work was the most significant literary experience of his life.<ref>Jorge Luis Borges (2000). ''This Craft of Verse''. Harvard University Press, 98\u2013101</ref>\n\nThe poetry of Keats is characterised by sensual imagery, most notably in the [[John Keats's 1819 odes|series of odes]]. This is typical of romantic poets, as they aimed to accentuate extreme emotion through an emphasis on natural imagery. Today his poems and letters are some of the most popular and most analysed in English literature. Some of the most acclaimed works of Keats are \"[[Ode to a Nightingale]]\", \"[[Sleep and Poetry]]\", and the famous sonnet \"[[On First Looking into Chapman's Homer]]\".\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nJohn Keats was born in [[Moorgate]], London, on 31 October 1795 to Thomas Keats and his wife, Frances Jennings.

The small school had a liberal outlook and a progressive curriculum more modern than the larger, more prestigious schools.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/> In the family atmosphere at Clarke's, Keats developed an interest in classics and history, which would stay with him throughout his short life. The headmaster's son, Charles Cowden Clarke, also became an important mentor and friend, introducing Keats to [[Renaissance]] literature, including [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[George Chapman|Chapman's translations]]. The young Keats was described by his friend Edward Holmes as a volatile character, \"always in extremes\", given to indolence and fighting. However, at 13 he began focusing his energy on reading and study, winning his first academic prize in midsummer 1809.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\">Gittings (1987), 1\u20133</ref>\n\nIn April 1804, when Keats was eight, his father died from a skull fracture, suffered when he fell from his horse while returning from a visit to Keats and his brother George at school.<ref>''John Keats'', Colvin, S, (1917)</ref> Thomas Keats died [[intestacy|intestate]].

She appointed two guardians, Richard Abbey and John Sandell, to take care of them. That autumn, Keats left Clarke's school to apprentice with Thomas Hammond, a surgeon and apothecary who was a neighbour and the doctor of the Jennings family. Keats lodged in the attic above the surgery at 7 Church Street until 1813.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Cowden Clarke, who remained a close friend of Keats, described this period as \"the most placid time in Keats' life.\"<ref>Motion (1999), 46</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nFrom 1814, Keats had two bequests, held in trust for him until his 21st birthday: \u00a3800 willed by his grandfather John Jennings (about \u00a350,000 in today's money) and a portion of his mother's legacy, \u00a38000 (about \u00a3500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children.<ref group=\"nb\">Keats' share would have increased on the death of his brother Tom in 1818.</ref> It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money.

Within a month of starting, he was accepted as a dresser at the hospital, assisting surgeons during operations, the equivalent of a junior house surgeon today. It was a significant promotion, that marked a distinct aptitude for medicine; it brought greater responsibility and a heavier workload.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Keats' long and expensive medical training with Hammond and at Guy's Hospital led his family to assume he would pursue a lifelong career in medicine, assuring financial security, and it seems that at this point Keats had a genuine desire to become a doctor.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/><ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/> He lodged near the hospital, at 28 St Thomas's Street in Southwark, with other medical students, including [[Henry Stephens (doctor)|Henry Stephens]] who became a famous inventor and ink magnate.<ref>Motion (1998), 74</ref>\n\nHowever, Keats' training took up increasing amounts of his writing time, and he was increasingly ambivalent about his medical career. He felt that he faced a stark choice.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/><ref>Motion (1998), 98</ref> He had written his first extant poem, \"An Imitation of Spenser,\" in 1814, when he was 19. Now, strongly drawn by ambition, inspired by fellow poets such as [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] and [[Lord Byron]], and beleaguered by family financial crises, he suffered periods of depression. His brother George wrote that John \"feared that he should never be a poet, & if he was not he would destroy himself\".<ref>Motion (1997), 94</ref> In 1816, Keats received his [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries|apothecary's licence]], which made him eligible to practise as an apothecary, physician, and surgeon, but before the end of the year he announced to his guardian that he was resolved to be a poet, not a surgeon.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/>\n\nAlthough he continued his work and training at Guy's, Keats devoted more and more time to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet \"O Solitude\" in his magazine, ''[[The Examiner (1808\u201386)|The Examiner]]'', a leading liberal magazine of the day.<ref name=\"hirsch\">Hirsch, Edward (2001)</ref> It was the first appearance in print of Keats' poetry, and [[Charles Cowden Clarke]] described it as his friend's red letter day,<ref>Colvin (2006), 35</ref> the first proof that Keats' ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was ''To My Brothers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poemist.com/john-keats/sonnet-viii-to-my-brothers|title=Sonnett VIII. To My Brothers|last=Keats|first=John|publisher=Poemist.com|year=1816|accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref> In the summer of that year, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of [[Margate]] to write. There he began \"Calidore\" and initiated the era of his great letter writing. On his return to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and braced himself for further study in order to become a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons]].<ref>Motion (1998), 104\u20135</ref>\n\nIn October 1816, Clarke introduced Keats to the influential Leigh Hunt, a close friend of Byron and Shelley. Five months later came the publication of ''Poems'', the first volume of Keats' verse, which included \"I stood tiptoe\" and \"Sleep and Poetry,\" both strongly influenced by Hunt.<ref name=\"hirsch\"/> The book was a critical failure, arousing little interest, although Reynolds reviewed it favourably in ''The Champion''.<ref Name=\"Poemsletters\"/> Clarke commented that the book \"might have emerged in Timbuctoo.\"<!---sic---><ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Keats' publishers, [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]], felt ashamed of the book. Keats immediately changed publishers to [[John Taylor (English publisher)|Taylor and Hessey]] on [[Fleet Street]].<ref>Motion proposes that the Olliers suggested Keats leave their publishing lists. See Motion (1997) p156</ref> Unlike the Olliers, Keats' new publishers were enthusiastic about his work. Within a month of the publication of ''Poems'' they were planning a new Keats volume and had paid him an advance. Hessey became a steady friend to Keats and made the company's rooms available for young writers to meet. Their publishing lists eventually included [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[William Hazlitt|Hazlitt]], [[John Clare|Clare]], [[Thomas Jefferson Hogg|Hogg]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[Charles Lamb|Lamb]].<ref>Motion (1997), 156</ref>\n\nThrough Taylor and Hessey, Keats met their [[Eton College|Eton]]-educated lawyer, Richard Woodhouse, who advised them on literary as well as legal matters and was deeply impressed by ''Poems''. Although he noted that Keats could be \"wayward, trembling, easily daunted,\" Woodhouse was convinced of Keats' genius, a poet to support as he became one of England's greatest writers. Soon after they met, the two became close friends, and Woodhouse started to collect Keatsiana, documenting as much as he could about Keats' poetry. This archive survives as one of the main sources of information on Keats' work.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Andrew Motion represents him as [[James Boswell|Boswell]] to Keats' [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]], ceaselessly promoting the writer's work, fighting his corner, and spurring his poetry to greater heights.

It was a decisive turning point for Keats, establishing him in the public eye as a figure in what Hunt termed \"a new school of poetry.\"<ref>Motion (1997) 130</ref> At this time Keats wrote to his friend Bailey: \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of the imagination. What imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth.\"<ref name=\"Neill418\" /><ref>Keats' letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817</ref> This passage would eventually be transmuted into the concluding lines of \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\": {{\"'}}Beauty is truth, truth beauty' \u2013 that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know\". In early December 1816, under the heady influence of his artistic friends, Keats told Abbey that he had decided to give up medicine in favour of poetry, to Abbey's fury. Keats had spent a great deal on his medical training and, despite his state of financial hardship and indebtedness, had made large loans to friends such as painter [[Benjamin Haydon]]. Keats would go on to lend \u00a3700 to his brother George. By lending so much, Keats could no longer cover the interest of his own debts.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/><ref>Bate (1964) p632</ref>\n\nHaving left his training at the hospital, suffering from a succession of colds, and unhappy with living in damp rooms in London, Keats moved with his brothers into rooms at 1 Well Walk in the village of [[Hampstead]] in April 1817. Both John and George nursed their brother Tom, who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. The house was close to Hunt and others from his circle in Hampstead, as well as to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], respected elder of the first wave of Romantic poets, at that time living in [[Highgate]]. On 11 April 1818, Keats reported that he and Coleridge had a long walk together on [[Hampstead Heath]]. In a letter to his brother George, Keats wrote that they talked about \"a thousand things,... nightingales, poetry, poetical sensation, metaphysics.\"<ref>Motion (1997), 365\u201366</ref> Around this time he was introduced to [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]] and James Rice.<ref>Motion (1997), 364, 184</ref>\n\nIn June 1818, Keats began a walking tour of Scotland, Ireland, and the [[Lake District]] with his friend [[Charles Armitage Brown]]. Keats' brother George and his wife Georgina accompanied them as far as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and then continued to [[Liverpool]], from where the couple emigrated to America. They lived in [[Ohio]] and [[Louisville, Kentucky]], until 1841, when George's investments failed.

She was born in the hamlet of West End (now in the district of [[West Hampstead]]), on 9 August 1800. Like Keats' grandfather, her grandfather kept a London inn, and both lost several family members to tuberculosis. She shared her first name with both Keats' sister and mother, and had a talent for dress-making and languages as well as a natural theatrical bent.<ref>Gittings (1968), 268</ref> During November 1818 she developed an intimacy with Keats, but it was shadowed by the illness of Tom Keats, whom John was nursing through this period.<ref>Gittings (1968), 264</ref>\n\n[[File:Fannybrawne.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Ambrotype]] of Fanny Brawne taken circa 1850 (photograph on glass)]]\nOn 3 April 1819, Brawne and her widowed mother moved into the other half of Dilke's Wentworth Place, and Keats and Brawne were able to see each other every day. Keats began to lend Brawne books, such as [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', and they would read together. He gave her the love sonnet \"[[Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art|Bright Star]]\" (perhaps revised for her) as a declaration. It was a work in progress which he continued at until the last months of his life, and the poem came to be associated with their relationship. \"All his desires were concentrated on Fanny\".<ref name=autogenerated1>Gittings (1968), 293\u2013298</ref> From this point there is no further documented mention of Isabella Jones.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Sometime before the end of June, he arrived at some sort of understanding with Brawne, far from a formal engagement as he still had too little to offer, with no prospects and financial stricture.<ref name=Gittings327>Gittings (1968), 327\u2013331</ref> Keats endured great conflict knowing his expectations as a struggling poet in increasingly hard straits would preclude marriage to Brawne. Their love remained unconsummated; jealousy for his 'star' began to gnaw at him. Darkness, disease and depression surrounded him, reflected in poems such as \"The Eve of St. Agnes\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\" where love and death both stalk. \"I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks;\" he wrote to her, \"...your loveliness, and the hour of my death\".<ref name=Gittings327/>\n\nIn one of his many hundreds of notes and letters, Keats wrote to Brawne on 13 October 1819: \"My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you&nbsp;\u2013 I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again&nbsp;\u2013 my Life seems to stop there&nbsp;\u2013 I see no further. You have absorb'd me.

In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would probably never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or read her letters, although he did correspond with her mother.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> He died there five months later.

In his lifetime, sales of Keats' three volumes of poetry probably amounted to only 200 copies.<ref name=\"guardian1\">{{cite news|author=Andrew Motion |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/john-keats-andrew-motion |title=Article 23 January 2010 ''An introduction to the poetry of John Keats'' |newspaper=The Guardian|date= 23 January 2010|accessdate=15 February 2010 | location=London}}</ref> His first poem, the [[sonnet]] ''O Solitude'', appeared in ''the Examiner'' in May 1816, while his collection ''Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes and other poems'' was published in July 1820 before his last visit to Rome. The compression of his poetic apprenticeship and maturity into so short a time is just one remarkable aspect of Keats' work.<ref name=\"Neill418\" />\n\nAlthough prolific during his short career, and now one of the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, [[John Keats's 1819 odes|centred on the Odes]],<ref>Strachan (2003), 2</ref> and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death.<ref Name=\"Walsh\">Walsh (1957), 220\u2013221</ref> Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, \"I have left no immortal work behind me \u2013 nothing to make my friends proud of my memory \u2013 but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember'd.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.john-keats.com/briefe/000220.htm|title=John-Keats.com - Letters|website=www.john-keats.com|accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nKeats' ability and talent was acknowledged by several influential contemporary allies such as Shelley and Hunt.<ref name=\"guardian1\"/> His admirers praised him for thinking \"on his pulses\", for having developed a style which was more heavily loaded with sensualities, more gorgeous in its effects, more voluptuously alive than any poet who had come before him: \"loading every rift with ore\".<ref>Keats Letter To Percy Bysshe Shelley, 16 August 1820</ref> Shelley often corresponded with Keats in Rome and loudly declared that Keats' death had been brought on by bad reviews in the ''Quarterly Review''. Seven weeks after the funeral he wrote ''[[Adonais]]'', a despairing elegy,<ref>''[[Adonais]]'' by Shelley is a despairing [[elegy]] of 495 lines and 55 [[Spenserian stanza]]s. It was published that July 1820 and he came to view it as his \"least imperfect\" work.</ref> stating that Keats' early death was a personal and public tragedy:\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe loveliest and the last,\nThe bloom, whose petals nipped before they blew\nDied on the promise of the fruit.<ref>''[[Adonais]]'' (Adonais: An Elegy on the Death of John Keats, Author of Endymion, Hyperion, etc.) by Shelley, published 1821</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rpo.library.utoronto.ca/poems/adonais-elegy-death-john-keats|title=University of Toronto \u2013 ''Adonais'' by Shelley}}</ref> </poem>}}\n\nAlthough Keats wrote that \"if poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all\", poetry did not come easily to him; his work was the fruit of a deliberate and prolonged classical self-education. He may have possessed an innate poetic sensibility, but his early works were clearly those of a young man learning his craft. His first attempts at verse were often vague, languorously narcotic and lacking a clear eye.<ref Name=\"Walsh\"/> His poetic sense was based on the conventional tastes of his friend Charles Cowden Clarke, who first introduced him to the classics, and also came from the predilections of Hunt's ''Examiner'', which Keats read as a boy.<ref Name= \"Poems18\">Gittings (1987), 18\u201321</ref> Hunt scorned the [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] or \"French\" school, dominated by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]], and attacked the earlier Romantic poets Wordsworth and Coleridge, now in their forties, as unsophisticated, obscure and crude writers. Indeed, during Keats' few years as a published poet, the reputation of the older Romantic school was at its lowest ebb. Keats came to echo these sentiments in his work, identifying himself with a \"new school\" for a time, somewhat alienating him from Wordsworth, Coleridge and Byron and providing the basis from the scathing attacks from ''Blackwood's'' and ''The Quarterly''.<ref Name= \"Poems18\"/>\n{{Quote box |width=450px |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote =<poem>\nSeason of mists and mellow fruitfulness\nClose bosom-friend of the maturing sun\nConspiring with him how to load and bless\nWith fruit the vines that round the thatch-eaves run;\nTo bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,\nAnd fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;\nTo swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells\nWith a sweet kernel; to set budding more,\nAnd still more, later flowers for the bees,\nUntil they think warm days will never cease,\nFor Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.\n</poem> |source =First stanza of \"[[To Autumn]]\",<ref name=\"PaL157\">Gittings (1987), 157</ref><br />September 1819}}\nBy the time of his death, Keats had therefore been associated with the taints of both old and new schools: the obscurity of the first-wave Romantics and the uneducated affectation of Hunt's \"Cockney School\". Keats' posthumous reputation mixed the reviewers' caricature of the simplistic bumbler with the image of the hyper-sensitive genius killed by high feeling, which Shelley later portrayed.<ref Name= \"Poems18\"/>\n\nThe Victorian sense of poetry as the work of indulgence and luxuriant fancy offered a schema into which Keats was posthumously fitted. Marked as the standard-bearer of sensory writing, his reputation grew steadily and remarkably.<ref Name= \"Poems18\"/> His work had the full support of the influential [[Cambridge Apostles]], whose members included the young [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]],<ref group=\"nb\">[[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] was writing Keats-style poetry in the 1830s and was being critically attacked in the same manner as his predecessor.</ref> later a popular Poet Laureate who came to regard Keats as the greatest poet of the 19th century.<ref Name=\"OCEL\"/> [[Constance Naden]] was a great admirer of his poems, arguing that his genius lay in his 'exquisite sensitiveness to all the elements of beauty'.<ref>'Poesy Club', Mason College Magazine, 4.5 (October 1886), 106.</ref> In 1848, twenty-seven years after Keats' death, [[Richard Monckton Milnes]] published the first full biography, which helped place Keats within the canon of English literature. The [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], including [[John Everett Millais|Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], were inspired by Keats and painted scenes from his poems including \"The Eve of St. Agnes\", \"Isabella\" and \"La Belle Dame sans Merci\", lush, arresting and popular images which remain closely associated with Keats' work.<ref Name= \"Poems18\"/>\n\nIn 1882, [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] wrote in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' that \"the Ode to a Nightingale, [is] one of the final masterpieces of human work in all time and for all ages\".<ref>\"Keats, John\". ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Ninth Edition, Vol. XIV. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1882. 22\u201324</ref> In the twentieth century, Keats remained the muse of poets such as [[Wilfred Owen]], who kept his death date as a day of mourning, Yeats and T.

Other collections of material are archived at the [[British Library]], [[Keats House]], [[Hampstead]], the [[Keats-Shelley Memorial House]] in Rome and the [[Pierpont Morgan Library]] in New York.

Leigh Hunt's ''Lord Byron and some of his Contemporaries'' (1828) gives the first biographical account, strongly emphasising Keats' supposedly humble origins, a misconception which still continues.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Given that he was becoming a significant figure within artistic circles, a succession of other publications followed, including anthologies of his many notes, chapters and letters.<ref name=\"gittings3\">Gittings (1968), 3</ref> However, early accounts often gave contradictory or heavily biased versions of events and were subject to dispute.<ref name=\"gittings3\"/> His friends Brown, Severn, Dilke, Shelley and his guardian Richard Abbey, his publisher Taylor, Fanny Brawne and many others issued posthumous commentary on Keats' life. These early writings coloured all subsequent biography and have become embedded in a body of Keats legend.<ref>Gittings (1968), 5</ref>\n\nShelley promoted Keats as someone whose achievement could not be separated from agony, who was 'spiritualised' by his decline and too fine-tuned to endure the harshness of life; the consumptive, suffering image popularly held today.<ref>Motion (1997), 499</ref> The first full biography was published in 1848 by Richard Monckton Milnes. Landmark Keats biographers since include [[Sidney Colvin]], [[Robert Gittings]], [[Walter Jackson Bate]] and [[Andrew Motion]]. The idealised image of the heroic romantic poet who battled poverty and died young was inflated by the late arrival of an authoritative biography and the lack of an accurate likeness. Most of the surviving portraits of Keats were painted after his death, and those who knew him held that they did not succeed in capturing his unique quality and intensity.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/>\n\n===Other portrayals===\n[[File:Poet John Keats, by sculptor Vincent Gray.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of poet John Keats (seated on bench) by Vincent Gray \u2013 Chichester, West Sussex, UK.

During the 19th century, critics deemed them unworthy of attention, distractions from his poetic works.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/> During the 20th century they became almost as admired and studied as his poetry,<ref Name=\"OCEL\"/> and are highly regarded within the canon of English literary correspondence.<ref>Strachan (2003), 12</ref> [[T.

Eliot]] ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1937) p100''</ref> Keats spent a great deal of time considering poetry itself, its constructs and impacts, displaying a deep interest unusual amongst his milieu who were more easily distracted by metaphysics or politics, fashions or science. Eliot wrote of Keats' conclusions; \"There is hardly one statement of Keats' about poetry which&nbsp;... will not be found to be true, and what is more, true for greater and more mature poetry than anything Keats ever wrote.\"<ref Name=\"PaL12\">Gittings (1987), 12\u201317</ref><ref>[[T. S. Eliot]] ''The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism (1937) p101''</ref>\n\nFew of Keats' letters are extant from the period before he joined his literary circle. From spring 1817, however, there is a rich record of his prolific and impressive skills as letter writer.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Keats and his friends, poets, critics, novelists, and editors wrote to each other daily, and Keats' ideas are bound up in the ordinary, his day-to-day missives sharing news, parody and social commentary. They glitter with humour and critical intelligence.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Born of an \"unself-conscious stream of consciousness,\" they are impulsive, full of awareness of his own nature and his weak spots.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/> When his brother George went to America, Keats wrote to him in great detail, the body of letters becoming \"the real diary\" and self-revelation of Keats' life, as well as containing an exposition of his philosophy, and the first drafts of poems containing some of Keats' finest writing and thought.<ref>Gittings (1968), 66</ref> Gittings describes them as akin to a \"spiritual journal\" not written for a specific other, so much as for synthesis.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/>\n\nKeats also reflected on the background and composition of his poetry, and specific letters often coincide with or anticipate the poems they describe.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/> In February to May 1819 he produced many of his finest letters\".<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> Writing to his brother George, Keats explored the idea of the world as \"the vale of Soul-making\", <!--- Keats' capitalisation---> anticipating the great odes that he would write some months later.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/><ref>Letter to George Keats, Sunday 14 February 1819</ref> In the letters, Keats coined ideas such as the [[Mansion of Many Apartments]] and the [[Chameleon Poet]], concepts that came to gain common currency and capture the public imagination, despite only making single appearances as phrases in his correspondence.<ref>Scott, Grant (ed.), Selected Letters of John Keats, Harvard University Press (2002)</ref> The poetical mind, Keats argued:\n<blockquote>\nhas no self \u2013 it is every thing and nothing \u2013 It has no character \u2013 it enjoys light and shade;... What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion [chameleon] Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A Poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity \u2013 he is continually in for \u2013 and filling some other Body \u2013 The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute \u2013 the poet has none; no identity \u2013 he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures.\n</blockquote>\nHe used the term [[negative capability]] to discuss the state in which we are \"capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact & reason&nbsp;...[Being] content with half knowledge\" where one trusts in the heart's perceptions.<ref>Wu, Duncan (2005) ''Romanticism: an anthology: Edition: 3, illustrated.'' Blackwell, 2005 p.1351. citing Letter to George Keats. Sunday, 21 December 1817</ref> He wrote later: \"I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination \u2013 What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth \u2013 whether it existed before or not \u2013 for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty\"<ref>Keats letter to Benjamin Bailey, 22 November 1817</ref> again and again turning to the question of what it means to be a poet.<ref name=autogenerated4>O'Neill and Mahoney (1988), 419</ref> \"My Imagination is a Monastery and I am its Monk\", Keats notes to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. In September 1819, Keats wrote to [[John Hamilton Reynolds|Reynolds]] \"How beautiful the season is now \u2013 How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it &nbsp;...

Ay, where are they?\nThink not of them, thou hast thy music too,-\nWhile barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,\nAnd touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;<ref name=\"PaL157\" />\n</poem></blockquote>\nLater, ''To Autumn'' became one of the most highly regarded poems in the English language.<ref group=\"nb\">Bate p581: \"Each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English.\"</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The 1888 ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' declared that, \"Of these [odes] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that of to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn\" Baynes, Thomas (Ed.).

He mentions little about his childhood or his financial straits and is seemingly embarrassed to discuss them. There is a total absence of any reference to his parents.<ref Name=\"NDB\"/> In his last year, as his health deteriorated, his concerns often gave way to despair and morbid obsessions. The publications of letters to Fanny Brawne in 1870 focused on this period and emphasised this tragic aspect, giving rise to widespread criticism at the time.<ref Name=\"PaL12\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|John Keats bibliography}}\n* ''Keats's Poetry and Prose.''
