According to the biblical account, this kingdom was founded after the death of [[Saul]], when the [[tribe of Judah]] elevated [[David]] to rule over it. After seven years, David became king of a reunited [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]]. However, in about [[930s BC|930 BCE]] the united kingdom split, with ten of the twelve [[Tribes of Israel]] rejecting Solomon's son [[Rehoboam]] as their king. The [[Tribe of Judah|tribes of Judah]] and [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] remained loyal to Rehoboam, and re-formed the Kingdom of Judah, while the other entity continued to be called the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], or just Israel.\n\nThe capital of the Kingdom of Judah was [[Jerusalem]]. All of the kings of Judah lived and died in Judah except for [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]] (who died at Megiddo in Israel), [[Jehoahaz of Judah|Jehoahaz]] (who died a prisoner in [[Egypt]]) and [[Jehoiachin|Jeconiah]] and [[Zedekiah]] who were deported as part of the [[Babylonian captivity]].\n\nJudah was conquered in 587 or 586 [[Anno Domini|BC]],<ref name=\"Barstad2008\">{{cite book|author=Hans M.

The Davidic line continued when David became king of the reunited Kingdom of Israel. When the united kingdom split, the tribes of Judah and Benjamin remained loyal to the Davidic line. Following the exile of Judah, the Davidic line was respected by the exiles in Babylon, who regarded the [[exilarch]]s as kings-in-exile.\n\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], additional details about the Kings of Judah were written by [[Visions of Iddo the Seer|Iddo the Seer]] and in the [[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]].\n\n==List==\nMost modern historians follow either the older chronologies established by [[William F.

Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the Bible with those derived from other external sources. These scholarly disagreements are reflected in the table above, which contains scholarly attempts to date the reigns of Judahite monarchs in terms of the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nBiblical scholars have noted the apparent inconsistencies in the chronology of the kings of Judah and Israel based on the biblical sources. Some have also pointed out the difficulties of cross-synchronising that dating with those of the other cultures of the area. Some have attempted to give as much historical weight as possible to the biblical sources, while others discount their reliability as historic sources, some even denying any historical value to the biblical sources at all.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nUsing the information in Kings and Chronicles, [[Edwin R. Thiele|Edwin Thiele]] calculated the dates of the reigns of the kings of Judah from the division of the kingdom, which he calculates to have been in 931&ndash;930 BCE. Thiele noticed that for the first seven kings of Israel (ignoring Zimri's seven-day reign), the synchronisms to Judean kings fell progressively behind by one year for each king. Thiele saw this as evidence that the northern kingdom was measuring the years by a non-accession system (first partial year of reign was counted as year one), whereas the southern kingdom was using the accession method (it was counted as year zero). He also concluded that the calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). This is the conclusion from cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms which often allows the narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king within a six-month period, identifying the difference as due to the calendar starting date. Once these were understood, the various reign lengths and cross-synchronisms for these kings was determined, and the sum of reigns for both kingdoms produced 931/930 BCE for the division of the kingdom when working backwards from the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC.\n\nThiele showed that for the reign of [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram]], Judah adopted Israel's non-accession method of counting the years of reign, meaning that the first partial year of the king's reign was counted as his first full year, in contrast to the \"accession\" method previously in use, whereby the first partial year was counted as year \"zero\", and \"year one\" was assigned to the first full year of reign. Thiele attributed this change to the rapprochement between Judah and Israel, whereby [[Jehoshaphat]], Jehoram's father, united with Ahab at the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and chose a daughter for his son from the house of Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|22:1-38|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|8:18|HE}}).<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'', 58.</ref> This convention was followed in Judah for the next three monarchs: [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]], [[Athaliah]], and [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]], returning to Judah's original accession reckoning in the time of [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]]. These changes can be inferred by comparison of the textual data in the Bible; however, the biblical texts do not explicitly state whether the reckoning was by accession or non-accession counting, nor do they indicate explicitly when a change was made in the method. Thiele's reckoning has been criticized as arbitrary in its assignment of accession and non-accession dating systems. The official records of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] show that he switched (arbitrarily) to non-accession reckoning for his reign, in contrast with the accession method used for previous kings of Assyria.<ref>Hayim Tadmor, ''The Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, King of Assyria'' (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1994) 232, n.3.</ref> Tiglath-Pileser left no record for modern historians to indicate which dating method he used, nor whether he was switching from the method used by his predecessors; this is instead determined by comparison of the relevant texts by Assyriologists, the same as Thiele did for the regnal data of Judah and Israel.\n\n===Co-regency===\nAdditional potential confusion arises from periods of [[co-regency]] when a son's reign may begin prior to the end of his father's reign. In those situations, years of reign are specified in terms of both the father and of the son. At times, the period of co-regency is clearly indicated, while in others it must be inferred from the source material.\n\nAs an example of the reasoning that finds inconsistencies in calculations when coregencies are ''a priori'' ruled out, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:10|HE}} dates the fall of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] (the Northern Kingdom) to the 6th year of Hezekiah's reign. [[William F. Albright]] dated the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to 721 BC, whereas [[Edwin R. Thiele|E. R. Thiele]] calculated the date as 723 BC.<ref>Edwin R. Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) pp. 134, 217.</ref> If Abright's or Thiele's dating are correct, then Hezekiah's reign would begin in either 729 or 727 BCE. On the other hand, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|18:13|HE}} states that [[Sennacherib]] invaded Judah in the 14th year of Hezekiah's reign. Assyrian records date this invasion to 701 BC, and Hezekiah's reign would therefore begin in 716/715 BC.<ref>Leslie McFall, \u201cA Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\u201d ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) p. 33. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link]){{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref> This dating would be confirmed by the account of Hezekiah's illness in chapter 20, which immediately follows Sennacherib's departure ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20|HE}}). This would date his illness to Hezekiah's 14th year, which is confirmed by Isaiah's statement ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:5|HE}}) that he would live fifteen more years (29&minus;15=14). These problems are all addressed by scholars who make reference to the ancient Near Eastern practice of [[coregency]].\n\nFollowing the approach of [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], another set of calculations shows it is probable that Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BCE. By Albright's calculations, [[Jehu]]'s initial year was 842 BC; and between it and Samaria's destruction the ''Books of Kings'' give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165&minus;120), has been accounted for in various ways; each of those positions must allow for Hezekiah's first six years to have fallen before 722 BCE. (However, Hezekiah beginning to reign before 722 BCE is consistent with a co-regency of Ahaz and Hezekiah from 729 BC.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne; although {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|HE}} states that he was twenty-five years of age, his father died at the age of thirty-six ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:2|HE}}) and it is not likely that Ahaz had a son at the age of eleven. Hezekiah's son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, suggesting Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nSince Albright and [[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman]], several scholars have explained these dating problems on the basis of a co-regency between Hezekiah and his father Ahaz between 729 and 716/715 BCE. Assyriologists and Egyptologists recognize that co-regency was practiced in both Assyria and Egypt.<ref>William J. Murnane, ''Ancient Egyptian Coregencies'' (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977).</ref><ref>J. D. Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) p. 1160.</ref> After noting that co-regencies were used sporadically in the northern kingdom (Israel), Nadav Na'aman writes, \n<blockquote>In the kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, the nomination of a co-regent was the common procedure, beginning from David who, before his death, elevated his son Solomon to the throne.... When taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century B.C.\"<ref>Nadav Na'aman, \"Historical and Chronological Notes on the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the Eighth Century B.C.\" ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 36 (1986) p. 91.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmong the numerous scholars who have recognized the co-regency between Ahaz and Hezekiah are Kenneth Kitchen,<ref>See Kitchen's chronology in ''New Bible Dictionary'' p. 220.</ref> Leslie McFall<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" p.42.</ref> and Jack Finegan.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 246.</ref> McFall, in his 1991 article, argues that if 729 BCE (that is, the Judean regnal year beginning in Tishri of 729) is taken as the start of the Ahaz/Hezekiah co-regency, and 716/715 BCE as the date of the death of Ahaz, then all the extensive chronological data for Hezekiah and his contemporaries in the late eighth century BCE are in harmony. Further, McFall found that no [[textual emendation]]s are required among the numerous dates, reign lengths, and synchronisms given in the Bible for this period.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" pp. 4-45 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link]).{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref> In contrast, those who do not accept the Ancient Near Eastern principle of co-regencies require multiple emendations of the biblical text, and there is no general agreement on which texts should be emended, nor is there any consensus among these scholars on the resultant chronology for the eighth century BCE. This is in contrast with the general consensus among those who accept the biblical and near Eastern practice of co-regencies that Hezekiah was installed as co-regent with his father Ahaz in 729 BC, and the synchronisms of 2 Kings 18 must be measured from that date, whereas the synchronisms with Sennacherib are measured from the sole reign starting in 716/715 BCE. The two synchronisms to [[Hoshea]] of Israel in 2 Kings 18 are then in agreement with the dates of Hoshea's reign that can be determined from Assyrian sources, as is the date of Samaria's fall as stated in 2 Kings 18:10. An analogous situation of two ways of measurement, both equally valid, is encountered in the dates given for [[Jehoram of Israel]], whose first year is synchronized to the 18th year of the sole reign of [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah in {{bibleverse|2|Kings|3:1|HE}} (853/852 BC), but his reign is also reckoned according to another method as starting in the second year of the coregency of Jehoshaphat and his son [[Jehoram of Judah]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|1:17|HE}}); both methods refer to the same calendar year.\n\nScholars who accept the principle of co-regencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found in the biblical material itself.<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'' chapter 3, \"Coregencies and Rival Reigns.\"</ref> The agreement of scholarship built on these principles with both biblical and secular texts was such that the Thiele/McFall chronology was accepted as the best chronology for the kingdom period in Jack Finegan's encyclopedic ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology''.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' p. 246.</ref>\n\n===Synchronism to fall of Judah===\nThe [[Babylonian Chronicles]] give 2 Adar (16 March), 597 BC, as the date that Nebuchadnezzar [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|first captured Jerusalem]], thus putting an end to the reign of [[Jeconiah|Jehoaichin]].<ref>D. J. Wiseman, ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.</ref>  Zedekiah's installation as king by Nebuchadnezzar can thus be dated to the early spring of 597 BC.\n\nHistorically, there has been considerable controversy over the date when Jerusalem was captured the second time and Zedekiah's reign came to an end. There is no dispute about the month, the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}). However, regarding the year, Albright preferred 587 BCE and Thiele advocated 586 BC, and this division among scholars has persisted until the present time. If Zedekiah's years are by accession counting, whereby the year he came to the throne was considered his \"zero\" year and his first full regnal year, 597/596, was counted as year one, Zedekiah's eleventh year, the year the city fell, would be 587/586. Since Judean regnal years were measured from Tishri in the fall, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of the city in the summer of 586 BCE. Accession counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Judah, whereas \"non-accession\" counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Israel.<ref name=Thiele /><ref>Leslie McFall, \u201cA Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\u201d ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.[https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe publication of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] in 1956, however, gave evidence that the years of Zedekiah were measured in a non-accession sense. This reckoning makes 598/597 BC, the year Zedekiah was installed by Nebuchadnezzar according to Judah's Tishri-based calendar, to be year \"one\", so that the fall of Jerusalem in his eleventh year would have been 588/587 BC, i.e. in the summer of 587 BCE. The Bablyonian Chronicles fairly precisely date the capture of [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]] and the start of Zedekiah's reign, and they also give the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar's successor [[Amel-Marduk]] (Evil Merodach) as 562/561 BC, which was the 37th year of Jehoiachin's captivity according to 2 Kings 25:27. These Babylonian records related to Jehoiachin's reign are consistent with the fall of the city in 587 but not in 586, vindicating Albright's reckoning.\n\n===Synchronism to Gregorian dating===\nFurther potential confusion arises from the convention of dating reigns of the Israelite kings in reference to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Years in the Gregorian calendar commence on 1 January, whereas year numbers for dating biblical events start on 1 [[Tishri]] of the [[Hebrew calendar]], with an unfixed  starting point during September\u2013October on the Gregorian calendar. Accordingly, an event which takes place after 1 Tishri, for example, in November and December on the Gregorian calendar, would fall in the following year in the Hebrew calendar used for biblical dating.\n\n==Coronation ritual==\nA detailed account of a coronation in ancient [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] is found in 2 Kings 11:12 and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 23:11, in which the seven-year-old [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]] is crowned in a [[coup]] against the usurper [[Athaliah]]. This ceremony took place in the doorway of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The king was led to \"his pillar\", where a crown was placed upon his head, and \"the testimony\" given to him, after which he was anointed at the hands of the high priest and his sons. Afterwards, the people \"clapped their hands\" and shouted \"God save the King\" as trumpets blew, music played, and singers offered hymns of praise.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Kings of Judah}}\n*[[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]]\n*[[Chronology of the Bible]]\n*[[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n*[[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)]]\n*[[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]]\n*[[Kingdom of Judah]]\n*[[Kings of Israel and Judah]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100928112915/http://www.dinur.org/1.html?rsID=219 The Jewish History Resource Center] Project of the Dinur Center for Research in Jewish History, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n*[http://www.complete-bible-genealogy.com/judah_israel_kings.htm Complete Bible Genealogy] A synchronized chart of the kings of Judah and Israel\n*[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-kings-of-ancient-israel Ancient Jewish History: The Kings of Israel] The Jewish Virtual Library provides a chart of the Kings of Judah and Israel, with academic dates\n\n{{Rulers of Ancient Israel}}\n\n[[Category:Kings of ancient Judah| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|400px|right|The genealogy of the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|kings of Judah, along with the kings of Israel]].]]\nThe '''Kings of Judah''' were the monarchs who ruled over the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]].

Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the Bible with those derived from other external sources. These scholarly disagreements are reflected in the table above, which contains scholarly attempts to date the reigns of Judahite monarchs in terms of the [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nBiblical scholars have noted the apparent inconsistencies in the chronology of the kings of Judah and Israel based on the biblical sources. Some have also pointed out the difficulties of cross-synchronising that dating with those of the other cultures of the area. Some have attempted to give as much historical weight as possible to the biblical sources, while others discount their reliability as historic sources, some even denying any historical value to the biblical sources at all.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nUsing the information in Kings and Chronicles, [[Edwin R. Thiele|Edwin Thiele]] calculated the dates of the reigns of the kings of Judah from the division of the kingdom, which he calculates to have been in 931&ndash;930 BCE. Thiele noticed that for the first seven kings of Israel (ignoring Zimri's seven-day reign), the synchronisms to Judean kings fell progressively behind by one year for each king. Thiele saw this as evidence that the northern kingdom was measuring the years by a non-accession system (first partial year of reign was counted as year one), whereas the southern kingdom was using the accession method (it was counted as year zero). He also concluded that the calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). This is the conclusion from cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms which often allows the narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king within a six-month period, identifying the difference as due to the calendar starting date. Once these were understood, the various reign lengths and cross-synchronisms for these kings was determined, and the sum of reigns for both kingdoms produced 931/930 BCE for the division of the kingdom when working backwards from the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC.\n\nThiele showed that for the reign of [[Jehoram of Judah|Jehoram]], Judah adopted Israel's non-accession method of counting the years of reign, meaning that the first partial year of the king's reign was counted as his first full year, in contrast to the \"accession\" method previously in use, whereby the first partial year was counted as year \"zero\", and \"year one\" was assigned to the first full year of reign. Thiele attributed this change to the rapprochement between Judah and Israel, whereby [[Jehoshaphat]], Jehoram's father, united with Ahab at the battle of Ramoth-Gilead, and chose a daughter for his son from the house of Ahab ({{bibleverse|1|Kings|22:1-38|HE}}, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|8:18|HE}}).<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'', 58.</ref> This convention was followed in Judah for the next three monarchs: [[Ahaziah of Judah|Ahaziah]], [[Athaliah]], and [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]], returning to Judah's original accession reckoning in the time of [[Amaziah of Judah|Amaziah]]. These changes can be inferred by comparison of the textual data in the Bible; however, the biblical texts do not explicitly state whether the reckoning was by accession or non-accession counting, nor do they indicate explicitly when a change was made in the method. Thiele's reckoning has been criticized as arbitrary in its assignment of accession and non-accession dating systems. The official records of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]] show that he switched (arbitrarily) to non-accession reckoning for his reign, in contrast with the accession method used for previous kings of Assyria.<ref>Hayim Tadmor, ''The Inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III, King of Assyria'' (Jerusalem: Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1994) 232, n.3.</ref> Tiglath-Pileser left no record for modern historians to indicate which dating method he used, nor whether he was switching from the method used by his predecessors; this is instead determined by comparison of the relevant texts by Assyriologists, the same as Thiele did for the regnal data of Judah and Israel.\n\n===Co-regency===\nAdditional potential confusion arises from periods of [[co-regency]] when a son's reign may begin prior to the end of his father's reign. In those situations, years of reign are specified in terms of both the father and of the son. At times, the period of co-regency is clearly indicated, while in others it must be inferred from the source material.\n\nAs an example of the reasoning that finds inconsistencies in calculations when coregencies are ''a priori'' ruled out, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:10|HE}} dates the fall of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] (the Northern Kingdom) to the 6th year of Hezekiah's reign. [[William F. Albright]] dated the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to 721 BC, whereas [[Edwin R. Thiele|E. R. Thiele]] calculated the date as 723 BC.<ref>Edwin R. Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) pp. 134, 217.</ref> If Abright's or Thiele's dating are correct, then Hezekiah's reign would begin in either 729 or 727 BCE. On the other hand, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|18:13|HE}} states that [[Sennacherib]] invaded Judah in the 14th year of Hezekiah's reign. Assyrian records date this invasion to 701 BC, and Hezekiah's reign would therefore begin in 716/715 BC.<ref>Leslie McFall, \u201cA Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\u201d ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) p. 33. ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link]){{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref> This dating would be confirmed by the account of Hezekiah's illness in chapter 20, which immediately follows Sennacherib's departure ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20|HE}}). This would date his illness to Hezekiah's 14th year, which is confirmed by Isaiah's statement ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:5|HE}}) that he would live fifteen more years (29&minus;15=14). These problems are all addressed by scholars who make reference to the ancient Near Eastern practice of [[coregency]].\n\nFollowing the approach of [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], another set of calculations shows it is probable that Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BCE. By Albright's calculations, [[Jehu]]'s initial year was 842 BC; and between it and Samaria's destruction the ''Books of Kings'' give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165&minus;120), has been accounted for in various ways; each of those positions must allow for Hezekiah's first six years to have fallen before 722 BCE. (However, Hezekiah beginning to reign before 722 BCE is consistent with a co-regency of Ahaz and Hezekiah from 729 BC.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne; although {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|HE}} states that he was twenty-five years of age, his father died at the age of thirty-six ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:2|HE}}) and it is not likely that Ahaz had a son at the age of eleven. Hezekiah's son [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]] ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, suggesting Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.{{fact|date=January 2018}}\n\nSince Albright and [[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman]], several scholars have explained these dating problems on the basis of a co-regency between Hezekiah and his father Ahaz between 729 and 716/715 BCE. Assyriologists and Egyptologists recognize that co-regency was practiced in both Assyria and Egypt.<ref>William J. Murnane, ''Ancient Egyptian Coregencies'' (Chicago: The Oriental Institute, 1977).</ref><ref>J. D. Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) p. 1160.</ref> After noting that co-regencies were used sporadically in the northern kingdom (Israel), Nadav Na'aman writes, \n<blockquote>In the kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, the nomination of a co-regent was the common procedure, beginning from David who, before his death, elevated his son Solomon to the throne.... When taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century B.C.\"<ref>Nadav Na'aman, \"Historical and Chronological Notes on the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the Eighth Century B.C.\" ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 36 (1986) p. 91.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmong the numerous scholars who have recognized the co-regency between Ahaz and Hezekiah are Kenneth Kitchen,<ref>See Kitchen's chronology in ''New Bible Dictionary'' p. 220.</ref> Leslie McFall<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" p.42.</ref> and Jack Finegan.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 246.</ref> McFall, in his 1991 article, argues that if 729 BCE (that is, the Judean regnal year beginning in Tishri of 729) is taken as the start of the Ahaz/Hezekiah co-regency, and 716/715 BCE as the date of the death of Ahaz, then all the extensive chronological data for Hezekiah and his contemporaries in the late eighth century BCE are in harmony. Further, McFall found that no [[textual emendation]]s are required among the numerous dates, reign lengths, and synchronisms given in the Bible for this period.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" pp. 4-45 ([https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf Link]).{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref> In contrast, those who do not accept the Ancient Near Eastern principle of co-regencies require multiple emendations of the biblical text, and there is no general agreement on which texts should be emended, nor is there any consensus among these scholars on the resultant chronology for the eighth century BCE. This is in contrast with the general consensus among those who accept the biblical and near Eastern practice of co-regencies that Hezekiah was installed as co-regent with his father Ahaz in 729 BC, and the synchronisms of 2 Kings 18 must be measured from that date, whereas the synchronisms with Sennacherib are measured from the sole reign starting in 716/715 BCE. The two synchronisms to [[Hoshea]] of Israel in 2 Kings 18 are then in agreement with the dates of Hoshea's reign that can be determined from Assyrian sources, as is the date of Samaria's fall as stated in 2 Kings 18:10. An analogous situation of two ways of measurement, both equally valid, is encountered in the dates given for [[Jehoram of Israel]], whose first year is synchronized to the 18th year of the sole reign of [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah in {{bibleverse|2|Kings|3:1|HE}} (853/852 BC), but his reign is also reckoned according to another method as starting in the second year of the coregency of Jehoshaphat and his son [[Jehoram of Judah]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|1:17|HE}}); both methods refer to the same calendar year.\n\nScholars who accept the principle of co-regencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found in the biblical material itself.<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'' chapter 3, \"Coregencies and Rival Reigns.\"</ref> The agreement of scholarship built on these principles with both biblical and secular texts was such that the Thiele/McFall chronology was accepted as the best chronology for the kingdom period in Jack Finegan's encyclopedic ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology''.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' p. 246.</ref>\n\n===Synchronism to fall of Judah===\nThe [[Babylonian Chronicles]] give 2 Adar (16 March), 597 BC, as the date that Nebuchadnezzar [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|first captured Jerusalem]], thus putting an end to the reign of [[Jeconiah|Jehoaichin]].<ref>D. J. Wiseman, ''Chronicles of Chaldean Kings in the British Museum'' (London: Trustees of the British Museum, 1956) 73.</ref>  Zedekiah's installation as king by Nebuchadnezzar can thus be dated to the early spring of 597 BC.\n\nHistorically, there has been considerable controversy over the date when Jerusalem was captured the second time and Zedekiah's reign came to an end. There is no dispute about the month, the summer month of Tammuz ({{bibleverse||Jeremiah|52:6|HE}}). However, regarding the year, Albright preferred 587 BCE and Thiele advocated 586 BC, and this division among scholars has persisted until the present time. If Zedekiah's years are by accession counting, whereby the year he came to the throne was considered his \"zero\" year and his first full regnal year, 597/596, was counted as year one, Zedekiah's eleventh year, the year the city fell, would be 587/586. Since Judean regnal years were measured from Tishri in the fall, this would place the end of his reign and the capture of the city in the summer of 586 BCE. Accession counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Judah, whereas \"non-accession\" counting was the rule for most, but not all, of the kings of Israel.<ref name=Thiele /><ref>Leslie McFall, \u201cA Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\u201d ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) 45.[https://web.archive.org/web/20030807124024/http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf]</ref>\n\nThe publication of the [[Babylonian Chronicles]] in 1956, however, gave evidence that the years of Zedekiah were measured in a non-accession sense. This reckoning makes 598/597 BC, the year Zedekiah was installed by Nebuchadnezzar according to Judah's Tishri-based calendar, to be year \"one\", so that the fall of Jerusalem in his eleventh year would have been 588/587 BC, i.e. in the summer of 587 BCE. The Bablyonian Chronicles fairly precisely date the capture of [[Jeconiah|Jehoiachin]] and the start of Zedekiah's reign, and they also give the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar's successor [[Amel-Marduk]] (Evil Merodach) as 562/561 BC, which was the 37th year of Jehoiachin's captivity according to 2 Kings 25:27. These Babylonian records related to Jehoiachin's reign are consistent with the fall of the city in 587 but not in 586, vindicating Albright's reckoning.\n\n===Synchronism to Gregorian dating===\nFurther potential confusion arises from the convention of dating reigns of the Israelite kings in reference to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Years in the Gregorian calendar commence on 1 January, whereas year numbers for dating biblical events start on 1 [[Tishri]] of the [[Hebrew calendar]], with an unfixed  starting point during September\u2013October on the Gregorian calendar. Accordingly, an event which takes place after 1 Tishri, for example, in November and December on the Gregorian calendar, would fall in the following year in the Hebrew calendar used for biblical dating.\n\n==Coronation ritual==\nA detailed account of a coronation in ancient [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] is found in 2 Kings 11:12 and [[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 23:11, in which the seven-year-old [[Jehoash of Judah|Jehoash]] is crowned in a [[coup]] against the usurper [[Athaliah]]. This ceremony took place in the doorway of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The king was led to \"his pillar\", where a crown was placed upon his head, and \"the testimony\" given to him, after which he was anointed at the hands of the high priest and his sons. Afterwards, the people \"clapped their hands\" and shouted \"God save the King\" as trumpets blew, music played, and singers offered hymns of praise.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Kings of Judah}}\n*[[Chronicles of the Kings of Judah]]\n*[[Chronology of the Bible]]\n*[[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n*[[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)]]\n*[[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]]\n*[[Kingdom of Judah]]\n*[[Kings of Israel and Judah]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100928112915/http://www.dinur.org/1.html?rsID=219 The Jewish History Resource Center] Project of the Dinur Center for Research in Jewish History, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n*[http://www.complete-bible-genealogy.com/judah_israel_kings.htm Complete Bible Genealogy] A synchronized chart of the kings of Judah and Israel\n*[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-kings-of-ancient-israel Ancient Jewish History: The Kings of Israel] The Jewish Virtual Library provides a chart of the Kings of Judah and Israel, with academic dates\n\n{{Rulers of Ancient Israel}}\n\n[[Category:Kings of ancient Judah| ]]\n", "name_user": "174.195.138.51", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHouse of God:Because GOD ruled it the world before anything existed even time)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_of_Judah"}

However this nomenclature and these categories of divisional play have only existed since 2006 and 1978, respectively.

Likewise, even after the formation of the NCAA, there was no differentiation into divisions until 1956, when play was separated in the upper \"University\" division and lower \"Collegiate\" division. In 1973, a three division reorganization occurred placing teams into NCAA Division I (highest), Division II, or Division III (lowest). In 1978, Division I was further subdivided into Division I-A (highest) and Division I-AA.

However this nomenclature and these categories of divisional play have only existed since 2006 and 1978, respectively. Prior to the formation of the NCAA in 1906, there was no differentiation between the level of play from one college to another, and thus all intercollegiate teams can be thought of as having played in the same division. Likewise, even after the formation of the NCAA, there was no differentiation into divisions until 1956, when play was separated in the upper \"University\" division and lower \"Collegiate\" division. In 1973, a three division reorganization occurred placing teams into NCAA Division I (highest), Division II, or Division III (lowest). In 1978, Division I was further subdivided into Division I-A (highest) and Division I-AA. In 2006, these subdivisions were renamed Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), respectively.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009FBS.pdf  | title=Official 2009 NCAA Division I Football Records Book | page=10 | publisher=The National Collegiate Athletic Association | date=August 2009 | location=Indianapolis, IN | accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref>\n\nThe following categories represent the historical equivalents of the highest level of play over the history of college football, and the subsequent tables list the teams for each season that went undefeated while competing in these highest categories:\n\n*uncategorized (pre-NCAA) 1869 to 1905\n*NCAA 1906 to 1955\n*NCAA University Division from 1956 until 1972\n*NCAA Division I from 1973 to 1977\n*NCAA Division I-A from 1978 to 2005\n*NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) from 2006\u2013present\n\n===Undefeated and untied===\nThese teams finished the season having won every game in which they played, thus completing a \"[[perfect season]]\".<ref name=CFDB/>\n\n====Pre-1900====\t\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\t\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\t\n!
