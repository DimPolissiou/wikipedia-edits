The [[Dragon Ball (manga)|initial manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', as well as [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named [[Bulma]], who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <onlyinclude>\n\nToriyama's [[manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (TV series)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|20 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996\u20131997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015\u20132018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]]. ''Dragon Ball'' is one of the top twenty [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchises of all time]], having generated more than {{US$|20 billion|long=no}} in total franchise revenue as of 2018</onlyinclude>.<ref name=\"sfchronicle\"/>\n\nSince its release, ''Dragon Ball'' has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 40{{nbsp}}countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80{{nbsp}}countries. The manga's 42 collected ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes have sold over 160{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more 250{{ndash}}300 million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, behind only ''[[One Piece]]''.<!-- This is referenced in the reception section below. --> Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular across the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global [[popular culture]], referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers across the world.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Dragon Ball story takes place on Earth where Goku goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, as well as aspiring to become a great fighter, and compete in multiple martial arts tournaments. Goku later stops the evil Red Ribbon Army, then 3 years later, thwarts the Grand Demon King Piccolo's plans for world conquest, afterwards he and his friends protect the Earth from the Saiyan invasion. The setting also goes to Planet Namek later on in the series for Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn to revive Goku's fallen friends from the Saiyan's attack, where they encounter Vegeta's higher ups, as well as the cosmic emperor, Freeza.\n\nThe ''Dragon Ball'' franchise is set in a [[multiverse]]<ref>''SOS from the Future: A Dark New Enemy Appears!'', [[Funimation]] dub</ref> composed of twelve{{refn|name=Multiverse|group=N|Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.}} numbered universes, each ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction. Almost all of the ''Dragon Ball'' series, except for parts of ''Dragon Ball Super'', takes place in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called \"Ages\", with most of the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790.\n\nUniverse 7 contains several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside, and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet Vegeta.\n\n''[[Dr. Slump]]'', an earlier manga series by Akira Toriyama, is set in the same multiverse.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters|Dragon Ball (manga)#Production}}\n[[File:Akira Toriyama.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Akira Toriyama]], the creator of ''Dragon

he added several characters like [[Master Roshi|Kame-Sen'nin]] and [[Krillin|Kuririn]], and created the Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai martial arts tournament to focus the storyline on fighting. It was when the first Tenkaichi Bud\u014dkai began that ''Dragon Ball'' truly became popular, having recalled the races and tournaments in ''Dr. Slump''.<ref name=\"Story\"/> Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments, Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory. He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game ''[[Kung-Fu Master (video game)|Spartan X]]'', in which enemies tended to appear very fast.

The [[Dragon Ball (manga)|initial manga]], written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 individual chapters collected into 42 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by its publisher [[Shueisha]]. ''Dragon Ball'' was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', as well as [[Hong Kong martial arts films]]. The series follows the adventures of the protagonist, [[Goku|Son Goku]], from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named [[Bulma]], who encourages him to join her quest in exploring the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls. <onlyinclude>\n\nToriyama's [[manga]] was adapted and divided into two [[anime]] series produced by [[Toei Animation]]: ''[[Dragon Ball (TV series)|Dragon Ball]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed [[List of Dragon Ball films|20 animated feature films]] and three television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled ''[[Dragon Ball GT]]'' (1996\u20131997) and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]'' (2015\u20132018). From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of ''Dragon Ball Z'' aired in Japan under the title ''Dragon Ball Kai'', as a recut that follows the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with [[List of Dragon Ball soundtracks|several collections of soundtracks]] and [[List of Dragon Ball video games|numerous video games]].

The manga's 42 collected ''tank\u014dbon'' volumes have sold over 160{{nbsp}}million copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more 250{{ndash}}300 million copies worldwide, making it the second [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, behind only ''[[One Piece]]''.<!-- This is referenced in the reception section below. --> Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential manga series ever made, with many [[Mangaka|manga artists]] citing ''Dragon Ball'' as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works. The anime, particularly ''Dragon Ball Z'', is also highly popular across the world and is considered one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global [[popular culture]], referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers across the world.\n\n==Setting==\nThe Dragon Ball story takes place on Earth where Goku goes on adventures to find the Dragon Balls, as well as aspiring to become a great fighter, and compete in multiple martial arts tournaments. Goku later stops the evil Red Ribbon Army, then 3 years later, thwarts the Grand Demon King Piccolo's plans for world conquest, afterwards he and his friends protect the Earth from the Saiyan invasion. The setting also goes to Planet Namek later on in the series for Bulma, Gohan, and Kuririn to revive Goku's fallen friends from the Saiyan's attack, where they encounter Vegeta's higher ups, as well as the cosmic emperor, Freeza.\n\nThe ''Dragon Ball'' franchise is set in a [[multiverse]]<ref>''SOS from the Future: A Dark New Enemy Appears!'', [[Funimation]] dub</ref> composed of twelve{{refn|name=Multiverse|group=N|Originally there were eighteen universes, but six of them were since erased by Zeno, a supreme deity.}} numbered universes, each ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Supreme Kais and Gods of Destruction. Almost all of the ''Dragon Ball'' series, except for parts of ''Dragon Ball Super'', takes place in Universe 7. Years in the timeline are called \"Ages\", with most of the story occurring between Age 749 and Age 790.\n\nUniverse 7 contains several planets, including a fictionalized Earth, where humans reside, and Planet Vegeta, the home world of the Saiyans, a powerful and destructive race. Many other races also inhabit Universe 7, including Angels, Demons, Androids, Tuffles and Namekians. Humans are among the weakest races in the universe. The protagonist Goku is raised as a human on Earth but finds out that he is actually a Saiyan from Planet Vegeta.\n\n''[[Dr. Slump]]'', an earlier manga series by Akira Toriyama, is set in the same multiverse.\n\n== Production ==\n{{See also|List of Dragon Ball characters|Dragon Ball (manga)#Production}}\n[[File:Akira Toriyama.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Akira Toriyama]], the creator of ''Dragon

It was recorded at [[American Sound Studio]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and released on 18 January 1969 by [[Atlantic Records]]. To make the album, Springfield worked with a team of musicians and producers that included [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Arif Mardin]], [[Tom Dowd]], conductor [[Gene Orloff]], backing vocalists [[The Sweet Inspirations]], bassist [[Tommy Cogbill]], and guitarist [[Reggie Young]].\n\n''Dusty in Memphis'' sold poorly on its first release, despite featuring one of Springfield's top-10 UK [[hit single|hits]], \"[[Son of a Preacher Man]]\". The album has since been acclaimed as her best work and one of the greatest records of all time, music critic [[Robert Christgau]] calling it \"the all-time [[Album era|rock-era]] [[torch song|torch]] record\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=October 1972|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/crm7210.php|title=The Christgau Consumer Guide|magazine=[[Creem]]|accessdate=3 March 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref> and included it in his \"Basic Record Library\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=0899190251|chapter=A Basic Record Library: The Fifties and Sixties|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/basics.php|accessdate=March 16, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com|title-link=Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies}}</ref> In 2001, it was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Anon.|date=n.d.|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/hall-of-fame|title=GRAMMY Hall of Fame|website=[[Grammy Award|GRAMMY.com]]|accessdate=3 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, the album was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref name=NRR-Mar2020>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=25 March 2020 |title=National Recording Registry Class Produces Ultimate 'Stay at Home' Playlist |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-20-023/ |website=Library of Congress \u2013 National Recording Registry |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=BBC-Mar2020>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=25 March 2020 |title=The Village People's YMCA is preserved for posterity |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/entertainment-arts-52033153 |website=BBC News |access-date=25 March 2020}}</ref> In its official press release, the library stated that despite its modest sales when first released, \"over time, 'Dusty in Memphis' grew in stature to become widely recognized as an important album by a woman in the rock era.\"<ref name=NRR-Mar2020/>\n\n==Writing and recording==\nHoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, Dusty Springfield turned to the roots of soul music. She signed with Atlantic Records, home label of one of her soul music idols, [[Aretha Franklin]]. Although she had sung [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs before, she had never released an entire album solely of R&B songs. She began recording an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where some notable blues musicians had grown up. The Memphis sessions at the [[American Sound Studios]] were recorded by the A team of Atlantic Records. It included producers [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Tom Dowd]] and [[Arif Mardin]], the back-up singers [[Sweet Inspirations]] and the \"house band\" of studio musicians, the Memphis Cats, led by guitarist [[Reggie Young]] and bassist [[Tommy Cogbill]].<ref name=memphis>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/230620/review/5944299/dustyinmemphis?rating=11|title=Dusty in Memphis. The Rolling Stone magazine}}</ref> The Memphis Cats had previously backed [[Wilson Pickett]], [[King Curtis]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. [[Terry Manning]] (also a recording engineer, but in this case a writer for the ''[[New Musical Express]]'') attended the recording sessions, and ended up assisting Dowd along with Ed Kollis. The songs were written by, among others, [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]], [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]], [[Michel Legrand]], [[Randy Newman]], and [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]].<ref name=marcus1>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/dustyspringfield/albums/album/230620/review/5945017/dusty_in_memphis|title=Greil Marcus.

She signed with Atlantic Records, home label of one of her soul music idols, [[Aretha Franklin]]. Although she had sung [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs before, she had never released an entire album solely of R&B songs. She began recording an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where some notable blues musicians had grown up. The Memphis sessions at the [[American Sound Studios]] were recorded by the A team of Atlantic Records. It included producers [[Jerry Wexler]], [[Tom Dowd]] and [[Arif Mardin]], the back-up singers [[Sweet Inspirations]] and the \"house band\" of studio musicians, the Memphis Cats, led by guitarist [[Reggie Young]] and bassist [[Tommy Cogbill]].<ref name=memphis>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/230620/review/5944299/dustyinmemphis?rating=11|title=Dusty in Memphis.

[[Terry Manning]] (also a recording engineer, but in this case a writer for the ''[[New Musical Express]]'') attended the recording sessions, and ended up assisting Dowd along with Ed Kollis. The songs were written by, among others, [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]], [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]], [[Michel Legrand]], [[Randy Newman]], and [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]].<ref name=marcus1>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/dustyspringfield/albums/album/230620/review/5945017/dusty_in_memphis|title=Greil Marcus.

Heading northbound in [[Twin Falls County, Idaho|Twin Falls County]], it passes through [[Rogerson, Idaho|Rogerson]] and [[Hollister, Idaho|Hollister]] towards [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]]. West of the city, US&#8209;93 turns and runs east&ndash;west for a few miles, parallel with [[U.S. Route 30|US&#8209;30]]. This section is Pole Line Road; the highway returns to its north&ndash;south orientation in Twin Falls at the intersection of Pole Line Road and Blue Lakes Boulevard.\n\nNorth of Twin Falls, US&#8209;93 crosses the [[Snake River Canyon (Idaho)|Snake River Canyon]] via the [[Perrine Bridge]], {{convert|486|ft}} above the water.  Approximately {{convert|3|mi|0}} north of the bridge, the highway intersects with [[Interstate 84 in Idaho|Interstate 84]] at Exit 173.\n\nFurther north in [[Shoshone, Idaho|Shoshone]], US&#8209;93 connects with the southern terminus of [[Idaho State Highway 75|State Highway 75]], the former route of US&#8209;93 to [[Ketchum, Idaho|Ketchum]] and over [[Galena Summit]](8,701 feet above sea level) to [[Stanley, Idaho|Stanley]] and [[Clayton, Idaho|Clayton]]. Present-day US&#8209;93 diverts in a northeasterly route to [[Richfield, Idaho|Richfield]], [[Carey, Idaho|Carey]], the [[Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve|Craters of the Moon]], and [[Arco, Idaho|Arco]]. Between Shoshone and Arco the highway runs concurrently with the east&ndash;west [[U.S. Route 26#Idaho|US&#8209;26]], and also with [[U.S. Route 20#Idaho|US&#8209;20]] between Carey and Arco.\n\nFrom Arco, the highway turns northwest and climbs the [[Big Lost River]] valley through [[Mackay, Idaho|Mackay]]. This section provides views of the [[Lost River Range]] to the northeast of the highway, including [[Borah Peak]], the highest point in the state at {{convert|12662|ft}} [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Mackay Dam and [[Mackay Reservoir (Idaho)|reservoir]] are on the southwest side of the highway.  The highway crosses the [[Willow Creek Summit]] at {{convert|7161|ft}} ([http://birice.vaisala.com/photos/02DA39EF_05C41D33_cam1.jpg web-cam]) and later descends into Grand View Canyon and heads into the city of [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]].\n\nUS&#8209;93 creates the northern terminus of [[Idaho State Highway 75|State Highway 75]] just south of Challis and takes over as the northern leg of the ''Salmon River Scenic Byway''.<ref>[http://www.idahobyways.gov/byways/salmon-river.aspx Idaho Scenic Byways - Salmon River] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922231545/http://www.idahobyways.gov/byways/salmon-river.aspx |date=2012-09-22 }}</ref> It descends with the [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]] as it winds north around the edge of the [[Lost River Range|Lost River]] and Lemhi mountain ranges into the city of [[Salmon, Idaho|Salmon]] at {{convert|4004|ft}}.\n\nContinuing north, the US&#8209;93 runs along portions of the [[Lewis and Clark Trail]]. The highway follows the descending northbound river until [[North Fork, Idaho|North Fork]] at {{convert|3620|ft}}, where the Salmon River makes a left turn to flow west across the state to [[Riggins, Idaho|Riggins]]. U&#8209;93 continues north, climbing the North Fork of the Salmon River into the [[Bitterroot Mountains|Bitterroot Range]], passing through the [[Salmon-Challis National Forest]] and Gibbonsville. The highway exits Idaho at [[Lost Trail Pass]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20090416040619/http://hb.511.idaho.gov/cameras/Lost_Trail_Pass.html web-cam]) at {{convert|7014|ft}} and enters [[Montana]] toward the [[Bitterroot Valley]].
