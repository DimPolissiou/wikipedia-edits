Splinter and the Ancient One arrive at the monastery, the former aggressively opposing the Turtles' affiliation with the Tribunal, because of their disinterest in aiding Hamato Yoshi against the Utrom Shredder that could have saved his life. The Tribunal proves to be aggressive and unrelenting in their training, brutally berating their acolytes for even aiding their wounded. The Tribunal finally reveals that the enemy they are preparing to face is in fact a Tengu demon that was the original incarnation of the Shredder, whose legend the Utrom Shredder manipulated to gain respect. The Tengu Shredder will be revived if his helmet and gauntlet are brought together with him, having been separated by the Tribunal millennia ago. Though the Turtles and acolytes retrieve all 3 relics, the Foot Mystics, revealed to be heralds of the Tengu Shredder, attack the temple, stealing the relics and seemingly killing the Tribunal and the Acolytes. The Turtles, Splinter and the Ancient One return to New York to prepare for the coming threat.\n\nThe Foot Mystics soon successfully revive the Tengu Shredder, who rampages through New York to kill Karai, who he deems an insult to his name due to her taking on the mantle in the last season. The Turtles manage to achieve a victory, repelling the Tengu Shredder and saving Karai from his wrath. However, the Tengu Shredder soon succeeds in transforming the island of New York into a hellish, Tengu-infested dominion of his; a fate which he intends to inflict upon the rest of the world. To combat this threat to Earth, the Turtles unite with the 4 acolytes (who are revealed to have miraculously survived the monastery's destruction), Hun and the Purple Dragons, the Foot Clan, Agent Bishop and the Earth Protection Force, the Justice Force, and several other allies of theirs to assault the Tengu Shredder's stronghold. After falling in battle, the Turtles are revived by Hamato Yoshi's spirit, and they manage to separate the Tengu Shredder from his helmet and gauntlet, rendering him vulnerable for Yoshi's spirit to finally end the demon's existence. The Ninja Tribunal reveal their survival as well, and recruit the Ancient One to serve on their tribunal. Karai parts with the Turtles on friendly terms, seemingly entering a relationship with Dr. Chaplin, and Splinter finally makes peace with the loss of his sensei.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]]: the leader of the Turtles.

Due to the multispecies population of the future, the Turtles are now free to move about openly and interact with everyday people. The season is lighter in tone and less violent than previous ones, with a greater emphasis on jokes.\n\nThe season was originally going to air one year later, but to try to increase interest in the series, [[4Kids]] and [[FOX]] started airing this season a year earlier instead of the \"Ninja Tribunal\" arc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This season became the fifth season to air on commercial television even though it was the sixth season produced. After the scheduling change was made, Mirage and its partners decided to finish production on the \"Ninja Tribunal\" episodes and release them directly to DVD. 4Kids Entertainment later signed a deal with Comcast and this season began airing on [[Comcast]]-On-Demand in August 2006. Thus mass confusion has ensued regarding which season is officially season five and which is season six. Chronologically this season comes after the \"Ninja Tribunal\" season.<ref name=\"TMNT FF Season Page\"/>\n\nThe episodes were released in partial season sets. Volume 1, named \"TMNT Fast Forward: Future Shellshock!\", was released on February 6, 2007, and had the first thirteen episodes, and volume 2, named  \"TMNT Fast Forward: Day of the Awakening\", was released on August 7, 2007, and had the remaining thirteen.\n\n==Story==\nDuring an ordinary day, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and the Turtles are suddenly transported through time to New York City in the year 2105 by Cody Jones, a descendant of [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] and [[April O'Neil]]. Cody intended to build a \"time window\", which could allow him to simply observe past escapades of the Turtles, but an unforeseen complication turned it into a time travel-capable machine, which is in disrepair after bringing Splinter and the Turtles to the future. At Cody's insistence, Splinter and the Turtles begin to live with him until the time window can be repaired, also contending with Cody's uptight robotic butler, Serling. However, during their time with Cody, the group comes into conflict with Darius Dunn, Cody's uncle and CEO of O'Neil Tech, who is in actuality a crime boss seeking to wrest complete control of the company from Cody. On several occasions, Dunn attempts to kill the Turtles, attempts that do not go unnoticed by them, who resolve to keep a wary eye on the villain, while Cody remains ignorant of his uncle's true nature.\n\nThe Turtles also gain a new nemesis in the form of Sh'Okanabo, an alien warlord who seeks to conquer the Earth so his species, the Kanabo, can reproduce and thrive on the planet. Sh'Okanabo enters a partnership with Dunn, both seeking to destroy the Turtles, and Sh'Okanabo creates the Dark Turtles, which are four malicious clones of the Turtles to battle them. Dunn also gives Sh'Okanabo the plans to Cody's time window, and the alien is able to manufacture a second one, but it malfunctions, creating a storm of time windows that transport beings from all across time in New York - resulting in a brief face-off between the Turtles and the Shredder from their time, before he is returned to his own time. The Turtles, Cody and Sh'Okanabo are briefly able to repair the villain's time window, but it malfunctions yet again, seemingly killing the alien warlord.\n\nTo his horror, Cody discovers his uncle's villainous nature when he uncovers a secret weapon factory that Dunn had kept hidden from Cody. When Dunn's plans are revealed, he faces off with Cody before fleeing in the wake of defeat, leaving Cody as the CEO of O'Neil Tech. Dunn quickly returns with a vengeance, hijacking Cody's Turtle X battle armor and going on a rampage. Serling manages to save Cody from his uncle, albeit at the cost of his own life, though he's soon repaired and converted into a second iteration of the Turtle X armor to better protect his young charge. Dunn goes into hiding with the Dark Turtles in the meantime.\n\nThe Turtles also discover that Agent Bishop has survived to 2105, thanks to his cloning-induced longevity. Bishop has undergone a change of heart after a lab accident which saw [[Baxter Stockman]] go missing, and instead of hunting aliens, he has become the President of the Pan-Galactic Alliance (or \"PGA\" for short), a [[United Nations]] type coalition between Earth and all peaceful alien races. Stockman is revealed to have survived the lab incident, and after nearly killing Bishop in retaliation, he reforms as well, entering a renewed partnership and friendship with his old ally. Bishop summons the Turtles to aid him in venturing to an Earth base on the Moon, which has lost contact with Earth. The group discovers that Sh'Okanabo survived the destruction of the time window, and has taken up residence on the dark side of the moon, plotting to block out the sunlight to engineer his \"Day of Awakening\", but is soon stopped by the combined efforts of the Turtles, Bishop and Cody.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]]: the leader of the Turtles.

Due to the multispecies population of the future, the Turtles are now free to move about openly and interact with everyday people. The season is lighter in tone and less violent than previous ones, with a greater emphasis on jokes.\n\nThe season was originally going to air one year later, but to try to increase interest in the series, [[4Kids]] and [[FOX]] started airing this season a year earlier instead of the \"Ninja Tribunal\" arc.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} This season became the fifth season to air on commercial television even though it was the sixth season produced. After the scheduling change was made, Mirage and its partners decided to finish production on the \"Ninja Tribunal\" episodes and release them directly to DVD. 4Kids Entertainment later signed a deal with Comcast and this season began airing on [[Comcast]]-On-Demand in August 2006. Thus mass confusion has ensued regarding which season is officially season five and which is season six. Chronologically this season comes after the \"Ninja Tribunal\" season.<ref name=\"TMNT FF Season Page\"/>\n\nThe episodes were released in partial season sets. Volume 1, named \"TMNT Fast Forward: Future Shellshock!\", was released on February 6, 2007, and had the first thirteen episodes, and volume 2, named  \"TMNT Fast Forward: Day of the Awakening\", was released on August 7, 2007, and had the remaining thirteen.\n\n==Story==\nDuring an ordinary day, [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and the Turtles are suddenly transported through time to New York City in the year 2105 by Cody Jones, a descendant of [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] and [[April O'Neil]]. Cody intended to build a \"time window\", which could allow him to simply observe past escapades of the Turtles, but an unforeseen complication turned it into a time travel-capable machine, which is in disrepair after bringing Splinter and the Turtles to the future. At Cody's insistence, Splinter and the Turtles begin to live with him until the time window can be repaired, also contending with Cody's uptight robotic butler, Serling. However, during their time with Cody, the group comes into conflict with Darius Dunn, Cody's uncle and CEO of O'Neil Tech, who is in actuality a crime boss seeking to wrest complete control of the company from Cody. On several occasions, Dunn attempts to kill the Turtles, attempts that do not go unnoticed by them, who resolve to keep a wary eye on the villain, while Cody remains ignorant of his uncle's true nature.\n\nThe Turtles also gain a new nemesis in the form of Sh'Okanabo, an alien warlord who seeks to conquer the Earth so his species, the Kanabo, can reproduce and thrive on the planet. Sh'Okanabo enters a partnership with Dunn, both seeking to destroy the Turtles, and Sh'Okanabo creates the Dark Turtles, which are four malicious clones of the Turtles to battle them. Dunn also gives Sh'Okanabo the plans to Cody's time window, and the alien is able to manufacture a second one, but it malfunctions, creating a storm of time windows that transport beings from all across time in New York - resulting in a brief face-off between the Turtles and the Shredder from their time, before he is returned to his own time. The Turtles, Cody and Sh'Okanabo are briefly able to repair the villain's time window, but it malfunctions yet again, seemingly killing the alien warlord.\n\nTo his horror, Cody discovers his uncle's villainous nature when he uncovers a secret weapon factory that Dunn had kept hidden from Cody. When Dunn's plans are revealed, he faces off with Cody before fleeing in the wake of defeat, leaving Cody as the CEO of O'Neil Tech. Dunn quickly returns with a vengeance, hijacking Cody's Turtle X battle armor and going on a rampage. Serling manages to save Cody from his uncle, albeit at the cost of his own life, though he's soon repaired and converted into a second iteration of the Turtle X armor to better protect his young charge. Dunn goes into hiding with the Dark Turtles in the meantime.\n\nThe Turtles also discover that Agent Bishop has survived to 2105, thanks to his cloning-induced longevity. Bishop has undergone a change of heart after a lab accident which saw [[Baxter Stockman]] go missing, and instead of hunting aliens, he has become the President of the Pan-Galactic Alliance (or \"PGA\" for short), a [[United Nations]] type coalition between Earth and all peaceful alien races. Stockman is revealed to have survived the lab incident, and after nearly killing Bishop in retaliation, he reforms as well, entering a renewed partnership and friendship with his old ally. Bishop summons the Turtles to aid him in venturing to an Earth base on the Moon, which has lost contact with Earth. The group discovers that Sh'Okanabo survived the destruction of the time window, and has taken up residence on the dark side of the moon, plotting to block out the sunlight to engineer his \"Day of Awakening\", but is soon stopped by the combined efforts of the Turtles, Bishop and Cody.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leo]]: the leader of the Turtles.

The success of the film garnered two direct sequels, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' in 1991 and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' in 1993. A [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) film titled ''TMNT'' was released in 2007 and built on the success of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003\u20132009 TV series]]. A fifth film by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Nickelodeon Movies]] was released on August 8, 2014, and served as a reboot to the original live-action films.

The buildings that were in use for this purpose - the Exchange Buildings and Mechanics' Institute - were proving insufficient for the city's needs. As a result, a group of shareholders was brought together by the city's [[mayor]], Samuel Smith, in 1849 for the purpose of building a music hall.{{sfn|James|1866|p=123}} \u00a316,000 of capital was raised, in \u00a310 shares and a site on the corner of Bridge Street and Hall Ings was chosen as the location of the hall.

The buildings that were in use for this purpose - the Exchange Buildings and Mechanics' Institute - were proving insufficient for the city's needs. As a result, a group of shareholders was brought together by the city's [[mayor]], Samuel Smith, in 1849 for the purpose of building a music hall.{{sfn|James|1866|p=123}} \u00a316,000 of capital was raised, in \u00a310 shares and a site on the corner of Bridge Street and Hall Ings was chosen as the location of the hall.

Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.<ref name=mommsen/>\n\nFrom his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.<ref name=mommsen/> He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.\n\nPetrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: \"My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.\"<ref>[[Petrarch]] (1343). ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', IX, 451-7. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.</ref> In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, 'better age', which they believed the world had entered. Later the term 'Middle Ages' - Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604) - was used to describe the period of supposed decline.<ref name=\"Albrow\">\nAlbrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.\n</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance Humanists such as Petrarch, but also added an [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature, but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as:  Popes ruling as kings, veneration of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.<ref>F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.</ref>\n\n===Baronius=== \nIn response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.<ref>[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}. \"Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries.\"</ref> The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as \"far surpassing anything before\"<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}</ref> and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as \"the greatest history of the Church ever written\".<ref>[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.</ref> The ''Annales'' covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198, and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term \"dark age\" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888<ref>Baronius's actual starting-point for the \"dark age\" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (\"Saeculum Obscurum\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019080028/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM |date=2009-10-19 }}, have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the \"lack of writers\" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.</ref> and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; clear:right;\"\n|+ Volumes of ''Patrologia Latina'' per century<ref>[[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (1882).

The \"lack of writers\" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.\n\n[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500\u20131500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.<ref>Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the \"Rise of the West\": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries\", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;409\u2013445 (416, table 1)</ref> The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]\n\nThere is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age', in Baronius's sense of a \"lack of writers\", between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of \"lack of writers\" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\nBaronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.\n\nThe first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages' which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the \"Epistle Dedicatory\" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: \"The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.\"<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.</ref> He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of \"St George's fighting with the dragon\" as \"a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry\".<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.</ref> Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or \"Age of Faith\", was therefore the opposite of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]].<ref>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). \"Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World\", in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. \"Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.\"</ref> [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Denis Diderot]],\n[[Voltaire]], [[Marquis De Sade]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion, while [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the \"rubbish of the Dark Ages\".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.</ref> Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a \"new age\", was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.\n\nConsequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages', used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word \"medieval\" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized \"Dark Ages\" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.<ref name=\"OED\"/> Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or alternatively to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.\n\n===Romanticism===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].<ref>Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.</ref> The word \"[[Goths|Gothic]]\" had been a term of opprobrium akin to \"[[Vandal]]\" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English \"Goths\" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an \"Age of Faith\". This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Chandler, Alice K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.</ref> The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.\n\nJust as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was largely the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.\n\n==Modern academic use==\n{{See also|Medieval studies}}\nThe term was widely used by 19th-century historians. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.<ref>Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.</ref> However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,<ref name=dmas/> or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of \"the lively centuries which we call dark\".<!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T.

The chapter opens: \"A popular if uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as \"the dark ages.\" If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Bl\u00fctezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity.\"</ref>\n\nMost modern historians do not use the term \"dark ages\", preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].

However, at this time the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify a geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nHowever, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.<ref name=dmas/> Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.

Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as \"far surpassing anything before\"<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}</ref> and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as \"the greatest history of the Church ever written\".<ref>[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906).

It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term \"dark age\" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888<ref>Baronius's actual starting-point for the \"dark age\" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (\"Saeculum Obscurum\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019080028/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM |date=2009-10-19 }}, have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the \"lack of writers\" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.</ref> and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; clear:right;\"\n|+ Volumes of ''Patrologia Latina'' per century<ref>[[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (1882).

The \"lack of writers\" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.\n\n[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500\u20131500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.<ref>Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the \"Rise of the West\": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries\", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;409\u2013445 (416, table 1)</ref> The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]\n\nThere is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age', in Baronius's sense of a \"lack of writers\", between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of \"lack of writers\" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\nBaronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.\n\nThe first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages' which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the \"Epistle Dedicatory\" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: \"The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.\"<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.</ref> He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of \"St George's fighting with the dragon\" as \"a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry\".<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.</ref> Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or \"Age of Faith\", was therefore the opposite of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]].<ref>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). \"Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World\", in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. \"Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.\"</ref> [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Denis Diderot]],\n[[Voltaire]], [[Marquis De Sade]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion, while [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the \"rubbish of the Dark Ages\".<ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.</ref> Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a \"new age\", was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.\n\nConsequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages', used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word \"medieval\" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized \"Dark Ages\" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.<ref name=\"OED\"/> Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or alternatively to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.\n\n===Romanticism===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].<ref>Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.</ref> The word \"[[Goths|Gothic]]\" had been a term of opprobrium akin to \"[[Vandal]]\" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English \"Goths\" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an \"Age of Faith\". This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Chandler, Alice K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.</ref> The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.\n\nJust as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was largely the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.\n\n==Modern academic use==\n{{See also|Medieval studies}}\nThe term was widely used by 19th-century historians. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.<ref>Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.</ref> However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,<ref name=dmas/> or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of \"the lively centuries which we call dark\".<!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--><ref>[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.</ref> More forcefully, a book about the [[history of German literature]] published in 2007 describes \"the dark ages\" as \"a popular if ignorant manner of speaking\".<ref>Dunphy, Graeme (2007). \"Literary Transitions, 1300\u20131500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern\" in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: \"Early Modern German Literature\".  The chapter opens: \"A popular if uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as \"the dark ages.\" If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Bl\u00fctezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity.\"</ref>\n\nMost modern historians do not use the term \"dark ages\", preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].

Canberra, pp. 81\u201382.</ref> because there are no extant historical texts in Greek from this period, and thus the history of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and its territories that were conquered by the Muslims is poorly understood and must be reconstructed from other contemporaneous sources, such as religious texts.<ref>[[Michael Whitby|Whitby, Michael]] (1992). \"Greek historical writing after Procopius\" in ''Byzantine and Early Islamic Near East'', ed.

Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], at the height of the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invasions, have been called \"the darkest of the Dark Ages\",<ref>[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] and Griffiths, Ralph (2000).

Further south and east, the same was true in the formerly Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify a geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nHowever, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.<ref name=dmas/> Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.

May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\".

The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker whereas the \"little low\" comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere.

After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man,\" with \"a gun against his head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\n\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\n\n===Guitar solo (2:37\u20133:05)===\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and originally composed by Mercury, later improvised by May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34651067|title=Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car'|last=May|first=Brian|date=29 October 2015|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\n\n===Opera (3:05\u20134:07)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg\n|title = \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\"\n|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.\n}}\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\". Also, on \"Let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\n\nLyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", while others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]\". According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!\", on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).\n\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\n=== Hard rock (4:07\u20134:54)===\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].\n\n===Outro (4:54\u20135:55)===\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"[[Deacy Amp]]\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\n\n==Lyrics==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\"{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\n{{quote box\n| salign = left\n| quote = It's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it. I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them... \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" didn't just come out of thin air.

In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"[[Basmala|Bismillah]]\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}\n\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".{{Sfn|Black|2002}}\n\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked\u2014Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David \"Diddy\" Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show.

The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\") in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.\n\nIn the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.<ref name=\"BillboardYE1976\" /> With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.<ref name=\"RPMTop100\"/>\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research. The song re-entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart after 16 years, reaching number two and spending 17 weeks on the chart, with a year-end chart position of 39.

A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'', since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \"Magnifico\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], a glare analogous to [[audio feedback]]. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on ''Top of the Pops'' in November 1975.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} After a few weeks at number one, an edit of the video was created.

The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of ''[[NME]]'' observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does.

'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that [[Pete Townshend|Pete Townsend]] [''sic''] used to tack on to the end of [[The Who|Who]] albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating.

It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] or the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].

They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed [[Folk music|folk]] influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".<ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".

As the heavy rock segment followed, the band would return to the stage.\n}}\nThe ''a cappella'' opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's ''a cappella'' opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the [[Hot Space Tour]], and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three members of the group during a live performance in Hanover. From left to right, John Deacon (stood casually), Roger Taylor (playing, sat at drum kit), and Brian May (appears to be playing intensely).

Behind that is a large set of multicoloured lights raised above the stage.|From left to right: Deacon, Taylor and May in concert in [[Hanover]] in 1979. Behind the drum kit is the [[tam-tam]] used at the end of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".]]\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the [[Sheer Heart Attack Tour|Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[A Night at the Opera Tour|A Night at the Opera]] tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"[[Killer Queen]]\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonh-ingham.blogspot.ca/2007/02/queen-riot-at-opera.html|title=Queen: A Riot At The Opera|author=Ingham, John|date=29 November 1975|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\n\nStarting with the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of [[pyrotechnics]] after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], with [[Elton John]] singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, [[Axl Rose]] singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.{{Sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Footage from the ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'' was used for the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005-6 tour]], and the [[Queen Rock Montreal|1981 Montreal performance]] used for the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]]. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience. Commenting upon this staging, Brian May says that they \"had to rise to the challenge of getting Freddie in there in a way which gave him his rightful place, but without demeaning Paul in any way. It also kept us live and 'present', although conscious and proud of our past, as we logically should be.\"{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\nSince 2012, May and Taylor have toured with former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant [[Adam Lambert]] under the name [[Queen + Adam Lambert]] (following two one-off performances together in 2009 and 2011), with \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" regularly included at the end of their set.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Simpson |title=Queen and Adam Lambert review \u2013 an unlikely union, but it works |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/14/queen-adam-lambert-live-review-arena-newcastle |newspaper=The Guardian |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |first=Ellise |last=Shafer |title=Queen and Adam Lambert Play the Hits, Pay Tribute to Freddie Mercury at L.A.

In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"[[The Prophet's Song]]\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.<ref>Freddie Mercury Interview, January 1976, ''Sounds''</ref>|Freddie Mercury, 1976}}\n\n{{quote|When we finished the album, the ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.|John Deacon, 1977}}\n\n{{quote|The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination.

Then we went out to eat dinner.\"  Guitarist [[Brian May]] said the band thought that Mercury's blueprint for the song was \"intriguing and original, and worthy of work\".{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} According to May, much of Queen's material was written in the studio, but this song \"was all in Freddie's mind\" before they started.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} In an interview during the band's Australian tour early in 1985, Mercury said, \"It was basically three songs that I wanted to put out and I just put the three together.\"<ref>{{cite av media|title=Freddie Mercury-Interview in Sydney 1985 (1080p) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2RoYpUoRkY |date=6 January 2014|website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nQueen spent a month rehearsing at [[Ridge Farm Studio]] in [[Surrey]] in mid-1975, and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] recalled that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was one of the songs the band worked on while they were at Ridge Farm.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jessica |last=Salter |title=Roger Taylor remembers rehearsing with Queen in 1975 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8344914/Roger-Taylor-remembers-rehearsing-with-Queen-in-1975.html |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2019}}</ref> Recording began on 24 August 1975 at [[Rockfield Studios|Rockfield Studio 1]] near [[Monmouth]], [[South Wales]], after a three-week rehearsal at [[Penrhos, Herefordshire|Penrhos Court]], near [[Kington, Herefordshire]]. During the making of the track, four additional studios (Roundhouse, [[Sarm East Studios]], [[Scorpio Sound]], and [[Wessex Sound Studios]]) were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} According to some band members, Mercury mentally prepared the song beforehand and directed the band throughout.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Mercury used a [[C. Bechstein]] concert grand piano, which he played in the promotional video and the UK tour. Due to the elaborate nature of the song, it was recorded in various sections.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} The piano was the same one [[Paul McCartney]] had used to record [[the Beatles]]' song \"[[Hey Jude]]\".<ref name=\"Horton\"/>\n\nBaker recalled in 1999:\n\n{{quote|\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was totally insane, but we enjoyed every minute of it. It was basically a joke, but a successful joke. [Laughs]. We had to record it in three separate units. We did the whole beginning bit, then the whole middle bit and then the whole end. It was complete madness. The middle part started off being just a couple of seconds, but Freddie kept coming in with more \"Galileos\" and we kept on adding to the opera section, and it just got bigger and bigger. We never stopped laughing...

In the end, eighth-generation tapes were used.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The various sections of tape containing the desired sub-mixes had to be [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|spliced]] (cut and assembled in the correct sequence). May recalled placing a tape in front of the light and being able to see through it, as the tape had been used so many times.{{Sfn|Classic Albums | 2006}} A similar story was told in 1977 by Taylor regarding the elaborate overdubs and sub-mixes for \"The March of The Black Queen\" for the album ''[[Queen II]]''.

May stated that he wanted to compose \"a little tune that would be a counterpart to the main melody; I didn't just want to play the melody\". The guitarist said that his better material stems from this way of working: in which he thought of the tune before playing it: \"the fingers tend to be predictable unless being led by the brain.\"{{Sfn | BBC| 2004b}} According to Baker, \"the end of the song was much heavier because it was one of the first mixes to be done with [[mix automation|automation]]... If you really listen to it, the ballad starts off clean, and as the opera section gets louder and louder, the vocals get more and more distorted. You can still hear this on the CD.

The lyrics question whether life is \"real\" or \"just fantasy caught in a [[landslide]]\" before concluding that there can be \"no escape from reality\".\n\nAfter 20 seconds, the grand piano enters, the song modulates briefly to E{{Music|flat}} major and Mercury's voice alternates with the other vocal parts. The narrator introduces himself as \"just a poor boy\" but declares that he \"needs no sympathy\" because he is \"easy come, easy go\" and then \"little high, little low\" (when heard in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]], the words \"little high\" come from the left speaker whereas the \"little low\" comes from the right); [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]] [[Outside (jazz)|side-slipping]] on \"easy come, easy go\" highlights the dream-like atmosphere. The end of this section is marked by the bass entrance and the cross-handed piano [[vamp (music)|vamp]] in B{{Music|flat}}.\n\n===Ballad (0:49\u20132:37)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody Mama.ogg\n|title = \"Mama, just killed a man\"\n|description = This sample features the distinctive piano phrase in B{{Music|flat}} and the first line of the first verse.\n}}\nThe piano begins in B{{Music|flat}} major along with the entrance of [[John Deacon]]'s bass guitar, marking the onset of this section. After it plays twice, Mercury's vocals enter. Over the course of the section, the vocals evolve from a softly sung harmony to an impassioned solo performance by Mercury. The narrator explains to his mother that he has \"just killed a man,\" with \"a gun against his head\" and in doing so, has thrown his life away. This \"confessional\" section, Whiteley comments, is \"affirmative of the nurturant and life-giving force of the feminine and the need for absolution\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} In the middle of the verse (1:19), Taylor's drums enter, and a descending chromatic run leads to a temporary modulation to E{{Music|flat}} major (up one fourth). The narrator makes the second of several invocations to his \"mama\" in the new key, continuing the original theme. The narrator explains his regret over \"mak[ing] you cry\" and urging \"mama\" to \"carry on as if nothing really matters\". A brief, descending variation of the piano phrase connects to the second verse.\n\nThen the piano intro plays, marking the start of the second verse. As the ballad proceeds into its second verse, the speaker confesses how ashamed he is by his act of murder (as May enters on guitar and mimics the upper range of the piano at 1:50). May imitates a [[bell tree]] during the line \"sends shivers down my spine\", by playing the strings of his guitar on the other side of the bridge. The narrator bids the world goodbye announcing he has \"got to go\" and prepares to \"face the truth\" admitting \"I don't want to die / I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.\" This is where the guitar solo enters.\n\n===Guitar solo (2:37\u20133:05)===\nTowards the end of the ballad section, the band builds in intensity, incorporating a guitar solo (in E{{Music|flat}} major) played and originally composed by Mercury, later improvised by May.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-34651067|title=Brian May on 40 years of Bohemian Rhapsody: 'I still listen to it in the car'|last=May|first=Brian|date=29 October 2015|website=BBC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The intensity continues to build, but once the bass line completes its descent establishing modulation to the new key (A major), the entire band cuts out abruptly at 3:03 except for quiet, staccato [[A major]] quaver (eighth-note) chords on the piano, marking the start of the \"Opera\" section.\n\n===Opera (3:05\u20134:07)===\n{{Listen\n|filename = QueenBohemianRhapsody_Opera.ogg\n|title = \"Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the fandango?\"\n|description = The operatic segment enters immediately as May's solo abruptly concludes. This vast shift in style is just one example of how the song rapidly changes throughout its running time.\n}}\nA rapid series of rhythmic and harmonic changes introduces a pseudo-operatic midsection, which contains the bulk of the elaborate vocal multi-tracking, depicting the narrator's descent into hell. While the underlying pulse of the song is maintained, the dynamics vary greatly from bar to bar, from only Mercury's voice accompanied by a piano to a multi-voice choir supported by drums, bass, piano, and [[timpani]]. The choir effect was created by having May, Mercury, and Taylor repeatedly sing their vocal parts, resulting in 180 separate overdubs. These overdubs were then combined into successive submixes. According to Roger Taylor, the voices of May, Mercury and himself combined created a wide vocal range: \"Brian could get down quite low, Freddie had a powerful voice through the middle, and I was good at the high stuff.\" The band wanted to create \"a [[Wall of Sound|wall of sound]], that starts down and goes all the way up\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The band used the [[bell effect]] for lyrics \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\". Also, on \"Let him go\", Taylor singing the top section carries his note on further after the rest of the \"choir\" have stopped singing.\n\nLyrical references in this passage include [[Scaramouche]], the [[fandango]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[The Barber of Seville (play)|Figaro]], [[Beelzebub]] and [[Basmala|Bismillah]], as rival factions fight over the narrator's soul, some wishing to \"let [him] go\" and \"spare him his life from this monstrosity\", while others sending him \"thunderbolts and lightning,/very, very fright'ning [him]\". According to ''Freddie Mercury: The Definitive Biography'' by [[Lesley-Ann Jones]]' theory: It is also figurative representation of the four members, Mercury, May, Taylor and Deacon respectively. The section concludes with a full choral treatment of the lyric \"[[Beelzebub]] has a [[devil]] put aside for me!\", on a block [[B-flat major|B{{Music|flat}} major]] chord. Roger Taylor tops the final chord with a [[falsetto]] B{{Music|flat}} in the [[scientific pitch notation|fifth octave]] (B{{Music|flat}}5).\n\nUsing the 24-track technology available at the time, the \"opera\" section took about three weeks to finish.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Producer Roy Thomas Baker said \"Every time Freddie came up with another 'Galileo', I would add another piece of tape to the reel.\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Baker recalls that they kept wearing out the tape, which meant having to do transfers.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}}\n\n=== Hard rock (4:07\u20134:54)===\nThe operatic section leads into a rock interlude with a [[riff|guitar riff]] written by Mercury. At 4:15, a [[double tracking|quadruple-tracked]] Mercury (in stereo, the four parts are panned two on the left and two on the right) sings angry lyrics addressed to an unspecified \"you\", accusing them of betrayal and abuse and insisting \"can't do this to me, baby\", before the final lines conclude that the singer \"just gotta get right outta\" an unspecified \"here\". Three ascending guitar runs follow. Mercury then plays a similar B{{Music|flat}} run on the piano, as the song builds up to the finale with a [[Andantino (music)|''ritardando'']].\n\n===Outro (4:54\u20135:55)===\nAfter Mercury plays ascending octaves of notes from the B{{Music|flat}} [[Key of D Mixolydian mode (scale)|mixolydian]] mode (composed of the notes from the E{{Music|flat}} scale), the song then returns to the tempo and form of the introduction, initially in E{{Music|flat}} major, before quickly modulating to [[C minor]], only to soon go through an abrupt short series of modulations, bringing it back to [[C minor]] again in time for the final \"nothing really matters\" section. A guitar accompanies the chorus \"ooh, ooh yeah, ooh yeah.\" A double-tracked twin guitar melody is played through an amplifier designed by John Deacon, affectionately nicknamed the \"[[Deacy Amp]]\". Mercury's line \"Nothing really matters{{nbsp}}...\" appears again, \"cradled by light piano arpeggios suggesting both resignation (minor tonalities) and a new sense of freedom in the wide vocal span\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} After the line \"nothing really matters\" is repeated multiple times, the song finally concludes in the key of E{{Music|flat}} major, but then changes again to F major just before it ends. The final line, \"Any way the wind blows\", is followed by the quiet sound of a large [[tam-tam]] that finally expels the tension built up throughout the song.\n\n==Lyrics==\n''[[The New York Times]]'' commented that \"the song's most distinct feature is the fatalistic lyrics\". Mercury refused to explain his composition other than to say it was about relationships; the band is still protective of the song's secret.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Brian May supports suggestions that the song contained veiled references to Mercury's personal traumas. He recalls \"Freddie was a very complex person: flippant and funny on the surface, but he concealed insecurities and problems in squaring up his life with his childhood. He never explained the lyrics, but I think he put a lot of himself into that song.\"{{Sfn|Black|2002}} May, though, says the band had agreed that the core of a lyric was a private issue for the composer.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} In a [[BBC Three]] documentary about the making of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", Roger Taylor maintains that the true meaning of the song is \"fairly self-explanatory with just a bit of nonsense in the middle\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\n{{quote box\n| salign = left\n| quote = It's one of those songs which has such a fantasy feel about it. I think people should just listen to it, think about it, and then make up their own minds as to what it says to them... \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" didn't just come out of thin air.

Why not?\n| source = \u2014Freddie Mercury{{Sfn|Davis|1993|p=20}}\n| align = left\n| width = 33%\n}}\n\nWhen the band released a ''Greatest Hits'' cassette in Iran, a leaflet in [[Farsi language|Persian]] was included with translation and explanations (refers to a book published in Iran called ''The March of the Black Queen'' by Sarah Sefati and Farhad Arkani, which included the whole biography of the band and complete lyrics with Persian translation (2000)). In the explanation, Queen states that \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is about a young man who has accidentally killed someone and, like [[Faust]], sold his soul to the devil. On the night before his execution, he calls for God saying, \"[[Basmala|Bismillah]]\" (\"In the name of God\" in Arabic), and with the help of angels, regains his soul from [[Devil (Islam)|Shaitan]] (the devil in Islam).{{Sfn|BBC|2004a}}\n\nDespite this, critics, both journalistic and academic, have speculated over the meaning behind the song's lyrics. Some believe the lyrics describe a suicidal murderer haunted by demons or depict events just preceding an execution. The latter explanation points to [[Albert Camus]]'s novel ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Stranger]]'', in which a young man confesses to an impulsive murder and has an epiphany before he is executed, as probable inspiration. Others believe the lyrics were only written to fit with the music, and have no meaning; the DJ, television entertainer and comedian [[Kenny Everett]], who played an influential role in popularising the single on his radio show on [[Capital London|Capital Radio]], quoted Mercury as claiming the lyrics were simply \"random rhyming nonsense\".{{Sfn|Black|2002}}\n\nStill, others interpreted them as Mercury's way of dealing with personal issues.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Music scholar Sheila Whiteley observes that Mercury reached a turning point in his personal life in the year he wrote \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=252}} He had been living with Mary Austin for seven years but had just embarked on his first love affair with a man. She suggests that the song provides an insight into Mercury's emotional state at the time, \"living with Mary ('Mamma', as in [[Mother Mary]]) and wanting to break away ('Mamma Mia let me go')\".{{Sfn|Whiteley|2006|p=253}} Others suggest it as veiled reference to [[coming out]], and dealing with the grave repercussions of the [[sodomy law]]s of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/is-queens-bohemian-rhapsody-actually-about-coming-out-guy-branum-book-excerpt/|title=Is Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" Actually About Coming Out? - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen US vinyl red label.png|thumb|One of Side-A labels of the US single release]]\nWhen the band wanted to release the single in 1975, various executives suggested to them that, at 5 minutes and 55 seconds, it was too long and would never be a hit.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bohemian rhapsody celebrates 40 YEARS: 19 things you didn't know about the queen anthem |url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/615750/Bohemian-Rhapsody-facts-Queen-40-years-anniversary |work=Express Online |date=30 October 2015 |access-date=28 September 2016}}</ref> The song was played to other musicians who commented the band had no hope of it ever being played on radio.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} According to producer Roy Thomas Baker, he and the band bypassed this corporate decision by playing the song for [[Capital Radio]] DJ [[Kenny Everett]]: \"we had a reel-to-reel copy but we told him he could only have it if he promised not to play it. 'I won't play it,' he said, winking ...\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Their plan worked\u2014Everett teased his listeners by playing only parts of the song. Audience demand intensified when Everett played the full song on his show 14 times in two days.{{Sfn|Chiu|2005}} Hordes of fans attempted to buy the single the following Monday, only to be told by record stores that it had not yet been released.{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} The same weekend, Paul Drew, who ran the [[RKO General]] stations in the States, heard the track on Everett's show in London. Drew managed to get a copy of the tape and started to play it in the States, which forced the hand of Queen's US label, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. In an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', Baker reflects that \"it was a strange situation where radio on both sides of the Atlantic was breaking a record that the record companies said would never get airplay!\"{{Sfn|Cunningham|1995}} Eventually the unedited single was released, with \"I'm in Love with My Car\" as the [[B-side]]. Following Everett's escapade in October 1975, [[Eric Hall]], a record plugger, gave a copy to [[David Hamilton (broadcaster)|David \"Diddy\" Hamilton]] to play on his weekday Radio One show.

The second was upon its re-release (as a double A-side single with \"[[These Are the Days of Our Lives]]\") in 1991 following Mercury's death, staying at number one for five weeks.\n\nIn the United States, the single was also a success, although to a lesser extent than in the UK. The single, released in December 1975, reached number nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of one million copies.<ref name=\"RIAA\" /> In a retrospective article, [[Anthony DeCurtis]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' explained why the song performed less strongly in the US charts by saying that it is \"the quintessential example of the kind of thing that doesn't exactly go over well in America\".{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} Its chart run of 24 weeks, however, placed it at number 18 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s year-end chart, higher than some number ones of the year.<ref name=\"BillboardYE1976\" /> With the Canadian record-buying public, the single fared better, reaching number one in the ''RPM'' national singles chart for the week ending 1 May 1976.<ref name=\"RPMTop100\"/>\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a double A-side cassette single with \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\" in January 1992 following the death of Freddie Mercury, with proceeds going to the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] for AIDS research.

A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as [[Pan's People]]. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on ''Top of the Pops'', since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song.{{Sfn|Black|2002}} He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at [[Dundee]]'s [[Caird Hall]] on tour and unable to appear on the programme anyway.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of [[Trident Studios]], their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to [[Elstree Studios]], where the band were rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by [[Bruce Gowers]], who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and [[assistant director]]/[[floor manager]] Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500.{{Sfn|Hodkinson|2004|p=192}} Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the end result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}}\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members in near darkness as they sing the ''a cappella'' part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Freddie. The composition of the shot is the same as [[Mick Rock]]'s cover photograph for their second album ''[[Queen II]]''. The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress [[Marlene Dietrich]], was the band's favourite image of themselves.{{Sfn|BBC|2004b}} The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the ''Queen II'' standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the [[Gong|tam tam]] in the manner of the trademark of the [[Rank Organisation]]'s [[Gongman]], familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\n\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed line \"Magnifico\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving [[optical feedback|visual feedback]], a glare analogous to [[audio feedback]].

The UK music papers reacted with bemusement, recognising that the song was original and technically accomplished, but they mostly remained indifferent. Pete Erskine of ''[[NME]]'' observed that, \"It'll be interesting to see whether it'll be played in its entirety on the radio. It's performed extremely well, but more in terms of production than anything else... Someone somewhere has decided that the boys' next release must sound 'epic'. And it does.

'Bohemian Rhapsody' is full of drama, passion and romance and sounds rather like one of those mini-opera affairs that [[Pete Townshend|Pete Townsend]] [''sic''] used to tack on to the end of [[The Who|Who]] albums\", before concluding, \"The significance of the composition eludes me totally, though I must admit to finding it horrifically fascinating.

He said it was \"unique at this point to hear a hit single in this style\", it was \"more accessible than other music of the genre\" and was \"able to communicate beyond the usual confines of the style\".<ref name=\"Eisentraut\"/> Author and progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe called it a \"remarkable\" single and said it \"provides a neat but coincidental bridge between prog in its prime and the move to more aggressive songwriting\", suggesting the song \"feels like a grotesque (although probably unintentional) parody of progressive rock\".<ref name=\"Lambe\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described it as \"either a prog-rock benchmark or the most convoluted [[novelty song]] ever recorded\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/668 668]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/668}}</ref> Writing for the [[BBC]] in 2015, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'}}s music critic [[Greg Kot]] called it a \"prog-rock pocket [[operetta]]\" and said the song's \"reign as a work of wigged-out genius rather than a dated gimmick testifies to its go-for-broke attitude\u2014one that has resonated across generations\".<ref name=\"Kot\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s music critic, [[Tom Service]], examined the song's relationship with the traditions of [[classical music]], describing its popularity as \"one of the strangest musical phenomena out there\":\n\n{{quote|The precedents of Bohemian Rhapsody are as much in the 19th-century classical traditions of rhapsodic, quasi-improvisational reveries\u2014like, say, the piano works of [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] or [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]] or the tone-poems of [[Richard Strauss|Strauss]] or [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]]\u2014as they are in prog-rock or the contemporary pop of 1975. That's because the song manages a sleight of musical hand that only a handful of real master-musicians have managed: the illusion that its huge variety of styles\u2014from intro, to ballad, to operatic excess, to hard-rock, to reflective coda\u2014are unified into a single statement, a drama that somehow makes sense. It's a classic example of the unity in diversity that high-minded musical commentators have heard in the symphonies of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] or the operas of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. And that's exactly what the piece is: a miniature operatic-rhapsodic-symphonic-tone-poem.<ref name=\"service\"/>}}\n\nComparison was also made between the song and [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 epic \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" by music writers [[Pete Prown]] and [[HP Newquist]]. They observed both songs were \"a slow, introspective beginning and gradual climb to a raging metal jam and back again\", with the notable distinction being \"while Zeppelin meshed [[Folk music|folk]] influences with heavy metal, Queen opted for the light grandeur of the operetta as part of its hard rock\". They said \"for sheer cleverness alone, not to mention May's riveting electric work, 'Bohemian Rhapsody' rightfully became one of the top singles of 1975 and established Queen in the elite of seventies rock bands\".<ref name=\"Prown/Newquist\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[The Economist]]'' described it as \"one of the most innovative pieces of the progressive rock era\".

Gracyk suggests that beginning the tape in the middle of the song after \"the lyrics which provide the song's narrative ... forces the film's audience to respond to its presence in the scene without the 'commentary' of the lyrics\".{{Sfn|Gracyk|2007|p=63}} Helped by the song, the soundtrack album of the film was a major hit.{{Sfn|Gracyk|2007|p=65}}\n\nIn connection with this, a new video was released, interspersing excerpts from the film with footage from the original Queen video, along with some live footage of the band. Myers was horrified that the record company had mixed clips from ''Wayne's World'' with Queen's original video, fearing that this would upset the band. He said, \"they've just [[Urination|whizzed]] on a [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]].\" He asked the record company to tell Queen that the video was not his idea, and that he apologised to them.

As the heavy rock segment followed, the band would return to the stage.\n}}\nThe ''a cappella'' opening was too complex to perform live, so Mercury tried various ways of introducing the song. When the song \"Mustapha\" became a live favourite, Mercury would often sub in that song's ''a cappella'' opening, which was easier to reproduce live as it was only one voice. During the [[Hot Space Tour]], and occasionally at other times, Mercury would do a piano improvisation (generally the introduction to \"Death on Two Legs\") that ended with the first notes of the song. Often, the preceding song would end, and Mercury would sit at the piano, say a quick word and start playing the ballad section.\n[[File:Hannover7907.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three members of the group during a live performance in Hanover. From left to right, John Deacon (stood casually), Roger Taylor (playing, sat at drum kit), and Brian May (appears to be playing intensely).

Behind the drum kit is the [[tam-tam]] used at the end of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\".]]\nInitially following the song's release, the operatic middle section proved a problem for the band. Because of extensive multi-tracking, it could not be performed on stage. The band did not have enough of a break between the [[Sheer Heart Attack Tour|Sheer Heart Attack]] and [[A Night at the Opera Tour|A Night at the Opera]] tours to find a way to make it work live, so they split the song into three sections that were played throughout the night. The opening and closing ballads were played as part of a medley, with \"[[Killer Queen]]\" and \"March of the Black Queen\" taking the place of the operatic and hard rock sections. In 1976 concerts where the same medley was played, the operatic section from the album would be played from tape as the introduction to the setlist. During this playback, Mercury would appear briefly to sing live for the line, \"I see a little sillhouetto of a man\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonh-ingham.blogspot.ca/2007/02/queen-riot-at-opera.html|title=Queen: A Riot At The Opera|author=Ingham, John|date=29 November 1975|accessdate=4 December 2014}}</ref> As the song segued into the hard rock section, the band would emerge on the smoke filled stage\u2014the playback would end at this point, and the hard rock section would be performed live (without the final ballad section, which appeared later in the set).\n\nStarting with the [[A Day at the Races Tour]] in 1977, the band adopted their lasting way of playing the song live. The opening ballad would be played on stage, and after Brian May's guitar solo, the lights would go down, the band would leave the stage, and the operatic section would be played from tape, while coloured stage lights provided a light show based around the voices of the opera section. Most playings of the opera section from the tape would often be accompanied by a portion of the song's music video containing the footage used for the operatic portion of the song. Other playings would be played over montages of footage filmed from the band members' other experiences throughout their daily lives. A blast of [[pyrotechnics]] after Roger Taylor's high note on the final \"for me\" would announce the band's return for the hard rock section and closing ballad. Queen played the song in this form all through the Magic Tour of 1986. This style was also used for [[the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], with [[Elton John]] singing the opening ballad and then after the taped operatic section, [[Axl Rose]] singing the hard rock section. John and Rose sang the closing ballad part together in a duet.\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was performed by [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] throughout their tours, accompanied by a video of Mercury.{{Sfn|Daily Telegraph|2008}} Footage from the ''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'' was used for the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour|2005-6 tour]], and the [[Queen Rock Montreal|1981 Montreal performance]] used for the [[Rock the Cosmos Tour]]. As with the Queen tours, the band went backstage for the operatic section, which was accompanied by a video tribute to Freddie Mercury. When the hard rock section began, the lights came back up to the full band on stage, including Rodgers, who took over lead vocals. Rodgers duetted with the recording of Mercury for the \"outro\" section, allowing the audience to sing the final \"Nothing really matters to me\", while the taped Mercury took a bow for the crowd. Rodgers would then repeat the line, and the final line (\"Any way the wind blows\") was delivered with one last shot of Mercury smiling at the audience.

In its early stages I almost rejected it, but then it grew. We started deciding on a single about halfway through. There were a few contenders\u2014we were thinking of \"[[The Prophet's Song]]\" at one point\u2014but then \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" seemed the one. There was a time when the others wanted to chop it around a bit, but I refused. If it was going to be released, it would be in its entirety. We knew it was very risky, but we had so much confidence in that song\u2014I did anyway. I felt, underneath it all, that if it was successful it would earn a lot of respect. People were all going, You're joking, they'll never play it, you'll only hear the first few bars and then they'll fade it out. We had numerous rows. EMI were shocked\u2014a six-minute single? You must be joking! The same in America\u2014oh, you just got away with it in Britain.<ref>Freddie Mercury Interview, January 1976, ''Sounds''</ref>|Freddie Mercury, 1976}}\n\n{{quote|When we finished the album, the ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' album, that was the track on it that we thought we were gonna release as a single in the UK first. And when we released it in Britain we didn't necessarily think it'd be released in America, cause we know even over here, you know, the AM tastes are even more [hesitates] stricter. Anyway we did have thoughts about even in the UK, perhaps editing it down at all, but we listened to it over and over again and there was no way we could edit it. We tried a few ideas, but if you edited it, you always lost some part of the song, so we had to leave it all in. And luckily it took off anyway.|John Deacon, 1977}}\n\n{{quote|The vocal harmonies was something we wanted to do from the beginning, as we are always keen to do that kind of thing. We wanted to be a group that could do the heaviness of hard rock, but also have harmonies swooping around all over the place. We thought there was some real power and emotion in that combination. The guitar solo was pretty much off the cuff, except I think I had plenty of time to think about that one. I remember playing along with it in the studio for a while when other things were being done.

It was released in 1981 on [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].\n\n==Recording==\nWith its radio-friendly sound and guest duets, Coe's previous album ''I\u2019ve Got Something to Say'' was an attempt to reach a wider country audience, and this process is continued on ''Invictus (Means) Unconquered'', with producer [[Billy Sherrill]] couching the songs in tasteful instrumentation that put the spotlight squarely on Coe's voice.  In his [[AllMusic]] review of the album, Thom Jurek calls the LP \u201carguably the finest album of his career\u201d<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-mysterious-rhinestone-cowboy-r637930/review |title=The Mysterious Rhinestone Cowboy \u2013 David Allan Coe |author=Thom Jurek |website=Allmusic |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>  and singles out Coe's vocals for particular praise:\n\n{{quote|True to form, Coe has always been underrated as a singer, and nowhere is this more evident than on ''Invictus''.
