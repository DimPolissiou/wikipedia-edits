Hall-Brown''' (November 1843 - August 1, 1907) was an American physician and writer.\n\nHall was a general practitioner and keen on education. She passed her early life in the Northwest, and in 1876, entered the [[University of Michigan]] for a medical course. Upon graduation in 1878, she served for six months as assistant physician under Dr. [[Eliza Maria Mosher]] at the [[Massachusetts]] Reformatory Prison for Women. She then pursued post-graduate work in [[New York City]] and [[London]], being the first woman admitted to clinics in [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London. Later, she became intern at the Royal Lying-in and Gynecological Hospital of Prof. [[Franz von Winckel]] in [[Dresden]]. Upon her arrival in Dresden, she knew scarcely any German, but after a month's study, she had acquired sufficient knowledge to warrant Dr. Winckel in admitting her to his hospital. On the completion of study and service abroad, in 1879, and while still in Dresden, she was appointed by Gov. [[Thomas Talbot (Massachusetts)|Thomas Talbot]], on Mosher's recommendation, resident-physician to the Massachusetts Reformatory and returned at once to take up the work. Later, she received but declined the appointment as superintendent.{{sfn|Kelly|Burrage|1920|p=480}}\n\nIn 1883, Mosher, being appointed professor of physiology, hygiene and resident physician to [[Vassar College]], asked to have Hall appointed to share the work, the two at this time starting a partnership, beginning their private work in [[Brooklyn]] and serving alternately at college. At the end of three years, Hall gave her entire time to practice in Brooklyn and continued so working until three years before her death.{{sfn|Kelly|Burrage|1920|p=480}}\n\nShe was a member of the [[American Red Cross|National Red Cross Society]] and also a delegate to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|International Red Cross]] Congress at [[Karlsruhe]] in 1887, and [[Vienna]] in 1897. She was also Fellow of the [[New York Academy of Medicine]], and vice-president of the [[American Social Science Association]]. She was a delegate to the International Congress of Medicine at [[Paris]] in 1900, and was frequently appointed by the New York Boards as an expert in [[medical jurisprudence]].{{sfn|University of Michigan|1907|p=76}}\n\n==Early years and education==\nLucy Mabel Hall was born in [[Holland, Vermont]].{{sfn|Kelly|Burrage|1920|p=480}}{{efn|Willard & Livermore state her place of birth was northern Vermont;{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=349}} Forbes notes [[Walden, Vermont]];{{sfn|Forbes|1895|p=133}} University of Michigan notes Wisconsin.{{sfn|University of Michigan|1907|p=76}} }} She was a descendant of Gov. Thomas Dudley of Massachusetts.{{sfn|Kelly|Burrage|1920|p=480}} Of [[New England]] ancestry, her family can be traced back to a titled ancestry in the Old World. Her education was begun in her native State, continued in [[Milton College]], [[Wisconsin]], and in the [[Dearborn Seminary]], [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], from which she was graduated.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=349}} She graduated with distinction from the Medical Department of the University of Michigan, in 1878; and studied medicine in London and [[Leipzig]].{{sfn|Forbes|1895|p=133}}\n\n==Career==\n===Physician===\nShe taught successfully for a few years, but soon after the death of her mother and father, she was persuaded by the family physician to begin the study of medicine. In the spring of 1878, Hall was graduated with distinction from the medical department of the University of Michigan, [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. She continued her medical observations in the hospitals and clinics of New York City, and later in those of London, where in St Thomas' Hospital, she was the first woman ever received at its bedside clinics. In Dresden, Germany, she was house physician in the Royal Lying-in and Gynaecological Hospital, under Prof. Winckel.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=349}}\n\nFrom there, she was called back to the United States, where she was appointed by Gov. Talbot, of Massachusetts, to the responsible position of physician to the State Reformatory for Women in [[Sherborn, Massachusetts]]. Connected with the prison was a hospital of 150 beds, likely to be filled from a body of from 300-400 inmates. \"Four years later,\" wrote [[Clara Barton]], \"it became my privilege, as superintendent of that prison, to observe how that duty was discharged by its resident physician. Perfect system prevailed. No prisoner could enter upon her term without a careful diagnosis of her physical condition and administration of the needful treatment. If any trace of mental trouble manifested itself, the case was closely watched and tenderly cared for. The most difficult surgical operations were performed, not only without loss of life but with marked success. The control of the doctor over her patients, and these included from time to time nearly every inmate, was simply marvelous, and her influence throughout the entire institution not less remarkable. Among all classes, she moved as one born to command, that most successful of all command, the secret of which lies in tact, conscious ability and sympathy with mankind. So long as that prison remains a success, so long will the influence of Dr. Hall's early administration and example for good be felt there.\" After nearly five years of service there, she was appointed superintendent by acclamation of the governor and his council. Though grateful for the honor, she declined the position, as its acceptance would necessitate the giving up of her medical work.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=349}}{{sfn|Massachusetts. Board of Commissioners of Prisons|1885|p=3}}\n\nSoon after that, she formed a partnership with her colleague, Dr. Mosher, and together they began to practice in the city of Brooklyn, New York. In the autumn of 1884, they were appointed associate professors of physiology and hygiene and physicians to Vassar College, resigning in 1887,{{sfn|Poppenheim|Poppenheim|2002|p=243}} very much to the regret of all concerned. During the same year, upon the occasion of the semi-centennial commencement of the University of Michigan, Hall, as first vice-president of the Department of Medicine and Surgery, was called upon to preside at the meeting of that body. As her colleagues, many of the most eminent physicians and professors of the land were present. Afterward one of them remarked: \"I had predicted that fifty years after the admission of women, a scene like this might occur. My prophecy has been anticipated by more than thirty years.\"{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=350}}\n\nIn the fall of 1887, she was appointed central committee delegate to the fourth International Conference of the [[Red Cross]], of [[Geneva]], held in Karlsruhe, Germany. By invitation she was a guest at the court of their Royal Highnesses, the [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke]] and [[Princess Louise of Prussia|Grand Duchess of Baden]]. That high conference brought Hall into contact with very many of the most noted personages of the European courts, and that for a series of royal occasions and a length of time sufficient to challenge the scrutiny of the most critical. She passed not only unscathed, but with the highest commendations, everywhere doing honor to the U.S. and to American women. Her elegance of bearing was a subject of personal remark. The respect of Her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess, was marked and thoughtfully manifested by the appreciative gifts bestowed as tokens of remembrance.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=350}} Her standing in medical jurisprudence was recognized by the courts of justice in New York and she was often, called as an expert by the Supreme Court to take charge of examinations instituted by that tribunal.{{sfn|Kelly|Burrage|1920|p=480}}\n\nAfter relocating to [[Los Angeles, California]], she made a visit to Japan, where characteristically she visited hospitals, schools, missions, prisons and police courts. So highly was her interest valued that, on leaving, she was urged by the officials of medical and public education in that empire to return and lecture on physiology and hygiene. The invitation was a great compliment, and she returned for several months in 1907, lecturing in leading institutions in the great cities.{{sfn|Kelly|Burrage|1920|p=480}} In a letter to a Brooklyn friend, quoted in the ''Brooklyn Eagle'', she wrote:\u2014{{sfn|Pilcher|Overton|1907|p=264}}\n{{quote|text=\"To-morrow I go to [[Yokohama]], to talk to a girls' club, foreign this time. I shall feel queerly to find myself talking to any girls not Japanese.

A few days ago a gentleman, his uniform all a-glitter with orders, drove up and sent in his card. Baron Dr. Ishigaro; I met him just twenty years ago at a Red Cross conference, at Carlsruhe. He is now a very great man, and was lately decorated anew by the Emperor. He is a member of parliament. He begged to be allowed to do anything possible for me while I remain in Japan. A number of titled people have called, and I have visited them. It has been of interest to see this side of Japanese high life, and I have enjoyed it very much, but after all the real pleasure has been in getting a hold of these bright-eyed, hungrybrained, vivid and determined young Japanese women, and, more than all these, they are the ones who will give\" this sturdy and brilliant nation the final touches needed to bring them up to a full realization of the ideals for which they are reaching and struggling. High and low, I love these people more every day. They are kind, cheerful, glad to serve you for the smallest favor with a sturdy, honest pride.\"}}\n\n===Writer===\nAs a writer, Hall contributed many articles upon health topics to the best magazines and other periodicals of the day.

Jacobi also received a bronze medal for her thesis. Her studies in Paris coincided with the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. In ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'' of August 1871, she published an account of the new French political leadership that came to power following the war.\n\nAfter five years of studying in Paris, Jacobi returned to the United States in the fall of 1871. Moving back to New York City, Jacobi established her own private medical practice. Jacobi also participated in research and became a professor in the new Women's Medical College of the New York Infirmary and Mount Sinai Hospital.<ref name=\":4\" /> Jacobi became the second woman member of the Medical Society of the County of New York, was admitted to the [[American Medical Association]]. In 1872 she helped to found the [[Women's Medical Association of New York City]],<ref name=Swaby /> and served as its president from 1874 to 1903. She campaigned consistently for leading [[medical school]]s, like [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins]], to admit women students.<ref name=\":1\" /> Her teaching at the Medical College tended to exceed what her students were prepared for and led her to resign in 1888. Dr. Jacobi was highly revered during her lifetime as the most accomplished woman physician.\n\nIn 1873, she married [[Abraham Jacobi]], a New York physician and researcher, nowadays often referred to as the \"father of American pediatrics.\" They had three children, two daughters, and one son. Mary and Abraham's first daughter died at birth and their only son died at the age of seven. Abraham and Mary had only one child who survived to adulthood, their daughter Marjorie Jacobi McAneny. Jacobi educated her daughter herself according to her own educational theories.\n\nShe received [[Harvard University]]'s Boylston Prize in 1876 for an original essay, ''The Question of Rest for Women during Menstruation''.<ref name=Swaby /> Jacobi's paper was a response to [[Edward Hammond Clarke|Dr. Edward H.

Ella Whipple''' (January 20, 1851 - March 23, 1924) was a physician.\n\n==Early life==\nElla Whipple Marsh was born in [[Batavia, Illinois]], on January 20, 1851. Her parents were both of English descent, her father being a lineal descendant of [[William Whipple]] who was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Her father was born and raised in [[Chautauqua County, New York]], and her mother was born in New Jersey and raised in [[Orange County, New York]]. They both moved to Illinois, where they were married. In 1852 they started across the plains by ox team to Oregon, being six months on the way.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nHer mother was a teacher for many years and wrote for the papers of the day. Dr. Whipple's early childhood was spent on a farm. She was studious, industrious and persevering, and always at the head in school work. Her schooldays were spent in [[Vancouver, Washington]], where her parents went to educate their children.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nShe was graduated in 1870 from Vancouver Seminary. Two years later she received the degree of B.S. from [[Willamette University]], and had also completed the normal course in that institution.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\n==Career==\nThe nine years following her B.S. were spent in teaching in the schools of Oregon and Washington, where she acquired the reputation of a very successful teacher. She was for two years preceptress of Baker City Academy, and later was principal of the Astoria public schools.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nDeciding to prepare herself for the medical profession, she gave up teaching and, after a three-year course of study, was graduated with honors from the medical department of the Willamette University in 1883. She received the advantage of special study and hospital practice in the sanitarium in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]. She was an active practitioner in Vancouver, until she moved to [[Pasadena, California]], in 1888.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nShe was identified with the religious, temperance, philanthropic and educational interests of every place where she resided. For ten years before the granting of equal suffrage Dr Whipple was a stanch worker in the [[Women's Suffrage]] field and shared largely in the honors and benefits gained by suffrage in Washington. She was twice a delegate to the Clarke county Republican convention in 1884 and 1886, and twice a delegate to the Territorial Republican convention in the same year. In the first convention she was on the committee on resolutions, and in the second convention was chairman of the committee on platform. In the Clark county convention, in 1884, she was nominated for superintendent of public schools and was elected by a large majority, although there were three tickets in the field. She discharged the duties of her office in such a way as to win the respect and confidence of political opponents as well as friends.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nShe had at different times occupied every official position to which a layman is eligible in the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]], of which she was an earnest member, being thrice a delegate to the lay electoral conferences of 1874 and 1878.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nDuring her term as superintendent of public schools the Clarke County Normal Institute was organized.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nShe was active in [[Temperance movement]], having been a [[Good Templar]] for many years and occupied nearly all the high and responsible positions in that order.<ref name=\"Willard\" />\n\nShe was active in the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] since the organization of Oregon and Washington, and again in California.

However, in 1853, when male students complained about having to study with a woman, the Illinois Medical Society vetoed her admission. She was accepted by the Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and earned her [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1854.

Despite their efforts, the Western Reserve faculty voted to put an end to Delamater's policies in 1856, finding it \"inexpedient\" to continue admitting women. (The [[American Medical Association]] also adopted a report in 1856 advising against [[coeducation]] in medicine.) Western Reserve resumed admitting women in 1879, but did so only sporadically for five years. Admission of women at Western Reserve recommenced on a continuous basis in 1918.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Webster's Dictionary of American Women'', {{ISBN|0-7651-9793-6}}.\n*{{cite web|last1=Blackwell|first1=Emily|title=Blackwell, Emily|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/12/12-01021.html?a=1&n=blackwell%2C%20emily&d=10&ss=0&q=1|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Loue|first1=edited by Sana|last2=Sajatovic|first2=edited by Martha|last3=Cain|first3=Tambra|title=Encyclopedia of woment's health|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0306480737|chapter=Blackwell, Elizabeth|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_w3z3}}\n*{{cite book |first=Edward C |last=Atwater |title=Women Medical Doctors in the United States before the Civil War: A Biographical Dictionary |year=2016 |oclc=945359277 |location=Rochester, NY |publisher=University of Rochester Press |ref=harv |isbn=9781580465717}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=no|n=no|v=no|b=no|wikt=no|q=no|s=Author:Emily Blackwell|d=Q1337584|c=Category:Emily Blackwell}}\n*[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_36.html Changing the Face of Medicine] \u2014 at NIH\n*[http://casemed.case.edu/student_affairs/enrichprog/blackwell.html The Emily Blackwell Society] \u2014 at Case Western\n*[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:RAD.SCHL:sch00050 Papers, 1832\u20131981.] [http://radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library Schlesinger Library], Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University.\n*{{findagrave|8611502}}\n\n{{National Women's Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blackwell, Emily}}\n[[Category:1826 births]]\n[[Category:1910 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century American physicians]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:American feminists]]\n[[Category:American hospital administrators]]\n[[Category:American obstetricians]]\n[[Category:Blackwell family]]\n[[Category:Case Western Reserve University alumni]]\n[[Category:English women medical doctors]]\n[[Category:History of women's rights in the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Sanitary Commission people]]\n[[Category:Women in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:19th-century American women physicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical person\n|name              = Emily Blackwell, M.D.\n|image             = Emily Blackwell.jpg\n|image_size        = \n|alt               = \n|caption           = \n|birth_date        = October 8, 1826\n|birth_place       = [[Bristol]], [[England]]\n|death_date        = {{death date and age|1910|9|7|1826|10|8}}\n|death_place       = [[York, Maine]]\n|profession        = Physician\n|specialism        = \n|research_field    = \n|known_for         = \n|years_active      = \n|education         = \n|alma mater        = [[Case Western Reserve University]]\n|work_institutions = \n|prizes            = \n|signature         = \n}}\n\n'''Emily Blackwell''' (October 8, 1826 \u2013 September 7, 1910) was the second woman to earn a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] at what is now [[Case Western Reserve University]], and the third woman (after [[Elizabeth Blackwell]] and [[Lydia Folger Fowler]]) to earn a medical degree in the United States.<ref>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_36.html/ \"Dr. Emily Blackwell.\"] Retrieved: October 23, 2013.</ref>  In 1993, she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]].<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/emily-blackwell/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Emily Blackwell]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nBlackwell was born on October 8, 1826 in [[Bristol]], [[England]].

Emily and Elizabeth Blackwell and [[Mary Livermore]] also played an important role in the development of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]].\n\n[[File:Dr. Emily Blackwell, ca. 1860s.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, ca. 1860s]]\n\nAfter the war, in 1868 the Blackwell sisters established the Women's Medical College in [[New York City]]. Emily became professor of obstetrics and, in 1869, when Elizabeth moved to [[London]] to help form the [[London School of Medicine for Women]], became dean of the college. In 1876 it became a three-year institution, and in 1893 it became a four-year college, ahead of much of the profession. By 1899 the college had trained 364 women doctors.\n\n[[File:I Blackwell and Cushier House, Montclair, NJ.jpg|thumb|Blackwell and Cushier's house in Montclair, NJ]]\n\nFrom 1883, Blackwell lived with her partner [[Elizabeth Cushier]], who also served as a doctor at the infirmary.<ref>{{cite book|author=Faderman, Lillian|authorlink=Lillian Faderman|title=To Believe in Women|url=https://books.google.com/?id=usIdCy63Y9sC&pg=PA400&dq=emily+blackwell#v=snippet&q=%22emily%20blackwell%22&f=false|year=2000|publisher=Mariner Books|isbn=978-0-618-05697-2|pages=6, 289\u2013290}}</ref> Blackwell and Cushier retired at the turn of the century.

After being rejected by several other schools, she was finally accepted in 1853 by [[Rush Medical College]] in [[Chicago]]. However, in 1853, when male students complained about having to study with a woman, the Illinois Medical Society vetoed her admission. She was accepted by the Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and earned her [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1854. She subsequently pursued further studies in [[Edinburgh]] under Sir [[James Young Simpson]], in London under Dr. [[William Jenner, 1st Baronet|William Jenner]], and in [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], and [[Dresden]].\n \t\n[[File:NYinfirmary.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary. [Announcement, 1868\u201369].]]\nAt Western Reserve University, the medical education of men began at the urging of reform-minded Dean John Delamater, who was backed by the Ohio Female Medical Education Society, formed in 1852 to provide moral and financial support for the women medical students. Despite their efforts, the Western Reserve faculty voted to put an end to Delamater's policies in 1856, finding it \"inexpedient\" to continue admitting women. (The [[American Medical Association]] also adopted a report in 1856 advising against [[coeducation]] in medicine.) Western Reserve resumed admitting women in 1879, but did so only sporadically for five years. Admission of women at Western Reserve recommenced on a continuous basis in 1918.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''Webster's Dictionary of American Women'', {{ISBN|0-7651-9793-6}}.\n*{{cite web|last1=Blackwell|first1=Emily|title=Blackwell, Emily|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/12/12-01021.html?a=1&n=blackwell%2C%20emily&d=10&ss=0&q=1|website=American National Biography Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Loue|first1=edited by Sana|last2=Sajatovic|first2=edited by Martha|last3=Cain|first3=Tambra|title=Encyclopedia of woment's health|date=2004|publisher=Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0306480737|chapter=Blackwell, Elizabeth|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofwo0000unse_w3z3}}\n*{{cite book |first=Edward C |last=Atwater |title=Women Medical Doctors in the United States before the Civil War: A Biographical Dictionary |year=2016 |oclc=945359277 |location=Rochester, NY |publisher=University of Rochester Press |ref=harv |isbn=9781580465717}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|voy=no|n=no|v=no|b=no|wikt=no|q=no|s=Author:Emily Blackwell|d=Q1337584|c=Category:Emily Blackwell}}\n*[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_36.html Changing the Face of Medicine] \u2014 at NIH\n*[http://casemed.case.edu/student_affairs/enrichprog/blackwell.html The Emily Blackwell Society] \u2014 at Case Western\n*[http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:RAD.SCHL:sch00050 Papers, 1832\u20131981.] [http://radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library Schlesinger Library], Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University.\n*{{findagrave|8611502}}\n\n{{National Women's Hall of Fame}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blackwell, Emily}}\n[[Category:1826 births]]\n[[Category:1910 deaths]]\n[[Category:19th-century American physicians]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:American feminists]]\n[[Category:American hospital administrators]]\n[[Category:American obstetricians]]\n[[Category:American women physicians]]\n[[Category:Blackwell family]]\n[[Category:Case Western Reserve University alumni]]\n[[Category:English women medical doctors]]\n[[Category:History of women's rights in the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Sanitary Commission people]]\n[[Category:Women in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:19th-century American women physicians]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing fromCategory:American women physiciansusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Blackwell"}

From girlhood, she took an active interest in any movement calculated to advance the interests of women. Interested in literary and philanthropic work, Marble served as president of the [[District of Columbia]] Federation Womans' Clubs, numbering ten societies and 2,500 members (\"Pro Re Noto,\" \"Womans' National Press Association,\" \"Womans' Relief Corps,\" \"20th Century Club of Unitarian Church,\" Civic Center,\" \"Ladies' Auxiliary Board of Emergency Hospital,\" \"Travel Club,\" \"Sons and Daughters of [[Maine]],\" \"District Womans' Suffrage Association\"); president, District Federal; vice-president, Womans' National Press Association for state of Maine; president, Minnesota State Suffrage Association; president, [[Minneapolis]] City Suffrage Association; president, Washington City Suffrage Association; Secretary, Pro Re Noto; and secretary, White Cross Society of Minneapolis.{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}\n\nDuring these years Marble was public lecturer on philanthropic and educational topics; member of editorial staff of Washington daily paper in 1889; established the first gymnasium for women and children in Washington, D.

The mother died when Marble was nine years of age. She was her father's housekeeper from the age of 12 until she was 17.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=492}} Living a rugged, healthful life during her girlhood days, Marble was educated in the common schools of her native town, and having completed that course, made her way through the village seminary and the [[Gorham Academy]].{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}\n\n==Career==\nAn aptitude for study fitted her for teaching, and she taught and attended school alternately until she married, in 1870.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=493}} Losing none of her interest in educational matters, she joined the Society for the Encouragement of Study at Home, conducted by a number of educated [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] women, supplementing her studies by contributions to the leading papers and magazines of Maine and [[Massachusetts]]. In 1873, she accepted the editorial management of the juvenile department of a Maine paper. Failing health put a stop to her literary work for a time, and in search of health she moved to the West, spending five years in [[Kansas]] and [[Minnesota]], devoting herself almost exclusively to philanthropic and educational work. She held at one time the offices of president of the Minnesota State Suffrage Association, president of the Minneapolis Suffrage Association, seven offices in the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and secretary of the [[White Cross Army|White Cross movement]]. She was also secretary and director of a maternity hospital, which she did much toward starting. She was one of the founders of the immense Woman's Christian Temperance Union Coffee Palace in Minneapolis. Receiving, in 1888, a flattering offer from a [[Washington D.C.]] daily newspaper, she moved to the Capital to take a position upon the editorial staff. She contributed also Washington letters to eastern and western papers.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=493}} Notable literary work appeared in Kansas, Minneapolis, [[Boston]], and [[Portland, Maine]].\n{{sfn|Godey Company|1895|p=585}}\n[[File:Ella M. S. Marble.png|thumb|Ella M. S. Marble]]\nFailing health caused her to abandon all literary work and engage in something more active, and she turned her attention to physical culture for women. She established, in 1889, the first women's gymnasium ever opened in Washington, D. C. She also established in connection with it an emporium for healthful dress, and found great pleasure in the fact that she had surrounded herself with two-hundred-fifty women and children who, as teachers, pupils and sewing-girls, were all looking to her to guide them toward health. In 1890, and again in 1891, she was made president of the District of Columbia Woman's Suffrage Association. She was several times called by the national officers to address the committees of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]]. As a public speaker she was elective. Her wide experience in philanthropic work caused her to be called frequently to fill pulpits of both orthodox and liberal churches. In 1891, having made her school of physical culture a social and financial success, she sold it and accepted the financial agency of [[Wimodaughsis]], the national woman's club. \n{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=492}}\n\nIn Washington in 1890, Marble began medical school, matriculating at the National University, where she received three courses of lectures, graduating with honors in 1895 and at once beginning practice.{{sfn|Godey Company|1895|p=585}} She gave an address on \"Women in Medicine\" at the [[Cotton States and International Exposition|Atlanta Exposition]].{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1870, she married Elmer Halsey Marble (1846-1893), of [[Paris, Maine]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=493}}{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}} There were two children from this marriage, Fred Jarvis Marble and Alice Chadbourne Marble.{{sfn|Lapham|Maxim|1884|p=668}} In 1901, she married Rev.

From girlhood, she took an active interest in any movement calculated to advance the interests of women. Interested in literary and philanthropic work, Marble served as president of the [[District of Columbia]] Federation Womans' Clubs, numbering ten societies and 2,500 members (\"Pro Re Noto,\" \"Womans' National Press Association,\" \"Womans' Relief Corps,\" \"20th Century Club of Unitarian Church,\" Civic Center,\" \"Ladies' Auxiliary Board of Emergency Hospital,\" \"Travel Club,\" \"Sons and Daughters of [[Maine]],\" \"District Womans' Suffrage Association\"); president, District Federal; vice-president, Womans' National Press Association for state of Maine; president, Minnesota State Suffrage Association; president, [[Minneapolis]] City Suffrage Association; president, Washington City Suffrage Association; Secretary, Pro Re Noto; and secretary, White Cross Society of Minneapolis.{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}\n\nDuring these years Marble was public lecturer on philanthropic and educational topics; member of editorial staff of Washington daily paper in 1889; established the first gymnasium for women and children in Washington, D. C, in 1890; and graduated in medicine after raising a family and becoming a grandmother.{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}{{sfn|Skinner|2014|p=199}}\n\n==Early years and education==\nElla Marie Smith was born in [[Gorham, Maine]], August 10, 1850, the daughter of Stevens Smith and Sophia Ann Chadbourne. The mother died when Marble was nine years of age. She was her father's housekeeper from the age of 12 until she was 17.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=492}} Living a rugged, healthful life during her girlhood days, Marble was educated in the common schools of her native town, and having completed that course, made her way through the village seminary and the [[Gorham Academy]].{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}\n\n==Career==\nAn aptitude for study fitted her for teaching, and she taught and attended school alternately until she married, in 1870.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=493}} Losing none of her interest in educational matters, she joined the Society for the Encouragement of Study at Home, conducted by a number of educated [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] women, supplementing her studies by contributions to the leading papers and magazines of Maine and [[Massachusetts]]. In 1873, she accepted the editorial management of the juvenile department of a Maine paper. Failing health put a stop to her literary work for a time, and in search of health she moved to the West, spending five years in [[Kansas]] and [[Minnesota]], devoting herself almost exclusively to philanthropic and educational work. She held at one time the offices of president of the Minnesota State Suffrage Association, president of the Minneapolis Suffrage Association, seven offices in the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] and secretary of the [[White Cross Army|White Cross movement]]. She was also secretary and director of a maternity hospital, which she did much toward starting. She was one of the founders of the immense Woman's Christian Temperance Union Coffee Palace in Minneapolis. Receiving, in 1888, a flattering offer from a [[Washington D.C.]] daily newspaper, she moved to the Capital to take a position upon the editorial staff. She contributed also Washington letters to eastern and western papers.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=493}} Notable literary work appeared in Kansas, Minneapolis, [[Boston]], and [[Portland, Maine]].\n{{sfn|Godey Company|1895|p=585}}\n[[File:Ella M. S. Marble.png|thumb|Ella M. S. Marble]]\nFailing health caused her to abandon all literary work and engage in something more active, and she turned her attention to physical culture for women. She established, in 1889, the first women's gymnasium ever opened in Washington, D. C. She also established in connection with it an emporium for healthful dress, and found great pleasure in the fact that she had surrounded herself with two-hundred-fifty women and children who, as teachers, pupils and sewing-girls, were all looking to her to guide them toward health. In 1890, and again in 1891, she was made president of the District of Columbia Woman's Suffrage Association. She was several times called by the national officers to address the committees of the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]]. As a public speaker she was elective. Her wide experience in philanthropic work caused her to be called frequently to fill pulpits of both orthodox and liberal churches. In 1891, having made her school of physical culture a social and financial success, she sold it and accepted the financial agency of [[Wimodaughsis]], the national woman's club. \n{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=492}}\n\nIn Washington in 1890, Marble began medical school, matriculating at the National University, where she received three courses of lectures, graduating with honors in 1895 and at once beginning practice.{{sfn|Godey Company|1895|p=585}} She gave an address on \"Women in Medicine\" at the [[Cotton States and International Exposition|Atlanta Exposition]].{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1870, she married Elmer Halsey Marble (1846-1893), of [[Paris, Maine]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=493}}{{sfn|Medical Women's National Association (U.S.)|1896|p=69}} There were two children from this marriage, Fred Jarvis Marble and Alice Chadbourne Marble.{{sfn|Lapham|Maxim|1884|p=668}} In 1901, she married Rev.

Although a successful student of music in the [[New England Conservatory of Music]], in [[Boston]], in 1881, she entered the medical school of [[Boston University]], and graduated with honor in 1884. In 1880, she married [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]], and in 1885, removed to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where she began the practice of medicine. She served as dramatic editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and also musical editor and critic on that journal. She was instrumental in the formation of a humane society which was brought about through her observations of the neglect and cruelty to the children of the poor, and Mexican families, visited in her practice; and the establishment of the [[California]] system of [[juvenile court]]s.{{sfn|Gullett|2000|p=141}}\nShe was a writer for ''Puck'', ''Judge'', ''Life'', ''Women's Cycle'', ''[[San Francisco]] Argonaut'', and the ''Californian'', as well as contributing many important papers to the various medical journals of the United States.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=741}} Having divorced Charles Lummis in 1891, she married secondly Dr. [[Ernest Carroll Moore]] in 1896.

In 1868, the family moved to [[Portsmouth, Ohio]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=478}}\n\nDorothea entered the Portsmouth Female College, and at the age of sixteen years was graduated as B.A. and was the salutatorian of her class. Two years later, she went to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and entered Mme. Emma Seller's conservatory of music. She remained two years, learning some music and hearing a great deal of the best in concert and opera, and reading indiscriminately and superficially everything that was found on the shelves of the Public Library, that looked interesting. Later she went to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and studied music under James O'Neil of the New England Conservatory of Music.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=478}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Charles Fletcher Lummis.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Fletcher Lummis]]]]\nOn April 16, 1880, at [[Boston]],{{sfn|Harvard College (1780- ).

In 1885, she joined her husband in [[Los Angeles]], where she began to practice medicine. She was highly successful in her practice, obtaining prompt recognition from her fellow physicians. She served as president and secretary of the [[Los Angeles County Medical Association]], and as corresponding secretary of the Southern California Medical Society. In her practice, after finding much cruelty and neglect among the children, chiefly of the [[Mexican-American]]s, and among animals, she formed a humane society, and brought the cases of neglect and cruelty into the courts.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=478}}\n\nMoore served as dramatic editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and later, the musical editor and critic of that journal.

Her father was Josiah H. Rhodes, of [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] stock, and her mother, Sarah Crosby Swift was descended from a [[New England]] family. Although a successful student of music in the [[New England Conservatory of Music]], in [[Boston]], in 1881, she entered the medical school of [[Boston University]], and graduated with honor in 1884. In 1880, she married [[Charles Fletcher Lummis]], and in 1885, removed to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where she began the practice of medicine. She served as dramatic editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and also musical editor and critic on that journal. She was instrumental in the formation of a humane society which was brought about through her observations of the neglect and cruelty to the children of the poor, and Mexican families, visited in her practice; and the establishment of the [[California]] system of [[juvenile court]]s.{{sfn|Gullett|2000|p=141}}\nShe was a writer for ''Puck'', ''Judge'', ''Life'', ''Women's Cycle'', ''[[San Francisco]] Argonaut'', and the ''Californian'', as well as contributing many important papers to the various medical journals of the United States.{{sfn|Logan|1912|p=741}} Having divorced Charles Lummis in 1891, she married secondly Dr. [[Ernest Carroll Moore]] in 1896.

Huntington Library and Art Gallery|1979|p=244}} Moore died in 1942 in California.\n\n==Early years and education==\nMary Dorothea Rhodes was born in Chillicothe, Ohio, November 9, 1860. Her parents were Josiah H. Rhodes, of Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry, and Sarah Crosby Swift, of [[New England]] [[Puritans]] ancestry. Several brothers and a sister died in infancy. In 1868, the family moved to [[Portsmouth, Ohio]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=478}}\n\nDorothea entered the Portsmouth Female College, and at the age of sixteen years was graduated as B.A. and was the salutatorian of her class. Two years later, she went to [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], and entered Mme. Emma Seller's conservatory of music. She remained two years, learning some music and hearing a great deal of the best in concert and opera, and reading indiscriminately and superficially everything that was found on the shelves of the Public Library, that looked interesting. Later she went to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and studied music under James O'Neil of the New England Conservatory of Music.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=478}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Charles Fletcher Lummis.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Fletcher Lummis]]]]\nOn April 16, 1880, at [[Boston]],{{sfn|Harvard College (1780- ).

Initially engaged in farming, he became a journalist on the ''Scioto Gazette'' before he accepted a position with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1884.{{sfn|Gullett|2000|p=141}} During the last year of her college life, Moore served as resident physician in the New England Conservatory of Music. In 1885, she joined her husband in [[Los Angeles]], where she began to practice medicine. She was highly successful in her practice, obtaining prompt recognition from her fellow physicians. She served as president and secretary of the [[Los Angeles County Medical Association]], and as corresponding secretary of the Southern California Medical Society. In her practice, after finding much cruelty and neglect among the children, chiefly of the [[Mexican-American]]s, and among animals, she formed a humane society, and brought the cases of neglect and cruelty into the courts.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=478}}\n\nMoore served as dramatic editor of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and later, the musical editor and critic of that journal. She also did some notable literary work.
