Once in the muscle, they [[cyst|encyst]], or become enclosed in a capsule. \nHumans can become infected by eating infected pork, horsemeat, or wild [[carnivores]] such as fox, cat, or bear.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n===Morphology===\nMales of ''T. spiralis'' measure between 1.4 and 1.6&nbsp;mm long, and are more flat anteriorly than posteriorly. The anus can be found in the terminal end, and they have a large copulatory pseudobursa on each side.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/> The females of ''T. spiralis'' are about twice the size of the males, and have an anus found terminally. The vulva is located near your hot booty (jk, the vulva is located near the esophagus haha). The single uterus of the female is filled with developing eggs in the posterior portion, while the anterior portion contains the fully developed juveniles.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\n==Lifecycle==\n''Trichinella spiralis'' can live the majority of its adult life in the intestines of humans. To begin its lifecycle, ''T. spiralis'' adults invade the intestinal wall of a pig, and produce larvae that invade the pig's muscles. The larval forms are encapsulated as a small cystic structure within a muscle cell of the infected host. When another animal (perhaps a human) eats the infected meat, the larvae are released from the [[nurse cell]]s in the meat (due to stomach pH), and migrate to the intestine, where they burrow into the intestinal mucosa, mature, and reproduce.<ref name=\"Crowley\">{{Cite book |author=Crowley, Leonard |title=An Introduction to Human Disease: Pathology and Pathophysiology Correlations |edition=8th |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |year=2009}}</ref> Juveniles within nurse cells have an anaerobic or facultative anaerobic metabolism, but when they become activated, they adopt the aerobic metabolism characteristics of the adult.<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n[[File:Trichinella life cycle.jpg|thumbnail|''Trichinella spiralis'' lifecycle]]\n\nFemale ''Trichinella'' worms live for about six weeks, and in that time can produce up to 1,500 larvae; when a spent female dies, she passes out of the host.

Among the opponents he defeated were [[Gregorio Peralta]], whom he decisioned at [[Madison Square Garden]] although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter punching mixed with an assertive boxing style. Foreman then defeated [[George Chuvalo]] by technical knockout (TKO) in three rounds. After this win, Foreman defeated [[Charlie Polite]] in four rounds and [[Boone Kirkman]] in three. Peralta and Chuvalo were Foreman's first world level wins.

Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from [[Muhammad Ali]], Frazier had won the title from [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten [[Oscar Bonavena]] and [[Jerry Quarry]]. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=561&more=1 |title=Why I Don't Believe Those Who Say They Picked Foreman Over Frazier |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=1973-01-21 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight.\n\nThe Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by technical knockout. In ABC's re-broadcast, [[Howard Cosell]] made the memorable call, \"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\" Before the fight Frazier was 29\u20130 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37\u20130 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee [[Arthur Mercante, Sr.|Arthur Mercante]] eventually called an end to the one-sided bout.\n\nForeman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/george-foreman/bio|title=George Foreman Bio |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135640/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/George-Foreman/bio |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}</ref> According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of [[Sonny Liston]], for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Heavyweight Champion [[Jose King Roman|Jos\u00e9 Roman]]. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, but had managed to beat a few decent fighters such as EBU champion Spain Jose Manuel Urtain, and was ranked #7 heavyweight in the March 1973 issue of ''the Ring''.<REf>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1972 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1972]</ref> It took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.\n\n===Foreman vs. Norton===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Ken Norton}}\nForeman's next defense was against a much tougher opponent. In 1974, in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], he faced the highly regarded future hall-of-famer [[Ken Norton]] (who was 30\u20132), a boxer noted for his awkward crossed-arm boxing style, crab-like defense, and heavy punch (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of [[Muhammad Ali]] in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had a good chin and had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and nearly winning the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.)  After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes.  Norton did not hit the canvas but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. \"Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn't want him to get into the fight\", Foreman said when interviewed years later.{{Cite quote| date=June 2016}} This fight became known as the \"Caracas Caper\".\n\nForeman had cruised past two of the top names in the rankings. The win gave him a 40\u20130 record with 37 knockouts.\n\n===The Rumble in the Jungle: Foreman vs. Ali===\n{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}\n[[File:Foreman tira golpe a clay.jpg|thumb|250px|Foreman (left) v Ali in Kinshasa]]\nForeman's next title defence, against [[Muhammad Ali]], was historic. During the summer of 1974, he traveled to [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) to defend his title against Ali. The bout was promoted as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\".\n\nDuring training in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement of the match for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: \"That was the best thing that happened to Ali when we were in Africa\u2014the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Video |date=December 15, 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115202805/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2878507 |title=Foreman claims he was drugged before loss to Ali \u2013 boxing \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.\n\nWhen Foreman and Ali finally met in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with superior punching speed. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes, being much looser than usual{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} (Foreman later charged that [[Angelo Dundee]] had loosened them, and this story is supported by Norman Mailer in the book ''[[The Fight (book)|The Fight]]''), allowed Ali to lean back and away from Foreman's wild swings and then to [[clinch fighting|clinch]] Foreman behind the head, forcing Foreman to expend much extra energy untangling himself. Ali also constantly pushed down on Foreman's neck{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but was never warned about doing so. To this day, it is unclear whether Ali's pre-fight talk of using speed and movement against Foreman had been just a diversionary tactic or whether his use of what became known as the \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" tactic was an improvisation necessitated by Foreman's constant pressure.\n\nIn either case, Ali was able to occasionally counter off the ropes with blows to the face and penetrated Foreman's defense. Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body and occasionally a hard jolt to the head. Ali later said he was \"out on his feet\" twice during the bout. As Foreman began to tire, his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild. An increasingly confident Ali taunted Foreman throughout the bout. Late in the eighth round, Foreman was left off balance by a haymaker, and Ali sprang off the ropes with a flurry to Foreman's head, punctuated by a hard right cross that landed flush on the jaw, knocking Foreman down. [[Muhammad Ali]] was the first boxer to score a knockdown of Foreman.\n\nForeman later reflected that \"it just wasn't my night\". Though he sought one, he was unable to secure a rematch with Ali. It has been suggested in some quarters that Ali was ducking Foreman,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} although he did give a rematch to [[Joe Frazier]] and to [[Ken Norton]]. Ali fought \"minimal risk\" opponents, such as [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]], [[Jean Pierre Coopman]], and [[Alfredo Evangelista]],<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722004933/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 |date=July 22, 2006 }} [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 Archived from the original.]</ref> as well as formidable opponents, such as Ron Lyle and Joe Frazier.\n\n===First comeback===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier II}}\nForeman remained inactive during 1975. In 1976, he announced a comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent was to be [[Ron Lyle]], who had been defeated by [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1975, via 11th-round TKO. Lyle was the #5 rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the March 1976 issue of ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> At the end of the first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed. Lyle remained on the canvas and was counted out, giving Foreman the KO victory. The fight was named by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' as \"The Fight of the Year.\"\n\nFor his next bout, Foreman chose to face [[Joe Frazier]] in a rematch. Frazier was then the world's #3 heavyweight per ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> Because of the one-sided Foreman victory in their first fight, and the fact that Frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from Ali in Manila a year earlier, few expected him to win. Frazier at this point was 32\u20133, and Foreman was 41\u20131. However, the 2nd Foreman-Frazier fight was fairly competitive for its duration, as Frazier used quick head movements to make Foreman miss with his hardest punches.   Frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision which was knocked loose during the bout. After being unable to mount a significant offense, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped. Next, Foreman knocked out [[Scott LeDoux]] in three rounds and prospect John Dino Denis in four to finish the year.\n\n===Retirement and spiritual rebirth===\n[[File:Foreman as reverend.jpg|thumb|180px|Foreman as reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1994]]\n1977 proved to be a life changing year for Foreman. After knocking out Pedro Agosto in four rounds at [[Pensacola, Florida]], Foreman flew to [[Puerto Rico]] a day before the fight without giving himself time to acclimatise. His opponent was the skilled boxer [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]], who had beaten [[Ron Lyle]] and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round 7 but was unable to land a finishing blow. Foreman tired during the second half of the fight and suffered a knockdown in round 12 en route to losing a decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nForeman became ill in his dressing room after the fight. He was suffering from exhaustion and [[heatstroke]] and stated he had a [[near-death experience]]. He spoke of being in a hellish, frightening place of nothingness and despair, and realized that he was in the midst of death. Though not yet religious, he began to plead with God to help him. He explained that he sensed God asking him to change his life and ways. When he said, \"I don't care if this is death \u2013 I still believe there is a God\", he felt a hand pull him out and sensed that he was also suffering [[stigmata]].{{citation needed|reason=sourced only to own website|date=April 2017}} After this experience, Foreman became a [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]], dedicating his life for the next decade to God. Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2017_00606|title=George Foreman and the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ (1980)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> in Houston<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/church |title=The Official Site of George Foreman |website=Georgeforeman.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |title=George Foreman Youth Center, Houston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609073250/http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}</ref> that bears his name. Foreman continues to speak about his experience on Christian television broadcasts such as ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and later joked that Young had knocked the devil out of him.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Second comeback===\nIn 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight [[Mike Tyson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/foreman_tyson_fl.html |title=Why We Never Saw Foreman-Tyson |website=Coxscorner.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> For his first fight, he went to [[Sacramento, California]], where he beat [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed {{convert|267|lb|abbr=on}} for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \"death sentence\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|Cruiserweight]] Champion [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nHaving always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \"retirement\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from [[George Foreman Grill|grills]] to [[muffler]]s on TV. For this purpose{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.\n\nForeman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over [[Bert Cooper]], who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against [[Evander Holyfield]].\n\n===Foreman vs. Cooney===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Gerry Cooney}}\nIn 1990, Foreman met former title challenger [[Gerry Cooney]] in Atlantic City. Cooney was coming off a long period of inactivity, but was well regarded for his punching power. Cooney wobbled Foreman in the first round, but Foreman landed several powerful punches in the second round. Cooney was knocked down twice and Foreman scored a devastating KO. Foreman went on to win four more fights that year.\n\n===Foreman vs. Holyfield===\n{{Main|Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman}}\nThe following year, Foreman was given the opportunity to challenge undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]], who was in tremendous shape at 208 pounds, for the world title in a [[pay-per-view]] boxing event. Very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old Foreman a chance of winning. Foreman, who weighed in at 257 pounds, began the contest by marching forward, absorbing several of Holyfield's best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own. Holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight, but Foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds, losing his challenge on points. Round 7, in which Foreman knocked Holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination, was expected to be [[Ring Magazine round of the year|''Ring Magazine'''s \"Round of the Year\"]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} though no award was given in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|title=PAST WINNERS OF THE RING'S YEAR-END AWARDS \u2013 Ring TV|author=THE RING|date=24 February 2012|work=Ring TV|accessdate=12 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320110422/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Foreman fought journeyman [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]], who had previously been stopped in the first round by [[Mike Tyson]]. Foreman knocked down Stewart twice in the second round but expended a lot of energy in doing so. He was subsequently tired, and Stewart rebounded. By the end of the 10th and final round, Foreman's face was bloodied and swollen, but the judges awarded him a  majority decision win.\n\n===Foreman vs. Morrison===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison}}\nIn 1993, Foreman received another title shot, although this was for the vacant [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title. Foreman's opponent was [[Tommy Morrison]], a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes he turned his back on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.\n\nIn this period, Foreman also starred briefly in the [[sitcom|situation comedy]] ''[[George (1993 TV series)|George]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  The show, which featured Foreman as a retired boxer, premiered in November, 1993, and ran for ten episodes where nine aired.  The show was co-produced by actor and former boxer [[Tony Danza]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=TV Guide |url= http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george/cast/201620|title=George Cast and Details |magazine=TV Guide |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Regaining the title: Foreman vs. Moorer===\n{{Main|Michael Moorer vs. George Foreman}}\n[[File:Elgrafico 3918 foreman.jpg|thumb|170px|Foreman celebrating his new world championship at 45 years old, after beating Michael Moorer]]\nIn 1994, Foreman again sought to challenge for the world championship after [[Michael Moorer]] had beaten Holyfield for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] titles.\n\nHaving lost his last fight against Morrison, Foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot. His relatively high profile, however, made a title shot against Moorer, 19 years his junior, a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion.\n\nForeman's title challenge against Moorer took place on November 5 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to \"pull the trigger\" on his punches. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, Foreman launched a comeback in the tenth round and hit Moorer with a number of punches. Then a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his bottom lip and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.\n\nIn an instant, Foreman had regained the title he had lost to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this historic victory, Foreman broke three records: he became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win a World Championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.\n\n===Foreman vs. Schulz===\n\n====Prelude====\nShortly after the 1994 Moorer fight, Foreman began talking about a potential superfight with [[Mike Tyson]], then the youngest heavyweight champion on record. In 1995, ''The New York Times'' quoted Foreman as stating, \"If he doesn't sign with [[Don King (boxing promoter)#Mike Tyson|Don King]], we'll fight before the end of the year... I can't be bothered having trouble with Don King. Every contract has some complication.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Eskenazi|first= Gerald|date= February 15, 1995|title= The Jewel in Foreman's Crown?

For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Schulz match====\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Axel Schulz}}\nOn April 22, 1995, Foreman fought mid-level underdog prospect [[Axel Schulz]], of Germany, in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range, and exhibited increasing confidence as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany; Foreman refused the terms and was stripped of his remaining title, yet continued to be recognized as the [[Lineal championship|Lineal Heavyweight Champion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Losing the title: Foreman vs. Briggs===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Shannon Briggs}}\nIn 1996, Foreman returned to Tokyo, scoring an easy win over the unrated [[Crawford Grimsley]] by a 12-round decision. In 1997, he faced contender [[Lou Savarese]], winning a close decision in a grueling, competitive encounter. Then, yet another opportunity came Foreman's way as the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] decided to match him against [[Shannon Briggs]] in a 1997 \"eliminator bout\" for the right to face WBC champion [[Lennox Lewis]]. After 12 rounds, in which Foreman consistently rocked Briggs with power punches, almost everyone at ringside saw Foreman as the clear winner.<ref>{{cite news |first=Timothy W. |last=Smith |title=BOXING; Briggs Wins, Crowd Boos and Foreman Says He Likely Won't Fight Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/sports/boxing-briggs-wins-crowd-boos-and-foreman-says-he-likely-won-t-fight-again.html |work=New York Times |date=November 23, 1997 |access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Once again there was a controversial decision\u2014but this time it went in favor of Foreman's opponent, with Briggs awarded a points win.

However, he did plan a return bout against [[Larry Holmes]] in 1999, scheduled to take place at the Houston [[Astrodome]] on pay per view. The fight was to be billed as \"The Birthday Bash\" due to both fighters' upcoming birthdays. Foreman was set to make $10 million and Holmes was to make $4 million, but negotiations fell through and the fight was cancelled. With a continuing affinity for the sport, Foreman became a respected boxing analyst for HBO.\n\nForeman said he had no plans to resume his career as a boxer, but then announced in February 2004 that he was training for one more comeback fight to demonstrate that the age of 55, like 40, is not a \"death sentence.\" The bout, against an unspecified opponent (rumored to be [[Trevor Berbick]]), never materialized (it was widely thought that Foreman's wife had been a major factor in the change of plans). George Foreman left the sport of boxing after leaving HBO to pursue other opportunities.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:GeorgeForemanSept09.jpg|thumb|right|Foreman speaking in Houston, Texas, in September 2009]]\nForeman has been married to Mary Joan Martelly since 1985. He had four previous marriages: to Adrienne Calhoun from 1971 to 1974, Cynthia Lewis from 1977 to 1979, Sharon Goodson from 1981 to 1982, and Andrea Skeete from 1982 to 1985.<ref name=\"Walsh\"/>\n\nForeman has 12 children, five sons and seven daughters.

Prior to that, he was paid about 40% of the profits on each grill sold (earning him $4.5 million a month in payouts at its peak), so it is estimated he has made a total of over $200 million from the endorsement, substantially more than he earned as a boxer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_51/b3913093.htm |title=George Foreman Grill. |work=Business Week |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|ko-wins=68\n|ko-losses=1\n|dec-wins=8\n|dec-losses=4\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Age\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|81\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|76\u20135\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Shannon Briggs]]\n|MD\n|12\n|[[George Foreman vs. Shannon Briggs|Nov 22, 1997]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1997|11|22}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Etess Arena]], Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Lost lineal heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|80\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|76\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lou Savarese]]\n|{{abbr|SD|Split decision}}\n|12\n|Apr 26, 1997\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1997|04|26}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Retained WBU and lineal heavyweight titles}}\n|-\n|79\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|75\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Crawford Grimsley]]\n|UD\n|12\n|Nov 3, 1996\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1996|11|3}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|JPN}} {{small|[[Tokyo Bay NK Hall|NK Hall]], [[Urayasu]], Japan}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Retained WBU and lineal heavyweight titles;<br>Won vacant [[International Boxing Association (professional)|IBA]] heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|78\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|74\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|GER}} [[Axel Schulz]]\n|MD\n|12\n|[[George Foreman vs. Axel Schulz|Apr 22, 1995]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1995|4|22}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|MGM Grand Garden Arena, Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Retained IBF and lineal heavyweight titles;<br>Won vacant [[World Boxing Union|WBU]] heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|77\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|73\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Michael Moorer]]\n|KO\n|10 (12), {{small|2:03}}\n|[[Michael Moorer vs. George Foreman|Nov 5, 1994]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1994|11|5}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[MGM Grand Garden Arena]], Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Won WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight titles}}\n|-\n|76\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|72\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tommy Morrison]]\n|UD\n|12\n|[[George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison|Jun 7, 1993]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1993|6|7}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Thomas & Mack Center, Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|For vacant [[list of WBO world champions#Heavyweight|WBO heavyweight title]]}}\n|-\n|75\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|72\u20133\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Pierre Coetzer]]\n|TKO\n|8 (10), {{small|1:48}}\n|Jan 16, 1993\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1993|1|16}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Convention Center, Reno, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|74\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|71\u20133\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|JAM}} [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]]\n|{{abbr|MD|Majority decision}}\n|10\n|Apr 11, 1992\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1992|4|11}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Thomas & Mack Center]], Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|73\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|70\u20133\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Jimmy K.

At age sixteen, Foreman had a change of heart and convinced his mother to sign him up for the [[Job Corps]] after seeing an ad for the Corps on TV. As part of the Job Corps, Foreman earned his [[General Educational Development|GED]] and trained to become a [[carpenter]] and [[bricklayer]].<ref>Hauser, Melanie.

Among the opponents he defeated were [[Gregorio Peralta]], whom he decisioned at [[Madison Square Garden]] although Peralta showed that Foreman was vulnerable to fast counter punching mixed with an assertive boxing style. Foreman then defeated [[George Chuvalo]] by technical knockout (TKO) in three rounds. After this win, Foreman defeated [[Charlie Polite]] in four rounds and [[Boone Kirkman]] in three. Peralta and Chuvalo were Foreman's first world level wins. Peralta was the #10 ranked heavyweight in the world in Jan. 1970 per ''the Ring'',<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1969 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1969.]</ref> while Chuvalo was #7 in the world per their March 1971 issue.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1970 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1970.]</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Foreman won seven more fights, winning all of them by knockout, including a rematch with Peralta, whom he defeated by knockout in the tenth and final round in [[Oakland, California]], and a win over Leroy Caldwell, who he knocked out in the second round.

Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from [[Muhammad Ali]], Frazier had won the title from [[Jimmy Ellis (boxer)|Jimmy Ellis]] and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten [[Oscar Bonavena]] and [[Jerry Quarry]]. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=561&more=1 |title=Why I Don't Believe Those Who Say They Picked Foreman Over Frazier |publisher=Eastsideboxing.com |date=1973-01-21 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight.\n\nThe Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in [[Kingston, Jamaica]], with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by technical knockout. In ABC's re-broadcast, [[Howard Cosell]] made the memorable call, \"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\" Before the fight Frazier was 29\u20130 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37\u20130 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee [[Arthur Mercante, Sr.|Arthur Mercante]] eventually called an end to the one-sided bout.\n\nForeman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/george-foreman/bio|title=George Foreman Bio |accessdate=April 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135640/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/George-Foreman/bio |archivedate=March 5, 2010 }}</ref> According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of [[Sonny Liston]], for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] Heavyweight Champion [[Jose King Roman|Jos\u00e9 Roman]]. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, but had managed to beat a few decent fighters such as EBU champion Spain Jose Manuel Urtain, and was ranked #7 heavyweight in the March 1973 issue of ''the Ring''.<REf>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1972 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1972]</ref> It took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.\n\n===Foreman vs. Norton===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Ken Norton}}\nForeman's next defense was against a much tougher opponent. In 1974, in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]], he faced the highly regarded future hall-of-famer [[Ken Norton]] (who was 30\u20132), a boxer noted for his awkward crossed-arm boxing style, crab-like defense, and heavy punch (a style Foreman emulated in his comeback), who had broken the jaw of [[Muhammad Ali]] in a points victory a year earlier. Norton had a good chin and had performed well against Ali in their two matches, winning the first on points and nearly winning the second. (Norton developed a reputation for showing nerves against heavy hitters, largely beginning with this fight.)  After an even first round, Foreman staggered Norton with an uppercut a minute into round two, buckling him into the ropes.  Norton did not hit the canvas but continued on wobbly legs, clearly not having recovered, and shortly he went down a further two times in quick succession, with the referee intervening and stopping the fight. \"Ken was awesome when he got going. I didn't want him to get into the fight\", Foreman said when interviewed years later.{{Cite quote| date=June 2016}} This fight became known as the \"Caracas Caper\".\n\nForeman had cruised past two of the top names in the rankings. The win gave him a 40\u20130 record with 37 knockouts.\n\n===The Rumble in the Jungle: Foreman vs. Ali===\n{{Main|The Rumble in the Jungle}}\n[[File:Foreman tira golpe a clay.jpg|thumb|250px|Foreman (left) v Ali in Kinshasa]]\nForeman's next title defence, against [[Muhammad Ali]], was historic. During the summer of 1974, he traveled to [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) to defend his title against Ali. The bout was promoted as \"The Rumble in the Jungle\".\n\nDuring training in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement of the match for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: \"That was the best thing that happened to Ali when we were in Africa\u2014the fact that I had to get ready for the fight without being able to box.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |work=CNN |title=Video |date=December 15, 1975 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115202805/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090594/4/index.htm |archivedate=January 15, 2010 }}</ref> Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=2878507 |title=Foreman claims he was drugged before loss to Ali \u2013 boxing \u2013 ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2007-05-22 |accessdate=2012-09-29}}</ref> Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.\n\nWhen Foreman and Ali finally met in the ring, Ali began more aggressively than expected, outscoring Foreman with superior punching speed. In the second round, Ali retreated to the ropes, shielding his head and hitting Foreman in the face at every opportunity. Foreman dug vicious body punches into Ali's sides; however, Foreman was unable to land many big punches to Ali's head. The ring ropes, being much looser than usual{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} (Foreman later charged that [[Angelo Dundee]] had loosened them, and this story is supported by Norman Mailer in the book ''[[The Fight (book)|The Fight]]''), allowed Ali to lean back and away from Foreman's wild swings and then to [[clinch fighting|clinch]] Foreman behind the head, forcing Foreman to expend much extra energy untangling himself. Ali also constantly pushed down on Foreman's neck{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} but was never warned about doing so. To this day, it is unclear whether Ali's pre-fight talk of using speed and movement against Foreman had been just a diversionary tactic or whether his use of what became known as the \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" tactic was an improvisation necessitated by Foreman's constant pressure.\n\nIn either case, Ali was able to occasionally counter off the ropes with blows to the face and penetrated Foreman's defense. Ali continued to take heavy punishment to the body and occasionally a hard jolt to the head. Ali later said he was \"out on his feet\" twice during the bout. As Foreman began to tire, his punches began to lose power and became increasingly wild. An increasingly confident Ali taunted Foreman throughout the bout. Late in the eighth round, Foreman was left off balance by a haymaker, and Ali sprang off the ropes with a flurry to Foreman's head, punctuated by a hard right cross that landed flush on the jaw, knocking Foreman down. [[Muhammad Ali]] was the first boxer to score a knockdown of Foreman.\n\nForeman later reflected that \"it just wasn't my night\". Though he sought one, he was unable to secure a rematch with Ali. It has been suggested in some quarters that Ali was ducking Foreman,{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} although he did give a rematch to [[Joe Frazier]] and to [[Ken Norton]]. Ali fought \"minimal risk\" opponents, such as [[Chuck Wepner]], [[Richard Dunn (boxer)|Richard Dunn]], [[Jean Pierre Coopman]], and [[Alfredo Evangelista]],<ref>{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722004933/http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 |date=July 22, 2006 }} [http://www.eastsideboxing.com/news.php?p=7566&more=1 Archived from the original.]</ref> as well as formidable opponents, such as Ron Lyle and Joe Frazier.\n\n===First comeback===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Joe Frazier II}}\nForeman remained inactive during 1975. In 1976, he announced a comeback and stated his intention of securing a rematch with Ali. His first opponent was to be [[Ron Lyle]], who had been defeated by [[Muhammad Ali]] in 1975, via 11th-round TKO. Lyle was the #5 rated heavyweight in the world at the time per the March 1976 issue of ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> At the end of the first round, Lyle landed a hard right that sent Foreman staggering across the ring. In the second round, Foreman pounded Lyle against the ropes and might have scored a KO, but due to a timekeeping error the bell rang with a minute still remaining in the round and Lyle survived. In the third, Foreman pressed forward, with Lyle waiting to counter off the ropes. In the fourth, a brutal slugfest erupted. A cluster of power punches from Lyle sent Foreman to the canvas. When Foreman got up, Lyle staggered him again, but just as Foreman seemed finished, he retaliated with a hard right to the side of the head, knocking down Lyle. Lyle beat the count, then landed another brutal combination, knocking Foreman down for the second time. Again, Foreman beat the count. Foreman said later that he had never been hit so hard in a fight and remembered looking down at the canvas and seeing blood. In the fifth round, both fighters continued to ignore defense and traded their hardest punches, looking crude. Each man staggered the other, and each seemed almost out on his feet. Then, as if finally tired, Lyle stopped punching, and Foreman delivered a dozen unanswered blows until Lyle collapsed. Lyle remained on the canvas and was counted out, giving Foreman the KO victory. The fight was named by ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' as \"The Fight of the Year.\"\n\nFor his next bout, Foreman chose to face [[Joe Frazier]] in a rematch. Frazier was then the world's #3 heavyweight per ''the Ring''.<Ref>[https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/The_Ring_Magazine%27s_Annual_Ratings:_1975 The Ring Magazine's Annual Ratings: 1975]</ref> Because of the one-sided Foreman victory in their first fight, and the fact that Frazier had taken a tremendous amount of punishment from Ali in Manila a year earlier, few expected him to win. Frazier at this point was 32\u20133, and Foreman was 41\u20131. However, the 2nd Foreman-Frazier fight was fairly competitive for its duration, as Frazier used quick head movements to make Foreman miss with his hardest punches.   Frazier was wearing a contact lens for his vision which was knocked loose during the bout. After being unable to mount a significant offense, Frazier was eventually floored twice by Foreman in the fifth round and the fight was stopped. Next, Foreman knocked out [[Scott LeDoux]] in three rounds and prospect John Dino Denis in four to finish the year.\n\n===Retirement and spiritual rebirth===\n[[File:Foreman as reverend.jpg|thumb|180px|Foreman as reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ, 1994]]\n1977 proved to be a life changing year for Foreman. After knocking out Pedro Agosto in four rounds at [[Pensacola, Florida]], Foreman flew to [[Puerto Rico]] a day before the fight without giving himself time to acclimatise. His opponent was the skilled boxer [[Jimmy Young (boxer)|Jimmy Young]], who had beaten [[Ron Lyle]] and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually had a point deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round 7 but was unable to land a finishing blow. Foreman tired during the second half of the fight and suffered a knockdown in round 12 en route to losing a decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nForeman became ill in his dressing room after the fight. He was suffering from exhaustion and [[heatstroke]] and stated he had a [[near-death experience]]. He spoke of being in a hellish, frightening place of nothingness and despair, and realized that he was in the midst of death. Though not yet religious, he began to plead with God to help him. He explained that he sensed God asking him to change his life and ways. When he said, \"I don't care if this is death \u2013 I still believe there is a God\", he felt a hand pull him out and sensed that he was also suffering [[stigmata]].{{citation needed|reason=sourced only to own website|date=April 2017}} After this experience, Foreman became a [[Born again Christianity|born-again Christian]], dedicating his life for the next decade to God. Although he did not formally retire from boxing, Foreman stopped fighting and became an ordained minister, initially preaching on street corners before becoming the reverend at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://texasarchive.org/2017_00606|title=George Foreman and the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ (1980)|last=|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref> in Houston<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/church |title=The Official Site of George Foreman |website=Georgeforeman.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> and devoting himself to his family and his congregation. He also opened a youth center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |title=George Foreman Youth Center, Houston |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609073250/http://www.georgeforeman.com/youthcenter.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 }}</ref> that bears his name. Foreman continues to speak about his experience on Christian television broadcasts such as ''[[The 700 Club]]'' and the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]] and later joked that Young had knocked the devil out of him.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Second comeback===\nIn 1987, after 10 years away from the ring, Foreman surprised the boxing world by announcing a comeback at the age of 38. In his autobiography, he wrote that his primary motive was to raise money to fund the youth center he had created, which had required much of the money he had earned in the initial phase of his career. Another stated ambition was to fight [[Mike Tyson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coxscorner.tripod.com/foreman_tyson_fl.html |title=Why We Never Saw Foreman-Tyson |website=Coxscorner.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-25}}</ref> For his first fight, he went to [[Sacramento, California]], where he beat [[Journeyman (boxing)|journeyman]] Steve Zouski by a knockout in four rounds. Foreman weighed {{convert|267|lb|abbr=on}} for the fight and looked badly out of shape. Although many thought his decision to return to the ring was a mistake, Foreman countered that he had returned to prove that age was not a barrier to people achieving their goals (as he said later, he wanted to show that age 40 is not a \"death sentence\"). He won four more bouts that year, gradually slimming down and improving his fitness. In 1988, he won nine times. Perhaps his most notable win during this period was a seventh-round knockout of former Light Heavyweight and [[Cruiserweight (boxing)|Cruiserweight]] Champion [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nHaving always been a deliberate fighter, Foreman had not lost much mobility in the ring since his first \"retirement\", although he found it harder to keep his balance after throwing big punches and could no longer throw rapid combinations. He was still capable of landing heavy single blows, however. The late-round fatigue that had plagued him in the ring as a young man now seemed to be unexpectedly gone, and he could comfortably compete for 12 rounds. Foreman attributed this to his new, relaxed fighting style (he has spoken of how, earlier in his career, his lack of stamina came from an enormous amount of nervous tension).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nBy 1989, while continuing his comeback, Foreman had sold his name and face for the advertising of various products, selling everything from [[George Foreman Grill|grills]] to [[muffler]]s on TV. For this purpose{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} his public persona was reinvented, and the formerly aloof, ominous Foreman had been replaced by a smiling, friendly George. He and Ali had become friends, and he followed in Ali's footsteps by making himself a celebrity outside the boundaries of boxing.\n\nForeman continued his string of victories, winning five more fights, the most impressive being a three-round win over [[Bert Cooper]], who went on to contest the Undisputed Heavyweight title against [[Evander Holyfield]].\n\n===Foreman vs. Cooney===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Gerry Cooney}}\nIn 1990, Foreman met former title challenger [[Gerry Cooney]] in Atlantic City. Cooney was coming off a long period of inactivity, but was well regarded for his punching power. Cooney wobbled Foreman in the first round, but Foreman landed several powerful punches in the second round. Cooney was knocked down twice and Foreman scored a devastating KO. Foreman went on to win four more fights that year.\n\n===Foreman vs. Holyfield===\n{{Main|Evander Holyfield vs. George Foreman}}\nThe following year, Foreman was given the opportunity to challenge undisputed heavyweight champion [[Evander Holyfield]], who was in tremendous shape at 208 pounds, for the world title in a [[pay-per-view]] boxing event. Very few boxing experts gave the 42-year-old Foreman a chance of winning. Foreman, who weighed in at 257 pounds, began the contest by marching forward, absorbing several of Holyfield's best combinations and occasionally landing a powerful swing of his own. Holyfield proved too tough and agile to knock down and was well ahead on points throughout the fight, but Foreman surprised many by lasting the full 12 rounds, losing his challenge on points. Round 7, in which Foreman knocked Holyfield off balance before being staggered by a powerful combination, was expected to be [[Ring Magazine round of the year|''Ring Magazine'''s \"Round of the Year\"]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} though no award was given in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|title=PAST WINNERS OF THE RING'S YEAR-END AWARDS \u2013 Ring TV|author=THE RING|date=24 February 2012|work=Ring TV|accessdate=12 September 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320110422/http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/171651-past-winners-of-the-rings-year-end-awards|archivedate=20 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Foreman fought journeyman [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]], who had previously been stopped in the first round by [[Mike Tyson]]. Foreman knocked down Stewart twice in the second round but expended a lot of energy in doing so. He was subsequently tired, and Stewart rebounded. By the end of the 10th and final round, Foreman's face was bloodied and swollen, but the judges awarded him a  majority decision win.\n\n===Foreman vs. Morrison===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison}}\nIn 1993, Foreman received another title shot, although this was for the vacant [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title. Foreman's opponent was [[Tommy Morrison]], a young prospect known for his punching power. Morrison retreated throughout the fight, refusing to trade toe-to-toe, and sometimes he turned his back on Foreman. The strategy paid off and he outboxed Foreman from long range. After 12 rounds, Morrison won a unanimous decision.\n\nIn this period, Foreman also starred briefly in the [[sitcom|situation comedy]] ''[[George (1993 TV series)|George]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  The show, which featured Foreman as a retired boxer, premiered in November, 1993, and ran for ten episodes where nine aired.  The show was co-produced by actor and former boxer [[Tony Danza]].<ref>{{cite magazine|author=TV Guide |url= http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george/cast/201620|title=George Cast and Details |magazine=TV Guide |accessdate=2012-09-07}}</ref>\n\n===Regaining the title: Foreman vs. Moorer===\n{{Main|Michael Moorer vs. George Foreman}}\n[[File:Elgrafico 3918 foreman.jpg|thumb|170px|Foreman celebrating his new world championship at 45 years old, after beating Michael Moorer]]\nIn 1994, Foreman again sought to challenge for the world championship after [[Michael Moorer]] had beaten Holyfield for the [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]] and [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] titles.\n\nHaving lost his last fight against Morrison, Foreman was unranked and in no position to demand another title shot. His relatively high profile, however, made a title shot against Moorer, 19 years his junior, a lucrative prospect at seemingly little risk for the champion.\n\nForeman's title challenge against Moorer took place on November 5 in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], with Foreman wearing the same red trunks he had worn in his title loss to Ali 20 years earlier. This time, however, Foreman was a substantial underdog. For nine rounds, Moorer easily outboxed him, hitting and moving away, while Foreman chugged forward, seemingly unable to \"pull the trigger\" on his punches. Entering the tenth round, Foreman was trailing on all scorecards. However, Foreman launched a comeback in the tenth round and hit Moorer with a number of punches. Then a short right hand caught Moorer on the tip of his chin, gashing open his bottom lip and he collapsed to the canvas. He lay flat on the canvas as the referee counted him out.\n\nIn an instant, Foreman had regained the title he had lost to Muhammad Ali two decades before. He went back to his corner and knelt in prayer as the arena erupted in cheers. With this historic victory, Foreman broke three records: he became, at age 45, the oldest fighter ever to win a World Championship; 20 years after losing his title for the first time, he broke the record for the fighter with the longest interval between his first and second world championships; and the age spread of 19 years between the champion and challenger was the largest of any heavyweight boxing championship fight.\n\n===Foreman vs. Schulz===\n\n====Prelude====\nShortly after the 1994 Moorer fight, Foreman began talking about a potential superfight with [[Mike Tyson]], then the youngest heavyweight champion on record. In 1995, ''The New York Times'' quoted Foreman as stating, \"If he doesn't sign with [[Don King (boxing promoter)#Mike Tyson|Don King]], we'll fight before the end of the year... I can't be bothered having trouble with Don King. Every contract has some complication.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Eskenazi|first= Gerald|date= February 15, 1995|title= The Jewel in Foreman's Crown?

For reasons not clearly known, Foreman refused to fight Tucker and allowed the WBA to strip him of that belt.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Schulz match====\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Axel Schulz}}\nOn April 22, 1995, Foreman fought mid-level underdog prospect [[Axel Schulz]], of Germany, in defense of his remaining IBF title. Schulz jabbed strongly from long range, and exhibited increasing confidence as the fight progressed. Foreman finished the fight with a swelling over one eye, but was awarded a controversial majority decision. The IBF ordered an immediate rematch to be held in Germany; Foreman refused the terms and was stripped of his remaining title, yet continued to be recognized as the [[Lineal championship|Lineal Heavyweight Champion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Losing the title: Foreman vs. Briggs===\n{{Main|George Foreman vs. Shannon Briggs}}\nIn 1996, Foreman returned to Tokyo, scoring an easy win over the unrated [[Crawford Grimsley]] by a 12-round decision. In 1997, he faced contender [[Lou Savarese]], winning a close decision in a grueling, competitive encounter. Then, yet another opportunity came Foreman's way as the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] decided to match him against [[Shannon Briggs]] in a 1997 \"eliminator bout\" for the right to face WBC champion [[Lennox Lewis]]. After 12 rounds, in which Foreman consistently rocked Briggs with power punches, almost everyone at ringside saw Foreman as the clear winner.<ref>{{cite news |first=Timothy W. |last=Smith |title=BOXING; Briggs Wins, Crowd Boos and Foreman Says He Likely Won't Fight Again |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/23/sports/boxing-briggs-wins-crowd-boos-and-foreman-says-he-likely-won-t-fight-again.html |work=New York Times |date=November 23, 1997 |access-date=January 26, 2017}}</ref> Once again there was a controversial decision\u2014but this time it went in favor of Foreman's opponent, with Briggs awarded a points win.

However, he did plan a return bout against [[Larry Holmes]] in 1999, scheduled to take place at the Houston [[Astrodome]] on pay per view. The fight was to be billed as \"The Birthday Bash\" due to both fighters' upcoming birthdays. Foreman was set to make $10 million and Holmes was to make $4 million, but negotiations fell through and the fight was cancelled. With a continuing affinity for the sport, Foreman became a respected boxing analyst for HBO.\n\nForeman said he had no plans to resume his career as a boxer, but then announced in February 2004 that he was training for one more comeback fight to demonstrate that the age of 55, like 40, is not a \"death sentence.\" The bout, against an unspecified opponent (rumored to be [[Trevor Berbick]]), never materialized (it was widely thought that Foreman's wife had been a major factor in the change of plans). George Foreman left the sport of boxing after leaving HBO to pursue other opportunities.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:GeorgeForemanSept09.jpg|thumb|right|Foreman speaking in Houston, Texas, in September 2009]]\nForeman has been married to Mary Joan Martelly since 1985.

Prior to that, he was paid about 40% of the profits on each grill sold (earning him $4.5 million a month in payouts at its peak), so it is estimated he has made a total of over $200 million from the endorsement, substantially more than he earned as a boxer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_51/b3913093.htm |title=George Foreman Grill. |work=Business Week |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|ko-wins=68\n|ko-losses=1\n|dec-wins=8\n|dec-losses=4\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\n|-\n!{{abbr|No.|Number}}\n!Result\n!Record\n!Opponent\n!Type\n!Round, time\n!Date\n!Age\n!Location\n!Notes\n|-\n|81\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|76\u20135\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Shannon Briggs]]\n|MD\n|12\n|[[George Foreman vs. Shannon Briggs|Nov 22, 1997]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1997|11|22}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Etess Arena]], Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Lost lineal heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|80\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|76\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Lou Savarese]]\n|{{abbr|SD|Split decision}}\n|12\n|Apr 26, 1997\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1997|04|26}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Retained WBU and lineal heavyweight titles}}\n|-\n|79\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|75\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Crawford Grimsley]]\n|UD\n|12\n|Nov 3, 1996\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1996|11|3}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|JPN}} {{small|[[Tokyo Bay NK Hall|NK Hall]], [[Urayasu]], Japan}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Retained WBU and lineal heavyweight titles;<br>Won vacant [[International Boxing Association (professional)|IBA]] heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|78\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|74\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|GER}} [[Axel Schulz]]\n|MD\n|12\n|[[George Foreman vs. Axel Schulz|Apr 22, 1995]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1995|4|22}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|MGM Grand Garden Arena, Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Retained IBF and lineal heavyweight titles;<br>Won vacant [[World Boxing Union|WBU]] heavyweight title}}\n|-\n|77\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|73\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Michael Moorer]]\n|KO\n|10 (12), {{small|2:03}}\n|[[Michael Moorer vs. George Foreman|Nov 5, 1994]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1994|11|5}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[MGM Grand Garden Arena]], Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|Won WBA, IBF, and lineal heavyweight titles}}\n|-\n|76\n|{{no2}}Loss\n|72\u20134\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Tommy Morrison]]\n|UD\n|12\n|[[George Foreman vs. Tommy Morrison|Jun 7, 1993]]\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1993|6|7}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Thomas & Mack Center, Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{small|For vacant [[list of WBO world champions#Heavyweight|WBO heavyweight title]]}}\n|-\n|75\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|72\u20133\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|RSA|1928}} [[Pierre Coetzer]]\n|TKO\n|8 (10), {{small|1:48}}\n|Jan 16, 1993\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1993|1|16}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|Convention Center, Reno, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|74\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|71\u20133\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|JAM}} [[Alex Stewart (boxer)|Alex Stewart]]\n|{{abbr|MD|Majority decision}}\n|10\n|Apr 11, 1992\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{age in years and days|1949|01|10|1992|4|11}}\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} {{small|[[Thomas & Mack Center]], Paradise, Nevada, U.S.}}\n|\n|-\n|73\n|{{yes2}}Win\n|70\u20133\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{flagicon|USA}} Jimmy K.
