M. Barrie]]'s characters [[Peter Pan]], the Darling brothers, and the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]].  Late in life, his only surviving brother [[Nicholas Llewelyn Davies|Nico]] described him as \"the cleverest of us, the most original, the potential genius.\"<ref name=\"birkin\" /> He died in ambiguous circumstances drowning with a close friend &ndash; and possible lover<ref name=\"jmb.co.uk\" /> &ndash; just short of his 21st birthday. He was a first cousin of English writer [[Daphne du Maurier]].\n\n==Early life and Peter Pan==\n[[Image:Michael Llewelyn Davies as Peter Pan.jpg|220px|thumb|left|Davies dressed as Peter Pan at age 6]]\nDavies was the fourth of five sons of [[Arthur Llewelyn Davies|Arthur]] and [[Sylvia Llewelyn Davies]].  He was born three years after Barrie became friends with his older brothers and mother in 1897.  He and his eldest brother [[George Llewelyn Davies|George]] were the boys closest to Barrie, and he is widely reported as the individual who most influenced the portrayal of Peter Pan in the 1911 [[novel]] based on the play. He was an infant as Barrie was writing the first appearance of Peter Pan as a newborn in ''[[The Little White Bird]]''.  He was four-and-a-half-years-old when ''[[Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' debuted in December 1904.  The following winter, he was ill for several months, so in February 1906, Barrie and producer [[Charles Frohman]] brought scenery and some of the cast to the family's home in [[Berkhamsted]] to perform the play for him.<ref name=\"birkin\" />  Barrie began writing a sequel to ''Peter Pan'' about the boy's brother, to be entitled ''Michael Pan'', but instead incorporated this material (such as the hero's nightmares) into the novel ''[[Peter and Wendy]]''.<ref name=\"birkin\" />\n\nThe [[statue of Peter Pan]] in [[Kensington Gardens]], erected in secret during the night of 30 April 1912, was meant to be modelled upon photographs of Michael Llewelyn Davies at the age of six, dressed as the character. However, sculptor [[George Frampton]] used a different child as his model, leaving Barrie very disappointed with the result. \"It doesn't show the devil in Peter,\" the writer said.<ref name=\"birkin\" />\n\nBarrie became [[Legal guardian|guardian]] of Davies and his brothers following the deaths of their father in 1907 and mother in 1910.  Davies and Barrie remained very close as Davies grew up and went away to school, particularly after his eldest brother [[George Llewelyn Davies|George]] died in combat in [[Flanders]] during [[World War I]] in 1915.  His youngest brother [[Nicholas Llewelyn Davies|Nico]] later described Michael and George as \"the Ones\", the boys who meant the most to Barrie.  Davies attended [[Eton College]], where he had difficulty adjusting to life away from his family, and he exchanged letters daily with \"Uncle Jim\" Barrie. He also suffered from nightmares, which he had experienced since childhood. Nonetheless, he made a number of friends and excelled at his studies, including art and writing poetry, and was generally described as a \"brilliant boy\", one destined for great things.\n\n==Adulthood==\n[[Image:Rupert Buxton 1920.jpg|130px|thumb|left|Rupert Buxton in 1920]]\n\nAfter finishing at Eton, Davies attended [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he continued to correspond regularly with Barrie.  He briefly decided to study art at the [[University of Paris]], but returned to Oxford.  Several friends from Eton joined him there, but he also became very close to Rupert Buxton,<ref>[http://neverpedia.com/pan/Rupert_Buxton Rupert Erroll Victor Buxton article at Neverpedia]</ref> the son of [[Sir Thomas Buxton, 4th Baronet|Sir Thomas Fowell Victor Buxton, 4th Baronet]]<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p19706.htm thePeerage.com - Person Page 19706<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and a former pupil of [[Harrow School]].  The two became inseparable friends, spending time both at the university and on holiday together.  Buxton was also a poet, and had an interest in acting. Buxton was one of the few friends of Davies whom Barrie reported getting along with.\n\nIn an interview taped in 1976, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Robert Boothby]], who had been a close friend of Davies at Eton and Oxford, spoke about Davies' relationships during this time.  When asked if Davies were [[homosexuality|homosexual]], Boothby &ndash; who was reported by newspapers to have had homosexual relationships as an adult<ref>[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/kray/invincibles_9.html The Kray Twins: Brothers in Arms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218230420/http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/mob_bosses/kray/invincibles_9.html |date=18 December 2007 }}</ref> &ndash; replied it was \"a phase...

Boothby reported that he had discouraged Davies' relationship with Buxton, warning of \"a feeling of doom\" he had about him.  Although Boothby criticised the relationship between Davies and his surrogate father Barrie as \"morbid\" and \"unhealthy\", he dismissed the notion that there was a sexual aspect to it.  However, he admitted that there had been a sexual relationship between Davies and Buxton.<ref name=\"jmb.co.uk\">[http://www.JMBarrie.co.uk Andrew Birkin's site about Barrie and the Davies family]</ref>\n\n==Death==\n[[Image:Michael Llewelyn Davies death.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Newspaper report of Davies' drowning]]\nAbout a month before Davies's 21st birthday, he and Buxton drowned together in Sandford Lasher, a pool of water downstream of a [[weir]] near [[Sandford Lock]] on the [[River Thames]], a few miles from [[Oxford]].\n\nThe closeness of Davies and Buxton, combined with the uncertain circumstances of their deaths, led to speculation that the pair had died in a [[suicide pact]]. Dangerous currents in Sandford Lasher had made the pool notorious as a drowning hazard \u2013 there were warning signs and a conspicuous 19th century memorial to previous victims. Despite this, the pair had gone swimming there before.\n\nThe water was {{convert|20|to|30|ft|m|0}} deep, but calm. Buxton was a good swimmer, but Davies had a fear of water and could not swim proficiently. A witness at the coroner's inquest reported that one man was swimming to join the other, who was sitting on a stone on the weir, but he experienced \"difficulties\" and the other dived in to reach him.  However, the witness also reported, when he saw their heads together in the water they did not appear to be struggling.  Their bodies were recovered \"clasped\" together the next day (sometimes misreported later as \"tied together\"). The coroner's conclusion was Davies had drowned accidentally, and Buxton had drowned trying to save him.<ref name=\"birkin\" /><ref>[http://jmbarrie.co.uk/allscans/fullsize/1921-05-27-DX-MLD-death-Oxford_Chronicle.jpg Oxford Chronicle article about coroner's inquest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814070514/http://www.jmbarrie.co.uk/allscans/fullsize/1921-05-27-DX-MLD-death-Oxford_Chronicle.jpg |date=14 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' published the following in an obituary for the pair: \n<blockquote>Two House men whose loss would have been more widely and more deeply mourned, it would be impossible to find.
