She meets Cyril ([[Fahadh Faasil]]) from the travel consultancy agency working towards setting up her visa. They soon fall in love and start living together. Tessa loves him with all her heart and takes their relationship and living together seriously.\n\nOne day while at a pub, a guy misbehaves with Tessa and Cyril beats him up badly. The guy tries to take revenge on Cyril and searches for him. Cyril goes into hiding with the help of his boss Hegde ([[Prathap Pothen]]). Hegde arrives at Cyril's home to inform Tessa about the situation. Then he asks her plainly \"Can I have sex with you?\" Though Tessa disagrees she is beaten up and forced to the bed. She gets raped that day. Cyril becomes violent and wants to kill Hegde. Tessa calms him down saying that she does not want to make the incident worse than it is; she instead wants to get to Canada at the earliest. Once Tessa recovers from her injuries, Hegde visits her again to ask for forgiveness. He comes while Cyril is not around and finds her in injury. He then rapes her again and leaves her. Tessa decides not to travel abroad and plans to murder Hegde.\n\nCyril discusses the situation with his boss who suggests killing Tessa and appoints Cyril to do it. Cyril traps her by putting some drugs in her bag. The police arrest Tessa and she is imprisoned. While Tessa calls out for help, she finds Cyril simply walking away from her, which is when she realizes Cyril set her up. Cyril relocates to Cochin and runs a modeling agency. While in prison Tessa meets Zubeida (Rashmi Sathish) who is sentenced for murder. Through Zubeida's criminal world connections Tessa realizes that Cyril is a known pimp and was cheating her along with the support of his boss Hegde. Zubeida and Tessa bond well with each other, and Zubeida molds a criminal mindset within her for the strength and courage needed to strike back at Cyril and Hegde.\n\nWhen the court sets her free, Tessa with the help of DK (Sathaar) kills Hegde by poisoning him with a cobra. Next, she arrives in Cochin as a [[femme fatale]] in search of Cyril while pretending to be a model. Later one night Tessa hooks up with Cyril in his studio. Cyril who had recognized her earlier reveals it and angrily berates her. He beats her and abuses her by calling her a \"slut who does any 'adjustment' to flourish her career\" for stopping her further being a menace to him. But his frustration dissolves slowly as he wants to enjoy her company. She reminds him she is a mere woman.\n\nBut at night Tessa executes her revenge plan and [[sedates]] Cyril and sadistically [[Penectomy|penectomises]] him. When he regains consciousness she tells him that she has removed his male organ through a medical surgery. While Cyril finds himself in intense pain and bound to his bed, she taunts him to make him realize his faults and the gross wrongs he committed to her and rationalizes her crime. But he doesn't yield to her taunts and reveals a back-story concerning his mother and that his life as a pimp is not entirely his fault.\n\nTessa tells Cyril that she knows that she is still somewhere in his heart. She reminds him that she has only lost someone who cheated on her, whereas he lost someone who genuinely loved him. Now Cyril is stunned that he is not even able to face Tessa. Cyril recollects that her love was true and his love was overshadowed by his male supremacy concept and greed for wealth. Over the days he admits his actions that caused her pain. Then Tessa leaves him but not before inviting him to settle the score with her, if any remains there. Cyril accepts the challenge of a true criminal as he is and taunts her that he will confront her when he is ready, most probably knowing that he has to settle the score with her in terms of true love with roots in violence. Tessa leaves for Canada, dismantles her cell phone, and cuts further contact with DK.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rima Kallingal]] as Tessa K. Abraham\n*[[Fahadh Faasil]]  as Cyril C. Mathew\n* [[Pratap K.

Kumar had worked with Ashik in ''Daddy Cool'' and ''Salt 'N Pepper'' as an assistant director.

He says that the film, which was shot on a multi-camera, was a big challenge for him. \"It is a thriller-cum-romance movie. In the first half, there is romance and suddenly a rape scene, so I had to add a lot of grays to give that effect. And, the climax was the most challenging part, as it\u2019s very dramatic and I had to add the proper effect to retain the mood. Here, the subject was a little dark so I could experiment, but in normal movies you can\u2019t do much of an experiment. Also, you have to keep in mind the taste of Malayalis,\" says Khalid.<ref>[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloid/kochi/malayalam-directors-usher-new-cinematic-language-860 \"Malayalam directors usher in a new cinematic language\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601001255/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloid/kochi/malayalam-directors-usher-new-cinematic-language-860 |date=1 June 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''22 Female Kottayam'' received positive critical response upon its release.\n\n''[[The Times of India]]'' rated it 3 out of 5 stars, concluding that \"The film has a theme as old as the [[Kannaki]] myth but comes nowhere near in terms of inspiration.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/regional/others/malayalam-movie-reviews/22-Female-Kottayam/movie-review/12690562.cms|title=22 Female Kottayam movie review|date=15 April 2012|accessdate=23 April 2012|work=The Times Of India}}</ref> [[Oneindia.in|One India]] commented that \"22 Female Kottayam is like a fresh whiff of breeze\" and concluded the review by adding, \"Cheers for director Ashik for experimenting with such a novel and path breaking plot.\"<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/malayalam/reviews/2012/22-female-kottayam-movie-review-160412.html 22 Female Kottayam \u2013 Movie Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Rediff]] also rated the film 3 out of 5 star praising the direction of Ashik by saying \"Ashik adds a distinct style to his direction with 22 Female Kottayam.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rediff.com/movies/report/south-review-22-female-kottayam-is-interesting/20120416.htm|title=Review: 22 Female Kottayam is interesting|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=23 April 2012}}</ref> [[Sify]] rated it as good and said that \"22 Female Kottayam may be far from perfect, but it is a movie in the right direction.

Cyril recollects that her love was true and his love was overshadowed by his male supremacy concept and greed for wealth. Over the days he admits his actions that caused her pain. Then Tessa leaves him but not before inviting him to settle the score with her, if any remains there. Cyril accepts the challenge of a true criminal as he is and taunts her that he will confront her when he is ready, most probably knowing that he has to settle the score with her in terms of true love with roots in violence. Tessa leaves for Canada, dismantles her cell phone, and cuts further contact with DK.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Rima Kallingal]] as Tessa K. Abraham\n*[[Fahadh Faasil]]  as Cyril C. Mathew\n* [[Pratap K.

Here, the subject was a little dark so I could experiment, but in normal movies you can\u2019t do much of an experiment.

His Superboy outfit consists of red sneakers, blue jeans, zippered jacket with the \"S-shield\" and cape attached to the back. \n\nOn designing Jon's Superboy costume, artist Jorge Jimenez said: \"I started trying out some of the more classic designs as a mini homage to the classic Superman, but the guys at DC wanted to experiment with something more casual, as those are the designs that have been working better recently. We are also looking at an incomplete \"Superboy;\" he's not super yet, so it's reasonable to say that if he's only half super, that he should have clothing that's half super. So we started to play around with clothing that I see as popular right now with teenagers. For example, tight ripped jeans, at least in Spain, are very popular right now and I think they give a lot of mobility to the character when I draw him on the page. I've also used a popular shoe design. I must mention that I like putting effort into what I wear personally, so this way I was able to add a bit of myself to the character. The short length of the cape gives it a younger look, and the zipped hoodie\u2026 I did that thinking they might make a real version for people to wear.

He and Lois had a son named Jonathan, who inherited his father's super power.\n*In the [[Elseworlds]] graphic novel ''[[Son of Superman]]'', Jon Kent is a 15-year-old teenage boy who never knew his father Clark Kent or that he was the superhero, Superman, as his father disappeared before he was born. When a solar storm's radiation triggers his Kryptonian powers, he learns the truth about his father from his mother Lois Lane. Jon dons a costume inspired by his father's, and later successfully rescues his father from a secret facility where he is being held as a prisoner. Superman reunites with his family. When it's revealed that [[Lex Luthor]] was responsible for Superman's capture, Jon teams up with his father to stop Lex. After a prolonged battle, Lex is defeated. Superman decides to temporarily retire from being a superhero and focus more on his family. This leaves Jon to be the first of a new generation of superheroes.\n*In the New 52 ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' book, Jon is the Superman of the future, who was put into captivity for study by Brother Eye with the rest of the future Justice League. It's unknown what happened to his father. Jon's costume and role are the same as his father's from his appearance in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' animated series, though Jon is younger than his father was in the cartoon.\n*In the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', after Superman returns to Earth after five years, he learns that Lois is engaged to Richard White (the nephew of editor-in-chief Perry White) and the two share a young son, Jason White. When the boy begins to exhibit superpowers, he is revealed to be the son of Superman.\n*In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s Elseworlds comic book series ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Superman and Lois have two children, Joel and Kara Kent. When Lois was pregnant with her son, Joel, Lex Luthor and [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] exposed her to Gold Kryptonite radiation, causing Joel to be born without any of his father's powers. Their daughter Kara, began developing superpowers at age 6 and eventually took on the superhero identity of [[Supergirl]]. Joel gains powers from a formula created by Luthor, and is manipulated into killing his sister before dying from the formula's side effects, leaving his own son to be raised by Batman's son Bruce Wayne Jr.\n*In the Elseworlds series ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', Adam Kent, the son of Lois and Superman, born shortly after a mysterious plague which nearly kills the entire male population.

We are also looking at an incomplete \"Superboy;\" he's not super yet, so it's reasonable to say that if he's only half super, that he should have clothing that's half super. So we started to play around with clothing that I see as popular right now with teenagers. For example, tight ripped jeans, at least in Spain, are very popular right now and I think they give a lot of mobility to the character when I draw him on the page. I've also used a popular shoe design. I must mention that I like putting effort into what I wear personally, so this way I was able to add a bit of myself to the character. The short length of the cape gives it a younger look, and the zipped hoodie\u2026 I did that thinking they might make a real version for people to wear.

Lois and Clark initially refuse, but Jon reveals his fears and insecurities to his parents, and this could be an opportunity to understand himself better. Lois agrees to go with them, but doesn't stay with Jon and Jor-El for long. While Lois soon returned to Earth, Jon and Jor-El traveled through space for some time afterward, until their ship suddenly fell into a black hole. Jon found himself on [[Earth-3]], where he was quickly taken prisoner by [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]]. After being imprisoned in a volcano for years, Jon was eventually rescued by Jor-El and sent back to Earth, finding that while years have passed for him, only three weeks have passed on Earth since he left.\n\nFollowing a battle against Rogol Zaar, the Houses of El and Zod meet with the heads of several planets to discuss Zaar's and Jor-El's roles in Krypton's destruction. Jon suggests forming the [[United Planets]], and the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] appears and offers Jon a membership in their ranks.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe first superpower Jonathan developed was super hearing.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer=Jurgens, Dan|penciller=Weeks, Lee|Story=Arrived V|Title=Superman: Lois and Clark|Issue=5|date=April 2016}}</ref> Other powers (invulnerability and superhuman strength) began to manifest when both he and his mother were put in danger.

However, Jon's power instability was, in fact, the result of [[Manchester Black]]'s manipulation. After Black is defeated, Jon's powers are restored to normal.\n\nAccording to Batman, Jon's mixed biology could have the potential of him becoming more powerful than his father, Superman.<ref>{{Cite comic| writer=Tomasi, Peter J; Gleason, Patrick|penciller=Gleason, Patrick|Story=Black Dawn: Part 1|Title=Superman|volume=4|Issue=20|date=June 2017}}</ref> Due to Jon's young age, his powers and control often fluctuate with his emotions.

After his last battle, Superman removed his powers using gold kryptonite, he settled down and married Lois and lived an anonymous normal life under the alias, Jordan Elliot. He and Lois had a son named Jonathan, who inherited his father's super power.\n*In the [[Elseworlds]] graphic novel ''[[Son of Superman]]'', Jon Kent is a 15-year-old teenage boy who never knew his father Clark Kent or that he was the superhero, Superman, as his father disappeared before he was born. When a solar storm's radiation triggers his Kryptonian powers, he learns the truth about his father from his mother Lois Lane. Jon dons a costume inspired by his father's, and later successfully rescues his father from a secret facility where he is being held as a prisoner. Superman reunites with his family. When it's revealed that [[Lex Luthor]] was responsible for Superman's capture, Jon teams up with his father to stop Lex. After a prolonged battle, Lex is defeated. Superman decides to temporarily retire from being a superhero and focus more on his family. This leaves Jon to be the first of a new generation of superheroes.\n*In the New 52 ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' book, Jon is the Superman of the future, who was put into captivity for study by Brother Eye with the rest of the future Justice League. It's unknown what happened to his father. Jon's costume and role are the same as his father's from his appearance in the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' animated series, though Jon is younger than his father was in the cartoon.\n*In the 2006 film ''[[Superman Returns]]'', after Superman returns to Earth after five years, he learns that Lois is engaged to Richard White (the nephew of editor-in-chief Perry White) and the two share a young son, '''Jason White'''. When the boy begins to exhibit superpowers, he is revealed to be the son of Superman.\n*In [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s Elseworlds comic book series ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Superman and Lois have two children, '''Joel''' and '''Kara Kent'''. When Lois was pregnant with her son, Joel, Lex Luthor and [[Joker (character)|the Joker]] exposed her to Gold Kryptonite radiation, causing Joel to be born without any of his father's powers. Their daughter Kara, began developing superpowers at age 6 and eventually took on the superhero identity of [[Supergirl]]. Joel gains powers from a formula created by Luthor, and is manipulated into killing his sister before dying from the formula's side effects, leaving his own son to be raised by Batman's son Bruce Wayne Jr.\n*In the Elseworlds series ''[[JLA: Created Equal]]'', '''Adam Kent''', the son of Lois and Superman, born shortly after a mysterious plague which nearly kills the entire male population.

The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s.

The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s.

Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].\n\nThe first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''[[Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum]]'' (released soon after).

As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her not to return. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;\u2013 unknown to Asrad&nbsp;\u2013 soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, \"Djaoeh Dimata\", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|''Het Dagblad'' 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385\u2013387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;\u2013 [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;\u2013 six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339\u2013343}}\n\nAfter the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}\n\n==Production==\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = [[Ratna Asmara]] and [[Ali Joego]], stars of the film\n\n| image1    = Ratna Asmara p298.JPG\n| alt1      = Ratna Asmara, pictured in 1940\n| width1    = 182\n\n| image2    = Ali Yugo in Djaoeh di Mata.jpg\n| alt2      = Ali Yugo, pictured in 1948\n| width2= 200\n}}\nSPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A.
