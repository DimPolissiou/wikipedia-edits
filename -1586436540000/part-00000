DVB has been standardized by [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]].\n\nThis system transmits compressed digital audio, video, and other data in \"physical layer pipes\" (PLPs), using [[OFDM]] modulation with concatenated [[channel coding]] and interleaving. The higher offered bit rate, with respect to its predecessor DVB-T, makes it a system suited for carrying [[HDTV]] signals on the terrestrial TV channel (though many broadcasters still use plain DVB-T for this purpose).\n\n{{As of|2019}}, it was implemented in broadcasts in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Freeview HD]], eight channels across two multiplexes, plus an extra multiplex in [[Northern Ireland]] carrying three SD channels), [[Italy]] ([[Europa 7 HD]], twelve channels), [[Finland]] (21 channels, five in HD), [[Germany]] (six HD (1080p50) channels, with 40 in planning)<ref name=\"dvbt2germany\">{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2016/06/06/dvb-t2-to-launch-in-germany-with-40-channels/|title=DVB-T2 to launch in Germany with 40 channels|date=6 June 2016|first=J\u00f6rn|last=Krieger|website=Broadband TV News}}</ref>, [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]] ([[Digitenne]], 30 HD (1080p50) channels), [[Sweden]] (five channels),<ref name=\"Teracom\">[http://www.teracom.se/Sandarinformation/Utbyggnadsplaner/ Teracom information on DVB-T2 transmissions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009232808/http://www.teracom.se/Sandarinformation/Utbyggnadsplaner/ |date=9 October 2010 }} {{in lang|sv}}</ref><ref name=\"Boxer\">[http://www.boxer.se/kundservice/kundservice-informerar/HDTV-sandningarna-startar-1-november/ Boxers list of DVB-T2 channels] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018190929/http://www.boxer.se/kundservice/kundservice-informerar/HDTV-sandningarna-startar-1-november/ |date=18 October 2010 }} {{in lang|sv}}</ref> [[Thailand]] (41 SD, 9 HD channels)<ref name=\"NBTC\">[http://digital.nbtc.go.th/ The Thai National Telecommunications and Broadcasting Committee] {{in lang|th}}</ref> [[Flanders]] (18 SD Channels), [[Serbia]] (eight channels<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etv.rs/televizija/mux1/|title=\u041f\u0440\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u2013 \u0415\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0438 \u0412\u0435\u0437\u0435|website=etv.rs}}</ref>), [[Ukraine]] (32 SD and HD channels in four nationwide multiplexes), [[Croatia]] (two pay-TV multiplexes, one experimental multiplex to be used for regular TV broadcasting in HEVC and 1080p50 once legacy DVB-T transmissions cease), [[Denmark]] (two pay-TV multiplexes with 20 channels), [[Romania]] (8 SD channels, 1 HD channel) and some other countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Preliminary investigation===\nIn March 2006 DVB decided to study options for an upgraded DVB-T standard.

Normal FECFRAMEs are 64,800 bits long, whereas short FECFRAMEs are 16,200 bits long. The effective code rates are 32,208/64,800 (1/2), 38,688/64,800 (3/5), 43,040/64,800 (2/3), 48,408/64,800 (3/4), 51,648/64,800 (4/5), 53,840/64,800 (5/6)\n*** ''Outer encoding'': a [[BCH code]], capable to correct 10 or 12 errors per FECFRAME, is used to compute parity data for the information data field. The BCH generator polynomial is of the 160th, 168th, or 192nd grade\n*** ''Inner encoding'': a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code is cascaded to the BCH\n** Bit interleaving\n*** Parity bits block interleaving\n*** Twist column interleaving\n** Bit demultiplexing to cell words[[File:Dvbt2 256qam rotated.png|thumb|right|Constellation map of the rotated 256-QAM modulation (tilt angle is 3.57 degrees)]]\n** ''Gray mapping of cell words to constellations'': either QPSK (4-QAM), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, or 256-QAM maps are used\n** ''Constellation rotation and cyclic quadrature (Q) delay'': optionally, the constellations may be tilted counterclockwise by an amount of up to 30 degrees. Furthermore, the quadrature (imaginary) part of the cells is cyclically shifted by one cell\n** Cell interleaving\n** Time interleaving\n* ''Frame building'': the transmitted stream is organized in super frames, which are composed by T2 frames and FEF (Future Extension Frame) parts\n** ''Cell mapping'': cells are mapped to OFDM symbols. A T2 frame is composed by a P1 symbol, one or more P2 symbols, regular data symbols, and a Frame Closing symbol (for certain configuration parameters). The P1 symbol is used for synchronization purposes, the P2 symbols convey L1 parameter configuration signaling, whereas the data symbols carry PLP data (there are three types: common PLPs, type 1 PLPs, and type 2 PLPs), auxiliary streams, and dummy symbols used as space filler\n** ''Frequency interleaving'': random interleaving is done on every OFDM symbol (except P1)\n* OFDM generation\n** ''Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) processing'': Alamouti pre-processing is optionally applied to pairs of OFDM symbol cells. Given <math>a_i</math> the input cells, <math>e^{(1)}_i</math> and <math>e^{(2)}_i</math> transmitter group 1 and 2 cells, the mapping is done as <math>e^{(1)}_i = a_i</math> and <math>e^{(1)}_{i+1} = a_{i+1}</math> for group 1, and as <math>e^{(2)}_i = -a^*_{i+1}</math> and <math>e^{(2)}_{i+1} = a^*_{i}</math> for group 2\n** ''Pilot insertion and dummy tone reservation'': three classes of pilot tones are added. They are either continual (fixed position), scattered (cyclically moving position), or edge (boundary positions). There are 8 different configuration for scattered pilots (PP1 ... PP8). Moreover, a number of dummy carriers are not modulated and reserved to reduce the dynamic range of the DVB-T2 output signal (it helps to combat nonlinear phenomena in power amplifiers during broadcast).\n** ''Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)'': classic IDFT is used to switch from the frequency domain into the time domain, after having adjusted carrier position relevant to the central transmit frequency. 1k (1024) to 32k (32768) carriers are available. There is also an ''extended'' mode, which allows to fill more data in the available bandwidth, using more active carriers and reducing the number of guard band (null) carriers.\n** Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) reduction, also called [[crest factor#Crest factor reduction|crest factor reduction]]\n** ''Guard interval insertion'': a cyclic prefix is inserted before the IDFT symbol, to recover from transmit channel echoes (multipath). Lengths from 1/128 to 1/4 of the IDFT length are allowed.\n** ''P1 symbol insertion'': the P1 symbol is a particularly crafted 1k OFDM symbol, always inserted at the head of a T2 frame. It conveys few bits of information (spread, scrambled and DBPSK modulated), as it is mainly dedicated to fast synchronization (both in time and in frequency) at the receiver side. It is prepended and postpended by frequency shifted repetitions of itself, to ease receiver lock even if the nominal center frequency of the T2 signal is up to 500&nbsp;kHz off.\n** ''Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC)'': the T2 samples are converted into an analog BB complex (I&Q) signal at a sample rate that depends on the channelization bandwidth. For instance, in 8&nbsp;MHz wide channels, the complex sample time is 7/64 \u03bcs.\n\n==Market adoption==\nWhen the digital terrestrial HDTV service [[Freeview HD]] was launched in December 2009, it was the first DVB-T2 service intended for the general public. As of November 2010, DVB-T2 broadcasts were available in a couple of European countries.\n\nThe earliest introductions of T2 have usually been tied with a launch of high-definition television. There are however some countries where HDTV is broadcast using the old DVB-T standard with no immediate plans to switch those broadcasts to DVB-T2. Among countries using DVB-T for nationwide broadcasts of HDTV are [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], and [[Taiwan]]. These are usually using MPEG4. [[Australia]] started broadcasting HD content over DVB-T with MPEG2, although in 2015 some Australian broadcasters switched to MPEG4.\n\nCountries where DVB-T2 is in use include:\n* [[Afghanistan]]: Four multiplexes, fully launched April 2015<ref name=\"oqaab.af\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oqaab.af/first-digital-terrestrial-television-network-dvb-t2-starts-broadcasting/|title=100,000 likes \u2013 Oqaab reaches over 1 Mio TV Households|date=31 March 2015|publisher=|access-date=28 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323182055/http://www.oqaab.af/first-digital-terrestrial-television-network-dvb-t2-starts-broadcasting/|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Albania]]: One multiplex full launch in July 2011. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[Argentina]]: Launch in February 2014 (Antina - UHF operating DVB-T in Buenos Aires area).  {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[Armenia]]: Launch in May 2015.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n* [[Austria]]: three multiplexes (D, E, F), full launch in April 2013, 22 transmissions sites    {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[Belarus]]: two multiplexes (2nd and 3rd), 89 transmission sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zala.by/by/node/8075|title=\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0443\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u043e 2-\u043c \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435 {{!}} ZALA|website=zala.by|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zala.by/information-about-radius-3nd-multiplex|title=\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0443\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 3-\u043c \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435 {{!}} ZALA|website=zala.by|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zala.by/karta-okhvata|title=\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 DVB-T2 {{!}} ZALA|website=zala.by|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n* [[Belgium]]: Expected to begin in March 2013.<ref>[http://www.norkring.be/downloads/20120503_DVB-T2_ENG.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2018|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n* [[Croatia]]: Two multiplexes launched in late 2012 for pay TV platform EVO TV.

This replaced DVB-T, the previously selected standard for digital TV, which was chosen after technical evaluation of several digital TV standards. The two standards coexisted until 2015 when DVB-T was turned off. \n\nDigital TV has been deployed gradually across the country, starting with the four main cities, Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Cali and Barranquilla followed by smaller cities such as Armenia, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, C\u00facuta, Manizales, Pereira and Santa Marta. By 2014, most main cities had digital TV. Due to the country's topography as well as there being no sharing of masts between the public and private broadcasters, the coverage in rural areas is patchy. There has been talk of using DVB-S2 (satellite) to ensure 100% coverage: as of January 2020 this hasn't happened.\n\nThe first two transmissions were by the two private TV channels [[RCN TV]] and [[Caracol TV]]. [[RTVC]] (the national government TV broadcaster) started to broadcast using the standard in 2013.\n\nThe digital system is known in Colombia as TDT which means Televisi\u00f3n Digital Terrestrial (Digital Terrestrial Television).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tdtcolombia.info/#anteriores|title=Televisi\u00f3n Digital Terrestre (TDT) en Colombia|language=es|website=TDTColombia.info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518160111/http://tdtcolombia.info/#anteriores|archive-date=2014-05-18|access-date=2014-06-15 |url-status=usurped}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdtparatodos.tv |title=TDT: Televisi\u00f3n Digital para Todos &#124; TDT Colombia |language=es |publisher=Tdtparatodos.tv |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}</ref>\n\n===Croatia===\nOn 13 October 2011, the Croatian Post and Electronic Communications Agency granted license for MUX C and MUX E, both in DVB-T2 standard.\n\nAlso in October 2011, [[Oda\u0161ilja\u010di i veze|OiV - Transmitters & Communications]] started testing on UHF channel 53 from Sljeme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skendi.com|title=Skendy portal - Digitalna televizija -DVB-T-DVB-T2-MUX A-MUX B-MUX D|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTwo DVB-T2 multiplexes launched in late 2012 by pay TV platform EVO TV.\n\nIn addition to that in September 2019 DVB-T2 was launched for free-to-air television, using the HEVC/H.265 codec and 720p or 1080p resolution.

Currently DD National, DD National HD, DD News, DD Bharati, DD Sports, and DD Regional/DD Kisan are being relayed.\n\n===Indonesia===\nThe project to adopt DVB-T technology in Indonesia was started about 2007 with 'full' government support as the project initiator. All television broadcasters were offered to transform their analog broadcasts into the new digital form, some were interested to follow suit and started testing their new digital broadcasts and some are still uninterested back then.\n\nDuring the [[DVB-T]] testing period, Indonesian government (via its Ministry of Information & Communication Technology [ICT]) wanted to switch to DVB-T2 technology which provides better signal efficiency, capacity and corrections compared to DVB-T. The TV broadcasters still testing their DVB-T broadcasts agreed to join the DVB-T2 conversion program offered by the government since they saw the significant benefits by switching to DVB-T2 (such as higher data rate for HD content and better carrier-to-noise ratio management), even though it would introduce additional cost for those who have bought DVB-T equipment. The official switch to DVB-T2 from DVB-T was started February 2012, based on ICT Minister decree (about 5 years from DVB-T introduction and adopting/nurturing period in Indonesia).<ref>[[DVB-T#cite note-14|Standar Penyiaran Televisi Digital]] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n\nThe Indonesian Ministry of Information & Communication Technology expects the final DVB-T2 digital television regulation to be finished in 2020 and the analog switch off transition will begin in the same year.<ref>DVB-T2 Seminar by Ministry of Information & Communication Technology at Hotel Borobudur, Jakarta on 26 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\nStarted testing DVB-T in mid 2006, but outlined plans to switch to DVB-T2 in 2011, after which tests of both were run concurrently.

Roll-out began in late 2016 in the Borneo states of Malaysia and has mostly concluded by mid-2017. Plans to shut off analog by mid-2018, but after the opposing party won in the 14th general election, the shutdown was postponed to mid-2019.\n\nSouth and central Peninsular Malaysia has switched to fully digital TV on 30 September 2019. North and Eastern Peninsular Malaysia has also shut off analog on 14 October 2019.

The package consists of 10 channels on the UHF ch35.\n\n===Romania===\nAlthough Romania started DVB-T Broadcasting in 2005 with the [[MPEG-2]] standard for SD broadcast and MPEG 4 for HD, it was only experimental. In June 2011 Romania shifted to MPEG4 both for SD and HD. In 2012, the Romanian authorities decided that DVB-T2 will be the standard used for terrestrial broadcasts, as it allows a larger number of programs to be broadcast on the same multiplex. Romania's switchover plans were initially delayed due to economical and feasibility-related reasons. One of the reasons was that most Romanian consumers already extensively used either cable or satellite services, which developed very quickly and became very popular after 1990. In fact, a technological boom started around 2003, driven by a solid economical development in the field of telecommunications, made several private operators create large networks of fiber optics and cable covering all of Romania, which are now used for providing both TV, telephony, and high quality broadband internet. As the prices for complete packages (TV, internet, telephony) are low and the quality quite good (e.g. about 20 EUR for 500Mbit/s internet, ~120 SD and HD digital cable TV channels and telephony, with an added 2-4 EUR for mobile telephony), the interest for over-the-air TV quickly became very low. There are rumors that commercial broadcasters that traditionally transmitted over-the-air using analogue channels (like [[MediaPro]], [[Antena GROUP]], [[Prima TV]]) will give up terrestrial broadcasting and will be available only on pay-TV services, like cable, satellite and IPTV. It is also rumored that the DVB-T standard (with MPEG-4 encoding) will continue until 2018.\n\nOn 17 June 2015 analogue terrestrial television was switched off, with the exception of the main public TV program (TVR1) which will continue to be broadcast strictly in the VHF band until the end of 2016.\n\nFree-to-air DVB-T2 broadcasts on MUX1 (provided by the state-owned Radiocom) are available since June 2015 in Timisoara (UHF channel 21), Cluj-Napoca (UHF channel 26), Iasi (UHF channel 25), and Bucharest (UHF channel 30).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocom.ro/business/servicii/Broadcasting/Broadcasting-TV/#|title=RADIOCOM - Internet broadband, broadcasting radio-TV, VPN, telefonie, videoconferinta, linii inchiriate|website=www.radiocom.ro}}</ref> The coverage will be extendend so that at the end of 2016, over 90% of the territory will be covered.

TVR announced that TVR News and TVR 3 will be closed, and the fate of TVR HD, is uncertain. This will lower the number of channels available on DVB-T. On 2 July 2015, Kanal D Romania left the terrestrial platform. The only broadcast that remained on terrestrial except TVR is Antena 3, but it is unknown whether it will stay on DVB-T, will shift to DVB-T2 or completely leave terrestrial platform. This will lead to only 3 channels in DVB-T2, and with many TV sets that are only DVB-T compatible ( most of sold models being equipped with digital cable tuner) to an unattractive terrestrial platform, and more and more people will subscribe to a cable provider, or a DTH operator in areas where there is no cable TV available.\n\nThe DVB-T transmitters were shut down since 1 September 2016, so only the DVB-T2 network remains on air.\nAs of 1 October 2016, 85% of the population and 78% of the Romanian territory (as stated by the broadcaster<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocom.ro/poze/dvb-t2/Tranzitie+DVB-T2_Septembrie_2016.pdf|title=RADIOCOM - Internet broadband, broadcasting radio-TV, VPN, telefonie, videoconferinta, linii inchiriate|website=www.radiocom.ro|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034936/http://www.radiocom.ro/poze/dvb-t2/Tranzitie%20DVB-T2_Septembrie_2016.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>) are covered by DVB-T2 signal.

Before settling for DVB-T2, Ukraine was testing both DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T/MPEG-4 options, and some experimental transmitters operating in those standards are still live.

The effective code rates are 32,208/64,800 (1/2), 38,688/64,800 (3/5), 43,040/64,800 (2/3), 48,408/64,800 (3/4), 51,648/64,800 (4/5), 53,840/64,800 (5/6)\n*** ''Outer encoding'': a [[BCH code]], capable to correct 10 or 12 errors per FECFRAME, is used to compute parity data for the information data field. The BCH generator polynomial is of the 160th, 168th, or 192nd grade\n*** ''Inner encoding'': a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code is cascaded to the BCH\n** Bit interleaving\n*** Parity bits block interleaving\n*** Twist column interleaving\n** Bit demultiplexing to cell words[[File:Dvbt2 256qam rotated.png|thumb|right|Constellation map of the rotated 256-QAM modulation (tilt angle is 3.57 degrees)]]\n** ''Gray mapping of cell words to constellations'': either QPSK (4-QAM), 16-QAM, 64-QAM, or 256-QAM maps are used\n** ''Constellation rotation and cyclic quadrature (Q) delay'': optionally, the constellations may be tilted counterclockwise by an amount of up to 30 degrees. Furthermore, the quadrature (imaginary) part of the cells is cyclically shifted by one cell\n** Cell interleaving\n** Time interleaving\n* ''Frame building'': the transmitted stream is organized in super frames, which are composed by T2 frames and FEF (Future Extension Frame) parts\n** ''Cell mapping'': cells are mapped to OFDM symbols. A T2 frame is composed by a P1 symbol, one or more P2 symbols, regular data symbols, and a Frame Closing symbol (for certain configuration parameters). The P1 symbol is used for synchronization purposes, the P2 symbols convey L1 parameter configuration signaling, whereas the data symbols carry PLP data (there are three types: common PLPs, type 1 PLPs, and type 2 PLPs), auxiliary streams, and dummy symbols used as space filler\n** ''Frequency interleaving'': random interleaving is done on every OFDM symbol (except P1)\n* OFDM generation\n** ''Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) processing'': Alamouti pre-processing is optionally applied to pairs of OFDM symbol cells. Given <math>a_i</math> the input cells, <math>e^{(1)}_i</math> and <math>e^{(2)}_i</math> transmitter group 1 and 2 cells, the mapping is done as <math>e^{(1)}_i = a_i</math> and <math>e^{(1)}_{i+1} = a_{i+1}</math> for group 1, and as <math>e^{(2)}_i = -a^*_{i+1}</math> and <math>e^{(2)}_{i+1} = a^*_{i}</math> for group 2\n** ''Pilot insertion and dummy tone reservation'': three classes of pilot tones are added. They are either continual (fixed position), scattered (cyclically moving position), or edge (boundary positions). There are 8 different configuration for scattered pilots (PP1 ... PP8). Moreover, a number of dummy carriers are not modulated and reserved to reduce the dynamic range of the DVB-T2 output signal (it helps to combat nonlinear phenomena in power amplifiers during broadcast).\n** ''Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)'': classic IDFT is used to switch from the frequency domain into the time domain, after having adjusted carrier position relevant to the central transmit frequency. 1k (1024) to 32k (32768) carriers are available. There is also an ''extended'' mode, which allows to fill more data in the available bandwidth, using more active carriers and reducing the number of guard band (null) carriers.\n** Peak-to-Average-Power-Ratio (PAPR) reduction, also called [[crest factor#Crest factor reduction|crest factor reduction]]\n** ''Guard interval insertion'': a cyclic prefix is inserted before the IDFT symbol, to recover from transmit channel echoes (multipath). Lengths from 1/128 to 1/4 of the IDFT length are allowed.\n** ''P1 symbol insertion'': the P1 symbol is a particularly crafted 1k OFDM symbol, always inserted at the head of a T2 frame. It conveys few bits of information (spread, scrambled and DBPSK modulated), as it is mainly dedicated to fast synchronization (both in time and in frequency) at the receiver side. It is prepended and postpended by frequency shifted repetitions of itself, to ease receiver lock even if the nominal center frequency of the T2 signal is up to 500&nbsp;kHz off.\n** ''Digital-to-Analog Conversion (DAC)'': the T2 samples are converted into an analog BB complex (I&Q) signal at a sample rate that depends on the channelization bandwidth. For instance, in 8&nbsp;MHz wide channels, the complex sample time is 7/64 \u03bcs.\n\n==Market adoption==\nWhen the digital terrestrial HDTV service [[Freeview HD]] was launched in December 2009, it was the first DVB-T2 service intended for the general public. As of November 2010, DVB-T2 broadcasts were available in a couple of European countries.\n\nThe earliest introductions of T2 have usually been tied with a launch of high-definition television. There are however some countries where HDTV is broadcast using the old DVB-T standard with no immediate plans to switch those broadcasts to DVB-T2. Among countries using DVB-T for nationwide broadcasts of HDTV are [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Spain]], and [[Taiwan]]. These are usually using MPEG4. [[Australia]] started broadcasting HD content over DVB-T with MPEG2, although in 2015 some Australian broadcasters switched to MPEG4.\n\nCountries where DVB-T2 is in use include:\n* [[Afghanistan]]: Four multiplexes, fully launched April 2015<ref name=\"oqaab.af\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oqaab.af/first-digital-terrestrial-television-network-dvb-t2-starts-broadcasting/|title=100,000 likes \u2013 Oqaab reaches over 1 Mio TV Households|date=31 March 2015|publisher=|access-date=28 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323182055/http://www.oqaab.af/first-digital-terrestrial-television-network-dvb-t2-starts-broadcasting/|archive-date=23 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Albania]]: One multiplex full launch in July 2011. {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[Argentina]]: Launch in February 2014 (Antina - UHF operating DVB-T in Buenos Aires area).  {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[Armenia]]: Launch in May 2015.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n* [[Austria]]: three multiplexes (D, E, F), full launch in April 2013, 22 transmissions sites    {{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* [[Belarus]]: two multiplexes (2nd and 3rd), 89 transmission sites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zala.by/by/node/8075|title=\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0443\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u043e 2-\u043c \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435 {{!}} ZALA|website=zala.by|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zala.by/information-about-radius-3nd-multiplex|title=\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u043e \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0443\u0441\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0447\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 3-\u043c \u043c\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0438\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435 {{!}} ZALA|website=zala.by|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zala.by/karta-okhvata|title=\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 \u043e\u0445\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0442\u0435\u0440\u0440\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u0435\u0449\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0430 DVB-T2 {{!}} ZALA|website=zala.by|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref>\n* [[Belgium]]: Expected to begin in March 2013.<ref>[http://www.norkring.be/downloads/20120503_DVB-T2_ENG.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2018|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n* [[Croatia]]: Two multiplexes launched in late 2012 for pay TV platform EVO TV.

This replaced DVB-T, the previously selected standard for digital TV, which was chosen after technical evaluation of several digital TV standards. The two standards coexisted until 2015 when DVB-T was turned off. \n\nDigital TV has been deployed gradually across the country, starting with the four main cities, Bogot\u00e1, Medell\u00edn, Cali and Barranquilla followed by smaller cities such as Armenia, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, C\u00facuta, Manizales, Pereira and Santa Marta. By 2014, most main cities had digital TV. Due to the country's topography as well as there being no sharing of masts between the public and private broadcasters, the coverage in rural areas is patchy. There has been talk of using DVB-S2 (satelite) to ensure 100% coverage: as of January 2020 this hasn't happened.\n\nThe first two transmissions were by the two private TV channels [[RCN TV]] and [[Caracol TV]]. [[RTVC]] (the national government TV broadcaster) started to broadcast using the standard in 2013.\n\nThe digital system is known in Colombia as TDT which means Televisi\u00f3n Digital Terrestrial (Digital Terrestrial Television).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tdtcolombia.info/#anteriores|title=Televisi\u00f3n Digital Terrestre (TDT) en Colombia|language=es|website=TDTColombia.info|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518160111/http://tdtcolombia.info/#anteriores|archive-date=2014-05-18|access-date=2014-06-15 |url-status=usurped}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdtparatodos.tv |title=TDT: Televisi\u00f3n Digital para Todos &#124; TDT Colombia |language=es |publisher=Tdtparatodos.tv |date= |accessdate=2018-08-10}}</ref>\n\n===Croatia===\nOn 13 October 2011, the Croatian Post and Electronic Communications Agency granted license for MUX C and MUX E, both in DVB-T2 standard.\n\nAlso in October 2011, [[Oda\u0161ilja\u010di i veze|OiV - Transmitters & Communications]] started testing on UHF channel 53 from Sljeme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skendi.com|title=Skendy portal - Digitalna televizija -DVB-T-DVB-T2-MUX A-MUX B-MUX D|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTwo DVB-T2 multiplexes launched in late 2012 by pay TV platform EVO TV.\n\nIn addition to that in September 2019 DVB-T2 was launched for free-to-air television, using the HEVC/H.265 codec and 720p or 1080p resolution.

All television broadcasters were offered to transform their analog broadcasts into the new digital form, some were interested to follow suit and started testing their new digital broadcasts and some are still uninterested back then.\n\nDuring the [[DVB-T]] testing period, Indonesian government (via its Ministry of Information & Communication Technology [ICT]) wanted to switch to DVB-T2 technology which provides better signal efficiency, capacity and corrections compared to DVB-T. The TV broadcasters still testing their DVB-T broadcasts agreed to join the DVB-T2 conversion program offered by the government since they saw the significant benefits by switching to DVB-T2 (such as higher data rate for HD content and better carrier-to-noise ratio management), even though it would introduce additional cost for those who have bought DVB-T equipment. The official switch to DVB-T2 from DVB-T was started February 2012, based on ICT Minister decree (about 5 years from DVB-T introduction and adopting/nurturing period in Indonesia).<ref>[[DVB-T#cite note-14|Standar Penyiaran Televisi Digital]] {{in lang|id}}</ref>\n\nThe Indonesian Ministry of Information & Communication Technology expects the final DVB-T2 digital television regulation to be finished in 2020 and the analog switch off transition will begin in the same year.<ref>DVB-T2 Seminar by Ministry of Information & Communication Technology at Hotel Borobudur, Jakarta on 26 June 2012</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\nStarted testing DVB-T in mid 2006, but outlined plans to switch to DVB-T2 in 2011, after which tests of both were run concurrently.

Roll-out began in late 2016 in the Borneo states of Malaysia and has mostly concluded by mid-2017. Plans to shut off analog by mid-2018, but after the opposing party won in the 14th general election, the shutdown was postponed to mid-2019.\n\nSouth and central Peninsular Malaysia has switched to fully digital TV on 30 September 2019.

The package consists of 10 channels on the UHF ch35.\n\n===Romania===\nAlthough Romania started DVB-T Broadcasting in 2005 with the [[MPEG-2]] standard for SD broadcast and MPEG 4 for HD, it was only experimental. In June 2011 Romania shifted to MPEG4 both for SD and HD. In 2012, the Romanian authorities decided that DVB-T2 will be the standard used for terrestrial broadcasts, as it allows a larger number of programs to be broadcast on the same multiplex. Romania's switchover plans were initially delayed due to economical and feasibility-related reasons. One of the reasons was that most Romanian consumers already extensively used either cable or satellite services, which developed very quickly and became very popular after 1990. In fact, a technological boom started around 2003, driven by a solid economical development in the field of telecommunications, made several private operators create large networks of fiber optics and cable covering all of Romania, which are now used for providing both TV, telephony, and high quality broadband internet. As the prices for complete packages (TV, internet, telephony) are low and the quality quite good (e.g. about 20 EUR for 500Mbit/s internet, ~120 SD and HD digital cable TV channels and telephony, with an added 2-4 EUR for mobile telephony), the interest for over-the-air TV quickly became very low. There are rumors that commercial broadcasters that traditionally transmitted over-the-air using analogue channels (like [[MediaPro]], [[Antena GROUP]], [[Prima TV]]) will give up terrestrial broadcasting and will be available only on pay-TV services, like cable, satellite and IPTV. It is also rumored that the DVB-T standard (with MPEG-4 encoding) will continue until 2018.\n\nOn 17 June 2015 analogue terrestrial television was switched off, with the exception of the main public TV program (TVR1) which will continue to be broadcast strictly in the VHF band until the end of 2016.\n\nFree-to-air DVB-T2 broadcasts on MUX1 (provided by the state-owned Radiocom) are available since June 2015 in Timisoara (UHF channel 21), Cluj-Napoca (UHF channel 26), Iasi (UHF channel 25), and Bucharest (UHF channel 30).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocom.ro/business/servicii/Broadcasting/Broadcasting-TV/#|title=RADIOCOM - Internet broadband, broadcasting radio-TV, VPN, telefonie, videoconferinta, linii inchiriate|website=www.radiocom.ro}}</ref> The coverage will be extendend so that at the end of 2016, over 90% of the territory will be covered.

TVR announced that TVR News and TVR 3 will be closed, and the fate of TVR HD, is uncertain. This will lower the number of channels available on DVB-T. On 2 July 2015, Kanal D Romania left the terrestrial platform. The only broadcast that remained on terrestrial except TVR is Antena 3, but it is unknown whether it will stay on DVB-T, will shift to DVB-T2 or completely leave terrestrial platform. This will lead to only 3 channels in DVB-T2, and with many TV sets that are only DVB-T compatible ( most of sold models being equipped with digital cable tuner) to an unattractive terrestrial platform, and more and more people will subscribe to a cable provider, or a DTH operator in areas where there is no cable TV available.\n\nThe DVB-T transmitters were shut down since 1 September 2016, so only the DVB-T2 network remains on air.\nAs of 1 October 2016, 85% of the population and 78% of the Romanian territory (as stated by the broadcaster<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiocom.ro/poze/dvb-t2/Tranzitie+DVB-T2_Septembrie_2016.pdf|title=RADIOCOM - Internet broadband, broadcasting radio-TV, VPN, telefonie, videoconferinta, linii inchiriate|website=www.radiocom.ro|access-date=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305034936/http://www.radiocom.ro/poze/dvb-t2/Tranzitie%20DVB-T2_Septembrie_2016.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>) are covered by DVB-T2 signal.

Before settling for DVB-T2, Ukraine was testing both DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T/MPEG-4 options, and some experimental transmitters operating in those standards are still live.

As of 2011 October 10, 150 of the 167 transmitter sites have officially gone live. The biggest problem of Ukraine's DVB-T2 rollout for now is the acute shortage of inexpensive DVB-T2 set-top-boxes.\n\nThe four multiplexes carry in total 28 nationwide channels (same for all transmitter sites, distributed via satellite) and 4 local channels.

Amongst his decorations was the [[Victoria Cross]], the highest award for gallantry to British or [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] troops. He was also the first of seven British officers to be awarded the DSO four times in the First World War.\n\n==Early life==\nFrederick William Lumsden was born into a military family in [[Faizabad]], India on 14 December 1872.

As Muslim separatism increased, the opposition from Punjabi Hindus and Sikhs increased substantially. Communal violence on the eve of Indian independence led to the dismissal of the coalition government, although the succeeding League ministry was unable to form a majority. Along with the province of Bengal, Punjab was partitioned on religious lines \u2013 the Muslim-majority West becoming part of the new Muslim state of Pakistan, and the Hindu and Sikh East remaining in India. Partition was accompanied by massive violence on both sides, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Ishtiaq|title=The Punjab bloodied, partitioned and cleansed : unravelling the 1947 tragedy through secret British reports and first-person accounts|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi|isbn=978-0199064700}}</ref> West Punjab was virtually cleansed of its Hindu and Sikh populations, who were forced to leave for India, while East Punjab and Delhi were virtually cleansed of their Muslim population.\n\nBy the 1960s, Indian Punjab underwent reorganisation as demands for a linguistic Punjabi state increased (in line with the policy of [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|linguistic states]] that had been applied in the rest of India). The Hindi-speaking areas were formed into the states of [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Haryana]] respectively, leaving a Punjabi speaking majority in the state of Punjab. In the 1980s, Sikh separatism combined with popular anger against the [[Indian Army]]'s counter-insurgency operations (especially [[Operation Bluestar]]) led to violence and disorder in Indian Punjab, which only subsided in the 1990s. Political power in Indian Punjab is contested between the secular Congress Party and the Sikh religious party Akali Dal and its allies, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. Indian Punjab remains one of the most prosperous of India's states and is considered the \"breadbasket of India.\"\n\nSubsequent to partition, West Punjabis made up a majority of the Pakistani population, and the Punjab province constituted 40% of Pakistan's total land mass. Today Punjabis continue to be the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, accounting for half of the country's population. They reside predominantly in the province of Punjab, neighboring [[Azad Kashmir]] and in [[Islamabad Capital Territory]]. Punjabis are also found in large communities in the largest city of Pakistan, [[Karachi]], located in the [[Sindh]] province.\n\nPunjabis in India can be found in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and the [[Union Territory]] of [[Chandigarh]].

The Punjabis found in Pakistan belong to groups known as biradaris. In addition, Punjabi society is divided into two divisions, the zamindar groups or qoums, traditionally associated with farming and the moeens, who are traditionally artisans. Some zamindars are further divided into groups such as the [[Punjabi Rajput|Rajputs]], [[Muslim Jats|Jats]], [[Punjabi Shaikh|Shaikhs]] or Muslim [[Khatri]]s, [[Gujjar]]s, [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awans]], [[Arain]]s and [[Syed]]s. People from neighbouring regions, such as [[Kashmiri Muslims|Kashmiris]], [[Punjabi Pathan|Pashtuns]] and [[Punjabi Baloch|Baluch]], also form size-able portion of the Punjabi population. A large number of punjabis descend from the groups historically associated with skilled professions and crafts such as [[Sunar]], [[Lohar]], [[Kumhar]], [[Tarkhan]], [[Julaha]], [[Mochi]], [[Hajjam]], [[Chhimba Darzi]], [[Muslim Teli|Teli]], Lalari, [[Qassab]], [[Mallaah]], [[Dhobi]], [[Mirasi]] etc.<ref>''Muslim Peoples: A World Ethnographic Survey'' Richard V.

A variety of related sub-groups exist in Pakistan and are often considered by many Pakistani Punjabis to be simply regional Punjabis including the [[Seraiki people|Seraikis]] (who overlap and are often considered transitional with the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]]).\n\nThe recent definition of Punjabi people, in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]], is not based on [[Race (classification of humans)|racial classification]], [[Common descent|common ancestry]] or [[endogamy]], but based on geographical and cultural basis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Punjabis in India===\nThe Punjabi-speaking people make 2.74% of India's population as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=SCHEDULED LANGUAGES IN DESCENDING ORDER OF SPEAKERS' STRENGTH - 2011 |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-4.pdf |website=censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> The total number of Indian Punjabis is unknown due to the fact that ethnicity is not recorded in the [[Census of India]].

Most of the [[East Punjab]]'s Muslims (in today's states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi and Chandigarh) left for West Punjab in 1947. However, a small community still exists today, mainly in [[Qadian]], and [[Malerkotla]], the only Muslim princely state among the seven that formed the erstwhile [[Patiala]] and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU).

Linguistic data cannot accurately predict ethnicity: for example, Punjabis make up a large portion of Delhi's population but many descendants of the [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Hindu]] refugees who came to Delhi following the [[partition of India]] now speak Hindi as their first language.

In Canada (specifically [[Vancouver]] and [[Toronto]]) and the United States, (specifically California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]). In the 1970s, a large wave of emigration of Punjabis (predominately from Pakistan) began to the Middle East, in places such as the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Kuwait]]. There are also large communities in East Africa including the countries of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]].

This opportunity was used by the [[British East India Company]] to launch the [[First Anglo-Sikh War|Anglo-Sikh Wars]]. The country was finally annexed and dissolved at the end of the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1849 into separate [[princely states]] and the British [[Punjab (British India)|province of Punjab]].

However, the growth of Muslim nationalism led to the [[All India Muslim League]] becoming the dominant party in the 1946 elections. As Muslim separatism increased, the opposition from Punjabi Hindus and Sikhs increased substantially. Communal violence on the eve of Indian independence led to the dismissal of the coalition government, although the succeeding League ministry was unable to form a majority. Along with the province of Bengal, Punjab was partitioned on religious lines \u2013 the Muslim-majority West becoming part of the new Muslim state of Pakistan, and the Hindu and Sikh East remaining in India. Partition was accompanied by massive violence on both sides, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Ishtiaq|title=The Punjab bloodied, partitioned and cleansed : unravelling the 1947 tragedy through secret British reports and first-person accounts|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Karachi|isbn=978-0199064700}}</ref> West Punjab was virtually cleansed of its Hindu and Sikh populations, who were forced to leave for India, while East Punjab and Delhi were virtually cleansed of their Muslim population.\n\nBy the 1960s, Indian Punjab underwent reorganisation as demands for a linguistic Punjabi state increased (in line with the policy of [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|linguistic states]] that had been applied in the rest of India). The Hindi-speaking areas were formed into the states of [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Haryana]] respectively, leaving a Punjabi speaking majority in the state of Punjab. In the 1980s, Sikh separatism combined with popular anger against the [[Indian Army]]'s counter-insurgency operations (especially [[Operation Bluestar]]) led to violence and disorder in Indian Punjab, which only subsided in the 1990s. Political power in Indian Punjab is contested between the secular Congress Party and the Sikh religious party Akali Dal and its allies, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. Indian Punjab remains one of the most prosperous of India's states and is considered the \"breadbasket of India.\"\n\nSubsequent to partition, West Punjabis made up a majority of the Pakistani population, and the Punjab province constituted 40% of Pakistan's total land mass. Today Punjabis continue to be the largest ethnic group in Pakistan, accounting for half of the country's population. They reside predominantly in the province of Punjab, neighboring [[Azad Kashmir]] and in [[Islamabad Capital Territory]]. Punjabis are also found in large communities in the largest city of Pakistan, [[Karachi]], located in the [[Sindh]] province.\n\nPunjabis in India can be found in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]] and the [[Union Territory]] of [[Chandigarh]].

The Punjabis found in Pakistan belong to groups known as biradaris. In addition, Punjabi society is divided into two divisions, the zamindar groups or qoums, traditionally associated with farming and the moeens, who are traditionally artisans. Some zamindars are further divided into groups such as the [[Punjabi Rajput|Rajputs]], [[Muslim Jats|Jats]], [[Punjabi Shaikh|Shaikhs]] or Muslim [[Khatri]]s, [[Gujjar]]s, [[Awan (Pakistan)|Awans]], [[Arain]]s and [[Syed]]s. People from neighbouring regions, such as [[Kashmiri Muslims|Kashmiris]], [[Punjabi Pathan|Pashtuns]] and [[Punjabi Baloch|Baluch]], also form size-able portion of the Punjabi population. A large number of punjabis descend from the groups historically associated with skilled professions and crafts such as [[Sunar]], [[Lohar]], [[Kumhar]], [[Tarkhan]], [[Julaha]], [[Mochi]], [[Hajjam]], [[Chhimba Darzi]], [[Muslim Teli|Teli]], Lalari, [[Qassab]], [[Mallaah]], [[Dhobi]], [[Mirasi]] etc.<ref>''Muslim Peoples: A World Ethnographic Survey'' Richard V.

A variety of related sub-groups exist in Pakistan and are often considered by many Pakistani Punjabis to be simply regional Punjabis including the [[Seraiki people|Seraikis]] (who overlap and are often considered transitional with the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]]).\n\nThe recent definition of Punjabi people, in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]], is not based on [[Race (classification of humans)|racial classification]], [[Common descent|common ancestry]] or [[endogamy]], but based on geographical and cultural basis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Punjabis in India===\nThe Punjabi-speaking people make 2.74% of India's population as of 2011.<ref>{{cite web |title=SCHEDULED LANGUAGES IN DESCENDING ORDER OF SPEAKERS' STRENGTH - 2011 |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011Census/Language-2011/Statement-4.pdf |website=censusindia.gov.in |accessdate=2 April 2020}}</ref> The total number of Indian Punjabis is unknown due to the fact that ethnicity is not recorded in the [[Census of India]].

They are basically divided into outdoor and [[Indoor games and sports|indoor sports]]. Special emphasis is put to develop both the mental and physical capacity while playing sports. That is why recently sports like [[Speed reading]], [[Mental abacus]], historical and IQ tests are arranged as well. Indoor sports are specially famous during the long summer season in Punjab. Also indoor sports are played by children in homes and in schools. [[Gilli-danda]] is vary famous indigenous sports among children along with [[Parcheesi]]. [[Pittu Garam]] is also famous among children. [[Hopscotch|Stapu]] is famous among young girls of Punjab. Also many new games are included with the passage of time. The most notable are [[Carrom]], [[Ludo (board game)]], [[Scrabble]], [[Chess]], [[Draughts]], [[Go (game)|Go]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]. The [[Tabletop game]]s games include [[billiards]] and [[snooker]]. [[Backgammon]] locally known as Dimaagi Baazi( Mental game) is famous in some regions as well.\n\nThe outdoor sports include [[Pehlwani|Kusti]] (a wrestling sport), [[Kabaddi]], Rasa Kashi ([[Tug Of War]]), Patang (Kite Flying) and Naiza Baazi or Tent pegging (a cavalry sport).[[Gatka]], is also taken as a form of sports. Punjab being part of the Indian subcontinent, the sport of [[cricket]] is very popular. New forms of sports are also being introduced and adopted in particular by the large overseas Punjabis, such as [[Ice hockey]], [[Soccer]], [[Boxing]], [[Mixed martial arts]], [[Rugby union]] as part of the globalisation of sports.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of Punjabis|List of Punjabi authors|List of Punjabi-language poets|List of Punjabi singers}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dialects of the Punjab]]\n* [[Punjabi press]]\n* [[Punjabi cuisine]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|40em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* Mohini Gupta, Encyclopaedia of Punjabi Culture & History \u2013 Vol. 1 (Window on Punjab) [Hardcover], {{ISBN|978-81-202-0507-9}}\n* Iqbal Singh Dhillion, Folk Dances of Punjab {{ISBN|978-81-7116-220-8}}\n* Punjabi Culture: Punjabi Language, Bhangra, Punjabi People, Karva Chauth, Kila Raipur Sports Festival, Lohri, Punjabi Dhabha, {{ISBN|978-1-157-61392-3}}\n* Kamla C.

It is also the format widely used worldwide (including North America) for [[Electronic news-gathering|Electronic News Gathering]] for transmission of video and audio from a mobile newsgathering vehicle to a central receive point.\nIt is also used in the US by [[Amateur television]] operators.\n\n==Basics==\nRather than carrying one data carrier on a single [[radio frequency]] (RF) channel, [[COFDM]] works by splitting the digital data stream into a large number of slower digital streams, each of which digitally modulates a set of closely spaced adjacent sub-carrier frequencies. In the case of DVB-T, there are two choices for the number of carriers known as 2K-mode or 8K-mode. These are actually 1,705 or 6,817 sub-carriers that are approximately 4&nbsp;kHz or 1&nbsp;kHz apart.\n\nDVB-T offers three different modulation schemes ([[QPSK]], [[16QAM]], [[64QAM]]).\n\nDVB-T has been adopted or proposed for digital television broadcasting by many countries ([[DVB-T#Countries and territories using DVB-T or DVB-T2|see map]]), using mainly VHF 7&nbsp;MHz and UHF 8&nbsp;MHz channels whereas Taiwan, Colombia, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago use 6&nbsp;MHz channels. Examples include the UK's [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].\n\nThe DVB-T Standard is published as EN 300 744, ''Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for digital terrestrial television''. This is available from the [[ETSI]] website, as is ETSI TS 101 154, ''Specification for the use of Video and Audio Coding in Broadcasting Applications based on the MPEG-2 Transport Stream'', which gives details of the DVB use of source coding methods for [[MPEG-2]] and, more recently, [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] as well as audio encoding systems. Many countries that have adopted DVB-T have published standards for their implementation. These include the [[D-book]] in the UK, the Italian DGTVi,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dgtvi.it | title = DGTVi - Per la Televisione Digitale Terrestre | access-date=2008-07-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419092227/http://www.dgtvi.it/stat/DGTVi/Page1.html | archive-date=2008-04-19 | df=ymd-all | url-status=usurped | language=it}}</ref> the ETSI E-Book and the Nordic countries and Ireland NorDig.\n\nDVB-T has been further developed into newer standards such as [[DVB-H]] (Handheld), which was a commercial failure and is no longer in operation, and [[DVB-T2]], which was initially finalised in August 2011.\n\nDVB-T as a digital transmission delivers data in a series of discrete blocks at the symbol rate. DVB-T is a [[COFDM]] transmission technique which includes the use of a Guard Interval. It allows the receiver to cope with strong multipath situations. Within a geographical area, DVB-T also allows [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) operation, where two or more transmitters carrying the same data operate on the same frequency. In such cases the signals from each transmitter in the SFN needs to be accurately time-aligned, which is done by sync information in the stream and timing at each transmitter referenced to [[GPS]].\n\nThe length of the Guard Interval can be chosen. It is a trade-off between data rate and [[single-frequency network|SFN]] capability. The longer the guard interval the larger is the potential SFN area without creating [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI).\nIt is possible to operate SFNs which do not fulfill the guard interval condition if the self-interference is properly planned and monitored.\n\n==Technical description of a DVB-T transmitter==\n[[Image:dvbt tx scheme.svg|thumb|600px|Scheme of a DVB-T transmission system]]\n\nWith reference to the figure, a short description of the signal processing blocks follows.\n\n*[[Source coding]] and MPEG-2 [[multiplexing]] (MUX): Compressed video, compressed audio, and data streams are multiplexed into [[MPEG program stream]]s (MPEG-PS's). One or more MPEG-PS's are joined together into an [[MPEG transport stream]] (MPEG-TS); this is the basic digital stream which is being transmitted and received by TV sets or home [[Set top box|Set Top Boxes]] (STB). Allowed [[bitrate]]s for the transported data depend on a number of coding and modulation parameters: it can range from about 5 to about 32 [[Mbit/s]] (see the bottom figure for a complete listing).\n*Splitter: Two different MPEG-TSs can be transmitted at the same time, using a technique called ''Hierarchical Transmission''. It may be used to transmit, for example a standard definition [[SDTV]] signal and a high definition [[HDTV]] signal on the same [[carrier signal|carrier]]. Generally, the SDTV signal is more robust than the HDTV one. At the receiver, depending on the quality of the received signal, the STB may be able to decode the HDTV stream or, if signal strength lacks, it can switch to the SDTV one (in this way, all receivers that are in proximity of the transmission site can lock the HDTV signal, whereas all the other ones, even the farthest, may still be able to receive and decode an SDTV signal).\n*MUX adaptation and energy dispersal: The MPEG-TS is identified as a sequence of [[Packet (information technology)|data packets]], of fixed length (188 bytes). With a technique called [[Scrambler (randomizer)|energy dispersal]], the byte sequence is [[correlation|decorrelated]].\n*External encoder: A first level of error correction is applied to the transmitted data, using a non-binary [[block code]], a [[Reed-Solomon]] RS (204, 188) code, allowing the correction of up to a maximum of 8 wrong bytes for each 188-byte packet.\n*External [[interleaver]]: [[Convolutional interleaving]] is used to rearrange the transmitted data sequence, in such a way that it becomes more rugged to long sequences of errors.\n*Internal encoder: A second level of error correction is given by a punctured [[convolutional code]], which is often denoted in STBs menus as FEC ([[Forward error correction]]). There are five valid coding rates: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, and 7/8.\n*Internal interleaver: Data sequence is rearranged again, aiming to reduce the influence of burst errors. This time, a block interleaving technique is adopted, with a pseudo-random assignment scheme (this is really done by two separate interleaving processes, one operating on bits and another one operating on groups of bits).\n*Mapper: The digital bit sequence is mapped into a base band modulated sequence of complex symbols. There are three valid [[modulation]] schemes: [[QPSK]], 16-[[QAM]], 64-QAM.\n*Frame adaptation: the complex symbols are grouped in blocks of constant length (1512, 3024, or 6048 symbols per block). A [[Frame synchronization|frame]] is generated, 68 blocks long, and a ''superframe'' is built by 4 frames.\n*Pilot and TPS signals: In order to simplify the reception of the signal being transmitted on the terrestrial [[radio channel]], additional signals are inserted in each block. Pilot signals are used during the synchronization and equalization phase, while TPS signals (Transmission Parameters Signalling) send the parameters of the transmitted signal and to unequivocally identify the transmission cell. The receiver must be able to synchronize, equalize, and decode the signal to gain access to the information held by the TPS pilots. Thus, the receiver must know this information beforehand, and the TPS data is only used in special cases, such as changes in the parameters, resynchronizations, etc.\n[[Image:dvbt spectrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Spectrum of a DVB-T signal in 8k mode (note the flat-top characteristics)]]\n*OFDM Modulation: The sequence of blocks is modulated according to the [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] technique, using 1705 or 6817 carriers (2k or 8k mode, respectively). Increasing the number of carriers does not modify the payload bit rate, which remains constant.\n*Guard interval insertion: to decrease receiver complexity, every OFDM block is extended, copying in front of it its own end ([[cyclic prefix]]). The width of such guard interval can be 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, or 1/4 that of the original block length. Cyclic prefix is required to operate single frequency networks, where there may exist an ineliminable interference coming from several sites transmitting the same program on the same [[carrier frequency]].\n*DAC and front-end: The digital signal is transformed into an analogue signal, with a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC), and then modulated to radio frequency ([[Very high frequency|VHF]], [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) by the [[RF front end]]. The occupied bandwidth is designed to accommodate each single DVB-T signal into 5, 6, 7, or 8 [[Megahertz|MHz]] wide channels. The base band sample rate provided at the DAC input depends on the channel bandwidth: it is <math>f_s = \\frac{8}{7} B</math>  ''samples/s'', where <math>B</math> is the channel bandwidth expressed in Hz.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em;\"\n|+ Available bit rates (Mbit/s) for a DVB-T system in 8&nbsp;MHz channels\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Modulation\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Coding rate\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Guard interval]]\n|-\n|''1/4''||''1/8''||''1/16''||''1/32''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[Quadrature phase-shift keying|QPSK]]\n|''1/2''||4.976||5.529||5.855||6.032\n|-\n|''2/3''||6.635||7.373||7.806||8.043\n|-\n|''3/4''||7.465||8.294||8.782||9.048\n|-\n|''5/6''||8.294||9.216||9.758||10.053\n|-\n|''7/8''||8.709||9.676||10.246||10.556\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | 16-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|''1/2''||9.953||11.059||11.709||12.064\n|-\n|''2/3''||13.271||14.745||15.612||16.086\n|-\n|''3/4''||14.929||16.588||17.564||18.096\n|-\n|''5/6''||16.588||18.431||19.516||20.107\n|-\n|''7/8''||17.418||19.353||20.491||21.112\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | 64-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|''1/2''||14.929||16.588||17.564||18.096\n|-\n|''2/3''||19.906||22.118||23.419||24.128\n|-\n|''3/4''||22.394||24.882||26.346||27.144\n|-\n|''5/6''||24.882||27.647||29.273||30.160\n|-\n|''7/8''||26.126||29.029||30.737||31.668\n|}\n\n==Technical description of the receiver==\nThe receiving STB adopts techniques which are dual to those ones used in the transmission.\n\n* Front-end and ADC: the analogue RF signal is converted to base-band and transformed into a digital signal, using an [[analogue-to-digital converter]] (ADC).\n* Time and frequency synchronization: the digital base band signal is searched to identify the beginning of frames and blocks. Any problems with the frequency of the components of the signal are corrected, too. The property that the guard interval at the end of the symbol is placed also at the beginning is exploited to find the beginning of a new [[OFDM symbol]]. On the other hand, continual pilots (whose value and position is determined in the standard and thus known by the receiver) determine the frequency offset suffered by the signal. This frequency offset might have been caused by [[Doppler effect]], inaccuracies in either the transmitter or receiver clock, and so on. Generally, synchronization is done in two steps, either before or after the FFT, in such way to resolve both coarse and fine frequency/timing errors. Pre-FFT steps involve the use of sliding correlation on the received time signal, whereas Post-FFT steps use correlation between the frequency signal and the pilot carriers sequence.\n* Guard interval disposal: the cyclic prefix is removed.\n* OFDM demodulation: this is achieved with an FFT.\n* Frequency [[equalization (communications)|equalization]]: the pilot signals are used to estimate the Channel Transfer Function (CTF) every three [[subcarrier]]s. The CTF is derived in the remaining subcarriers via interpolation. The CTF is then used to equalize the received data in each subcarrier, generally using a Zero-Forcing method (multiplication by CTF inverse). The CTF is also used to weigh the reliability of the demapped data when they are provided to the Viterbi decoder. \n* Demapping: since there are Gray-encoded QAM constellations, demapping is done in a \"soft\" way using nonlinear laws that demap each bit in the received symbol to a more or less reliable fuzzy value between -1 and +1.\n* Internal deinterleaving\n* Internal decoding: uses the [[Viterbi algorithm]], with a traceback length larger than that generally used for the basic 1/2 rate code, due to the presence of punctured (\"erased\") bits.\n* External deinterleaving\n* External decoding\n* MUX adaptation\n* MPEG-2 demultiplexing and source decoding\n\n==Countries and territories using DVB-T or DVB-T2==\n\n[[Image:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|600px|center|Digital terrestrial television systems worldwide.

It is also the format widely used worldwide (including North America) for [[Electronic news-gathering|Electronic News Gathering]] for transmission of video and audio from a mobile newsgathering vehicle to a central receive point.\nIt is also used in the US by [[Amateur television]] operators.\n\n==Basics==\nRather than carrying one data carrier on a single [[radio frequency]] (RF) channel, [[COFDM]] works by splitting the digital data stream into a large number of slower digital streams, each of which digitally modulates a set of closely spaced adjacent sub-carrier frequencies. In the case of DVB-T, there are two choices for the number of carriers known as 2K-mode or 8K-mode. These are actually 1,705 or 6,817 sub-carriers that are approximately 4&nbsp;kHz or 1&nbsp;kHz apart.\n\nDVB-T offers three different modulation schemes ([[QPSK]], [[16QAM]], [[64QAM]]).\n\nDVB-T has been adopted or proposed for digital television broadcasting by many countries ([[DVB-T#Countries and territories using DVB-T or DVB-T2|see map]]), using mainly VHF 7&nbsp;MHz and UHF 8&nbsp;MHz channels whereas Taiwan, Colombia, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago use 6&nbsp;MHz channels. Examples include the UK's [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]].\n\nThe DVB-T Standard is published as EN 300 744, ''Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for digital terrestrial television''. This is available from the [[ETSI]] website, as is ETSI TS 101 154, ''Specification for the use of Video and Audio Coding in Broadcasting Applications based on the MPEG-2 Transport Stream'', which gives details of the DVB use of source coding methods for [[MPEG-2]] and, more recently, [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] as well as audio encoding systems. Many countries that have adopted DVB-T have published standards for their implementation. These include the [[D-book]] in the UK, the Italian DGTVi,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.dgtvi.it | title = DGTVi - Per la Televisione Digitale Terrestre | access-date=2008-07-30 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419092227/http://www.dgtvi.it/stat/DGTVi/Page1.html | archive-date=2008-04-19 | df=ymd-all | url-status=usurped | language=it}}</ref> the ETSI E-Book and the Nordic countries and Ireland NorDig.\n\nDVB-T has been further developed into newer standards such as [[DVB-H]] (Handheld), which was a commercial failure and is no longer in operation, and [[DVB-T2]], which was initially finalised in August 2011.\n\nDVB-T as a digital transmission delivers data in a series of discrete blocks at the symbol rate. DVB-T is a [[COFDM]] transmission technique which includes the use of a Guard Interval. It allows the receiver to cope with strong multipath situations. Within a geographical area, DVB-T also allows [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) operation, where two or more transmitters carrying the same data operate on the same frequency. In such cases the signals from each transmitter in the SFN needs to be accurately time-aligned, which is done by sync information in the stream and timing at each transmitter referenced to [[GPS]].\n\nThe length of the Guard Interval can be chosen. It is a trade-off between data rate and [[single-frequency network|SFN]] capability. The longer the guard interval the larger is the potential SFN area without creating [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI).\nIt is possible to operate SFNs which do not fulfill the guard interval condition if the self-interference is properly planned and monitored.\n\n==Technical description of a DVB-T transmitter==\n[[Image:dvbt tx scheme.svg|thumb|600px|Scheme of a DVB-T transmission system]]\n\nWith reference to the figure, a short description of the signal processing blocks follows.\n\n*[[Source coding]] and MPEG-2 [[multiplexing]] (MUX): Compressed video, compressed audio, and data streams are multiplexed into [[MPEG program stream]]s (MPEG-PS's). One or more MPEG-PS's are joined together into an [[MPEG transport stream]] (MPEG-TS); this is the basic digital stream which is being transmitted and received by TV sets or home [[Set top box|Set Top Boxes]] (STB). Allowed [[bitrate]]s for the transported data depend on a number of coding and modulation parameters: it can range from about 5 to about 32 [[Mbit/s]] (see the bottom figure for a complete listing).\n*Splitter: Two different MPEG-TSs can be transmitted at the same time, using a technique called ''Hierarchical Transmission''. It may be used to transmit, for example a standard definition [[SDTV]] signal and a high definition [[HDTV]] signal on the same [[carrier signal|carrier]]. Generally, the SDTV signal is more robust than the HDTV one. At the receiver, depending on the quality of the received signal, the STB may be able to decode the HDTV stream or, if signal strength lacks, it can switch to the SDTV one (in this way, all receivers that are in proximity of the transmission site can lock the HDTV signal, whereas all the other ones, even the farthest, may still be able to receive and decode an SDTV signal).\n*MUX adaptation and energy dispersal: The MPEG-TS is identified as a sequence of [[Packet (information technology)|data packets]], of fixed length (188 bytes). With a technique called [[Scrambler (randomizer)|energy dispersal]], the byte sequence is [[correlation|decorrelated]].\n*External encoder: A first level of error correction is applied to the transmitted data, using a non-binary [[block code]], a [[Reed-Solomon]] RS (204, 188) code, allowing the correction of up to a maximum of 8 wrong bytes for each 188-byte packet.\n*External [[interleaver]]: [[Convolutional interleaving]] is used to rearrange the transmitted data sequence, in such a way that it becomes more rugged to long sequences of errors.\n*Internal encoder: A second level of error correction is given by a punctured [[convolutional code]], which is often denoted in STBs menus as FEC ([[Forward error correction]]). There are five valid coding rates: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, and 7/8.\n*Internal interleaver: Data sequence is rearranged again, aiming to reduce the influence of burst errors. This time, a block interleaving technique is adopted, with a pseudo-random assignment scheme (this is really done by two separate interleaving processes, one operating on bits and another one operating on groups of bits).\n*Mapper: The digital bit sequence is mapped into a base band modulated sequence of complex symbols. There are three valid [[modulation]] schemes: [[QPSK]], 16-[[QAM]], 64-QAM.\n*Frame adaptation: the complex symbols are grouped in blocks of constant length (1512, 3024, or 6048 symbols per block). A [[Frame synchronization|frame]] is generated, 68 blocks long, and a ''superframe'' is built by 4 frames.\n*Pilot and TPS signals: In order to simplify the reception of the signal being transmitted on the terrestrial [[radio channel]], additional signals are inserted in each block. Pilot signals are used during the synchronization and equalization phase, while TPS signals (Transmission Parameters Signalling) send the parameters of the transmitted signal and to unequivocally identify the transmission cell. The receiver must be able to synchronize, equalize, and decode the signal to gain access to the information held by the TPS pilots. Thus, the receiver must know this information beforehand, and the TPS data is only used in special cases, such as changes in the parameters, resynchronizations, etc.\n[[Image:dvbt spectrum.jpg|thumb|250px|Spectrum of a DVB-T signal in 8k mode (note the flat-top characteristics)]]\n*OFDM Modulation: The sequence of blocks is modulated according to the [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] technique, using 1705 or 6817 carriers (2k or 8k mode, respectively). Increasing the number of carriers does not modify the payload bit rate, which remains constant.\n*Guard interval insertion: to decrease receiver complexity, every OFDM block is extended, copying in front of it its own end ([[cyclic prefix]]). The width of such guard interval can be 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, or 1/4 that of the original block length. Cyclic prefix is required to operate single frequency networks, where there may exist an ineliminable interference coming from several sites transmitting the same program on the same [[carrier frequency]].\n*DAC and front-end: The digital signal is transformed into an analogue signal, with a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC), and then modulated to radio frequency ([[Very high frequency|VHF]], [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) by the [[RF front end]]. The occupied bandwidth is designed to accommodate each single DVB-T signal into 5, 6, 7, or 8 [[Megahertz|MHz]] wide channels. The base band sample rate provided at the DAC input depends on the channel bandwidth: it is <math>f_s = \\frac{8}{7} B</math>  ''samples/s'', where <math>B</math> is the channel bandwidth expressed in Hz.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 40em;\"\n|+ Available bit rates (Mbit/s) for a DVB-T system in 8&nbsp;MHz channels\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Modulation\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Coding rate\n! colspan=\"4\" | [[Guard interval]]\n|-\n|''1/4''||''1/8''||''1/16''||''1/32''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | [[Quadrature phase-shift keying|QPSK]]\n|''1/2''||4.976||5.529||5.855||6.032\n|-\n|''2/3''||6.635||7.373||7.806||8.043\n|-\n|''3/4''||7.465||8.294||8.782||9.048\n|-\n|''5/6''||8.294||9.216||9.758||10.053\n|-\n|''7/8''||8.709||9.676||10.246||10.556\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | 16-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|''1/2''||9.953||11.059||11.709||12.064\n|-\n|''2/3''||13.271||14.745||15.612||16.086\n|-\n|''3/4''||14.929||16.588||17.564||18.096\n|-\n|''5/6''||16.588||18.431||19.516||20.107\n|-\n|''7/8''||17.418||19.353||20.491||21.112\n|-\n! rowspan=\"5\" | 64-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]\n|''1/2''||14.929||16.588||17.564||18.096\n|-\n|''2/3''||19.906||22.118||23.419||24.128\n|-\n|''3/4''||22.394||24.882||26.346||27.144\n|-\n|''5/6''||24.882||27.647||29.273||30.160\n|-\n|''7/8''||26.126||29.029||30.737||31.668\n|}\n\n==Technical description of the receiver==\nThe receiving STB adopts techniques which are dual to those ones used in the transmission.\n\n* Front-end and ADC: the analogue RF signal is converted to base-band and transformed into a digital signal, using an [[analogue-to-digital converter]] (ADC).\n* Time and frequency synchronization: the digital base band signal is searched to identify the beginning of frames and blocks. Any problems with the frequency of the components of the signal are corrected, too. The property that the guard interval at the end of the symbol is placed also at the beginning is exploited to find the beginning of a new [[OFDM symbol]]. On the other hand, continual pilots (whose value and position is determined in the standard and thus known by the receiver) determine the frequency offset suffered by the signal. This frequency offset might have been caused by [[Doppler effect]], inaccuracies in either the transmitter or receiver clock, and so on. Generally, synchronization is done in two steps, either before or after the FFT, in such way to resolve both coarse and fine frequency/timing errors. Pre-FFT steps involve the use of sliding correlation on the received time signal, whereas Post-FFT steps use correlation between the frequency signal and the pilot carriers sequence.\n* Guard interval disposal: the cyclic prefix is removed.\n* OFDM demodulation: this is achieved with an FFT.\n* Frequency [[equalization (communications)|equalization]]: the pilot signals are used to estimate the Channel Transfer Function (CTF) every three [[subcarrier]]s. The CTF is derived in the remaining subcarriers via interpolation. The CTF is then used to equalize the received data in each subcarrier, generally using a Zero-Forcing method (multiplication by CTF inverse). The CTF is also used to weigh the reliability of the demapped data when they are provided to the Viterbi decoder. \n* Demapping: since there are Gray-encoded QAM constellations, demapping is done in a \"soft\" way using nonlinear laws that demap each bit in the received symbol to a more or less reliable fuzzy value between -1 and +1.\n* Internal deinterleaving\n* Internal decoding: uses the [[Viterbi algorithm]], with a traceback length larger than that generally used for the basic 1/2 rate code, due to the presence of punctured (\"erased\") bits.\n* External deinterleaving\n* External decoding\n* MUX adaptation\n* MPEG-2 demultiplexing and source decoding\n\n==Countries and territories using DVB-T or DVB-T2==\n\n[[Image:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|600px|center|Digital terrestrial television systems worldwide.

On October 15, 2013, he released \"[[6 AM]]\", which features [[Farruko]], was later sent to Latin radio and received heavy rotation, becoming his first number one [[Latin Rhythm Airplay|''Billboard'' Latin Rhythm Songs]] chart and peaked at number three at ''Billboard'' Latin Songs chart, the song was certified Gold in Mexico and Spain.

He has more than 35 million singles sales certified and 4 million albums sales certified worldwide as of 2019.\n\nIn 2005, Balvin released his first single \"Ella Me Cautiv\u00f3\", becoming his first song charted in the United States, which serves as the first single from his debut studio album ''Real'' that was released in 2009 and received a Gold certification. ''El Negocio'', released in 2011, was less commercially successful than ''Real'' but produced two hit singles that gave him national recognition, \"Sin Compromiso\" and \"En Lo Oscuro\", both charted in Colombia's top ten. In the beginnings of the 2012, he released a mixtape that includes some singles and new songs, only was released in the United States and Mexico.\n\nOn April 24, 2012, Balvin released \"[[Yo Te Lo Dije]]\", the first single from his upcoming album, the song was number one in Colombia for eight non-consecutive weeks and became his first charting entry on the [[Top Latin Songs|''Billboard'' Latin Songs]] chart, peaking at number 13, also, the song was a huge hit in Romania. The second single, \"[[Tranquila]]\", was a top ten hit in four countries and peaked at the top of the charts in Greece. This resulted into releasing a remix featuring Greek-Albanian singer [[Eleni Foureira]]. In 2013, he released the third single \"[[Sola (J Balvin song)|Sola]]\" that was number one in Colombia and charted in Bulgaria. On October 15, 2013, he released \"[[6 AM]]\", which features [[Farruko]], was later sent to Latin radio and received heavy rotation, becoming his first number one [[Latin Rhythm Airplay|''Billboard'' Latin Rhythm Songs]] chart and peaked at number three at ''Billboard'' Latin Songs chart, the song was certified Gold in Mexico and Spain. That October 2013, Balvin released his third studio album ''[[La Familia (album)|La Familia]]'' that peaked at number ten on the [[Latin Albums|''Billboard'' Latin Albums]] chart, topped the [[Latin Rhythm Albums|''Billboard'' Latin Rhythm Albums]] chart and recently received seven Platinum and two Gold certifications. In 2014, he released the fifth single \"La Venganza\". An expanded version of ''La Familia'', subtitled ''[[La Familia B Sides|B Sides]]'', was released on September 16, 2014, that spawned the hit single \"[[Ay Vamos]]\", that eventually topped the charts in Colombia, Dominican Republic and the ''Billboard'' Latin Rhythm Songs chart.\n\n==Albums==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details, chart positions, sales, and certifications\n!

Directed and co-written by [[Spike Lee]], the film stars [[Denzel Washington]] in the title role, as well as [[Angela Bassett]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Al Freeman Jr.]], and [[Delroy Lindo]]. Lee has a supporting role, while [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]], the Rev. [[Al Sharpton]], and future South Africa president [[Nelson Mandela]] make [[cameo appearance]]s. This is the second of four film collaborations between Washington and Lee.\n\nThe film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his [[Prison|incarceration]], his [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Islam, his ministry as a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to [[Betty Shabazz|Betty X]], his [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] and reevaluation of his views concerning [[White people|whites]], and his [[assassination]] on February 21, 1965.  Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], and his experiences with racism are dramatized in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.\n\n''Malcolm X's'' screenplay, co-credited to Lee and [[Arnold Perl]], is based largely on [[Alex Haley|Alex Haley's]] 1965 book, ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]''. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death.\n\n''Malcolm X'' was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and released on November 18, 1992. Denzel Washington won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] is born into a poor household in rural [[Nebraska]] to a Caribbean mother and African-American father. When Malcolm is a young boy, their house is burnt down and his father, an activist for black rights, is killed by a chapter of the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]]. His death is falsely registered as a suicide and the family receives no compensation. Malcolm's mother's mental state deteriorates and she is admitted to a [[mental institution]]. Malcolm and his siblings are put into protective care. Malcolm performs well in school and dreams of being a lawyer, but is discriminated against by his teachers. \n\nIn 1944, Malcolm, now a teenager, lives in [[Boston]]. He goes to a nightclub with his friend Shorty and girlfriend Laura. He catches the attention of the white Sophia, and the two begin to date. Malcolm gets a job as railroad worker and travels to [[Harlem]] with Sophia. At a bar, he meets \"West Indian\" Archie, a gangster who runs a local [[numbers game]]. The two become friends and start co-operating an illegal numbers racket. One night at a club, Malcolm bets on a series of numbers, one of which is a winner; however Archie disputes that Malcolm had selected the winning number, denying him a large sum of money. A conflict ensues between the two and Malcolm returns to Boston after an attempt on his life. Malcolm reconnects with Shorty and meets Rudy and another girl named Peg. The four delinquents decide to start performing robberies to earn some money. \n\nBy 1946, the group has accrued a large amount of money from thievery. However, they are later arrested. The two girls are sentenced to two years as first offenders in connection with the robberies, while Shorty and Malcolm are sentenced to 8-10 years in jail. While incarcerated, Malcolm meets Baines, a member of the [[Nation of Islam]], who directs him to the teachings of the group's leader [[Elijah Muhammad]]. He is initially cold towards the preachings, but later grows interested in the [[Muslim]] religion and lifestyle that is promoted by the group. Malcolm begins to resent white people for their maltreatment of his race. Malcolm is [[parole]]d from prison in 1952 after serving six years, and travels to the Nation of Islam's headquarters in [[Chicago]]. There, he meets Muhammad, who instructs Malcolm to remove his \"Little\" surname and replace it with \"X\", which is symbolic of his lost African surname that was taken from him by white people; he is rechristened as \"Malcolm X\".\n\nMalcolm returns to Harlem and begins to preach the Nation's message. Over time, his speeches gather large crowds of onlookers who protest African-American mistreatment. Malcolm proposes ideas such as African-American separation from white Americans. In 1958, Malcolm meets nurse [[Betty Shabazz|Betty Sanders]]. The two begin dating, quickly marry and become the parents of four daughters. Several years later, Malcolm is now in a high position as the spokesperson of the Nation of Islam.\n\nAfter US President [[John F. Kennedy]] is assassinated in November 1963, Malcolm comments that his assassination was the product of the white violence that has been prevalent in America since its founding: he compares the killing to \"the chickens coming home to roost.\" This statement greatly damages Malcolm's reputation and he is informed by Muhammad that he is being suspended as the Nation's figurehead for 90 days. Seeing this as a betrayal, Malcolm loses faith in the organization. In early 1964, Malcolm goes on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] where he finds that Muslims come from all cultures, including white. Malcolm publicly announces that he will no longer preach African-American separation and begins his own organization, the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]], which teaches tolerance instead of protest. He also legally changes his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. This action publicly exiles him from the Nation of Islam. He is subsequently sent several death threats by members of the Nation and his house is firebombed in early 1965. \n\nOn February 21, 1965, Malcolm prepares to speak before a crowd at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] in Harlem before he is shot several times by disciples of the Nation of Islam. One of the shooters, [[Thomas Hagan]], is shot in the leg by one of Malcolm's bodyguards and dragged into a furious crowd, who proceed to beat him. Malcolm is transported to a hospital, but he is pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThe film concludes with a series of clips showing the aftermath of Malcolm's death. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivers a eulogy to Malcolm, and [[Ossie Davis]] recites a speech at Malcolm's funeral. [[Nelson Mandela]] delivers a speech to a school, quoting an excerpt from one of Malcolm's speeches.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n\n*[[Denzel Washington]] as [[Malcolm X]] (previously Malcolm Little).

Worth had met Malcolm X, then called \"Detroit Red,\" as a teenager selling drugs in New York City. Worth was fifteen at the time, and spending time around [[jazz]] clubs in the area. As Worth remembers: \"He was selling grass.  He was sixteen or seventeen but looked older. He was very witty, a funny guy, and he had this extraordinary charisma. A great dancer and a great dresser. He was very good-looking, very, very tall. Girls always noticed him. He was quite a special guy.\"<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\nEarly on, the production had difficulties telling the entire story, in part due to unresolved questions surrounding Malcolm X's assassination.  In 1971, Worth made a well-received documentary, ''[[Malcolm X (1972 film)|Malcolm X]]'', which received an [[Academy Award]] nomination [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|in that category]]. The project remained unrealized. However, several major entertainers were attached to it at various times, including [[Richard Pryor]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and director [[Sidney Lumet]].<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1968, Worth commissioned a screenplay from novelist [[James Baldwin]], who was later joined by [[Arnold Perl]], a screenwriter who had been a victim of [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-era [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref name=NYT111592>Sheila Rule, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF173BF936A25752C1A964958260 FILM; Malcolm X: The Facts, the Fictions, the Film], ''The New York Times'', November 15, 1992; accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> However, the screenplay took longer to develop than anticipated. Perl died in 1971.<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\nBaldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the 1972 book ''One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X''. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, \"I think that I would rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure\".<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Baldwin |authorlink=James Baldwin |title=[[The Devil Finds Work]] |year=1976 |publisher=The Dial Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8037-1916-7 |page=95 }}</ref> Baldwin died in 1987.

Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus ''Malcolm X'' only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\n=== Production difficulties ===\nThe production was considered controversial long before filming began.  The crux of the controversy was Malcolm X's denunciation of whites before he undertook his [[hajj]].  He was, arguably, not well regarded among white citizens by and large; however, he had risen to become a hero in the African-American community and a symbol of blacks' struggles, particularly during the presidencies of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the three years before the movie's release, sales of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' had increased 300 percent, and four of his books saw a nine-fold increase in sales between 1986 and 1991.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>\n\nOnce Warner Bros. agreed to the project, they initially wanted [[Academy Award]]-nominated Canadian film director [[Norman Jewison]] to direct the film. Jewison, director of the seminal civil rights film ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', was able to bring Denzel Washington into the project to play Malcolm X. Jewison and Washington previously worked together in the 1984 film ''[[A Soldier's Story]]''. A protest erupted over the fact that a white director was slated to make the film.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> Spike Lee was one of the main voices of criticism; since college, he had considered a film adaption of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' to be a dream project. Lee and others felt that it was appropriate that only a black person should direct ''Malcolm X.<ref name=OnionAV>Scott Tobias, [http://www.avclub.com/review/malcolm-x-11023 Malcolm X], The Onion A/V Club, February 15, 2005, Retrieved February 19, 2014.</ref>''\n\nAfter the public outcry against Jewison, Worth came to the conclusion that \"it needed a black director at this point. It was insurmountable the other way...There's a grave responsibility here.\" Jewison left the project, though he noted he gave up the movie not because of the protest, but because he could not reconcile Malcolm's private and public lives and was unsatisfied with Charles Fuller's script. Lee confirmed Jewison's position, stating, \"If Norman actually thought he could do it, he would have really fought me. But he bowed out gracefully.\" Jewison and Denzel Washington would reunite several years later for ''[[The Hurricane (1999 film)|The Hurricane]]'', in which Washington played imprisoned boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], who spent nearly twenty years in prison for a murder he claimed he did not commit before his conviction was overturned in 1985.\n\nSpike Lee was soon named the director, and he made substantial changes to the script. \"I'm directing this movie and I rewrote the script, and I'm an artist and there's just no two ways around it: this film about Malcolm X is going to be my vision of Malcolm X. But it's not like I'm sitting atop a mountain saying, 'Screw everyone, this is the Malcolm I see.' I've done the research, I've talked to the people who were there.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>\n\n===Concerns over Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X===\nSoon after Spike Lee was announced as the director and before its release, ''Malcolm X'' received criticism by [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] and members of the United Front to Preserve the Legacy of Malcolm X, headed by poet and playwright [[Amiri Baraka]], who were worried about how Lee would portray Malcolm X.  One protest in Harlem drew over 200 people.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=NYT080991>Evelyn Nieves, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DF123FF93AA3575BC0A967958260& Malcolm X: Firestorm Over a Film Script], ''The New York Times'', August 9, 1991; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref>  Some based their opinion on dislike of Lee's previous films; others were concerned that he would focus on Malcolm X's life before he converted to Islam.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=\"NYT080991\"/><ref name=NYT052092>Lena Williams, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DB1338F933A15756C0A964958260 Spike Lee Says Money From Blacks Saved 'X'], ''The New York Times'', May 20, 1992; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref> Baraka bluntly accused Spike Lee of being a \"[[Buppie]]\", stating \"We will not let Malcolm X's life be trashed to make middle-class Negroes sleep easier\", compelling others to write the director and warn him \"not to mess up Malcolm's life.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>  Some, including Lee himself, noted the irony that many of the arguments they made against him mirrored those made against Norman Jewison.<ref name=\"NYT080991\"/>\n\nLooking back on the experience of making the film and the pressure he faced to produce an accurate film, Lee jokingly stated on the DVD's [[audio commentary]] that when the film was released, he and Denzel Washington had their passports handy in case they needed to flee the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=56742|title=Malcolm X: Special Edition|author=Nat Tunbridge|publisher=DVD Times|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Concerns over Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X===\nWashington agreed to play Malcolm X while [[Norman Jewison]] was scheduled to direct the film.  Still, Lee stated he never envisioned any actor other than Washington in the role.  Lee, who had worked with Washington on ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' (1990), cited Washington's performance as Malcolm X in an [[Off Broadway]] play as superb.  However, some purists noted that Washington was far shorter and had a far darker complexion than the real Malcolm X, who stood 6'4\" and had notably reddish hair and a lighter complexion (due to his very fair-skinned [[Grenada|Grenadian]]-born mother's partial white ancestry) and bore only a passing resemblance to him.<ref name=NYT102592>Lena Williams, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D81F30F936A15753C1A964958260 Playing With Fire], ''The New York Times'', October 25, 1992; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Budget issues===\nSpike Lee also encountered difficulty in securing a sufficient budget.  Lee told Warner Bros. and the [[Completion guarantee|bond company]] that a budget of over US$30 million was necessary; the studio disagreed and offered a lower amount.  Following advice from fellow director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], Lee got \"the movie company pregnant\": taking the movie far enough along into actual [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] to attempt to force the studio to increase the budget.<ref name=\"OnionAV\"/> The film, initially budgeted at $28 million, climbed to nearly $33 million. Lee contributed $2 million of his own $3 million salary. Completion Bond Company, which assumed financial control in January 1992, refused to approve any more expenditures; in addition, the studio and bond company instructed Lee that the film could be no longer than two hours, fifteen minutes in length.<ref name=\"NYT052092\"/> The resulting conflict caused the project to be shut down in [[Filmmaking#Post-production|post-production]].<ref name=\"OnionAV\"/>\n\nThe film was saved by the financial intervention of prominent black Americans, some of whom appear in the film: [[Bill Cosby]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Peggy Cooper Cafritz]], founder of the [[Duke Ellington]] [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts|School of the Arts]].  Their contributions were made as donations; as Lee noted: \"This is not a loan. They are not investing in the film. These are black folks with some money who came to the rescue of the movie. As a result, this film will be my version. Not the bond company's version, not Warner Brothers'. I will do the film the way it ought to be, and it will be over three hours.\"<ref name=\"NYT052092\"/>  The actions of such prominent members of the African American community giving their money helped finish the project as Lee envisioned it.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=\"OnionAV\"/>\n\n===Request for black interviewers===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I'm doing what every other person in Hollywood does: they dictate who they want to do interviews with.

The request proved controversial.  While it was common practice for celebrities to pick interviewers who were known to be sympathetic to them, it was the first time in many years in which race had been used as a qualification.  Lee clarified that he was not barring white interviewers from interviewing him, but that he felt, given the subject matter of the film, that black writers have \"more insight about Malcolm than white writers.\"<ref name=\"NYT102992\"/>\n\nThe request was turned down by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', but several others agreed including ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  The ''Los Angeles Times'' explained they did not give writer approval.  The editor of ''Premiere'' noted that the request created internal discussions that resulted in changes at the magazine: \"Had we had a history of putting a lot of black writers on stories about the movie industry we'd be in a stronger position. But we didn't. It was an interesting challenge he laid down. It caused some personnel changes. We've hired a black writer and a black editor.\"<ref name=\"NYT102992\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nMalcolm X's widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz, served as a consultant to the film.<ref name=\"NYT080991\"/>  The [[Fruit of Islam]], the defense arm of the Nation of Islam, provided security for the movie.<ref name=\"NYT102592\"/>\n\nWhen Denzel Washington took the role of Malcolm X in the play, ''When the Chickens Come Home to Roost'', which dealt with the relationship between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, he admitted he knew little about Malcolm X and had not yet read ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.  Washington prepared by reading books and articles by and about Malcolm X and went over hours of tape and film footage of speeches.  The play opened in 1981 and earned Washington a warm review by [[Frank Rich]], who was at the time the chief theater critic of ''[[The New York Times]]''. Upon being cast in the film, he interviewed people who knew Malcolm X, among them Betty Shabazz and two of his brothers. Although they had different upbringings, Washington tried to focus on what he had in common with his character: Washington was close to Malcolm X's age when he was assassinated, both men were from large families, both of their fathers were ministers, and both were raised primarily by their mothers.<ref name=\"NYT102592\"/>\n\n''Malcolm X'' is the first non-documentary, and the first American film, to be given permission to film in [[Mecca]] (or within the [[Masjid al-Haram|Haram Sharif]]). A second unit film crew was hired to film in Mecca because non-Muslims, such as Lee, are not allowed inside the city. Lee fought very hard to get filming in Mecca but Warner Bros. initially refused to put up the money for location shooting. New Jersey was considered for filming the Mecca segments. In the end, Lee got money and permission together for filming in Mecca.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spike Lee: interviews|last=Spike|first=Lee|date=2002|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|editor-last=Fuchs|editor-first=Cynthia|isbn=1578064708|location=Jackson|oclc=48163614}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Nelson Mandela, the film featured cameos by [[Christopher Plummer]] (as the prison's Catholic chaplain), [[Peter Boyle]] (as a police officer), [[William Kunstler]] (as a judge), as well as activists [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] (as street preachers).<ref name=NYT111892>Vincent Canby, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173CF93BA25752C1A964958260 Review/Film; 'Malcolm X', as Complex as Its Subject], ''The New York Times'', November 18, 1992, Retrieved May 23, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe film was made shortly after Mandela's 1990 release from prison and during the [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa]].

He is alive in children in classrooms in Harlem, in classrooms in Soweto.\"<ref name=\"NYT111592\"/> Mandela ends the film with a quote from Malcolm X himself, with Malcolm in a film clip saying the last four words.

'''''X''''', is a 1992 American [[epic film|epic]] [[biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] about the [[African-American]] activist [[Malcolm X]]. Directed and co-written by [[Spike Lee]], the film stars [[Denzel Washington]] in the title role, as well as [[Angela Bassett]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Al Freeman Jr.]], and [[Delroy Lindo]]. Lee has a supporting role, while [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]], the Rev. [[Al Sharpton]], and future South Africa president [[Nelson Mandela]] make [[cameo appearance]]s. This is the second of four film collaborations between Washington and Lee.\n\nThe film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X's life: his criminal career, his [[Prison|incarceration]], his [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to Islam, his ministry as a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to [[Betty Shabazz|Betty X]], his [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] and reevaluation of his views concerning [[White people|whites]], and his [[assassination]] on February 21, 1965.  Defining childhood incidents, including his father's death, his mother's [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], and his experiences with racism are dramatized in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.\n\n''Malcolm X's'' screenplay, co-credited to Lee and [[Arnold Perl]], is based largely on [[Alex Haley|Alex Haley's]] 1965 book, ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]''. Haley collaborated with Malcolm X on the book beginning in 1963 and completed it after Malcolm X's death.\n\n''Malcolm X'' was distributed by [[Warner Bros.]] and released on November 18, 1992. Denzel Washington won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]] and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. In 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] is born into a poor household in rural [[Nebraska]] to a Caribbean mother and African-American father. When Malcolm is a young boy, their house is burnt down and his father, an activist for black rights, is killed by a chapter of the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]]. His death is falsely registered as a suicide and the family receives no compensation. Malcolm's mother's mental state deteriorates and she is admitted to a [[mental institution]]. Malcolm and his siblings are put into protective care. Malcolm performs well in school and dreams of being a lawyer, but is discriminated against by his teachers. \n\nIn 1944, Malcolm, now a teenager, lives in [[Boston]]. He goes to a nightclub with his friend Shorty and girlfriend Laura. He catches the attention of the white Sophia, and the two begin to date. Malcolm gets a job as railroad worker and travels to [[Harlem]] with Sophia. At a bar, he meets \"West Indian\" Archie, a gangster who runs a local [[numbers game]]. The two become friends and start co-operating an illegal numbers racket. One night at a club, Malcolm bets on a series of numbers, one of which is a winner; however Archie disputes that Malcolm had selected the winning number, denying him a large sum of money. A conflict ensues between the two and Malcolm returns to Boston after an attempt on his life. Malcolm reconnects with Shorty and meets Rudy and another girl named Peg. The four delinquents decide to start performing robberies to earn some money. \n\nBy 1946, the group has accrued a large amount of money from thievery. However, they are later arrested. The two girls are sentenced to two years as first offenders in connection with the robberies, while Shorty and Malcolm are sentenced to 8-10 years in jail. While incarcerated, Malcolm meets Baines, a member of the [[Nation of Islam]], who directs him to the teachings of the group's leader [[Elijah Muhammad]]. He is initially cold towards the preachings, but later grows interested in the [[Muslim]] religion and lifestyle that is promoted by the group. Malcolm begins to resent white people for their maltreatment of his race. Malcolm is [[parole]]d from prison in 1952 after serving six years, and travels to the Nation of Islam's headquarters in [[Chicago]]. There, he meets Muhammad, who instructs Malcolm to remove his \"Little\" surname and replace it with \"X\", which is symbolic of his lost African surname that was taken from him by white people; he is rechristened as \"Malcolm X\".\n\nMalcolm returns to Harlem and begins to preach the Nation's message. Over time, his speeches gather large crowds of onlookers who protest African-American mistreatment. Malcolm proposes ideas such as African-American separation from white Americans. In 1958, Malcolm meets nurse [[Betty Shabazz|Betty Sanders]]. The two begin dating, quickly marry and become the parents of four daughters. Several years later, Malcolm is now in a high position as the spokesperson of the Nation of Islam.\n\nAfter US President [[John F. Kennedy]] is assassinated in November 1963, Malcolm comments that his assassination was the product of the white violence that has been prevalent in America since its founding: he compares the killing to \"the chickens coming home to roost.\" This statement greatly damages Malcolm's reputation and he is informed by Muhammad that he is being suspended as the Nation's figurehead for 90 days. Seeing this as a betrayal, Malcolm loses faith in the organization. In early 1964, Malcolm goes on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] where he finds that Muslims come from all cultures, including white. Malcolm publicly announces that he will no longer preach African-American separation and begins his own organization, the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]], which teaches tolerance instead of protest. He also legally changes his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. This action publicly exiles him from the Nation of Islam. He is subsequently sent several death threats by members of the Nation and his house is firebombed in early 1965. \n\nOn February 21, 1965, Malcolm prepares to speak before a crowd at the [[Audubon Ballroom]] in Harlem before he is shot several times by disciples of the Nation of Islam. One of the shooters, [[Thomas Hagan]], is shot in the leg by one of Malcolm's bodyguards and dragged into a furious crowd, who proceed to beat him. Malcolm is transported to a hospital, but he is pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nThe film concludes with a series of clips showing the aftermath of Malcolm's death. [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] delivers a eulogy to Malcolm, and [[Ossie Davis]] recites a speech at Malcolm's funeral. [[Nelson Mandela]] delivers a speech to a school, quoting an excerpt from one of Malcolm's speeches.\n\n==Cast==\n\n=== Main cast ===\n\n*[[Denzel Washington]] as [[Malcolm X]] (previously Malcolm Little).

Worth had met Malcolm X, then called \"Detroit Red,\" as a teenager selling drugs in New York City. Worth was fifteen at the time, and spending time around [[jazz]] clubs in the area. As Worth remembers: \"He was selling grass.  He was sixteen or seventeen but looked older. He was very witty, a funny guy, and he had this extraordinary charisma. A great dancer and a great dresser. He was very good-looking, very, very tall. Girls always noticed him. He was quite a special guy.\"<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\nEarly on, the production had difficulties telling the entire story, in part due to unresolved questions surrounding Malcolm X's assassination.  In 1971, Worth made a well-received documentary, ''[[Malcolm X (1972 film)|Malcolm X]]'', which received an [[Academy Award]] nomination [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|in that category]]. The project remained unrealized. However, several major entertainers were attached to it at various times, including [[Richard Pryor]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and director [[Sidney Lumet]].<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\n===Screenplay===\nIn 1968, Worth commissioned a screenplay from novelist [[James Baldwin]], who was later joined by [[Arnold Perl]], a screenwriter who had been a victim of [[Joseph McCarthy|McCarthy]]-era [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]].<ref name=NYT111592>Sheila Rule, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE4DF173BF936A25752C1A964958260 FILM; Malcolm X: The Facts, the Fictions, the Film], ''The New York Times'', November 15, 1992; accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> However, the screenplay took longer to develop than anticipated. Perl died in 1971.<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\nBaldwin developed his work on the screenplay into the 1972 book ''One Day, When I Was Lost: A Scenario Based on Alex Haley's The Autobiography of Malcolm X''. In 1976, Baldwin wrote of his experience, \"I think that I would rather be horsewhipped, or incarcerated in the forthright bedlam of Bellevue, than repeat the adventure\".<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Baldwin |authorlink=James Baldwin |title=[[The Devil Finds Work]] |year=1976 |publisher=The Dial Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8037-1916-7 |page=95 }}</ref> Baldwin died in 1987. Several authors attempted drafts, including [[David Mamet]], [[David Bradley (novelist)|David Bradley]], [[Charles Fuller]] and [[Calder Willingham]].<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/><ref name=Newsweek>David Ansen and Spike Lee, [http://www.newsweek.com/1991/08/25/the-battle-for-malcolm-x.html The Battle For Malcolm X], ''Newsweek'', Retrieved May 31, 2010.</ref> Once Spike Lee took over as director, he rewrote the Baldwin-Perl script. Due to the revisions, the Baldwin family asked the producer to take his name off the credits. Thus ''Malcolm X'' only credits Perl and Lee as the writers and Malcolm X and Alex Haley as the authors of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.<ref name=\"NYT112392\"/>\n\n=== Production difficulties ===\nThe production was considered controversial long before filming began.  The crux of the controversy was Malcolm X's denunciation of whites before he undertook his [[hajj]].  He was, arguably, not well regarded among white citizens by and large; however, he had risen to become a hero in the African-American community and a symbol of blacks' struggles, particularly during the presidencies of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]].  In the three years before the movie's release, sales of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' had increased 300 percent, and four of his books saw a nine-fold increase in sales between 1986 and 1991.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>\n\nOnce Warner Bros. agreed to the project, they initially wanted [[Academy Award]]-nominated Canadian film director [[Norman Jewison]] to direct the film. Jewison, director of the seminal civil rights film ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', was able to bring Denzel Washington into the project to play Malcolm X. Jewison and Washington previously worked together in the 1984 film ''[[A Soldier's Story]]''. A protest erupted over the fact that a white director was slated to make the film.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/> Spike Lee was one of the main voices of criticism; since college, he had considered a film adaption of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X'' to be a dream project. Lee and others felt that it was appropriate that only a black person should direct ''Malcolm X.<ref name=OnionAV>Scott Tobias, [http://www.avclub.com/review/malcolm-x-11023 Malcolm X], The Onion A/V Club, February 15, 2005, Retrieved February 19, 2014.</ref>''\n\nAfter the public outcry against Jewison, Worth came to the conclusion that \"it needed a black director at this point. It was insurmountable the other way...There's a grave responsibility here.\" Jewison left the project, though he noted he gave up the movie not because of the protest, but because he could not reconcile Malcolm's private and public lives and was unsatisfied with Charles Fuller's script. Lee confirmed Jewison's position, stating, \"If Norman actually thought he could do it, he would have really fought me. But he bowed out gracefully.\" Jewison and Denzel Washington would reunite several years later for ''[[The Hurricane (1999 film)|The Hurricane]]'', in which Washington played imprisoned boxer [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], who spent nearly twenty years in prison for a murder he claimed he did not commit before his conviction was overturned in 1985.\n\nSpike Lee was soon named the director, and he made substantial changes to the script. \"I'm directing this movie and I rewrote the script, and I'm an artist and there's just no two ways around it: this film about Malcolm X is going to be my vision of Malcolm X. But it's not like I'm sitting atop a mountain saying, 'Screw everyone, this is the Malcolm I see.' I've done the research, I've talked to the people who were there.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>\n\n===Concerns over Lee's portrayal of Malcolm X===\nSoon after Spike Lee was announced as the director and before its release, ''Malcolm X'' received criticism by [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]] and members of the United Front to Preserve the Legacy of Malcolm X, headed by poet and playwright [[Amiri Baraka]], who were worried about how Lee would portray Malcolm X.  One protest in Harlem drew over 200 people.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=NYT080991>Evelyn Nieves, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DF123FF93AA3575BC0A967958260& Malcolm X: Firestorm Over a Film Script], ''The New York Times'', August 9, 1991; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref>  Some based their opinion on dislike of Lee's previous films; others were concerned that he would focus on Malcolm X's life before he converted to Islam.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=\"NYT080991\"/><ref name=NYT052092>Lena Williams, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DB1338F933A15756C0A964958260 Spike Lee Says Money From Blacks Saved 'X'], ''The New York Times'', May 20, 1992; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref> Baraka bluntly accused Spike Lee of being a \"[[Buppie]]\", stating \"We will not let Malcolm X's life be trashed to make middle-class Negroes sleep easier\", compelling others to write the director and warn him \"not to mess up Malcolm's life.\"<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/>  Some, including Lee himself, noted the irony that many of the arguments they made against him mirrored those made against Norman Jewison.<ref name=\"NYT080991\"/>\n\nLooking back on the experience of making the film and the pressure he faced to produce an accurate film, Lee jokingly stated on the DVD's [[audio commentary]] that when the film was released, he and Denzel Washington had their passports handy in case they needed to flee the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=56742|title=Malcolm X: Special Edition|author=Nat Tunbridge|publisher=DVD Times|date=April 11, 2005|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Concerns over Washington's portrayal of Malcolm X===\nWashington agreed to play Malcolm X while [[Norman Jewison]] was scheduled to direct the film.  Still, Lee stated he never envisioned any actor other than Washington in the role.  Lee, who had worked with Washington on ''[[Mo' Better Blues]]'' (1990), cited Washington's performance as Malcolm X in an [[Off Broadway]] play as superb.  However, some purists noted that Washington was far shorter and had a far darker complexion than the real Malcolm X, who stood 6'4\" and had notably reddish hair and a lighter complexion (due to his very fair-skinned [[Grenada|Grenadian]]-born mother's partial white ancestry) and bore only a passing resemblance to him.<ref name=NYT102592>Lena Williams, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6D81F30F936A15753C1A964958260 Playing With Fire], ''The New York Times'', October 25, 1992; retrieved May 15, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Budget issues===\nSpike Lee also encountered difficulty in securing a sufficient budget.  Lee told Warner Bros. and the [[Completion guarantee|bond company]] that a budget of over US$30 million was necessary; the studio disagreed and offered a lower amount.  Following advice from fellow director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], Lee got \"the movie company pregnant\": taking the movie far enough along into actual [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] to attempt to force the studio to increase the budget.<ref name=\"OnionAV\"/> The film, initially budgeted at $28 million, climbed to nearly $33 million. Lee contributed $2 million of his own $3 million salary. Completion Bond Company, which assumed financial control in January 1992, refused to approve any more expenditures; in addition, the studio and bond company instructed Lee that the film could be no longer than two hours, fifteen minutes in length.<ref name=\"NYT052092\"/> The resulting conflict caused the project to be shut down in [[Filmmaking#Post-production|post-production]].<ref name=\"OnionAV\"/>\n\nThe film was saved by the financial intervention of prominent black Americans, some of whom appear in the film: [[Bill Cosby]], [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Peggy Cooper Cafritz]], founder of the [[Duke Ellington]] [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts|School of the Arts]].  Their contributions were made as donations; as Lee noted: \"This is not a loan. They are not investing in the film. These are black folks with some money who came to the rescue of the movie. As a result, this film will be my version. Not the bond company's version, not Warner Brothers'. I will do the film the way it ought to be, and it will be over three hours.\"<ref name=\"NYT052092\"/>  The actions of such prominent members of the African American community giving their money helped finish the project as Lee envisioned it.<ref name=\"Newsweek\"/><ref name=\"OnionAV\"/>\n\n===Request for black interviewers===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"I'm doing what every other person in Hollywood does: they dictate who they want to do interviews with.

The request proved controversial.  While it was common practice for celebrities to pick interviewers who were known to be sympathetic to them, it was the first time in many years in which race had been used as a qualification.  Lee clarified that he was not barring white interviewers from interviewing him, but that he felt, given the subject matter of the film, that black writers have \"more insight about Malcolm than white writers.\"<ref name=\"NYT102992\"/>\n\nThe request was turned down by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', but several others agreed including ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' magazine, ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.  The ''Los Angeles Times'' explained they did not give writer approval.  The editor of ''Premiere'' noted that the request created internal discussions that resulted in changes at the magazine: \"Had we had a history of putting a lot of black writers on stories about the movie industry we'd be in a stronger position. But we didn't. It was an interesting challenge he laid down. It caused some personnel changes. We've hired a black writer and a black editor.\"<ref name=\"NYT102992\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nMalcolm X's widow, Dr. Betty Shabazz, served as a consultant to the film.<ref name=\"NYT080991\"/>  The [[Fruit of Islam]], the defense arm of the Nation of Islam, provided security for the movie.<ref name=\"NYT102592\"/>\n\nWhen Denzel Washington took the role of Malcolm X in the play, ''When the Chickens Come Home to Roost'', which dealt with the relationship between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, he admitted he knew little about Malcolm X and had not yet read ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X''.  Washington prepared by reading books and articles by and about Malcolm X and went over hours of tape and film footage of speeches.  The play opened in 1981 and earned Washington a warm review by [[Frank Rich]], who was at the time the chief theater critic of ''[[The New York Times]]''. Upon being cast in the film, he interviewed people who knew Malcolm X, among them Betty Shabazz and two of his brothers. Although they had different upbringings, Washington tried to focus on what he had in common with his character: Washington was close to Malcolm X's age when he was assassinated, both men were from large families, both of their fathers were ministers, and both were raised primarily by their mothers.<ref name=\"NYT102592\"/>\n\n''Malcolm X'' is the first non-documentary, and the first American film, to be given permission to film in [[Mecca]] (or within the [[Masjid al-Haram|Haram Sharif]]). A second unit film crew was hired to film in Mecca because non-Muslims, such as Lee, are not allowed inside the city. Lee fought very hard to get filming in Mecca but Warner Bros. initially refused to put up the money for location shooting. New Jersey was considered for filming the Mecca segments. In the end, Lee got money and permission together for filming in Mecca.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spike Lee: interviews|last=Spike|first=Lee|date=2002|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|editor-last=Fuchs|editor-first=Cynthia|isbn=1578064708|location=Jackson|oclc=48163614}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Nelson Mandela, the film featured cameos by [[Christopher Plummer]] (as the prison's Catholic chaplain), [[Peter Boyle]] (as a police officer), [[William Kunstler]] (as a judge), as well as activists [[Al Sharpton]] and [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] (as street preachers).<ref name=NYT111892>Vincent Canby, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD8173CF93BA25752C1A964958260 Review/Film; 'Malcolm X', as Complex as Its Subject], ''The New York Times'', November 18, 1992, Retrieved May 23, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe film was made shortly after Mandela's 1990 release from prison and during the [[negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa]].

Since the opening of its historic site in 1992, the museum has continued to fulfill its mission through historical exhibitions, and through partnerships with other communities and museums.  It has been at the forefront of preserving, researching and educating about the internment experience during [[World War II]], as well as related issues such as Japanese American military service in World War II, redress, and broader civil rights.  The National Museum opened its 85,000 square-foot Pavilion to the public in January 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/about/history/|title=Museum History {{!}} About {{!}} Japanese American National Museum|website=www.janm.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, she was appointed by [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] to the Committee on the Arts and Humanities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-09/news/ci-48502_1_japanese-american-national-museum|title=Hirano Appointed to Presidential Panel|last=Li|first=Tommy|date=9 October 1994|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=18 May 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Strengthening U.S.-Japan relations ===\nIHirano Inouye served as President of the U.S.-Japan Council, which is headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], with offices in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Tokyo]].

She saw the importance of connecting Japanese American communities and younger Nikkei generations to the land of their ancestry as an important way to strengthen U.S.-Japan relations.  Having led U.S. delegations to Japan under the Japanese Government's Japanese American Leadership Delegation for several years, she recognized the untapped potential within the Japanese American community to actively support people-to-people connections that were the foundation of the bilateral relationship.  She saw that although many Japanese Americans had been addressing U.S.-Japan relations in their various professions, the time had come to create an organization of leaders who are dedicated to working on U.S.-Japan relations.  As such, she brought together leaders from all different fields who are either working in or committed to building that relationship. There are many Japanese Americans in very high positions in various sectors.  The Council's role is to connect them with each other, with their counterparts in Japan, and with other diverse leaders with the same mission and vision.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/people/e00027/|title=The Potential of \"Tomodachi\" to Connect People|last=Joji|first=Harano|date=October 12, 2012|website=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon.com|access-date=December 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Council has grown in size and expanded its activities to include diverse participants, and signature programs such as the Japanese American Leadership Delegation, the Asian American Leadership Delegation, the Emerging Leaders Program, and well-attended Annual Conferences that gather government, business, and civil society leaders from both countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/usjc/pages/616/attachments/original/1461096204/USJC_2015_Annual_Report_-_English_-_FINAL_(small).pdf?1461096204|title=USJC 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=January 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince 2011, the U.S.-Japan Council has administered the TOMODACHI Initiative in partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.  The initiative is a public-private partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, and enjoys the strong support of the Government of Japan and it invests in the next generation of leaders in U.S.-Japan relations. The Initiative represents a path-breaking paradigm in U.S. public diplomacy, in which government joins forces with private enterprises and organizations to achieve mutually beneficial, strategic goals. TOMODACHI provides young Japanese and Americans with opportunities to study, live, and work in each other's countries, thereby ensuring a thriving bilateral partnership into the foreseeable future.  TOMODACHI has raised over $45 million, supported over 35,000 participants in activities, with over 5,000 program alumni (as of late 2016).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usjapantomodachi.org/|title=TOMODACHI Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-profit board leadership and service ===\nHer professional and community activities included serving as the Immediate Past Chair of the Board of Directors to the Ford Foundation, where she continued as a Trustee.

Since the opening of its historic site in 1992, the museum has continued to fulfill its mission through historical exhibitions, and through partnerships with other communities and museums.  It has been at the forefront of preserving, researching and educating about the internment experience during [[World War II]], as well as related issues such as Japanese American military service in World War II, redress, and broader civil rights.

She saw the importance of connecting Japanese American communities and younger Nikkei generations to the land of their ancestry as an important way to strengthen U.S.-Japan relations.  Having led U.S. delegations to Japan under the Japanese Government's Japanese American Leadership Delegation for several years, she recognized the untapped potential within the Japanese American community to actively support people-to-people connections that were the foundation of the bilateral relationship.  She saw that although many Japanese Americans had been addressing U.S.-Japan relations in their various professions, the time had come to create an organization of leaders who are dedicated to working on U.S.-Japan relations.  As such, she brought together leaders from all different fields who are either working in or committed to building that relationship. There are many Japanese Americans in very high positions in various sectors.  The Council's role is to connect them with each other, with their counterparts in Japan, and with other diverse leaders with the same mission and vision.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/people/e00027/|title=The Potential of \"Tomodachi\" to Connect People|last=Joji|first=Harano|date=October 12, 2012|website=Nippon.com|publisher=Nippon.com|access-date=December 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Council has grown in size and expanded its activities to include diverse participants, and signature programs such as the Japanese American Leadership Delegation, the Asian American Leadership Delegation, the Emerging Leaders Program, and well-attended Annual Conferences that gather government, business, and civil society leaders from both countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/usjc/pages/616/attachments/original/1461096204/USJC_2015_Annual_Report_-_English_-_FINAL_(small).pdf?1461096204|title=USJC 2015 Annual Report|last=|first=|date=January 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince 2011, the U.S.-Japan Council has administered the TOMODACHI Initiative in partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo.

It was released in [[1981 in music|1981]] as a sampler of the label's musical ethos. The acts were not actually signed exclusively to the label at the time.\n\n==Information==\nThe album consisted of tracks by unsigned [[synthpop]] groups, including future alternative icons [[Depeche Mode]], [[Soft Cell]], [[The The]] and [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]]. The compilation saw the first ever released recording of [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>Redefining the Prologue booklet, 2006</ref>\n''Some Bizzare Album'' was [[Stevo Pearce]]\u2019s vision. He believed in the music that was included on the album as opposed to the fashion or style aspects.<ref name=Almond>Page 100, Marc Almond, Tainted Life, Sidgwick & Jackson</ref> \n''Some Bizzare Album'' was re-released on [[CD]] format in 1992 for a limited time. It was re-released again in 2008 with extra bonus tracks.\n\n===Soft Cell - \"The Girl with the Patent Leather Face\"===\nAfter meeting with [[Stevo Pearce]], [[Soft Cell]] decided to include one of their tracks on the new ''Some Bizzare Album''. They recorded ''The Girl with the Patent Leather Face'' at a studio owned by John Darling.<ref name=Almond/>\nAlmond describes the song as a \"tinny-sounding, trashy synthesizer song\" that owed much to \"[[Warm Leatherette]]\", a track by [[The Normal]].<ref name=Almond/>\n\n===Depeche Mode - \"Photographic\"===\nFormed in 1980, [[Depeche Mode]] were cautious when first approached by Pearce, they were indecisive about being included on a 'futurist' compilation album. They first decided to take their demo tape to various other record companies, only to be rejected by every one.<ref>Page 14, Steve Malins, Depeche Mode Biography</ref> After a bad first meeting with [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] of Mute Records (Miller was in a bad mood due to a problem with some [[Fad Gadget]] artwork),<ref name=Malins18>Page 18, Steve Malins, Depeche Mode Biography</ref> the door was left open for Pearce to include Depeche Mode on his ''Some Bizzare Album''.<ref name=Malins18/> During an evening at the Bridgehouse, in Canning Town, Pearce chatted with Depeche Mode about his new label and compilation album. At the time, the band had been supporting Fad Gadget. It was decided that Depeche Mode would record a track for ''Some Bizzare Album''. Pearce had then recommended that the band work with Daniel Miller at [[Mute Records]].<ref name=Malins18/> In late 1980, Depeche Mode went into an east London recording studio and recorded the track \"Photographic\". Daniel Miller wanted to put a good track on the compilation album, but not their best track. Miller acted as an informal producer on the recording of the [[Some Bizzare]] version of the \"Photographic\" track.<ref name=Malins18/> The band set up their equipment in the studio and ran through some of their tracks live in the studio. \"Photographic\" was recorded and mixed in one day.<ref name=Malins21>Page 21, Steve Malins, Depeche Mode Biography</ref>\n\nThe song was later included in the 1998 reissue of Depeche Mode's [[The Singles 81\u219285]] album as a bonus track.\n\n===Neu Electrikk - \"Lust of Berlin\"===\nLondon based [[Neu Electrikk]] comprised singer songwriter Derek Morris, guitarist and electronics Steve Parry, bass player Nicholas Chamberlain Hunt, sax/flute/treatments Steve Sherlock and Barry Deller on drums/percussion. Neu Electrikk released 2 single/EPs on the Synethesia label - \"Lust Of Berlin\"/\"Distractions\" (1979) and \"Cover Girl\"/\"Practically Isolate\"/\"Hand\"/\"Converse of Tapes\" (1980). Stevo Pearce discovered the band via an advert in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine and contacted the band via their distributor [[Rough Trade Records]]. Pearce had telephoned Steve Parry to say he wanted to manage the band, however Parry became suspicious of the hyperbole emanating from Pearce's mouth. Asking Pearce who he already managed, Pearce, to Parry's surprise, answered The The. Parry already knew The The having previously befriended Matt Johnson and Keith Laws. Having spoken to Johnson, Pearce apparently had done a similar thing to him, saying he was managing Neu Electrikk. The version of \"Lust of Berlin\" on the ''Some Bizzare Album'' is a later recording made at ARK Studios, Kingston upon Thames.<ref>{{cite book |last=Panciera |first=Mario |title=45 Revolutions, The Bible of Punk/Mod/Powerpop/New Wave/NWOBHM/Indie Singles(1976/79).Volume 1 UK/Ireland |publisher=Hurdy Gurdy Books |location=Italy |page=446| isbn= 978-88-95592-00-8}}</ref>  Neu Electrikk gigged extensively, notably with The The at the Bridgehouse in [[Canning Town]], with Stevo Pearce as DJ. Further to Neu Electrikk disbanding, [[Steve James Sherlock]] joined The The and joined [[Marc Almond]] in [[Marc and the Mambas]], Nicholas Chamberlain Hunt continues to collaborate as a musician and producer, most noticeably with singer Christine Ann Leach (Baby Fox), [[William Orbit]], co-writer of the song \"Ray of Light\", and on projects ALF and Alongside Frank. [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] has released numerous recordings as a solo artist and as [[hwyl nofio]] (an avant-garde music ensemble of which Parry is the only permanent member).\n\n===The The - \"Untitled\"===\nThe The's contribution to the ''Some Bizzare Album'' is the composition \"Untitled\". Recorded at SGS studios in south London, the recording originally had the working title \"Strawberry Sunset\". Matt Johnson had asked [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] of [[Neu Electrikk]] about potential recording studios. Parry knew Johnson having previously answered an advertisement by Johnson for musicians in the ''NME''. Parry had suggested SGS studios to [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] having previously recorded there with Neu Electrikk. Johnson, Keith Laws and Parry entered the studio; however the recording proved to be a controversial affair due to difficulties encountered with an uncooperative studio engineer, who failed to appreciate or understand the music. Such was the negative ambience throughout the recording, the recording master tape was given to Parry and remained in his possession for a time after; Keith Laws contacting Parry about the track when Stevo Pearce asked The The to contribute a track to the forthcoming ''Some Bizzare Album''.\n\n===Naked Lunch - \"La Femme\"===\n[[Naked Lunch (UK band)|Naked Lunch]] was formed in 1979. Their first live performance was at Studio 21 in London under the initial name of Sons of Perdition but decided to change it to Naked Lunch while having post gig drinks in the club. The first live performance as Naked Lunch took place in the Thomas A Becket pub in SE London supporting a punk band. Initially having used live analog sequencers, it was difficult to change settings between songs and they accepted that the sequences had to be recorded onto tape. Although a live drummer was used, the only cymbals permitted were those of the hi-hat; any cymbal-like sounds were deemed to be done by a synthesizer with adjustments of white noise with a volume and sustain control.\n\nNaked Lunch reformed in 2012 and released a new single \"Alone\", in August 2013. The original line-up has been joined by Jet Noir on vocals and synths. Other members of the band are Tony Mayo (vocals), Paul Davies (guitar), Mark Irwin (drums and percussion) and Cliff Chapmen (synths).\n\n===Illustration - \"Tidal Flow\"===\nIllustration were described as playing futurist and early electronic music. Formed in 1979 by classmates Tony Harrison and [[Julia Adamson]], the group were together for approximately 3 years, rehearsing in the cellar of a clothes shop called 'Off The Rails' at the Little Underbank in Stockport, where the band was based.  The group was composed of Tony on Vocals, Julia on Keyboards, Paul Lancaster on bass, Tim Johnson on guitar, and George Terry, now known as [[Morgan King]], on drums.  With manager Graham Cooper, the group made various demos for record companies and agreed to release one of these songs, ''Tidal Flow'', taken from a demo engineered and produced by Phil Ault, on the Some Bizzare Album.  Though Illustration toured to promote the album alongside the other bands, they broke up in 1981 shortly before they were to release their first single ''Danceable''. ''Danceable'' would eventually be released in 2008 by Julia's [[Invisiblegirl Records]].\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=SomeBizarre/>\n}}\n\n==Track listing<ref name=SomeBizarre>{{cite web| work=Allmusic.com | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1392570|pure_url=yes}} | title =Some Bizzare Album | publisher = Allmusic.com | accessdate = 2010-05-25}}</ref> ==\n\n===Fish side===\n#Illustration - \"Tidal Flow\"\n#[[Depeche Mode]] - \"Photographic\"\n#[[The The]] - \"Untitled\"\n#[[B-Movie (band)|B-Movie]] - \"Moles\"\n#Jell - \"I Dare Say it Will Hurt a Little\"\n#Blah Blah Blah - \"Central Park\"\n\n===Eye Lamp side===\n#[[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]] - \"Sad Day\"\n#[[Soft Cell]] - \"The Girl with the Patent Leather Face\"\n#[[Neu Electrikk]] - \"Lust of Berlin\"\n#[[Naked Lunch (UK band)|Naked Lunch]] - \"La Femme\"\n#The Fast Set - \"King of the Rumbling Spires\"\n#The Loved One - \"Observations\"\n\nThe 1981 cassette edition actively positioned the 'Eye Lamp' side of the album as side 1, with the 'Fish' side as side 2, whereas the 1992 CD edition plays the 'Fish' side followed by the 'Eye Lamp' side.\n\n===2008 CD reissue bonus tracks===\n#[[The Normal]] - \"Warm Leatherette\"\n#[[Fad Gadget]] - \"Back to Nature\"\n#The Residents - \"The Act of Being Polite\"\n\n==Personnel==\n* [[Stevo Pearce]] \u2013 Compiler\n* Steve Bush - Designer\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.invisiblegirl.co.uk/archive/1979.html Page about Illustration and the track \"Tidal Flow\"]\n\n[[Category:Record label compilation albums]]\n[[Category:1981 compilation albums]]\n[[Category:New wave compilation albums]]\n[[Category:Alternative rock compilation albums]]\n[[Category:Some Bizzare Records compilation albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox album\n| name       = Some Bizzare Album\n| type       = compilation\n| artist     = various artists\n| cover      = Some_bizzare.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1981\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Synthpop]], [[New wave music|new wave]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Some Bizzare]]\n| producer   =\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = If You Can't Please Yourself, You Can't Please Your Soul\n| next_year  = 1985\n}}\n'''''Some Bizzare Album''''' was the first album by [[Some Bizzare Records]]. It was released in [[1981 in music|1981]] as a sampler of the label's musical ethos. The acts were not actually signed exclusively to the label at the time.\n\n==Information==\nThe album consisted of tracks by unsigned [[synthpop]] groups, including future alternative icons [[Depeche Mode]], [[Soft Cell]], [[The The]] and [[Blancmange (band)|Blancmange]]. The compilation saw the first ever released recording of [[Depeche Mode]].<ref>Redefining the Prologue booklet, 2006</ref>\n''Some Bizzare Album'' was [[Stevo Pearce]]\u2019s vision. He believed in the music that was included on the album as opposed to the fashion or style aspects.<ref name=Almond>Page 100, Marc Almond, Tainted Life, Sidgwick & Jackson</ref> \n''Some Bizzare Album'' was re-released on [[CD]] format in 1992 for a limited time. It was re-released again in 2008 with extra bonus tracks.\n\n===Soft Cell - \"The Girl with the Patent Leather Face\"===\nAfter meeting with [[Stevo Pearce]], [[Soft Cell]] decided to include one of their tracks on the new ''Some Bizzare Album''. They recorded ''The Girl with the Patent Leather Face'' at a studio owned by John Darling.<ref name=Almond/>\nAlmond describes the song as a \"tinny-sounding, trashy synthesizer song\" that owed much to \"[[Warm Leatherette]]\", a track by [[The Normal]].<ref name=Almond/>\n\n===Depeche Mode - \"Photographic\"===\nFormed in 1980, [[Depeche Mode]] were cautious when first approached by Pearce, they were indecisive about being included on a 'futurist' compilation album. They first decided to take their demo tape to various other record companies, only to be rejected by every one.<ref>Page 14, Steve Malins, Depeche Mode Biography</ref> After a bad first meeting with [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] of Mute Records (Miller was in a bad mood due to a problem with some [[Fad Gadget]] artwork),<ref name=Malins18>Page 18, Steve Malins, Depeche Mode Biography</ref> the door was left open for Pearce to include Depeche Mode on his ''Some Bizzare Album''.<ref name=Malins18/> During an evening at the Bridgehouse, in Canning Town, Pearce chatted with Depeche Mode about his new label and compilation album. At the time, the band had been supporting Fad Gadget. It was decided that Depeche Mode would record a track for ''Some Bizzare Album''. Pearce had then recommended that the band work with Daniel Miller at [[Mute Records]].<ref name=Malins18/> In late 1980, Depeche Mode went into an east London recording studio and recorded the track \"Photographic\". Daniel Miller wanted to put a good track on the compilation album, but not their best track. Miller acted as an informal producer on the recording of the [[Some Bizzare]] version of the \"Photographic\" track.<ref name=Malins18/> The band set up their equipment in the studio and ran through some of their tracks live in the studio. \"Photographic\" was recorded and mixed in one day.<ref name=Malins21>Page 21, Steve Malins, Depeche Mode Biography</ref>\n\nThe song was later included in the 1998 reissue of Depeche Mode's [[The Singles 81\u219285]] album as a bonus track.\n\n===Neu Electrikk - \"Lust of Berlin\"===\nLondon based [[Neu Electrikk]] comprised singer songwriter Derek Morris, guitarist and electronics Steve Parry, bass player Nicholas Chamberlain Hunt, sax/flute/treatments Steve Sherlock and Barry Deller on drums/percussion. Neu Electrikk released 2 single/EPs on the Synethesia label - \"Lust Of Berlin\"/\"Distractions\" (1979) and \"Cover Girl\"/\"Practically Isolate\"/\"Hand\"/\"Converse of Tapes\" (1980). Stevo Pearce discovered the band via an advert in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine and contacted the band via their distributor [[Rough Trade Records]]. Pearce had telephoned Steve Parry to say he wanted to manage the band, however Parry became suspicious of the hyperbole emanating from Pearce's mouth. Asking Pearce who he already managed, Pearce, to Parry's surprise, answered The The. Parry already knew The The having previously befriended Matt Johnson and Keith Laws. Having spoken to Johnson, Pearce apparently had done a similar thing to him, saying he was managing Neu Electrikk. The version of \"Lust of Berlin\" on the ''Some Bizzare Album'' is a later recording made at ARK Studios, Kingston upon Thames.<ref>{{cite book |last=Panciera |first=Mario |title=45 Revolutions, The Bible of Punk/Mod/Powerpop/New Wave/NWOBHM/Indie Singles(1976/79).Volume 1 UK/Ireland |publisher=Hurdy Gurdy Books |location=Italy |page=446| isbn= 978-88-95592-00-8}}</ref>  Neu Electrikk gigged extensively, notably with The The at the Bridgehouse in [[Canning Town]], with Stevo Pearce as DJ. Further to Neu Electrikk disbanding, [[Steve James Sherlock]] joined The The and joined [[Marc Almond]] in [[Marc and the Mambas]], Nicholas Chamberlain Hunt continues to collaborate as a musician and producer, most noticeably with singer Christine Ann Leach (Baby Fox), [[William Orbit]], co-writer of the song \"Ray of Light\", and on projects ALF and Alongside Frank. [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] has released numerous recordings as a solo artist and as [[hwyl nofio]] (an avant-garde music ensemble of which Parry is the only permanent member).\n\n===The The - \"Untitled\"===\nThe The\u2019s contribution to the ''Some Bizzare Album'' is the composition \"Untitled\". Recorded at SGS studios in south London, the recording originally had the working title \"Strawberry Sunset\". Matt Johnson had asked [[Steve Parry (musician)|Steve Parry]] of [[Neu Electrikk]] about potential recording studios. Parry knew Johnson having previously answered an advertisement by Johnson for musicians in the ''NME''. Parry had suggested SGS studios to [[Matt Johnson (singer)|Matt Johnson]] having previously recorded there with Neu Electrikk. Johnson, Keith Laws and Parry entered the studio; however the recording proved to be a controversial affair due to difficulties encountered with an uncooperative studio engineer, who failed to appreciate or understand the music.
