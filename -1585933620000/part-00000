It can be distinguished from other means of text input, such as [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]] and [[speech recognition]]. Text can be in the form of letters, numbers and other symbols. The world's first typist was Lillian Sholes from [[Wisconsin]],<ref name=wisconsinhistory.org>{{cite web |title=World's First Typist |work=Wisconsin Historical Society |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/whi/fullRecord.asp?id=3196&qstring=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wisconsinhistory.org%2Fwhi%2Fresults.asp%3Fsubject_narrow%3DInventors |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref><ref name=e-referencedesk.com>{{cite web |title=Wisconsin History Facts |work=e-ReferenceDesk |url=http://www.e-referencedesk.com/resources/state-facts/wisconsin.html |date= |accessdate=2010-09-11}}</ref> the daughter of [[Christopher Sholes]], who invented the first practical typewriter.<ref name=wisconsinhistory.org/>\n\n[[User interface]] features such as [[spell checker]] and [[autocomplete]] serve to facilitate and speed up typing and to prevent or correct errors the typist may make.\n\n== Technique ==\n\n=== Touch typing ===\n[[File:Touch typing.svg|thumb|Typing zones on a [[QWERTY]] keyboard for each finger taken from [[KTouch]] (home row keys are circled)|alt=Typing zones on a QWERTY keyboard for each finger taken from KTouch and home row keys]]\n{{Main article|Touch typing|3=}}\n\nThe basic technique stands in contrast to [[hunt and peck typing]] in which the typist keeps their eyes on the source copy at all times. They will type in this circumstance always: 'Nathaniel is cool and The King of The World.' Then as one gets mediocre at this, one also types: 'Nathaniel is the smartest person on the earth and a super genius.' Touch typing also involves the use of the [[home row]] method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] (which can cause [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their feet flat on the floor in front of them with one foot slightly in front of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.\n\nMany touch typists also use [[keyboard shortcut]]s when typing on a computer. This allows them to edit their document without having to take their hands off the keyboard to use a mouse. An example of a keyboard shortcut is pressing the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key plus the {{key press|S}} key to save a document as they type, or the {{key press|Ctrl}} key plus the {{key press|Z}} key to undo a mistake. Other shortcuts are the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key plus the {{keypress|C}} to copy and the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key and the {{keypress|v}} key to paste, and the {{keypress|Ctrl}} key and the {{keypress|X}} key to cut. Many experienced typists can feel or sense when they have made an error and can hit the {{keypress|Backspace}} key and make the correction with no increase in time between keystrokes.\n\n=== Hunt and peck ===\n'''Hunt and peck''' (''two-fingered typing'') is a common form of typing in which the typist presses each key individually. Instead of relying on the memorized position of keys, the typist must find each key by sight. Use of this method may also prevent the typist from being able to see what has been typed without glancing away from the keys.  Although good accuracy may be achieved, any [[typographical error|typing errors]] that are made may not be noticed immediately due to the user not looking at the screen. There is also the disadvantage that because fewer fingers are used, those that are used are forced to move a much greater distance.\n[[File:Civilian Conservation Corps, Third Corps Area, typing class with W.P.A. instructor - NARA - 197144.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Civilian Conservation Corps typing class, 1933]]\n\n=== Hybrid ===\nThere are many idiosyncratic typing styles in between novice-style \"hunt and peck\" and touch typing. For example, many \"hunt and peck\" typists have the keyboard layout memorized and are able to type while focusing their gaze on the screen. Some use just two fingers, while others use 3\u20136 fingers. Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.\n\nOne study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-02-ten-fingers-fast.html|title=Ten fingers not needed for fast typing, study shows|author=|date=|website=phys.org}}</ref> According to the study, \"The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.\" To quote doctoral candidate Anna Feit: \"We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average\"\n\n=== Buffering ===\nSome people combine '''touch typing''' and '''hunt and peck''' by using a '''buffering''' method. In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the '''buffer''' of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--It would be nice to provide a specific example of this type of competition.--> Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when time is of the essence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Thumbing ===\nA late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards (such as PDAs and Smartphones), is ''thumbing'' or thumb typing.  This can be accomplished using one or both thumbs. Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or have small and unergonomic layouts, it could cause thumb tendonitis or other [[repetitive strain injury]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n== Words per minute ==\n{{Contradicts other|date=April 2010|1=Words per minute}}\n{{further information|Words per minute}}\n[[Words per minute]] (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in [[recruitment]]. For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, \"brown\" counts as one word, but \"mozzarella\" counts as two.\n\nThe benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an [[Afrikaans]]-speaking operator in [[Cape Town]] can be compared with a [[French language|French]]-speaking operator in [[Paris]].\n\n=== Alphanumeric entry{{anchor|Alphanumeric entry}} ===\nIn one study of average computer users, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.<ref>Karat, C.M., Halverson, C., Horn, D. and Karat, J.

An average professional [[Copy typist|typist]] reaches 50 to 80 wpm, while some positions can require 80 to 95 wpm (usually the minimum required for dispatch positions and other typing jobs), and some advanced typists work at speeds above 120 wpm.<ref name=\"Ayres&Martin\u00e1s2005\">{{citation |year=2005 |author=Ayres, Robert U |authorlink=Robert Ayres (scientist) |author2=Martin\u00e1s, Katalin |chapter=120 wpm for very skilled typist |page=41 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&pg=PA41&dq=typists+%22120+words+per+minute%22#v=onepage&q=typists%20%22120%20words%20per%20minute%22&f=false |title=On the Reappraisal of Microeconomics: Economic Growth and Change in a Material World |place=Cheltenham, UK & Northampton, Massachusetts |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |isbn=1-84542-272-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ksxK7J95IF8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=reappraisal+microeconomics#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=22 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Citation\n |author            = Teresia R.

M. (1988). Human-computer interface design guidelines. Norwood, NJ: [[Ablex Publishing]].</ref>  From the 1920s through the 1970s, typing speed (along with shorthand speed) was an important secretarial qualification and typing contests were popular and often publicized by typewriter companies as promotional tools.\n\nA less common measure of the speed of a typist, CPM is used to identify the number of characters typed per minute. This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person's typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. The common conversion factor between WPM and CPM is 5. It is also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read. CPM has also been applied to 20th century printers, but modern faster printers more commonly use PPM (pages per minute).\n\nThe fastest typing speed ever, 216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM electric]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/history-of-typewriters |title=History of Typewriters &#124; Big Site of Amazing Facts \u00ae |publisher=Bigsiteofamazingfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owled.com/typing.html |title=World Records in Typing |publisher=Owled.com |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_4509PH04.html |title=IBM Archives: Typing posture |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deskstore.com/INFORMATION-1/en/Plan-Your-Office/Believe-it-or-not |title=Believe it or not ... |publisher=Deskstore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> using the [[QWERTY]] key layout.<ref>url=http://thekindle3books.com/qwerty-vs-dvorak-the-two-great-keyboards-the-time-were-born/</ref><ref>url=https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/75268195/miss-stella-pajunas-worlds-fast-typist-types-ibm-electric-ty.html</ref> {{As of|2005}}, writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest [[English language]] typist in the world, according to [[The Guinness Book of World Records]]. Using the [[Dvorak keyboard layout]], she had maintained 150 wpm for 50 minutes, and 170 wpm for shorter periods, with a peak speed of 212 wpm. Blackburn, who failed her [[QWERTY]] typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak layout in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career. She appeared on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on January 24, 1985, but felt that Letterman made a spectacle of her.<ref name=\"Letterman\">{{cite web|url=http://rcranger.mysite.syr.edu/dvorak/ |title=Barbara Blackburn, the World's Fastest Typist |accessdate=2008-05-08}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Don Giller|title=The Great Typing Controversy on Late Night, January 24 and 28, 1985|date=2016-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3OlsQL1rYs|accessdate=2017-07-05}}</ref> Blackburn died in April 2008.<ref name=\"Letterman\" />\n\nThe recent emergence of several competitive typing websites has allowed several fast typists on computer keyboards to emerge along with new records, though these are unverifiable for the most part.

In the past, using a typewriter, speed was measured with a stopwatch and errors were tallied by hand. With the current technology, document preparation is more about using word-processors as a composition aid, changing the meaning of error rate and how it is measured. Research performed by R. William Soukoreff and I. Scott MacKenzie, has led to a discovery of the application of a well-known algorithm. Through the use of this algorithm and accompanying analysis technique, two statistics were used, ''minimum string distance error rate'' (MSD error rate) and ''keystrokes per character'' (KSPC). The two advantages of this technique include:\n\n* Participants are allowed to enter text naturally, since they may commit errors and correct them.\n* The identification of errors and generation of error rate statistics is easy to automate.\n\n==== Deconstructing the text input process ====\nThrough analysis of keystrokes, the keystrokes of the input stream were divided into four classes: Correct (C), Incorrect Fixed (IF), Fixes (F), and Incorrect Not Fixed (INF). These key stroke classification are broken down into the following\n\n* The two classes Correct and Incorrect Not Fixed comprise all of the characters in transcribed text. \n* Fixes (F) keystrokes are easy to identify, and include keystrokes such as backspace, delete, cursor movements, and modifier keys.\n* Incorrect Fixed (IF) keystrokes are found in the input stream, but not the transcribed text, and are not editing keys.\n\nUsing these classes, the Minimum String Distance Error Rate and the Key Strokes per Character statistics can both be calculated.\n\n==== Minimum string distance error rate ====\nThe minimum string distance (MSD) is the number of \"primitives\" which is the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions to transform one string into another. The following equation was found for the MSD Error Rate\n\n''MSD Error Rate'' = <math>(INF/(C + INF)) * 100\\%</math>\n\n==== Key strokes per character (KSPC) ====\nWith the minimum string distance error, errors that are corrected do not appear in the transcribed text. The following example will show you why this is an important class of errors to consider:\n\n''Presented Text'':       the quick brown<br />\n''Input Stream'':         the quix<-ck brown<br />\n''Transcribed Text'':     the quick brown\n\nin the above example, the incorrect character ('x') was deleted with a backspace ('<-'). Since these errors do not appear in the transcribed text, the MSD error rate is 0%. This is why there is the key strokes per character (KSPC) statistic.\n\n''KSPC'' = <math>(C+INF+IF+F)/(C+INF)</math>\n\nThe three shortcomings of the KSPC statistic are listed below:\n\n* High KSPC values can be related to either many errors which were corrected, or few errors which were not corrected; however, there is no way to distinguish the two.\n* KSPC depend on the text input method, and cannot be used to meaningfully compare two different input methods, such as Qwerty-keyboard and a multi-tap input.\n* There is no obvious way to combine KSPC and MSD into an overall error rate, even though they have an inverse relationship.\n\n==== Further metrics ====\nUsing the classes described above, further metrics were defined by R. William Soukoreff and I.Scott MacKenzie:\n\n''Error correction efficiency'' refers to the ease with which the participant performed error correction.\n* ''Correction Efficiency'' = IF/F\n''Participant conscientiousness'' is the ratio of corrected errors to the total number of error, which helps distinguish perfectionists from apathetic participants.\n* ''Participant Conscientiousness'' = IF / (IF + INF)\nIf C represents the amount of useful information transferred, INF, IF, and F represent the proportion of bandwidth wasted.\n* ''Utilized Bandwidth'' = C / (C + INF + IF + F)<br />\n* ''Wasted Bandwidth'' = (INF + IF + F)/ (C + INF + IF + F)\n\n==== Total error rate ====\nThe classes described also provide an intuitive definition of total error rate:\n\n* ''Total Error Rate'' = ((INF + IF)/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Not Corrected Error Rate'' = (INF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Corrected Error Rate'' = (IF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n\nSince these three error rates are ratios, they are comparable between different devices, something that cannot be done with the KSPC statistic, which is device dependent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soukoreff.com/academic/chi03 |title=Soukoreff, R.

Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.\n\nOne study examining 30 subjects, of varying different styles and expertise, has found minimal difference in typing speed between touch typists and self-taught hybrid typists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-02-ten-fingers-fast.html|title=Ten fingers not needed for fast typing, study shows|author=|date=|website=phys.org}}</ref> According to the study, \"The number of fingers does not determine typing speed... People using self-taught typing strategies were found to be as fast as trained typists... instead of the number of fingers, there are other factors that predict typing speed... fast typists... keep their hands fixed on one position, instead of moving them over the keyboard, and more consistently use the same finger to type a certain letter.\" To quote doctoral candidate Anna Feit: \"We were surprised to observe that people who took a typing course, performed at similar average speed and accuracy, as those that taught typing to themselves and only used 6 fingers on average\"\n\n=== Buffering ===\nSome people combine '''touch typing''' and '''hunt and peck''' by using a '''buffering''' method. In the buffer method, the typist looks at the source copy, mentally stores one or several sentences, then looks at the keyboard and types out the '''buffer''' of sentences. This eliminates frequent up and down motions with the head and is used in typing competitions in which the typist is not well versed in touch typing.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<!--It would be nice to provide a specific example of this type of competition.--> Not normally used in day-to-day contact with keyboards, this buffer method is used only when time is of the essence.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Thumbing ===\nA late 20th century trend in typing, primarily used with devices with small keyboards (such as PDAs and Smartphones), is ''thumbing'' or thumb typing.  This can be accomplished using one or both thumbs. Similar to desktop keyboards and input devices, if a user overuses keys which need hard presses and/or have small and unergonomic layouts, it could cause thumb tendonitis or other [[repetitive strain injury]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n== Words per minute ==\n{{Contradicts other|date=April 2010|1=Words per minute}}\n{{further information|Words per minute}}\n[[Words per minute]] (WPM) is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in [[recruitment]]. For the purposes of WPM measurement a word is standardized to five characters or keystrokes. Therefore, \"brown\" counts as one word, but \"mozzarella\" counts as two.\n\nThe benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries. The speed of an [[Afrikaans]]-speaking operator in [[Cape Town]] can be compared with a [[French language|French]]-speaking operator in [[Paris]].\n\n=== Alphanumeric entry{{anchor|Alphanumeric entry}} ===\nIn one study of average computer users, the average rate for transcription was 33 words per minute, and 19 words per minute for composition.<ref>Karat, C.M., Halverson, C., Horn, D. and Karat, J.

This is a common measurement for typing programs, or typing tutors, as it can give a more accurate measure of a person's typing speed without having to type for a prolonged period of time. The common conversion factor between WPM and CPM is 5. It is also used occasionally for associating the speed of a reader with the amount they have read. CPM has also been applied to 20th century printers, but modern faster printers more commonly use PPM (pages per minute).\n\nThe fastest typing speed ever, 216 words per minute, was achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand from Chicago in 1946 in one minute on an [[IBM Electric typewriter|IBM electric]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigsiteofamazingfacts.com/history-of-typewriters |title=History of Typewriters &#124; Big Site of Amazing Facts \u00ae |publisher=Bigsiteofamazingfacts.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.owled.com/typing.html |title=World Records in Typing |publisher=Owled.com |date=2006-09-02 |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/modelb/modelb_4509PH04.html |title=IBM Archives: Typing posture |publisher=03.ibm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deskstore.com/INFORMATION-1/en/Plan-Your-Office/Believe-it-or-not |title=Believe it or not ... |publisher=Deskstore.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-13}}</ref> using the [[QWERTY]] key layout.<ref>url=http://thekindle3books.com/qwerty-vs-dvorak-the-two-great-keyboards-the-time-were-born/</ref><ref>url=https://www.pond5.com/stock-footage/75268195/miss-stella-pajunas-worlds-fast-typist-types-ibm-electric-ty.html</ref> {{As of|2005}}, writer Barbara Blackburn was the fastest [[English language]] typist in the world, according to [[The Guinness Book of World Records]].

Blackburn, who failed her [[QWERTY]] typing class in high school, first encountered the Dvorak layout in 1938, quickly learned to achieve very high speeds, and occasionally toured giving speed-typing demonstrations during her secretarial career.

In the past, using a typewriter, speed was measured with a stopwatch and errors were tallied by hand. With the current technology, document preparation is more about using word-processors as a composition aid, changing the meaning of error rate and how it is measured. Research performed by R. William Soukoreff and I. Scott MacKenzie, has led to a discovery of the application of a well-known algorithm. Through the use of this algorithm and accompanying analysis technique, two statistics were used, ''minimum string distance error rate'' (MSD error rate) and ''keystrokes per character'' (KSPC). The two advantages of this technique include:\n\n* Participants are allowed to enter text naturally, since they may commit errors and correct them.\n* The identification of errors and generation of error rate statistics is easy to automate.\n\n==== Deconstructing the text input process ====\nThrough analysis of keystrokes, the keystrokes of the input stream were divided into four classes: Correct (C), Incorrect Fixed (IF), Fixes (F), and Incorrect Not Fixed (INF). These key stroke classification are broken down into the following\n\n* The two classes Correct and Incorrect Not Fixed comprise all of the characters in transcribed text. \n* Fixes (F) keystrokes are easy to identify, and include keystrokes such as backspace, delete, cursor movements, and modifier keys.\n* Incorrect Fixed (IF) keystrokes are found in the input stream, but not the transcribed text, and are not editing keys.\n\nUsing these classes, the Minimum String Distance Error Rate and the Key Strokes per Character statistics can both be calculated.\n\n==== Minimum string distance error rate ====\nThe minimum string distance (MSD) is the number of \"primitives\" which is the number of insertions, deletions, or substitutions to transform one string into another. The following equation was found for the MSD Error Rate\n\n''MSD Error Rate'' = <math>(INF/(C + INF)) * 100\\%</math>\n\n==== Key strokes per character (KSPC) ====\nWith the minimum string distance error, errors that are corrected do not appear in the transcribed text. The following example will show you why this is an important class of errors to consider:\n\n''Presented Text'':       the quick brown<br />\n''Input Stream'':         the quix<-ck brown<br />\n''Transcribed Text'':     the quick brown\n\nin the above example, the incorrect character ('x') was deleted with a backspace ('<-'). Since these errors do not appear in the transcribed text, the MSD error rate is 0%. This is why there is the key strokes per character (KSPC) statistic.\n\n''KSPC'' = <math>(C+INF+IF+F)/(C+INF)</math>\n\nThe three shortcomings of the KSPC statistic are listed below:\n\n* High KSPC values can be related to either many errors which were corrected, or few errors which were not corrected; however, there is no way to distinguish the two.\n* KSPC depend on the text input method, and cannot be used to meaningfully compare two different input methods, such as Qwerty-keyboard and a multi-tap input.\n* There is no obvious way to combine KSPC and MSD into an overall error rate, even though they have an inverse relationship.\n\n==== Further metrics ====\nUsing the classes described above, further metrics were defined by R. William Soukoreff and I.Scott MacKenzie:\n\n''Error correction efficiency'' refers to the ease with which the participant performed error correction.\n* ''Correction Efficiency'' = IF/F\n''Participant conscientiousness'' is the ratio of corrected errors to the total number of error, which helps distinguish perfectionists from apathetic participants.\n* ''Participant Conscientiousness'' = IF / (IF + INF)\nIf C represents the amount of useful information transferred, INF, IF, and F represent the proportion of bandwidth wasted.\n* ''Utilized Bandwidth'' = C / (C + INF + IF + F)<br />\n* ''Wasted Bandwidth'' = (INF + IF + F)/ (C + INF + IF + F)\n\n==== Total error rate ====\nThe classes described also provide an intuitive definition of total error rate:\n\n* ''Total Error Rate'' = ((INF + IF)/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Not Corrected Error Rate'' = (INF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n* ''Corrected Error Rate'' = (IF/ (C + INF + IF)) * 100%\n\nSince these three error rates are ratios, they are comparable between different devices, something that cannot be done with the KSPC statistic, which is device dependent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soukoreff.com/academic/chi03 |title=Soukoreff, R.

The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history.<ref>{{citation |title= Guinness World Records 2008 |year= 2007 |publisher= [[Guinness World Records]] |location= London |isbn= 978-1-904994-19-0 |page= 118 |editor-first=Craig |editor-last=Glenday |url= https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldre000guin }}</ref> The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British [[Sultan]] [[Hamad bin Thuwaini of Zanzibar|Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Sultan Khalid bin Barghash]]. The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[Enthronement|accession]] to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[consul (representative)|consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a ''[[casus belli]]'' and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\n\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruiser]]s, two [[gunboat]]s, 150 [[Royal Marines|marines]] and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army (who was also the [[First Minister]] of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and [[machine gun]]s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HHS|Glasgow}} and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.\n\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to [[German East Africa]] (in the mainland part of present [[Tanzania]]). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]. The war marked the end of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar Sultanate]] as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.png|thumb|250px|The islands of Zanzibar and the [[Africa|African mainland]]]]\n\nZanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[Tanganyika]]; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]]. The main island, [[Unguja]] (or Zanzibar Island), had been under the nominal control of the [[Sultan of Oman|Sultans of Oman]] since 1698 when they expelled the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers who had claimed it in 1499.<ref name=\"hernon397\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=397}}.</ref> Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]] declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by Great Britain, and split the sultanate from that of Oman.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]], the second sultan and Khalid's father, had been forced by British ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish the slave trade in June 1873, though it was later discovered that instructions from London would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected.<ref>Christopher Lloyd, ''The Navy and the Slave Trade: The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century'', 1968, pp 264-268</ref>\n\nThe subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at [[Zanzibar Town]] where a palace complex was built on the sea front. By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached [[harem]]; and the [[Beit al-Ajaib]] or \"House of Wonders\"\u2014a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}.</ref> The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.<ref name=\"hernon402\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=402}}.</ref> All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.<ref name=\"hoyle160\">{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|p=160}}.</ref>\n\nBritain had recognised Zanzibar's [[sovereignty]] and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=131\u2013132}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> However, [[Germany]] was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=124\u2013131}}.</ref> Sultan [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifah]] had granted rights to the land of [[Kenya]] to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> Many of the [[Arab]] ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which [[Abushiri Revolt|resulted in some unrest]].<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the [[flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate]], which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.<ref name=\"hernon398\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=398}}.</ref> One such conflict in [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/>\n\nSultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General [[Lloyd Mathews]], a former [[Lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to restore order in Tanganyika.<ref name=\"Hernon147\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=147}}.</ref> The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/> Further conflicts erupted at [[Bagamoyo]], where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at [[Ketwa]], where German officials and their servants were murdered.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] ascended to the sultanate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=165}}.</ref> Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as [[First Minister]] to lead his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[Enthronement|accession]] to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[consul (representative)|consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a ''[[casus belli]]'' and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\n\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruiser]]s, two [[gunboat]]s, 150 [[Royal Marines|marines]] and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army (who was also the [[First Minister]] of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and [[machine gun]]s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HHS|Glasgow}} and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.\n\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to [[German East Africa]] (in the mainland part of present [[Tanzania]]). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]. The war marked the end of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar Sultanate]] as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.png|thumb|250px|The islands of Zanzibar and the [[Africa|African mainland]]]]\n\nZanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[Tanganyika]]; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]]. The main island, [[Unguja]] (or Zanzibar Island), had been under the nominal control of the [[Sultan of Oman|Sultans of Oman]] since 1698 when they expelled the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers who had claimed it in 1499.<ref name=\"hernon397\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=397}}.</ref> Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]] declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by Great Britain, and split the sultanate from that of Oman.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]], the second sultan and Khalid's father, had been forced by British ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish the slave trade in June 1873, though it was later discovered that instructions from London would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected.<ref>Christopher Lloyd, ''The Navy and the Slave Trade: The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century'', 1968, pp 264-268</ref>\n\nThe subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at [[Zanzibar Town]] where a palace complex was built on the sea front. By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached [[harem]]; and the [[Beit al-Ajaib]] or \"House of Wonders\"\u2014a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}.</ref> The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.<ref name=\"hernon402\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=402}}.</ref> All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.<ref name=\"hoyle160\">{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|p=160}}.</ref>\n\nBritain had recognised Zanzibar's [[sovereignty]] and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=131\u2013132}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> However, [[Germany]] was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=124\u2013131}}.</ref> Sultan [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifah]] had granted rights to the land of [[Kenya]] to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> Many of the [[Arab]] ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which [[Abushiri Revolt|resulted in some unrest]].<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the [[flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate]], which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.<ref name=\"hernon398\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=398}}.</ref> One such conflict in [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/>\n\nSultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General [[Lloyd Mathews]], a former [[Lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to restore order in Tanganyika.<ref name=\"Hernon147\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=147}}.</ref> The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/> Further conflicts erupted at [[Bagamoyo]], where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at [[Ketwa]], where German officials and their servants were murdered.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] ascended to the sultanate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=165}}.</ref> Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as [[First Minister]] to lead his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

Parthenogenesis allows the resulting all-female population to reproduce and thus evolve into a unique species capable of reproduction. This combination of [[interspecific hybrid]]ization and [[parthenogenesis]] exists as a reproductive strategy in several species of whiptail lizard within the genus ''[[Aspidoscelis]]'' to which the New Mexico whiptail belongs.\n\n== Description ==\nThe New Mexico whiptail grows from {{convert|16.5|to|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and is typically overall brown or black in color with seven pale yellow stripes from [[head]] to [[tail]]. Light colored spots often occur between the stripes. They have a white or pale blue underside, with a blue or blue-green colored throat. They are slender bodied, with a long tail that is more commonly blue-green in their infant stage, melding into the same spotted brownand yellow color as they age.\n\n== Behavior ==\nLike most other whiptail lizards, the New Mexico whiptail is [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] and [[insectivore|insectivorous]]. They are wary, energetic, and fast moving, darting for cover if approached. They are found in a wide variety of semi-arid habitats, including [[grassland]], rocky areas, shrubland, or mountainside woodlands. Reproduction occurs through [[parthenogenesis]], with up to four unfertilized [[egg (biology)|eggs]] being laid in mid summer, and hatching approximately eight weeks later.\n\nThe New Mexico whiptail lizard is a crossbreed of a western whiptail, which lives in the desert, and the little striped whiptail, which favours grasslands. The lizard is a female-only species that reproduces by producing an egg through [[parthenogenesis]]. Despite reproducing asexually, and being an all-female species, the whiptail still engages in mating behavior with other females of its own species, giving rise to the common nickname \"lesbian lizards\". A common theory is that this behavior stimulates ovulation, as those that do not \"mate\" do not lay eggs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Courtship in unisexual lizards: A model for brain evolution|journal=Scientific American|date=1987|volume=257|issue=6|pages=116\u2013121|jstor=24979584|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1287-116|bibcode=1987SciAm.257f.116C}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[New Mexico]]\n*[[Teiidae|Whiptail]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060619065241/http://www.zo.utexas.edu/research/txherps/lizards/cnemidophorus.neomexicanus.html Herps of Texas: ''Cnemidophorus neomexicanus'']\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q934175}}\n\n[[Category:Aspidoscelis]]\n[[Category:Vertebrate parthenogenesis]]\n[[Category:Reptiles described in 1852]]\n[[Category:Lizards of North America]]\n[[Category:Reptiles of the United States]]\n[[Category:Biota of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Endemic fauna of the United States]]\n[[Category:Symbols of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Herbert Lowe]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Richard G.

This combination of [[interspecific hybrid]]ization and [[parthenogenesis]] exists as a reproductive strategy in several species of whiptail lizard within the genus ''[[Aspidoscelis]]'' to which the New Mexico whiptail belongs.\n\n== Description ==\nThe New Mexico whiptail grows from {{convert|16.5|to|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and is typically overall brown or black in color with seven pale yellow stripes from [[head]] to [[tail]]. Light colored spots often occur between the stripes. They have a white or pale blue underside, with a blue or blue-green colored throat. They are slender bodied, with a long tail that is more commonly blue-green in their infant stage, melding into the same spotted brown and yellow color as they age.\n\n== Behavior ==\nLike most other whiptail lizards, the New Mexico whiptail is [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] and [[insectivore|insectivorous]]. They are wary, energetic, and fast moving, darting for cover if approached. They are found in a wide variety of semi-arid habitats, including [[grassland]], rocky areas, shrubland, or mountainside woodlands. Reproduction occurs through [[parthenogenesis]], with up to four unfertilized [[egg (biology)|eggs]] being laid in mid summer, and hatching approximately eight weeks later.\n\nThe New Mexico whiptail lizard is a crossbreed of a western whiptail, which lives in the desert, and the little striped whiptail, which favours grasslands. The lizard is a female-only species that reproduces by producing an egg through [[parthenogenesis]]. Despite reproducing asexually, and being an all-female species, the whiptail still engages in mating behavior with other females of its own species, giving rise to the common nickname \"lesbian lizards\". A common theory is that this behavior stimulates ovulation, as those that do not \"mate\" do not lay eggs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Crews|first1=David|title=Courtship in unisexual lizards: A model for brain evolution|journal=Scientific American|date=1987|volume=257|issue=6|pages=116\u2013121|jstor=24979584|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1287-116|bibcode=1987SciAm.257f.116C}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[New Mexico]]\n*[[Teiidae|Whiptail]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060619065241/http://www.zo.utexas.edu/research/txherps/lizards/cnemidophorus.neomexicanus.html Herps of Texas: ''Cnemidophorus neomexicanus'']\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q934175}}\n\n[[Category:Aspidoscelis]]\n[[Category:Vertebrate parthenogenesis]]\n[[Category:Reptiles described in 1852]]\n[[Category:Lizards of North America]]\n[[Category:Reptiles of the United States]]\n[[Category:Biota of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Endemic fauna of the United States]]\n[[Category:Symbols of New Mexico]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Charles Herbert Lowe]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Richard G.

He is best known for his work with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]) as '''Razor Ramon''' and with World Championship Wrestling ([[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]]) under his real name.\n\nBeginning with his time in the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), Hall maintained a perennially high profile as a wrestler, as he became a [[List of WWE Intercontinental Champions|four time]] [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Champion]] (a record from 1995\u20131999), a [[List of WWE United States Champions|two-time]] [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Champion]], a [[List of WCW World Television Champions|one-time]] [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW World Television Champion]], and a nine-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] ([[List of WCW World Tag Team Champions|seven times in WCW]], [[List of TNA World Tag Team Champions|once in TNA]], and [[AWA World Tag Team Championship|once in the AWA]]). In addition, Hall is a two-time [[world champion]], having won the [[WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship]]. He is also notable for being a founding member of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order (nWo)]]. On April 5, 2014, Hall was inducted  individually into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as Razor Ramon, and he will be inducted a second time (this time under his real name) in 2020 as a member of nWo, together with fellow former stablemates [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Kevin Nash]] and [[Sean Waltman]].\n\n== Early life ==\nHall was born in St. Mary's County, Maryland. He grew up as an [[army brat]] and moved once every year before he was fifteen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2016/06/24/22646003.html|title=Scott Hall once again the Bad Guy|author=Murphy, Jan|work=Slam!

They debuted as American Starship, Hall under the ring name Starship Coyote and Spivey under the ring name Starship Eagle.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/s/scott-hall.html|title=Scott Hall Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=June 18, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"earlycareer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.accelerator3359.com/Wrestling/bios/hall.html#beginning|title=Scott Hall's Early Career|work=Accelerator's Wrestling Rollercoaster|accessdate=June 18, 2008}}</ref>\n\nAt first, American Starship were booked to wrestle infrequently; so much so that the two were given ground crew jobs for the Charlotte Orioles (which Jim Crockett owned at the time).

In 1861, as a result of the [[Wheeling Convention]], Tucker County joined the rest of West Virginia in breaking away from Virginia to remain a part of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  Tucker County was initially divided into three townships: Black Fork, Hannahsville, and St. George, which became magisterial districts in 1872.  The following year, Hannahsville became Licking District, and in 1876, two new magisterial districts were formed: Clover from part of St. George, and Dry Fork from part of Black Fork.  A sixth district, Fairfax, was organized in the 1880s, followed by a seventh, Davis, formed in the 1890s from parts of Dry Fork and Fairfax Districts.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\nBetween 1889 and 1893, a dispute known as the [[Tucker County Seat War]] took place between the people in the town of Parsons and that of [[St. George, West Virginia|St. George]], over the location of the county seat. Although nobody was killed in the \"war\", the situation came to a climax when a mob of armed men from Parsons marched on St. George and took the county records by force.<ref name=\"tuckercountycommission.com\">{{Cite web | title=Tucker County History - The Tucker County Seat| work=| url=http://www.tuckercountycommission.com/index.php/our-county| date=| year=| accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"livingplaces.com\">{{Cite web | title=Living Places - Tucker County Courthouse and Jail| work=| url=http://www.livingplaces.com/WV/Tucker_County/Parsons_City/Tucker_County_Courthouse_and_Jail.html| date=| year=| accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0801.html</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1907, the [[Babcock Lumber Company]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], while operating out of [[Davis, West Virginia]], [[Clearcutting|clear cut]] the mountain ridges throughout Tucker Country. This clear cutting, with its residual slashings, converted the landscape into a \"tinderbox\". By 1910, fires burned continuously \u2014 in some areas for years on end, from spring until the first snows \u2014 leaving little other than thin mineral soil and bare rock. In 1914, with the county virtually denuded of standing trees, the ground burned continually for 6 months. As a result, top soils that once produced huge timbers on the mountainsides \u2014 including the largest tree ever harvested in West Virginia, a [[white oak]] some 13 feet in diameter just 10 feet from the ground \u2014 washed down into the narrow valleys and bottom lands, which had always been too narrow for harvesting productive crops or livestock. Uncontrollable soil erosion and flooding further degraded and depopulated the region. To this day, Tucker County and surrounding regions bear the scars of this remarkable conflagration.<ref>[[Maurice Brooks|Brooks, Maurice]] (1965), ''The Appalachians'' (Series: The Naturalist's America), Illustrated by Lois Darling and Lo Brooks, [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], pp 127-128.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|421|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|419|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.1|sqmi}} (0.5%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 31, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:US 219.svg|23px]] [[U.S. Highway 219]]\n* [[Image:WV-32.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 32]]\n* [[Image:WV-38.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 38]]\n* [[Image:WV-72.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 72]]\n* [[Image:WV-90.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 90]]\n* [[Image:WV-93.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 93]]\nWV 48\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Preston County, West Virginia|Preston County]] (north)\n* [[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant County]] (east)\n* [[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]] (south)\n* [[Barbour County, West Virginia|Barbour County]] (west)\n\n===State protected areas===\n* [[Blackwater Falls State Park]]\n* [[Canaan Valley Resort State Park]]\n* [[Fairfax Stone|Fairfax Stone State Park]]\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Big Run Bog]]\n* [[Canaan Valley]]\n* [[Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge]] [http://www.fws.gov/canaanvalley/ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service web site]\n* [[Dolly Sods Wilderness]] [http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/parsons/fefhome.htm U.S. Forest Service web site]\n* [[Fernow Experimental Forest]] [http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/parsons/fefhome.htm U.S. Department of Agriculture web site]\n* [[Fisher Spring Run Bog]]\n* [[Monongahela National Forest]] [http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/mnf/ U.S. Forest Service web site]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 1428\n|1870= 1907\n|1880= 3151\n|1890= 6459\n|1900= 13433\n|1910= 18675\n|1920= 16791\n|1930= 13374\n|1940= 13173\n|1950= 10600\n|1960= 7750\n|1970= 7447\n|1980= 8675\n|1990= 7728\n|2000= 7231\n|2010= 7141\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=6955\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/wv190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

In 1861, as a result of the [[Wheeling Convention]], Tucker County joined the rest of West Virginia in breaking away from Virginia to remain a part of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.  This proved impractical in the heavily rural state, and in 1872 the townships were converted into [[minor civil division|magisterial districts]].<ref>Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, ''West Virginia: A History'', 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240.</ref>  Tucker County was initially divided into three townships: Black Fork, Hannahsville, and St. George, which became magisterial districts in 1872.  The following year, Hannahsville became Licking District, and in 1876, two new magisterial districts were formed: Clover from part of St. George, and Dry Fork from part of Black Fork.  A sixth district, Fairfax, was organized in the 1880s, followed by a seventh, Davis, formed in the 1890s from parts of Dry Fork and Fairfax Districts.<ref>[[United States Census Bureau]], [[United States Census|U.S. Decennial Census]], Tables of Minor Civil Divisions in West Virginia, 1870\u20132010.</ref>\n\nBetween 1889 and 1893, a dispute known as the [[Tucker County Seat War]] took place between the people in the town of Parsons and that of [[St. George, West Virginia|St. George]], over the location of the county seat. Although nobody was killed in the \"war\", the situation came to a climax when a mob of armed men from Parsons marched on St. George and took the county records by force.<ref name=\"tuckercountycommission.com\">{{Cite web | title=Tucker County History - The Tucker County Seat| work=| url=http://www.tuckercountycommission.com/index.php/our-county| date=| year=| accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"livingplaces.com\">{{Cite web | title=Living Places - Tucker County Courthouse and Jail| work=| url=http://www.livingplaces.com/WV/Tucker_County/Parsons_City/Tucker_County_Courthouse_and_Jail.html| date=| year=| accessdate=April 11, 2014}}</ref><ref>http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0801.html</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1907, the [[Babcock Lumber Company]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], while operating out of [[Davis, West Virginia]], [[Clearcutting|clear cut]] the mountain ridges throughout Tucker Country. This clear cutting, with its residual slashings, converted the landscape into a \"tinderbox\". By 1910, fires burned continuously \u2014 in some areas for years on end, from spring until the first snows \u2014 leaving little other than thin mineral soil and bare rock. In 1914, with the county virtually denuded of standing trees, the ground burned continually for 6 months. As a result, top soils that once produced huge timbers on the mountainsides \u2014 including the largest tree ever harvested in West Virginia, a [[white oak]] some 13 feet in diameter just 10 feet from the ground \u2014 washed down into the narrow valleys and bottom lands, which had always been too narrow for harvesting productive crops or livestock. Uncontrollable soil erosion and flooding further degraded and depopulated the region. To this day, Tucker County and surrounding regions bear the scars of this remarkable conflagration.<ref>[[Maurice Brooks|Brooks, Maurice]] (1965), ''The Appalachians'' (Series: The Naturalist's America), Illustrated by Lois Darling and Lo Brooks, [[Boston]]: [[Houghton Mifflin Company]], pp 127-128.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|421|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|419|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.1|sqmi}} (0.5%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_54.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=July 31, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n*[[Image:US 219.svg|23px]] [[U.S. Highway 219]]\n*[[Image:WV-32.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 32]]\n*[[Image:WV-38.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 38]]\n*[[Image:WV-72.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 72]]\n*[[Image:WV-90.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 90]]\n*[[Image:WV-93.svg|20px]] [[West Virginia Route 93]]\nWV 48\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n*[[Preston County, West Virginia|Preston County]] (north)\n*[[Grant County, West Virginia|Grant County]] (east)\n*[[Randolph County, West Virginia|Randolph County]] (south)\n*[[Barbour County, West Virginia|Barbour County]] (west)\n\n===State protected areas===\n* [[Blackwater Falls State Park]]\n* [[Canaan Valley Resort State Park]]\n* [[Fairfax Stone|Fairfax Stone State Park]]\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Big Run Bog]]\n* [[Canaan Valley]]\n* [[Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge]] [http://www.fws.gov/canaanvalley/ U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service web site]\n* [[Dolly Sods Wilderness]] [http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/parsons/fefhome.htm U.S. Forest Service web site]\n* [[Fernow Experimental Forest]] [http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/parsons/fefhome.htm U.S. Department of Agriculture web site]\n* [[Fisher Spring Run Bog]]\n* [[Monongahela National Forest]] [http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/mnf/ U.S. Forest Service web site]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 1428\n|1870= 1907\n|1880= 3151\n|1890= 6459\n|1900= 13433\n|1910= 18675\n|1920= 16791\n|1930= 13374\n|1940= 13173\n|1950= 10600\n|1960= 7750\n|1970= 7447\n|1980= 8675\n|1990= 7728\n|2000= 7231\n|2010= 7141\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=6955\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=May 22, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref><br />1790\u20131960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref> 1900\u20131990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/wv190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 11, 2014}}</ref><br />1990\u20132000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

{"title_page": "Star Trek crossovers", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Star Trek'' crossovers}}\n{{Redirect|Crossovers (Star Trek)|Deep Space Nine episode|Crossover (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)}}\n\nSeveral characters within the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise, primary and secondary, often made [[fictional crossover|crossover appearances]] between one live-action series and another. This included appearances of established characters on premiere episodes of new series, a few long-term transfers from one series to another, and even crossovers between ''Trek'' films and television. A few crossover appearances, such as that of [[Spock]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' and the time-travel of the crew of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' to the era of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' were especially lauded by both fans and critics.\n\n==Appearances in series premieres==\nAfter the original series, a character from an earlier series appeared in the premiere episode of each new series. These were the appearances of [[Leonard McCoy]] in \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", the first episode of ''The Next Generation''; that of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] in \"[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]\", the first episode of ''Deep Space Nine''; [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] and [[Morn]] in \"[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]\", the premiere of ''Voyager''; [[Zefram Cochrane]] (from the original series episode \"[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]\" and the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'') in \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", the premiere of ''Enterprise''; and [[Sarek]] in \"[[The Vulcan Hello]]\", the first episode of ''Discovery''.\n\n==Long-term transitions==\nTwo long-term transitions were the transfer of [[Worf]] and [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] from permanent characters on ''The Next Generation'' to permanent characters on ''Deep Space Nine''. Worf stayed on ''The Next Generation'' until its conclusion, then transferred from the start of season 4 of ''DS9''. Chief O'Brien had appeared in fifty episodes of ''The Next Generation'', but only gained opening credits billing on ''DS9'', in which he appeared in almost every episode of all seven seasons. While not seen as often as Chief O'Brien, his wife [[Keiko O'Brien]] also transitioned as a series regular guest star from ''The Next Generation'' to ''Deep Space Nine'', bringing their daughter [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]]. Miles O'Brien reprised his ''Next Generation'' role in that series' finale \"[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]\".\n\n==Episodes and films focused on crossovers==\n\n===Television-to-television crossover===\n\nAn especially significant crossover is Spock's appearance on the two-part ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]\". Spock meets Data and they exchange opinions on the relative value of logic and emotion, and share mutual impressions of ''Next Generation''{{'}}s Captain Picard (who for Spock is a model of logical behavior, and for Data is a model of what it means to be human). Critics such as Ina Rae Hark have noted this encounter between two non-human characters summarizes their contrasting attitudes to humanity, Data embodying Spock's ideal of pure logic, while Data aspires to be more human.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek: BFI TV Classics |last=Hark |first=Ina Rae |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=MacMillan |location= |isbn=9781844572144 |page=64 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] appears in TNG Season 6, Episode 4 \"[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]\".\n\nRecycled footage from the original series episode \"[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]\" is used extensively in ''Deep Space Nine''{{'}}s time-travel episode \"[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]\". In addition to extensive archival footage of cast from the original series, actor [[Charlie Brill]] (portraying Klingon spy [[Arne Darvin]]) appears in both new and archival footage. The episode was designed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original series. Critic Matthew Kappell notes that the new episode simultaneously \"parodies and valorizes\" the original series, highlighting the discontinuities between two eras of ''Trek'' while trying simultaneously to weave them together.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek as myth: essays on symbol and archetype at the final frontier |last=Kapell |first=Matthew Wilhelm |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=9780786447244 |page=83 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Riker and Deanna Troi from ''The Next Generation'' appear in a flash-forward to the future in \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\", the final episode of ''Enterprise''.

The episode contains the added revelation that the USS ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Tuvok]] was on Sulu's ship ''Excelsior'' at the time. In bit of rather glaring discontinuity, the character of Lieutenant Dimitri Valtane, who appears in both the 1996 third season Voyager Episode and the 1991 feature film is shown to still be alive at the end of ''Undiscovered Country''. While that same character in the \"Flashback\" episode, is shown to have died prior to the feature films concluding scene in which the ''Excelsior'' crew bid farewell to the USS ''Enterprise'' crew. A scene from the film in which Valtane is visibly featured, and Tuvok is completely absent. Though the actor Tim Russ whom portrayed Tuvok, made an appearance as a Star Fleet bridge officer from the same fictional time period, serving on the [[USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701-B]] in the feature film [[''Star Trek Generations'']] (1994). Critic Lincoln Geraghty cites this as an example of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s ongoing propensity for reverential recognition of earlier versions of the series.<ref>{{cite book |title=Living with Star Trek: American culture and the Star Trek universe |last=Geraghty |first=Lincoln |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781845112653 |page=51 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Television-to-film crossover===\n\nThe film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' brought Kirk and Picard, ''Enterprise'' captains from different centuries, together to defeat a common enemy. It also marked the passing of the film franchise from the original series cast to that of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n==Characters more prominent on subsequent series==\nA few occasional recurring characters introduced in one series continued into other series, sometimes attaining more significant roles in their subsequent ''Trek'' series than in the one in which they were first introduced:\n\n* Spock's father [[Sarek]] appeared in only one episode of the original series, but became a more developed character in three movies and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and appeared in [[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|the ''Next Generation'' episode named after him]] and the first part of \"Unification\".

Introduced in ''The Next Generation'', they would appear in ''Deep Space Nine'', ''Voyager'' and ''Enterprise''. Their role in ''Deep Space Nine'' was limited to an appearance in the premiere episode to explore Benjamin Sisko's troubled past (his wife having been killed in a major confrontation with the Borg), while their role in the ''Enterprise'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\" served as a 'sequel' to ''Star Trek: First Contact'', as an archaeological expedition discovers the remains of the time-travelling Borg sphere that was destroyed in ''First Contact'' and unwittingly reactivate a pair of Borg drones. However, the Borg became a recurring threat on ''Voyager''. The only crossover character was the [[Borg (Star Trek)#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] first introduced in the ''Next Generation'' feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact''. She would then become a recurring character on ''Voyager'' appearing in the two-part episodes \"Dark Frontier\" and \"Unimatrix Zero\" and in the series finale \"Endgame\".

This included appearances of established characters on premiere episodes of new series, a few long-term transfers from one series to another, and even crossovers between ''Trek'' films and television. A few crossover appearances, such as that of [[Spock]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|The Next Generation]]'' and the time-travel of the crew of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|Deep Space Nine]]'' to the era of ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|The Original Series]]'' were especially lauded by both fans and critics.\n\n==Appearances in series premieres==\nAfter the original series, a character from an earlier series appeared in the premiere episode of each new series. These were the appearances of [[Leonard McCoy]] in \"[[Encounter at Farpoint]]\", the first episode of ''The Next Generation''; that of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] in \"[[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]\", the first episode of ''Deep Space Nine''; [[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]] and [[Morn]] in \"[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]\", the premiere of ''Voyager''; [[Zefram Cochrane]] (from the original series episode \"[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]\" and the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'') in \"[[Broken Bow (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Broken Bow]]\", the premiere of ''Enterprise''; and [[Sarek]] in \"[[The Vulcan Hello]]\", the first episode of ''Discovery''.\n\n==Long-term transitions==\nTwo long-term transitions were the transfer of [[Worf]] and [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] from permanent characters on ''The Next Generation'' to permanent characters on ''Deep Space Nine''. Worf stayed on ''The Next Generation'' until its conclusion, then transferred from the start of season 4 of ''DS9''. Chief O'Brien had appeared in fifty episodes of ''The Next Generation'', but only gained opening credits billing on ''DS9'', in which he appeared in almost every episode of all seven seasons. While not seen as often as Chief O'Brien, his wife [[Keiko O'Brien]] also transitioned as a series regular guest star from ''The Next Generation'' to ''Deep Space Nine'', bringing their daughter [[Molly O'Brien|Molly]]. Miles O'Brien reprised his ''Next Generation'' role in that series' finale \"[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]\".\n\n==Episodes and films focused on crossovers==\n\n===Television-to-television crossover===\n\nAn especially significant crossover is Spock's appearance on the two-part ''Next Generation'' episode \"[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]\". Spock meets Data and they exchange opinions on the relative value of logic and emotion, and share mutual impressions of ''Next Generation''{{'}}s Captain Picard (who for Spock is a model of logical behavior, and for Data is a model of what it means to be human). Critics such as Ina Rae Hark have noted this encounter between two non-human characters summarizes their contrasting attitudes to humanity, Data embodying Spock's ideal of pure logic, while Data aspires to be more human.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek: BFI TV Classics |last=Hark |first=Ina Rae |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=MacMillan |location= |isbn=9781844572144 |page=64 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n[[Scotty (Star Trek)|Scotty]] appears in TNG Season 6, Episode 4 \"[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]\".\n\nRecycled footage from the original series episode \"[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]\" is used extensively in ''Deep Space Nine''{{'}}s time-travel episode \"[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]\". In addition to extensive archival footage of cast from the original series, actor [[Charlie Brill]] (portraying Klingon spy [[Arne Darvin]]) appears in both new and archival footage. The episode was designed to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the original series. Critic Matthew Kappell notes that the new episode simultaneously \"parodies and valorizes\" the original series, highlighting the discontinuities between two eras of ''Trek'' while trying simultaneously to weave them together.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star Trek as myth: essays on symbol and archetype at the final frontier |last=Kapell |first=Matthew Wilhelm |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=9780786447244 |page=83 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nWilliam Riker and Deanna Troi from ''The Next Generation'' appear in a flash-forward to the future in \"[[These Are the Voyages...]]\", the final episode of ''Enterprise''. This episode was widely criticized by both cast members and fans for playing more like a ''Next Generation'' episode to the point of being an inappropriate wrap-up for the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|archivedate=2006-03-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060318130122/http://theedge.bostonherald.com/tvNews/view.bg?articleid=82256|title=Jolene Blalock interview| work=[[Boston Herald]]|accessdate=2008-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Salem, Rob|date=2005-05-09|title=Trek fatigued, producer admits.

The episode contains the added revelation that the USS ''Voyager''{{'}}s [[Tuvok]] was on Sulu's ship ''Excelsior'' at the time. In bit of rather glaring discontinuity, the character of Lieutenant Dimitri Valtane, who appears in both the 1996 third season Voyager Episode and the 1991 feature film is shown to still be alive at the end of ''Undiscovered Country''. While that same character in the \"Flashback\" episode, is shown to have died prior to the feature films concluding scene in which the ''Excelsior'' crew bid farewell to the USS ''Enterprise'' crew. A scene from the film in which Valtane is visibly featured, and Tuvok is completely absent. Though the actor Tim Russ whom portrayed Tuvok, made an appearance as a Star Fleet bridge officer from the same fictional time period, serving on the [[USS ''Enterprise'' NCC-1701-B]] in the feature film [[''Star Trek Generations'']] (1994). Critic Lincoln Geraghty cites this as an example of ''Star Trek''{{'}}s ongoing propensity for reverential recognition of earlier versions of the series.<ref>{{cite book |title=Living with Star Trek: American culture and the Star Trek universe |last=Geraghty |first=Lincoln |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781845112653 |page=51 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Television-to-film crossover===\n\nThe film ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' brought Kirk and Picard, ''Enterprise'' captains from different centuries, together to defeat a common enemy. It also marked the passing of the film franchise from the original series cast to that of ''The Next Generation''.\n\n==Characters more prominent on subsequent series==\nA few occasional recurring characters introduced in one series continued into other series, sometimes attaining more significant roles in their subsequent ''Trek'' series than in the one in which they were first introduced:\n\n* Spock's father [[Sarek]] appeared in only one episode of the original series, but became a more developed character in three movies and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' and appeared in [[Sarek (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|the ''Next Generation'' episode named after him]] and the first part of \"Unification\". Sarek's appearance in the former is described in ''The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion'' as \"the first major unifying event tying together the old and new Trek eras since McCoy's cameo\" in the original series.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion: Revised Edition |last=Nemecek |first=Larry |authorlink= |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location= |isbn=9780743457989 |page=127 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n* Recurring character [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], originally introduced in the premiere episode of ''Next Generation'', continued to appear in episodes of ''Deep Space Nine'' and ''Voyager''. Teleplay writer Robert Wolfe found it difficult to incorporate Q into the ''DS9'' universe as the character had been conceived so much as a foil for Captain Picard. He eventually decided to use Q to show personality differences between Picard and Sisko.<ref>{{cite book |title=Star trek: Deep space nine : companion |last=Erdmann |first=Terry |authorlink= |author2=Paula M.

Barclay also appears in a cameo role in the eighth movie in the film series, ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''.\n* Three Klingon characters from separate individual episodes of the original series, Kor, Koloth and Kang, all appear in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode \"[[Blood Oath (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Blood Oath]]\", and Kor further appeared in ''DS9'' episodes \"[[The Sword of Kahless]]\" and \"[[Once More Unto the Breach (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Once More Unto the Breach]]\".

Introduced in ''The Next Generation'', they would appear in ''Deep Space Nine'', ''Voyager'' and ''Enterprise''. Their role in ''Deep Space Nine'' was limited to an appearance in the premiere episode to explore Benjamin Sisko's troubled past (his wife having been killed in a major confrontation with the Borg), while their role in the ''Enterprise'' episode \"[[Regeneration (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Regeneration]]\" served as a 'sequel' to ''Star Trek: First Contact'', as an archaeological expedition discovers the remains of the time-travelling Borg sphere that was destroyed in ''First Contact'' and unwittingly reactivate a pair of Borg drones. However, the Borg became a recurring threat on ''Voyager''. The only crossover character was the [[Borg (Star Trek)#Borg Queen|Borg Queen]] first introduced in the ''Next Generation'' feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact''. She would then become a recurring character on ''Voyager'' appearing in the two-part episodes \"Dark Frontier\" and \"Unimatrix Zero\" and in the series finale \"Endgame\". These episodes form a narrative thread in which the Borg Queen is battling with Janeway in attempts to re-assimilate [[Seven of Nine]].<ref>{{cite book |title=American science fiction tv: Star Trek, Stargate and beyond |last=Johnson-Smith |first=Jan |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |location= |isbn=9781860648823 |page=88 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Only in the final ''Voyager'' episode is the Borg Queen played by the same actress who played her in the feature film ''Star Trek: First Contact'', [[Alice Krige]].
