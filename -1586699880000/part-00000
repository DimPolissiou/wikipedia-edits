He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]].

He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]].

He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]].

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist, who has served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to [[2016 London mayoral election|2016]]. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, he identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. Later he became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005. After being elected MP for Henley in 2001, Johnson served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[Party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. In 2008 he [[2008 London mayoral election|was elected Mayor of London]], [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resigning a month later from the House of Commons]]; he was re-elected as Mayor in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty, Johnson oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; he stepped down as mayor the following year, during which he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979.

Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

The etymology of the name came from ''Meru-Api''; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] combined words; ''[[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]]'' means \"mountain\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and ''api'' means \"fire\".\n\nRubish\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Uitbarsting van de Merapi in 1930 TMnr 10003995.jpg|thumb|Merapi in 1930]]\nMerapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern [[Java]]. It is situated at a [[subduction]] zone, where the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] is subducting under the [[Sunda Plate]]. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire\u2013a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes\" /> Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing [[lava]] emitted was [[basalt]]ic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas often generating [[lava dome]]s. Dome collapse has often generated [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and larger explosions, which have resulted in [[eruption column]]s, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.\n\nTypically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10\u201315 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the [[Hindu]] [[Kingdom of Mataram]]; however, the  evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.\n\n===2006 eruption===\nIn April 2006, increased [[seismicity]] at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation. On 19 April smoke from the crater reached a height of {{convert|400|m|ft}}, compared to {{convert|75|m|ft}} the previous day. On 23 April, after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma, some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/&articleid=269888 | title = Mail & Guardian online | publisher = mg.co.za | date = 23 April 2006 | accessdate = 27 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy early May, active lava flows had begun.

[[Seismology|Seismic]] monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]] and Merapi), and [[Plawangan]] monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into [[Kaliurang]] as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]].\n\nThe eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 [[seismograph]]s currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the [[hypocentre]]s of tremors and quakes.\n\nA zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5&nbsp;km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the [[magma chamber|magma reservoir]] which feeds the eruptions.\n\nOther measurements taken on the volcano include [[magnetism|magnetic]] measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.\n\n[[Lahar]]s (a type of [[mudflow]] of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by [[rain]] remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-[[frequency]] seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50&nbsp;mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.\n\n==Sabo Dam==\nThere are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged. The cost for recovery is about Rp.1 trillion ($116 million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.indonesiafinancetoday.com/read/4688/Merapi-Sand-Barriers-Restoration-Need-Rp-1-T- |title=Merapi Sand Barriers Restoration Need Rp 1 T \u2013 Indonesia Finance Today |publisher=En.indonesiafinancetoday.com |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Sterile zone==\nFollowing the 2010 eruption, three Indonesian government departments declared a prohibited zone which nobody can permanently stay and no infrastructure is allowed in 9 villages (dusun): Palemsari, Pangukrejo, Kaliadem, Jambu, Kopeng, Petung, Kalitengah Lor, Kalitengah Kidul and Srunen, all in Cangkringan district.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaindonesia.com/read/2011/09/15/259708/289/101/-Sembilan-Dusun-Lereng-Merapi-Tetap-tidak-Boleh-untuk-Hunian |title=Sembilan Dusun Lereng Merapi Tetap tidak Boleh untuk Hunian  |date=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==National park==\nIn 2004, an area of 6,410 hectares around Mount Merapi was established as a [[List of national parks of Indonesia|national park]].

The constant smoke from its summit is said to come from two sacred armourers living under the mountain.]]\nMerapi is very important to [[Javanese people|Javanese]], especially those living around its crater. As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.\n\n===Creation===\nAlthough most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.\nIt is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, [[Java]] was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by [[Batara Guru]]) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred [[keris]] at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \"fire of Rama and Permadi.\"<ref name=\"Triyoga\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit ''Kraton'' of Merapi===\nThe Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (''makhluk halus''). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]'') used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.\nBesides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of [[ancestor]]s who died as righteous people. The spirits of these ancestors are said to live in the palace as royal servants (''abdi dalem''), occasionally visiting their descendants in dreams to give [[Prophecy|prophecies]] or warnings. \"<ref name=\"Triyoga1\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=56\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits of Merapi===\nTo keep the volcano quiet and to appease the spirits of the mountain, the Javanese regularly bring offerings on the anniversary of the sultan of [[Yogyakarta]]'s coronation.<ref>{{cite book | publisher = Ministry of Culture and Tourism | title = Mount Tourism&nbsp;\u2013 Mount Merapi | year = 2008}}</ref> For [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], Merapi holds a significant cosmological symbolism, because it forms a sacred north-south axis line between Merapi peak and Southern Ocean ([[Indian Ocean]]).

The etymology of the name came from ''Meru-Api''; from the ancient classical language of India Sanskrit and  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] combined words; ''[[Mount Meru (mythology)|Meru]]'' means \"mountain\", refers to mountain of Gods in Hinduism, and ''api'' means \"fire\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Uitbarsting van de Merapi in 1930 TMnr 10003995.jpg|thumb|Merapi in 1930]]\nMerapi is the youngest in a group of volcanoes in southern [[Java]]. It is situated at a [[subduction]] zone, where the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] is subducting under the [[Sunda Plate]]. It is one of at least 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, part of the volcano is located in the Southeastern part of the Pacific Ring of Fire\u2013a section of fault lines stretching from the Western Hemisphere through Japan and South East Asia.<ref name=\"StraitsTimes\" /> Stratigraphic analysis reveals that eruptions in the Merapi area began about 400,000 years ago, and from then until about 10,000 years ago, eruptions were typically effusive, and the out flowing [[lava]] emitted was [[basalt]]ic. Since then, eruptions have become more explosive, with viscous [[andesite|andesitic]] lavas often generating [[lava dome]]s. Dome collapse has often generated [[pyroclastic flow]]s, and larger explosions, which have resulted in [[eruption column]]s, have also generated pyroclastic flows through column collapse.\n\nTypically, small eruptions occur every two to three years, and larger ones every 10\u201315 years or so. Notable eruptions, often causing many deaths, have occurred in 1006, 1786, 1822, 1872, and 1930. Thirteen villages were destroyed in the latter one, and 1,400 people were killed by pyroclastic flows.\n\nThe very large eruption in 1006 is claimed to have covered all of central Java with [[Volcanic ash|ash]]. The volcanic devastation is claimed to have led to the collapse of the [[Hindu]] [[Kingdom of Mataram]]; however, the  evidence from that era is insufficient for this to be substantiated.\n\n===2006 eruption===\nIn April 2006, increased [[seismicity]] at more regular intervals and a detected bulge in the volcano's cone indicated that fresh eruptions were imminent. Authorities put the volcano's neighboring villages on high alert and local residents prepared for a likely evacuation. On 19 April smoke from the crater reached a height of {{convert|400|m|ft}}, compared to {{convert|75|m|ft}} the previous day. On 23 April, after nine surface tremors and some 156 multifaced quakes signalled movements of magma, some 600 elderly and infant residents of the slopes were evacuated.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__international_news/&articleid=269888 | title = Mail & Guardian online | publisher = mg.co.za | date = 23 April 2006 | accessdate = 27 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy early May, active lava flows had begun.

[[Seismology|Seismic]] monitoring began in 1924, with some of the volcano monitoring stations lasting until the present. The Babadan (northwest location), Selo (in the saddle between [[Mount Merbabu|Merbabu]] and Merapi), and [[Plawangan]] monitoring stations have been updated with equipment over the decades since establishment. During the 1950s and early 1960s some of the stations were starved of equipment and funds, but after the 1970s considerable improvement occurred with the supply of new equipment. Some of the pre-1930 observation posts were destroyed by the 1930 eruption, and newer posts were re-located. Similarly after the 1994 eruption, the Plawangan post and equipment were moved into [[Kaliurang]] as a response to the threat of danger to the volcanological personnel at the higher point. This volcano is monitored by the [[Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project]].\n\nThe eruption of 1930 was found to have been preceded by a large earthquake swarm. The network of 8 [[seismograph]]s currently around the volcano allow volcanologists to accurately pinpoint the [[hypocentre]]s of tremors and quakes.\n\nA zone in which no quakes originate is found about 1.5&nbsp;km below the summit, and is thought to be the location of the [[magma chamber|magma reservoir]] which feeds the eruptions.\n\nOther measurements taken on the volcano include [[magnetism|magnetic]] measurements and tilt measurements. Small changes in the local magnetic field have been found to coincide with eruptions, and tilt measurements reveal the inflation of the volcano caused when the magma chambers beneath it is filling up.\n\n[[Lahar]]s (a type of [[mudflow]] of pyroclastic material and water) are an important hazard on the mountain, and are caused by [[rain]] remobilizing pyroclastic flow deposits. Lahars can be detected seismically, as they cause a high-[[frequency]] seismic signal. Observations have found that about 50&nbsp;mm of rain per hour is the threshold above which lahars are often generated.\n\n==Sabo Dam==\nThere are about 90 units (30 percent) from the total 258 units of sand barriers (sabo) were damaged.

As such, there are many myths and beliefs attached to Merapi.\n\n===Creation===\nAlthough most nearby villages have their own myths about the creation of Mount Merapi, they have numerous commonalities.\nIt is believed that when the gods had just created the Earth, [[Java]] was unbalanced because of the placement of Mount Jamurdipo on the west end of the island. In order to assure balance, the gods (generally represented by [[Batara Guru]]) ordered the mountain to be moved to the centre of Java. However, two armourers, Empu Rama and Empu Permadi, were already forging a sacred [[keris]] at the site where Mount Jamurdipo was to be moved. The gods warned them that they would be moving a mountain there, and that they should leave; Empu Rama and Empu Permadi ignored that warning. In anger, the gods buried Empu Rama and Empu Permadi under Mount Jamurdipo; their spirits later became the rulers of all mystical beings in the area. In memory of them, Mount Jamurdipo was later renamed Mount Merapi, which means \"fire of Rama and Permadi.\"<ref name=\"Triyoga\">{{cite book |title= Merapi dan Orang Jawa: Persepsi dan Kepercayaannya| last=Triyoga |first=Lucas Sasongko |year=2010 |publisher=Gramedia Widiasarana Indonesia |location=Jakarta |language=Indonesian |isbn= |pages=50\u201352}}</ref>\n\n===Spirit ''Kraton'' of Merapi===\nThe Javanese believe that the Earth is not only populated by human beings, but also by spirits (''makhluk halus''). Villages near Merapi believe that one of the palaces (in [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''[[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]]'') used by the rulers of the spirit kingdom lies inside Merapi, ruled by Empu Rama and Empu Permadi. This palace is said to be a spiritual counterpart to the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], complete with roads, soldiers, princes, vehicles, and domesticated animals.\nBesides the rulers, the palace is said to also be populated by the spirits of [[ancestor]]s who died as righteous people.

[[Ice yachting]] is the [[sport]] of [[sailing]] and racing iceboats. Sail-able ice is known in the sport as \"hard water\" versus sailing on liquid or \"soft\" water. A related sport, [[land sailing]], utilizes a configuration with an iceboat-like fuselage or frame equipped with wheels instead of runners. Iceboats commonly used for racing are usually only for one person, but several classes of two-seat and multiple-seat iceboats are more or less common. On some boats, a \"side car\" can be fitted to take others along for a ride.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\nThe first iceboats were probably converted from canal vessels used in the [[Netherlands]], where due to the [[Little Ice Age]] - a cooler [[Climate change (general concept)|climatic period]] lasting from the [[15th century|15th]] to the [[19th century]] - the canals were typically covered with ice for up to 5 months a year. Due to the winters lasted for almost half a year, trade and the transport of goods through the canals could not stop, so ingenious merchants put their boats on skates with the help of a plank, thus making them usable even during wintertime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://icesailing.nl/|title=ijszeilvereniging \"De Robben\" uit Kaag|website=icesailing.nl|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nTraditional iceboats from before the late 19th century were used for transportation of goods and racing. These boats reached lengths of {{convert|30|to|50|ft|m}} and were sometimes transported between sites on rail cars. Ice sailing was first developed in Europe. \n\nIn America, it was done in several locations where the sport also continues today. Many active ice sailing clubs are thriving in the northern States and Canadian Provinces, including on the [[Hudson River]]; [[Long Island Sound]]; [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; [[Sandusky, Ohio]]; [[Gull Lake (Michigan)|Gull Lake, Michigan]]; [[Lake Muskegon]], [[Michigan]]; [[Geneva Lake]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]; Hamilton Bay, Ontario, Rondeau Bay, Ontario; [[Ghost Lake, Alberta]], [[Fort Peck Lake|Fort Peck Lake, Montana]] and on other venues as far south as Decatur and Springfield, Illinois. Some of the older large \"stern steerer\" iceboats can seat several in their \"baskets.\" Several of these boats are maintained and raced today. The Northwest Ice Yacht Association sponsors an annual [[regatta]] that includes classes for these boats. This annual regatta recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe first iceboat in America is attributed to Oliver Booth in 1790 at Poughkeepsie, NY.  This craft was a small triangular box with two runners affixed to the front and a steering runner at the rear.\n\nOne unique type of ice boat has its history in wide, stubby, scow-like vessels used in the 1800s, often for transportation across a mixed passage transitioning over sea-ice and open water. Wildly sailed by adjusting main and jib sail trim only, these boats had no rudder. Parallel rails were mounted on the bottom, like multiple sled runners. These early vessels (called an \"ice scooter\" or \"bay scooter\") were capable of simultaneously and daringly traversing both open water and jumping onto stretches of ice and were used primarily for winter [[transportation]] to and from lighthouses and for [[ice fishing]]. In 1869, one of the largest ice yachts ever was built for racing on the frozen [[Hudson River]], called the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''. That boat occasionally raced the railroad which ran alongside the Hudson.\n\nThe first iceboats were adaptations of regular sailing boats, with a wooden plank fastened cross-wise at the front having a fixed runner at each end, and a steering runner attached to the bottom of the rudder at the [[stern]] (back). These early ice sailing [[marine vessel|vessels]] led to the development of boats designed strictly for racing on ice. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''. This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into a very efficient aerodynamically clean machine.

[[Ice yachting]] is the [[sport]] of [[sailing]] and racing iceboats. Sail-able ice is known in the sport as \"hard water\" versus sailing on liquid or \"soft\" water. A related sport, [[land sailing]], utilizes a configuration with an iceboat-like fuselage or frame equipped with wheels instead of runners. Iceboats commonly used for racing are usually only for one person, but several classes of two-seat and multiple-seat iceboats are more or less common. On some boats, a \"side car\" can be fitted to take others along for a ride.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\nThe first iceboats were probably converted from canal vessels used in the [[Netherlands]], where due to the [[Little Ice Age]] - a cooler [[Climate change (general concept)|climatic period]] lasting from the [[15th century|15th]] to the [[19th century]] - the canals were typically covered with ice for up to 5 months a year. Due to the winters lasted for almost half a year, trade and the transport of goods through the canals could not stop, so ingenious merchants put their boats on skates with the help of a plank, thus making them usable even during wintertime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://icesailing.nl/|title=ijszeilvereniging \"De Robben\" uit Kaag|website=icesailing.nl|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nTraditional iceboats from before the late 19th century were used for transportation of goods and racing. These boats reached lengths of {{convert|30|to|50|ft|m}} and were sometimes transported between sites on rail cars. Ice sailing was first developed in Europe. \n\nIn America, it was done in several locations where the sport also continues today. Many active ice sailing clubs are thriving in the northern States and Canadian Provinces, including on the [[Hudson River]]; [[Long Island Sound]]; [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]; [[Sandusky, Ohio]]; [[Gull Lake (Michigan)|Gull Lake, Michigan]]; [[Lake Muskegon]], [[Michigan]]; [[Geneva Lake]], [[Wisconsin]]; [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]; Hamilton Bay, Ontario, Rondeau Bay, Ontario; [[Ghost Lake, Alberta]], [[Fort Peck Lake|Fort Peck Lake, Montana]] and on other venues as far south as Decatur and Springfield, Illinois. Some of the older large \"stern steerer\" iceboats can seat several in their \"baskets.\" Several of these boats are maintained and raced today. The Northwest Ice Yacht Association sponsors an annual [[regatta]] that includes classes for these boats. This annual regatta recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.\n\nThe first iceboat in America is attributed to Oliver Booth in 1790 at Poughkeepsie, NY.  This craft was a small triangular box with two runners affixed to the front and a steering runner at the rear.\n\nOne unique type of ice boat has its history in wide, stubby, scow-like vessels used in the 1800s, often for transportation across a mixed passage transitioning over sea-ice and open water. Wildly sailed by adjusting main and jib sail trim only, these boats had no rudder. Parallel rails were mounted on the bottom, like multiple sled runners. These early vessels (called an \"ice scooter\" or \"bay scooter\") were capable of simultaneously and daringly traversing both open water and jumping onto stretches of ice and were used primarily for winter [[transportation]] to and from lighthouses and for [[ice fishing]]. In 1869, one of the largest ice yachts ever was built for racing on the frozen [[Hudson River]], called the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''. That boat occasionally raced the railroad which ran alongside the Hudson.\n\nThe first iceboats were adaptations of regular sailing boats, with a wooden plank fastened cross-wise at the front having a fixed runner at each end, and a steering runner attached to the bottom of the rudder at the [[stern]] (back). These early ice sailing [[marine vessel|vessels]] led to the development of boats designed strictly for racing on ice. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''. This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into a very efficient aerodynamically clean machine. While the large stern-steerers could have up to {{convert|600|sqft|m2}} of sail, the Skeeter class is limited to just {{convert|75|sqft|m2}} of sail.\n\nIn 1937, The [[Detroit News]] sponsored a new home-buildable ice boat design, which became the [[International DN]]. In 1968 Dick Slates of [[Pewaukee, Wisconsin]] designed and built the ''Nite'' with two wooden prototypes. The design was refined and fiberglass production began in 1970.\n\n==Modern designs==\n[[File:Ice yachters on Hudson River near Barrytown, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Ice yachters on [[Hudson River]] at [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown, NY]]|alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them.
