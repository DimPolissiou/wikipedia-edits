Disputes are settled, interests are pursued, and justice and order are dispensed and maintained by means of this framework, organized according to an ethic of self-help and collective responsibility (Andersen 14). The individual family unit (known as a tent or \"gio\"{{Clarify|date=March 2013}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bayt}}'') typically consisted traditionally of three or four adults (a married couple plus siblings or parents) and any number of children.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nWhen resources were plentiful, several tents would travel together as a ''goum''. While these groups were sometimes linked by patriarchal lineage, others were just as likely linked by marriage alliances (new wives were especially likely to have close male relatives join them). Sometimes, the association was based on acquaintance and familiarity, or even no clearly defined relation except for simple shared membership within a tribe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}[[File:A Bedouin girl in Nuweiba - Egypt.jpg|thumb|A Bedouin girl in [[Nuweiba]], Egypt (2015)]]The next scale of interaction within groups was the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ibn \u02bfamm}}'' (cousin, or literally \"son of an uncle\") or descent group, commonly of three to five generations. These were often linked to goums, but where a goum would generally consist of people all with the same herd type, descent groups were frequently split up over several economic activities, thus allowing a degree of 'risk management'; should one group of members of a descent group suffer economically, the other members of the descent group would be able to support them.

With urbanization and new education opportunities, Bedouins started to marry outside their tribe, a practice that once was completely inappropriate.<ref name=\"DNE\" />\n\nBedouins living in the Sinai peninsula did not benefit much from employment in the initial construction boom due to low wages offered.

When the tourist industry started to bloom, local Bedouins increasingly moved into new service positions such as cab drivers, tour guides, campgrounds or cafe managers. However, the competition is very high, and many Sinai Bedouins are unemployed.

The director of the Tourist Development Agency dismissed Bedouin rights to most of the land, saying that they had not lived on the coast prior to 1982.

Disputes are settled, interests are pursued, and justice and order are dispensed and maintained by means of this framework, organized according to an ethic of self-help and collective responsibility (Andersen 14).

While these groups were sometimes linked by patriarchal lineage, others were just as likely linked by marriage alliances (new wives were especially likely to have close male relatives join them). Sometimes, the association was based on acquaintance and familiarity, or even no clearly defined relation except for simple shared membership within a tribe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}[[File:A Bedouin girl in Nuweiba - Egypt.jpg|thumb|A Bedouin girl in [[Nuweiba]], Egypt (2015)]]The next scale of interaction within groups was the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ibn \u02bfamm}}'' (cousin, or literally \"son of an uncle\") or descent group, commonly of three to five generations. These were often linked to goums, but where a goum would generally consist of people all with the same herd type, descent groups were frequently split up over several economic activities, thus allowing a degree of 'risk management'; should one group of members of a descent group suffer economically, the other members of the descent group would be able to support them. Whilst the phrase \"descent group\" suggests purely a lineage-based arrangement, in reality these groups were fluid and adapted their genealogies to take in new members.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe largest scale of tribal interactions is the tribe as a whole, led by a ''[[Sheikh]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0634\u064a\u062e}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\u0161ay\u1e2b}}'', literally, \"old man\"), though the title refers to leaders in varying contexts.

With urbanization and new education opportunities, Bedouins started to marry outside their tribe, a practice that once was completely inappropriate.<ref name=\"DNE\" />\n\nBedouins living in the Sinai peninsula did not benefit much from employment in the initial construction boom due to low wages offered.

When the tourist industry started to bloom, local Bedouins increasingly moved into new service positions such as cab drivers, tour guides, campgrounds or cafe managers. However, the competition is very high, and many Sinai Bedouins are unemployed.

The director of the Tourist Development Agency dismissed Bedouin rights to most of the land, saying that they had not lived on the coast prior to 1982.

The film is a British and American venture distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nThe film takes place in France during the early 19th century and tells the story of [[Jean Valjean]] who, while being hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman [[Javert]] after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The story reaches resolution against the background of the [[June Rebellion]].\n\nFollowing the release of the 1980 musical, a [[film adaptation]] was mired in \"development hell\" for over ten years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 2011, producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] sold the film rights to [[Eric Fellner]], who financed the film through his Working Title Films. In June 2011, production of the film officially began, with Hooper and Mackintosh serving as director and producer, and the main characters were cast later that year. [[Principal photography]] commenced in March 2012, with a budget of $61{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"FirstDay\"/> Filming took place on locations in Greenwich, London, Chatham, Winchester, Bath, and Portsmouth, England; in [[Gourdon, Alpes-Maritimes|Gourdon, France]]; and on soundstages in [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' held its [[world premiere]] at [[Leicester Square]] in London on 5 December 2012, and was released 25 December 2012 in the [[United States]] and 11 January 2013 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"premiere\"/><ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lesmiserables2012.htm |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usreleasedate\"/> It grossed over $441{{nbsp}}million worldwide.

His [[parole]]d status prevents him from finding work or accommodation, but he is sheltered by the kindly [[Bishop of Digne]]. Stealing his silverware, Valjean is captured by [[National Gendarmerie|police]], but the Bishop claims he gave Valjean the silver, telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life. Moved, Valjean breaks his parole to start a new life.\n\nEight years later, Valjean is a respected factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais]]. He is shocked when [[Javert]], formerly a Toulon prison guard, arrives as his new chief of police. Javert suspects Valjean's real identity when he rescues a worker trapped under a cart. One of Valjean's workers, [[Fantine]], is dismissed by the factory foreman upon learning she has an illegitimate daughter [[Cosette]], who lives with greedy innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], to whom Fantine sends her earnings.\n\nTo support her daughter, Fantine sells her hair and teeth, and becomes a [[prostitute]]. Javert arrests her when she attacks an abusive customer, but Valjean rescues her and takes her to the hospital. Learning that a man has been wrongly identified as him, Valjean reveals his identity to the court before returning to the dying Fantine, promising to care for Cosette. Javert arrives to arrest Valjean but he escapes. Paying Fantine's debts to the Th\u00e9nardiers, Valjean flees from Javert with Cosette. They hide in a [[convent]], aided by the worker Valjean rescued.\n\nNine years later, Valjean has become a [[philanthropist]] to the poor in [[Paris]]. [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only government official sympathetic to the poor, dies, and revolutionists called the [[Friends of the ABC]] plot against the [[July Monarchy|monarchy]]. [[Marius Pontmercy]], a member of the Friends, falls in love with Cosette and asks [[\u00c9ponine]], the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughter, to help find her. He and Cosette meet and confess their love; \u00c9ponine, also in love with Marius, is heartbroken.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Valjean's house, but is stopped by \u00c9ponine. Valjean, afraid Javert is near, plans to flee to [[England]] with Cosette. She leaves Marius a letter, which \u00c9ponine hides from him. During Lamarque's [[funeral procession]], the revolt begins and barricades are built across Paris. Javert poses as an ally to spy on the rebels, but the street urchin [[Gavroche]] exposes him as a policeman. During the first skirmish against the soldiers, \u00c9ponine takes a bullet for Marius and dies in his arms, giving him Cosette's letter and confessing her love. Marius' answer to Cosette is intercepted by Valjean, who joins the revolution to guard Marius.\n\nValjean offers to execute Javert but releases him instead, faking the policeman\u2019s death. By dawn, the soldiers storm the barricade and kill everyone except Marius and Valjean, who escape into the sewers. Th\u00e9nardier comes across Valjean and the unconscious Marius, stealing the latter's ring before pointing a way out. Valjean finds Javert waiting for him, but ignores his threats. Javert, morally confused by the mercy of his nemesis, commits [[suicide]] by throwing himself in the [[Seine]]. Marius recovers, traumatized by the death of his friends.\n\nMarius and Cosette are reunited but Valjean, concerned his presence would threaten their happiness, makes plans to leave and reveals his story to Marius, who promises to remain silent. Cosette and Marius marry, but the Th\u00e9nardiers crash the wedding reception to [[blackmail]] Marius. Th\u00e9nardier claims that he witnessed Valjean carrying a murdered corpse and shows the stolen ring, which Marius recognises as his own. Realizing that Valjean saved him that night, Marius forces Th\u00e9nardier to reveal where Valjean is before leaving with Cosette, and the Th\u00e9nardiers are thrown out of the wedding. At the convent, Cosette and Marius find the dying Valjean, who gives them letters of confession before dying peacefully, and his spirit is guided by the spirits of Fantine and the Bishop to join Eponine, Gavroche, and the Friends of the ABC in the afterlife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Jean Valjean]], a Frenchman released from [[Toulon]] [[Bagne of Toulon|prison]] after 19 years of imprisonment for stealing bread and failed attempts at escaping from the prison.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\"/> Around June 2011, Jackman met with producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] to audition in New York.<ref name=\"THR\"/> To prepare for the role, Jackman lost {{convert|15|lbs}} and later regained {{convert|30|lbs}} to mirror his character's success.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-miserables-anne-hathaway-russell-398099?page=2 |title=Inside the Fight to Bring 'Les Mis' to the Screen |last=Galloway |first=Stephen |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> He avoided drinking [[coffee]], warmed up at least 15 minutes every day, kept [[Ricola]] lozenges, drank as much as seven litres of water per day, sat in steam three times a day, took cold baths and used a wet washcloth over his face while flying, citing the musical's original co-director [[Trevor Nunn]] for his training.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-en-les-miserables-hugh-jackman-20121227,0,3437263.story |title='Les Miz': Hugh Jackman prepped with weights, washcloths, desire |last=Dawn |first=Randie |date=27 December 2012 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref> He worked extensively with vocal coach Joan Lader, and managed to extend his vocal range, which he originally categorised a high [[baritone]], up to [[tenor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/hugh-jackman-on-les-miz-and-his-javert-past.html |title=Hugh Jackman on Les Mis\u00e9rables, His Brutal Training Regimen, and His Javert Past |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Javert]], a police inspector dedicating his life to imprisoning Valjean once again.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=81882 |title=Russell Crowe Joins Les Mis\u00e9rables |work=ComingSoon.net |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> Before being cast as Javert, Crowe was initially dissatisfied with the character.

The film is a British and American venture distributed by [[Universal Pictures]]. The film stars an [[ensemble cast]] led by [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Eddie Redmayne]], [[Amanda Seyfried]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].\n\nThe film takes place in France during the early 19th century and tells the story of [[Jean Valjean]] who, while being hunted for decades by the ruthless policeman [[Javert]] after breaking parole, agrees to care for a factory worker's daughter. The story reaches resolution against the background of the [[June Rebellion]].\n\nFollowing the release of the 1980 musical, a [[film adaptation]] was mired in \"development hell\" for over ten years, as the rights were passed on to several major studios, and various directors and actors considered. In 2011, producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] sold the film rights to [[Eric Fellner]], who financed the film through his Working Title Films. In June 2011, production of the film officially began, with Hooper and Mackintosh serving as director and producer, and the main characters were cast later that year. [[Principal photography]] commenced in March 2012, with a budget of $61{{nbsp}}million.<ref name=\"FirstDay\"/> Filming took place on locations in Greenwich, London, Chatham, Winchester, Bath, and Portsmouth, England; in [[Gourdon, Alpes-Maritimes|Gourdon, France]]; and on soundstages in [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Les Mis\u00e9rables'' held its [[world premiere]] at [[Leicester Square]] in London on 5 December 2012, and was released 25 December 2012 in the [[United States]] and 11 January 2013 in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"premiere\"/><ref name=\"BOM\">{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lesmiserables2012.htm |title=Les Mis\u00e9rables (2012) |work=Box Office Mojo |accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"usreleasedate\"/> It grossed over $441{{nbsp}}million worldwide. The film received generally favourable<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/les-miserables |title=Metacritic provided reviews}}</ref> reviews, with many critics praising the direction, production values, musical numbers and the cast performances, with Jackman, Hathaway, Bonham Carter, Redmayne, Seyfried and [[Samantha Barks]] being the most often singled out for praise.

His [[parole]]d status prevents him from finding work or accommodation, but he is sheltered by the kindly [[Bishop of Digne]]. Stealing his silverware, Valjean is captured by [[National Gendarmerie|police]], but the Bishop claims he gave Valjean the silver, telling him to use it to do something worthwhile with his life. Moved, Valjean breaks his parole to start a new life.\n\nEight years later, Valjean is a respected factory owner and mayor of [[Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais]]. He is shocked when [[Javert]], formerly a Toulon prison guard, arrives as his new chief of police. Javert suspects Valjean's real identity when he rescues a worker trapped under a cart. One of Valjean's workers, [[Fantine]], is dismissed by the factory foreman upon learning she has an illegitimate daughter [[Cosette]], who lives with greedy innkeepers, the [[Th\u00e9nardiers]], to whom Fantine sends her earnings.\n\nTo support her daughter, Fantine sells her hair and teeth, and becomes a [[prostitute]]. Javert arrests her when she attacks an abusive customer, but Valjean rescues her and takes her to the hospital. Learning that a man has been wrongly identified as him, Valjean reveals his identity to the court before returning to the dying Fantine, promising to care for Cosette. Javert arrives to arrest Valjean but he escapes. Paying Fantine's debts to the Th\u00e9nardiers, Valjean flees from Javert with Cosette. They hide in a [[convent]], aided by the worker Valjean rescued.\n\nNine years later, Valjean has become a [[philanthropist]] to the poor in [[Paris]]. [[Jean Maximilien Lamarque|General Lamarque]], the only government official sympathetic to the poor, dies, and revolutionists called the [[Friends of the ABC]] plot against the [[July Monarchy|monarchy]]. [[Marius Pontmercy]], a member of the Friends, falls in love with Cosette and asks [[\u00c9ponine]], the Th\u00e9nardiers' daughter, to help find her. He and Cosette meet and confess their love; \u00c9ponine, also in love with Marius, is heartbroken.\n\nTh\u00e9nardier attempts to rob Valjean's house, but is stopped by \u00c9ponine. Valjean, afraid Javert is near, plans to flee to [[England]] with Cosette. She leaves Marius a letter, which \u00c9ponine hides from him. During Lamarque's [[funeral procession]], the revolt begins and barricades are built across Paris. Javert poses as an ally to spy on the rebels, but the street urchin [[Gavroche]] exposes him as a policeman. During the first skirmish against the soldiers, \u00c9ponine takes a bullet for Marius and dies in his arms, giving him Cosette's letter and confessing her love. Marius' answer to Cosette is intercepted by Valjean, who joins the revolution to guard Marius.\n\nValjean offers to execute Javert but releases him instead, faking the policeman\u2019s death. By dawn, the soldiers storm the barricade and kill everyone except Marius and Valjean, who escape into the sewers. Th\u00e9nardier comes across Valjean and the unconscious Marius, stealing the latter's ring before pointing a way out. Valjean finds Javert waiting for him, but ignores his threats. Javert, morally confused by the mercy of his nemesis, commits [[suicide]] by throwing himself in the [[Seine]]. Marius recovers, traumatized by the death of his friends.\n\nMarius and Cosette are reunited but Valjean, concerned his presence would threaten their happiness, makes plans to leave and reveals his story to Marius, who promises to remain silent. Cosette and Marius marry, but the Th\u00e9nardiers crash the wedding reception to [[blackmail]] Marius. Th\u00e9nardier claims that he witnessed Valjean carrying a murdered corpse and shows the stolen ring, which Marius recognises as his own. Realizing that Valjean saved him that night, Marius forces Th\u00e9nardier to reveal where Valjean is before leaving with Cosette, and the Th\u00e9nardiers are thrown out of the wedding. At the convent, Cosette and Marius find the dying Valjean, who gives them letters of confession before dying peacefully, and his spirit is guided by the spirits of Fantine and the Bishop to join Eponine, Gavroche, and the Friends of the ABC in the afterlife.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Jean Valjean]], a Frenchman released from [[Toulon]] [[Bagne of Toulon|prison]] after 19 years of imprisonment for stealing bread and failed attempts at escaping from the prison.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\"/> Around June 2011, Jackman met with producer [[Cameron Mackintosh]] to audition in New York.<ref name=\"THR\"/> To prepare for the role, Jackman lost {{convert|15|lbs}} and later regained {{convert|30|lbs}} to mirror his character's success.<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/les-miserables-anne-hathaway-russell-398099?page=2 |title=Inside the Fight to Bring 'Les Mis' to the Screen |last=Galloway |first=Stephen |date=5 December 2012 |accessdate=27 December 2012 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> He avoided drinking [[coffee]], warmed up at least 15 minutes every day, kept [[Ricola]] lozenges, drank as much as seven litres of water per day, sat in steam three times a day, took cold baths and used a wet washcloth over his face while flying, citing the musical's original co-director [[Trevor Nunn]] for his training.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-en-les-miserables-hugh-jackman-20121227,0,3437263.story |title='Les Miz': Hugh Jackman prepped with weights, washcloths, desire |last=Dawn |first=Randie |date=27 December 2012 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref> He worked extensively with vocal coach Joan Lader, and managed to extend his vocal range, which he originally categorised a high [[baritone]], up to [[tenor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vulture.com/2012/12/hugh-jackman-on-les-miz-and-his-javert-past.html |title=Hugh Jackman on Les Mis\u00e9rables, His Brutal Training Regimen, and His Javert Past |accessdate=28 January 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as [[Javert]], a police inspector dedicating his life to imprisoning Valjean once again.<ref name=\"ComingSoon\">{{cite web |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=81882 |title=Russell Crowe Joins Les Mis\u00e9rables |work=ComingSoon.net |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2011}}</ref> Before being cast as Javert, Crowe was initially dissatisfied with the character.

In other areas, they have become largely [[nocturnal]] due to forest molestation caused by humans. In central India, they are most active at night, and are rarely seen in the open after 8 o'clock in the morning. During the dry season, herds congregate and remain in small areas, dispersing into the hills with the arrival of the [[monsoon]]. While gaur depend on water for drinking, they do not seem to bathe or wallow.<ref name=Nowak1999 />\n\nIn January and February, gaur live in small herds of eight to 11 individuals, one of which is a bull. In April or May, more bulls may join the herd for mating, and individual bulls may move from herd to herd, each mating with many cows. In May or June, they leave the herd and may form herds of bulls only or live alone. Herds wander {{Convert|2|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day. Each herd has a nonexclusive home range, and sometimes herds may join in groups of 50 or more.<ref name=\"Burton\" />\n\nGaur herds are led by an old adult female, the matriarch. Adult males may be solitary. During the peak of the breeding season, unattached males wander widely in search of receptive females. No serious fighting between males has been recorded, with size being the major factor in determining dominance. Males make a [[mating call]] of clear, resonant tones which may carry for more than {{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

When alarmed, gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed. However, in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South India]], where they are used to the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur lets out a high whistle for help.<ref name=Sanderson1907 />\n\n=== Feeding ecology ===\n\nWild gaur [[Grazing (behaviour)|graze]] and [[browsing (herbivory)|browse]] on a wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of India, with a preference for the upper portions of plants, such as leaf blades, stems, seeds and flowers of grass species, including ''[[Adina cordifolia|kadam]]''.<ref>Shukla, R., Khare, P.

They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of [[Dillenia|elephant apple]] (''Dillenia'' ssp.) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and [[monsoon]], they feed on preferably fine and fresh [[True grass|grasses]] and herb species of the [[Fabaceae|legume family]], such as [[Desmodium triflorum|tick clover]] (''Desmodium triflorum''), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as [[Strobilanthes callosus|karvy]] (''Strobilanthes callosus''), [[Gardenia latifolia|Indian boxwood]] (''Gardenia latifolia''), [[Grewia abutifolia|mallow-leaved crossberry]] (''Grewia abutifolia''), [[Helicteres|East-Indian screw tree]] (''Helicteres'' ssp.) and the [[Vitex negundo|chaste tree]] (''Vitex negundo''). In summer, they also feed on bark of [[Tectona grandis|teak]] (''Tectona grandis''), on fruit of [[Cassia fistula|golden shower tree]] (''Cassia fistula''), and on the bark and fruit of [[Anacardium occidentale|cashew]] (''Anacardium occidentale''). Gaur spent most of their daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30&nbsp;am and between 5:30 and 6:45&nbsp;pm.

They may turn to available browse species and fibrous teak bark in summer as green grass and herbaceous resources dry up. High concentrations of calcium (22400 ppm) and phosphorus (400 ppm) have been reported in teak bark, so consumption of teak bark may help animals to satisfy both mineral and other food needs. Long-term survival and conservation of these herbivores depend on the availability of preferred plant species for food.

By the 1980s, they were extirpated in [[Lancang County]], and the remaining animals were split into two populations, viz. in [[Xishuangbanna]]\u2013[[Simao District|Simao]] and [[Cangyuan]]. In the mid-1990s, a population of 600\u2013800 individuals may have lived in Yunnan Province, with the majority occurring in Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve.<ref name=iucn />\n\n== Ecology and behaviour ==\n[[File:Bos gaurus.jpg|thumb|A gaur herd at a [[mineral lick]] in [[Nagarhole National Park]] at [[Kabini]]]]\nWhere gaur have not been disturbed, they are basically [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]]. In other areas, they have become largely [[nocturnal]] due to forest molestation caused by humans. In central India, they are most active at night, and are rarely seen in the open after 8 o'clock in the morning. During the dry season, herds congregate and remain in small areas, dispersing into the hills with the arrival of the [[monsoon]]. While gaur depend on water for drinking, they do not seem to bathe or wallow.<ref name=Nowak1999 />\n\nIn January and February, gaur live in small herds of eight to 11 individuals, one of which is a bull. In April or May, more bulls may join the herd for mating, and individual bulls may move from herd to herd, each mating with many cows. In May or June, they leave the herd and may form herds of bulls only or live alone. Herds wander {{Convert|2|-|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day. Each herd has a nonexclusive home range, and sometimes herds may join in groups of 50 or more.<ref name=\"Burton\" />\n\nGaur herds are led by an old adult female, the matriarch. Adult males may be solitary. During the peak of the breeding season, unattached males wander widely in search of receptive females. No serious fighting between males has been recorded, with size being the major factor in determining dominance. Males make a [[mating call]] of clear, resonant tones which may carry for more than {{Convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Gaur have also been known to make a whistling snort as an alarm call, and a low, cow-like moo.<ref name=\"Huffman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/Artiodactyla/Bos_frontalis.html |title=Bos frontalis \u2013 Gaur |last=Huffman |first=B. |year=2004 |publisher=ultimateungulate.com}}</ref>\n\nIn some regions in India where human disturbance is minor, the gaur is very timid and shy despite their great size and power. When alarmed, gaur crash into the jungle at a surprising speed. However, in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South India]], where they are used to the presence of humans, gaur are said by locals to be very bold and aggressive. They are frequently known to go into fields and graze alongside domestic cattle, sometimes killing them in fights. Gaur bulls may charge without provocation, especially during summer, when the intense heat and parasitic insects make them more short-tempered than usual. To warn other members of its herd of approaching danger, the gaur lets out a high whistle for help.<ref name=Sanderson1907 />\n\n=== Feeding ecology ===\n\nWild gaur [[Grazing (behaviour)|graze]] and [[browsing (herbivory)|browse]] on a wider variety of plants than any other ungulate species of India, with a preference for the upper portions of plants, such as leaf blades, stems, seeds and flowers of grass species, including ''[[Adina cordifolia|kadam]]''.<ref>Shukla, R., Khare, P.

They consume herbs, young shoots, flowers, fruits of [[Dillenia|elephant apple]] (''Dillenia'' ssp.) with a high preference for leaves. Food preference varies by season. In winter and [[monsoon]], they feed on preferably fine and fresh [[True grass|grasses]] and herb species of the [[Fabaceae|legume family]], such as [[Desmodium triflorum|tick clover]] (''Desmodium triflorum''), but also browse on leaves of shrub species such as [[Strobilanthes callosus|karvy]] (''Strobilanthes callosus''), [[Gardenia latifolia|Indian boxwood]] (''Gardenia latifolia''), [[Grewia abutifolia|mallow-leaved crossberry]] (''Grewia abutifolia''), [[Helicteres|East-Indian screw tree]] (''Helicteres'' ssp.) and the [[Vitex negundo|chaste tree]] (''Vitex negundo''). In summer, they also feed on bark of [[Tectona grandis|teak]] (''Tectona grandis''), on fruit of [[Cassia fistula|golden shower tree]] (''Cassia fistula''), and on the bark and fruit of [[Anacardium occidentale|cashew]] (''Anacardium occidentale''). Gaur spent most of their daily time feeding. Peak feeding activity was observed between 6:30 and 8:30&nbsp;am and between 5:30 and 6:45&nbsp;pm.

They may turn to available browse species and fibrous teak bark in summer as green grass and herbaceous resources dry up. High concentrations of calcium (22400 ppm) and phosphorus (400 ppm) have been reported in teak bark, so consumption of teak bark may help animals to satisfy both mineral and other food needs. Long-term survival and conservation of these herbivores depend on the availability of preferred plant species for food. Hence, protection of the historically preferred habitats used by gaur is a significant factor in [[conservation biology]].<ref name=\"Gad\" />\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Gaur with calf.jpg|thumb|A cow with calf]]\nSexual maturity occurs in the gaur's second or third year. Females have one calf, rarely two, after a [[gestation]] period of about 275 days, a few days less than domestic cattle. Calves are typically weaned after seven to 12 months.
