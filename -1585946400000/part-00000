The character was created by [[Alan B. McElroy]] and portrayed by actress [[Danielle Harris]] in the fourth and fifth films of the series, while [[J.C. Brandy]] portrays her in the sixth.\n\nThe character was created after [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] declined to return as [[Laurie Strode]] for the fourth film due to not wanting to continue her participation in the film. As a result, her character was written out and died in a car accident, which is briefly explained in the film. Originally, the character was named Brittany \"Britti\" Lloyd. Britti's name was later changed to Jamie, a homage to Laurie Strode actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. The fourth film introduced Laurie's daughter, Jamie Lloyd. As the daughter of Laurie, she is also the niece of infamous [[serial killer]] [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] and his first victim, [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Judith Myers|Judith Myers]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===Films===\nFirst appearing in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988), Jamie is [[Laurie Strode]]'s daughter, as well as the niece of [[#Judith Myers|Judith]] and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], which she and all of Haddonfield know about. Her father is unknown since her surname was never explained or elaborated in films where it came from when she appeared. She is put in the care of a foster family, the Carruthers, and later [[adoption|adopted]] after Laurie dies in a car crash. She suffers from nightmares about Michael and is bullied at school for being related to \"The Boogeyman\". On October 30, 1988, Michael is being transferred out of Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium back to Smith's Grove. While in the transfer ambulance, he recovers from his ten-year coma upon learning the existence of his niece. Accordingly, he kills the two medical attendants and the two drivers. While making his way back to his hometown, he also kills a mechanic and a waitress. In Haddonfield, while on the trail for Jamie, Michael kills the Carruthers' Golden Retriever Sundae, a worker at the power plant which causes a blackout of the entire town, the entire police force, the deputy, the police chief's daughter Kelly, Rachel's boyfriend Brady, and 4 men from a vigilante mob. Escaping from town, Jamie cowers in a pick-up truck as Rachel hits Michael head on, throwing him off the road and knocking him out. Despite Rachel's orders, Jamie goes over to him and holds his hand. The police tell Jamie to drop to the ground and shoot Michael many times, causing him to fall into an abandoned mine shaft, which then collapses on top of him. Later, back in her foster home, Jamie is possessed by Michael's spirit and attacks her foster mother. When screams are heard from upstairs, Dr. Loomis walks over to the staircase seeing Jamie poised at the top holding a pair of bloody scissors, similar to Michael when he killed his older sister Judith. Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) restrains Loomis from shooting her, and both men, Mr. Carruthers, and Rachel watch in horror, realizing that Jamie is following in Michael's footsteps. ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989), taking place a year later, has a severely traumatized Jamie housed in the Haddonfield Children's Clinic. She has now been rendered mute and suffers from nightmares and seizures, and being treated for attacking her foster mother under Michael's influence, though her foster mother survived. Early in the film, a brick, bearing a note reading, \"The evil child must die,\" is thrown through her window.  When Michael ([[Donald L. Shanks]]) awakens from a year-long coma, she exhibits signs of a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link with her uncle, eventually regains the ability to speak, and has seizures whenever her uncle kills someone. Michael kills Rachel, four of Rachel's friends, two cops, and the Carruthers' new dog, a Doberman Pinscher named Max, while in pursuit of Jamie. Towards the end, Loomis takes Jamie to the old Myers house and successfully lures Michael into the house by having Jamie reenact her aunt Judith's final moments. Despite the doctor's pleas with Michael to fight his rage and seek redemption through a positive relationship with Jamie, Myers tracks down his niece in Judith Myers' deserted bedroom. Michael finds Jamie, but before he can kill her, she tries to appeal to her uncle's humanity. At Jamie's request, Michael takes off his mask. However, Jamie touches Michael's face, sending him into a fit of rage. Using Jamie as bait, Loomis catches Michael in a net, shoots him with tranquilizer darts, and beats him unconscious with a wooden beam. Michael is manacled and locked up in the local jail, awaiting transport to a maximum-security facility, where, Meeker says, he will remain \"until the day he dies,\" to which Jamie responds, \"He'll never die.\" After Jamie is escorted out to be taken home, a mysterious \"Man in Black\" arrives and attacks the police station. Jamie goes back inside to find that eight police officers have been gunned down, including Meeker, and that her uncle has escaped, prompting her to begin sobbing in terror. In ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995), the Man in Black kidnaps Jamie immediately after the shoot-out and has kept her and Michael ([[George P. Wilbur]]) in captivity for the past six years. 15-year-old Jamie gives birth to a boy on the night of October 30, 1995. [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] and Tommy Doyle ([[Paul Rudd]]), whom Laurie Strode was babysitting on Halloween 1978, attempt to rescue Jamie after hearing her plea for help on a local radio station. Michael kills Jamie by impaling her on a corn [[threshing machine|thresher]] and turning it on, disemboweling her. Before being killed, Jamie hides her [[infant]], who is found by Tommy. The Man in Black is revealed to be Loomis' former medical colleague [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Dr. Terence Wynn|Dr. Terence Wynn]] ([[Mitchell Ryan]]). He and most of his staff are revealed to be a [[Druid]] cult headquartered in the subterranean levels of the Smith's Grove Sanitarium, the place where Michael was committed after killing his sister Judith. They are responsible for Michael's actions, placing an ancient curse on him to kill his family to ward off sickness and death. By the end of the movie, it is implied that Dr. Wynn has been trying and failing to breed the ultimate evil using Michael's DNA and female patients of the sanitarium in [[in vitro fertilisation|in-vitro fertilization]] experiments; finally reaching a success with Jamie's baby after she had been tested on. In the original cut of the film, Jamie does not die at the beginning of the film, and instead survives a knife attack by Michael in the barn. She remains in a [[coma]] and is taken to the hospital, where Loomis and Wynn visit her. Later, an unseen person, later revealed to be Wynn, shoots the unconscious Jamie in the head with a silenced pistol.\n\nWhen screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] first outlined ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998), he created the storyline in which Laurie Strode has faked her own death and taken on a new identity as a specific way of [[retroactive continuity|retconning]] the character's death in ''Halloween 4''. In Williamson's original treatment, there are scenes in which a Hillcrest student does a report on Michael Myers' killing spree, mentioning the death of Jamie, complete with flashbacks to 4-6 mentioned in the text. \"Keri\"/Laurie responds to hearing the student's report on the death of her daughter by going into a restroom and throwing up.<ref>[[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Williamson, Kevin]]. \"[http://soma.sbcc.edu/users/DaVega/FILMPRO_175/Filmpro_175_Film_Writing/TREATMENTS/treatmentexaple_4_halloween7.pdf Halloween 7 treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://soma.sbcc.edu/users/DaVega/FILMPRO_175/Filmpro_175_Film_Writing/TREATMENTS/treatmentexaple_4_halloween7.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}\"</ref> In a controversial decision, director [[Steve Miner]] retconned the series with ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. This installment retained Laurie's faked death from Williamson's treatment, revealing that she did so in order to avoid detection by her relentless brother.

The character was created by [[Alan B. McElroy]] and portrayed by actress [[Danielle Harris]] in the fourth and fifth films of the series, while [[J.C. Brandy]] portrays her in the sixth.\n\nThe character was created after [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] declined to return as [[Laurie Strode]] for the fourth film due to not wanting to continue her participation in the film. As a result, her character was written out and died in a car accident, which is briefly explained in the film. Originally, the character was named Brittany \"Britti\" Lloyd. Britti's name was later changed to Jamie, a homage to Laurie Strode actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]]. The fourth film introduced Laurie's daughter, Jamie Lloyd. As the daughter of Laurie, she is also the niece of infamous [[serial killer]] [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] and his first victim, [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Judith Myers|Judith Myers]].\n\n==Appearances==\n===Films===\nFirst appearing in ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]'' (1988), Jamie is [[Laurie Strode]]'s daughter, as well as the niece of [[#Judith Myers|Judith]] and [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], which she and all of Haddonfield know about. Her father is unknown since her surname was never explained or elaborated in films where it came from when she appeared. She is put in the care of a foster family, the Carruthers, and later [[adoption|adopted]] after Laurie dies in a car crash. She suffers from nightmares about Michael and is bullied at school for being related to \"The Boogeyman\". On October 30, 1988, Michael is being transferred out of Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium back to Smith's Grove. While in the transfer ambulance, he recovers from his ten-year coma upon learning the existence of his niece. Accordingly, he kills the two medical attendants and the two drivers. While making his way back to his hometown, he also kills a mechanic and a waitress. In Haddonfield, while on the trail for Jamie, Michael kills the Carruthers' Golden Retriever Sundae, a worker at the power plant which causes a blackout of the entire town, the entire police force, the deputy, the police chief's daughter Kelly, Rachel's boyfriend Brady, and 4 men from a vigilante mob. Escaping from town, Jamie cowers in a pick-up truck as Rachel hits Michael head on, throwing him off the road and knocking him out. Despite Rachel's orders, Jamie goes over to him and holds his hand. The police tell Jamie to drop to the ground and shoot Michael many times, causing him to fall into an abandoned mine shaft, which then collapses on top of him. Later, back in her foster home, Jamie is possessed by Michael's spirit and attacks her foster mother. When screams are heard from upstairs, Dr. Loomis walks over to the staircase seeing Jamie poised at the top holding a pair of bloody scissors, similar to Michael when he killed his older sister Judith. Sheriff Ben Meeker (Beau Starr) restrains Loomis from shooting her, and both men, Mr. Carruthers, and Rachel watch in horror, realizing that Jamie is following in Michael's footsteps. ''[[Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers]]'' (1989), taking place a year later, has a severely traumatized Jamie housed in the Haddonfield Children's Clinic. She has now been rendered mute and suffers from nightmares and seizures, and being treated for attacking her foster mother under Michael's influence, though her foster mother survived. Early in the film, a brick, bearing a note reading, \"The evil child must die,\" is thrown through her window.  When Michael ([[Donald L. Shanks]]) awakens from a year-long coma, she exhibits signs of a [[Telepathy|telepathic]] link with her uncle, eventually regains the ability to speak, and has seizures whenever her uncle kills someone. Michael kills Rachel, four of Rachel's friends, two cops, and the Carruthers' new dog, a Doberman Pinscher named Max, while in pursuit of Jamie. Towards the end, Loomis takes Jamie to the old Myers house and successfully lures Michael into the house by having Jamie reenact her aunt Judith's final moments. Despite the doctor's pleas with Michael to fight his rage and seek redemption through a positive relationship with Jamie, Myers tracks down his niece in Judith Myers' deserted bedroom. Michael finds Jamie, but before he can kill her, she tries to appeal to her uncle's humanity. At Jamie's request, Michael takes off his mask. However, Jamie touches Michael's face, sending him into a fit of rage. Using Jamie as bait, Loomis catches Michael in a net, shoots him with tranquilizer darts, and beats him unconscious with a wooden beam. Michael is manacled and locked up in the local jail, awaiting transport to a maximum-security facility, where, Meeker says, he will remain \"until the day he dies,\" to which Jamie responds, \"He'll never die.\" After Jamie is escorted out to be taken home, a mysterious \"Man in Black\" arrives and attacks the police station. Jamie goes back inside to find that eight police officers have been gunned down, including Meeker, and that her uncle has escaped, prompting her to begin sobbing in terror. In ''[[Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers]]'' (1995), the Man in Black kidnaps Jamie immediately after the shoot-out and has kept her and Michael ([[George P. Wilbur]]) in captivity for the past six years. 15-year-old Jamie gives birth to a boy on the night of October 30, 1995. [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Loomis]] and Tommy Doyle ([[Paul Rudd]]), whom Laurie Strode was babysitting on Halloween 1978, attempt to rescue Jamie after hearing her plea for help on a local radio station. Michael kills Jamie by impaling her on a corn [[threshing machine|thresher]] and turning it on, disemboweling her. Before being killed, Jamie hides her [[infant]], who is found by Tommy. The Man in Black is revealed to be Loomis' former medical colleague [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters#Dr. Terence Wynn|Dr. Terence Wynn]] ([[Mitchell Ryan]]). He and most of his staff are revealed to be a [[Druid]] cult headquartered in the subterranean levels of the Smith's Grove Sanitarium, the place where Michael was committed after killing his sister Judith. They are responsible for Michael's actions, placing an ancient curse on him to kill his family to ward off sickness and death. By the end of the movie, it is implied that Dr. Wynn has been trying and failing to breed the ultimate evil using Michael's DNA and female patients of the sanitarium in [[in vitro fertilisation|in-vitro fertilization]] experiments; finally reaching a success with Jamie's baby after she had been tested on. In the original cut of the film, Jamie does not die at the beginning of the film, and instead survives a knife attack by Michael in the barn. She remains in a [[coma]] and is taken to the hospital, where Loomis and Wynn visit her. Later, an unseen person, later revealed to be Wynn, shoots the unconscious Jamie in the head with a silenced pistol.\n\nWhen screenwriter [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] first outlined ''[[Halloween H20: 20 Years Later]]'' (1998), he created the storyline in which Laurie Strode has faked her own death and taken on a new identity as a specific way of [[retroactive continuity|retconning]] the character's death in ''Halloween 4''. In Williamson's original treatment, there are scenes in which a Hillcrest student does a report on Michael Myers' killing spree, mentioning the death of Jamie, complete with flashbacks to 4-6 mentioned in the text. \"Keri\"/Laurie responds to hearing the student's report on the death of her daughter by going into a restroom and throwing up.<ref>[[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Williamson, Kevin]]. \"[http://soma.sbcc.edu/users/DaVega/FILMPRO_175/Filmpro_175_Film_Writing/TREATMENTS/treatmentexaple_4_halloween7.pdf Halloween 7 treatment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://soma.sbcc.edu/users/DaVega/FILMPRO_175/Filmpro_175_Film_Writing/TREATMENTS/treatmentexaple_4_halloween7.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }}\"</ref> In a controversial decision, director [[Steve Miner]] retconned the series with ''Halloween H20: 20 Years Later''. This installment retained Laurie's faked death from Williamson's treatment, revealing that she did so in order to avoid detection by her relentless brother. Under a new identity, Laurie has fled to Summer Glen, [[California]], along with her only son, John Tate ([[Josh Hartnett]]). However, to focus more on the Laurie Strode character, the events of parts 4, 5, and 6 are implicitly written out of the continuity, thus erasing the Jamie Lloyd character from the canon.\n\nEarly on, the script for ''[[Halloween (2018 film)|Halloween]]'' (2018) had Jamie appear alongside Laurie for the first time.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\".<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]],<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]], and Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> The next month, [[Joy Osmanski]] was cast as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]], [[Neil Hopkins]] was cast as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \u201cCrusher\u201d Crock / Sportsmaster]], and [[Nelson Lee]] was cast as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]], members of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In January 2019, [[Luke Wilson]] was cast as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Cameron Gellman joined the cast as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]] the next month,<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> along with [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]],<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Trae Romano as Mike Dugan, and Hunter Sansone in an undisclosed role rounding out the cast.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\nIn December 2018, the following members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were cast, all recurring roles: [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]],<ref name=\"McHale\" /> [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]],<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" /> Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]],<ref name=\"Stapf\" /> and [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In February 2019, Jake Austin Walker was cast in an undisclosed role and Meg Delacy was cast as Cindy Burman.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" /> In April 2019, Hina Khan was cast in an undisclosed role said to be a principal.<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had began by March 14, 2019,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> with [[Glen Winter]] directing the pilot.<ref name=\"Winter\" /> Filming occurs throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], including: [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Virginia\u2013Highland]], [[Duluth, Georgia|Duluth]], [[Lithia Springs, Georgia|Lithia Springs]], [[Dallas, Georgia|Dallas]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> [[Marietta Square]], [[West End, Atlanta|West End]], [[Westlake High School (Georgia)|Westlake High School]], the Atlanta Center for Medical Research,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Campbell Middle School, [[Paulding County, Georgia|Paulding County]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Arbor Place]] Mall, [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming3\" /> [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], and [[Douglas County High School (Douglasville, Georgia)|Douglas County High School]].<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming4\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn June 2019, [[Pinar Toprak]] revealed she would be composing for the series.<ref name=\"Toprak\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Stargirl'' is scheduled to begin airing on DC Universe on May 18, 2020.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series was originally intended to begin airing on May 11, 2020.<ref name=\"OriginalReleaseDate\" /> In November 2019, it was announced that [[The CW]] would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast.<ref name=\"The CW\" /> It will start airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nOn December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\" />\n\n==Arrowverse==\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}\nStargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" in January 2020.

In April 2020, Johns said, \"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that ''Stargirl'' is the best show it can possibly be.\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with [[Melissa Benoist]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title=Geoff Johns To Write & Produce \u2018Stargirl\u2019 Series For DC Universe \u2013 Comic-Con |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/geoff-johns-stargirl-tv-series-dc-universe-greg-berlanti-wbtv-comic-con-1202429776/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=July 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LegendsStargirl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/legends-tomorrow-legion-doom-season-913953|title=Comic-Con: ''Legends of Tomorrow'' to Tackle Legion of Doom Villain Team In Season 2|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bassinger\">{{cite web |last1=Boucher |first1=Geoff |title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Discovered: Warner Bros Takes Shine To Brec Bassinger As DC Universe Superhero |url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/stargirl-brec-bassinger-dc-universe-series-1202468446/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018 |date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Washington\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/11/02/stargirl-casts-anjelika-washington-in-undisclosed-dc-role/|title='Stargirl' Casts Anjelika Washington in Undisclosed DC Role|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=Comicbook.com|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/stargirl-yvette-monreal-christopher-james-baker-set-as-regulars-in-dc-universe-series-1202510976/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019: Yvette Monreal & Christopher James Baker Set As Regulars In DC Universe Series|last=Petski|first=Denise|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 29, 2018|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McHale\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/joel-mchale-starman-dc-universe-stargirl-exclusive-1203087415/|title=Joel McHale Cast as Starman in DC Universe\u2019s \u2018Stargirl\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 12, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ferrigno\">{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/12/13/stargirl-casts-hourman-lou-ferrigno-jr-dc-universe/|title=Stargirl Casts Lou Ferrigno Jr. as Hourman, Founding Member of JSA|last=Mitovitch|first=Matt Webb|work=[[TV Line]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Stapf\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvinsider.com/738208/dc-universe-stargirl-wildcat-brian-stapf/|title=DC Universe's 'Stargirl' Casts Brian Stapf as Wildcat|last=Holbrook|first=Damian|work=[[TV Insider]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/17/stargirl-henry-thomas-mid-nite-dc-universe/|title=DC Universe's Stargirl casts Haunting of Hill House star as the JSA's Dr. Mid-Nite|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 17, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/stargirl-casting-meet-three-members-of-injustice-society-1202524168/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Casting: Meet Three Members Of Injustice Society|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 20, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/stargirl-luke-wilson-dc-comics-geoff-johns-1202531355/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019: Luke Wilson Joins Cast Of DC Universe Series|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Winter\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/01/10/arrow-veteran-glen-winter-to-direct-dc-universes-stargirl-pilot/|title='Arrow' Veteran Glen Winter To Direct DC Universe's 'Stargirl' Pilot|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=Comicbook.com|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/stargirl-dc-universe-series-jake-austin-walker-and-meg-delacy-1202549066/|title='Stargirl': DC Universe Series Adds Jake Austin Walker and Meg DeLacy |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |date=February 4, 2019 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gellman\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/stargirl-casts-cameron-gellman-carmela-zumbado-you-1202561735/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Casts Cameron Gellman;

Two weeks prior to graduation, he dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]], upon realizing that he did not have enough credits to graduate.

During his time with Marander, Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening, watching television, and concentrating on art projects. Her insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write \"[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]\", which was featured on the Nirvana album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''.

After meeting Vail, Cobain vomited, as he was so completely overwhelmed with anxiety caused by his infatuation with her. This event inspired the lyric \"love you so much it makes me sick,\" which appears in the song \"[[Aneurysm (song)|Aneurysm]]\".<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|152}} While Cobain regarded Vail as his female counterpart, his relationship with her waned; he desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship, which Vail regarded as sexist within a [[countercultural]] punk rock community. Vail's lovers were described by her friend Alice Wheeler as \"fashion accessories.\"<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}} Cobain and Vail spent most of their time together as a couple discussing political and philosophical issues. In 1990, they collaborated on a musical project called Bathtub is Real, in which they both sang and played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track tape]] machine that belonged to Vail's father. In [[Everett True]]'s 2009 book ''Nirvana: The Biography'', Vail is quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|[Kurt] would play the songs he was writing, I would play the songs I was writing and we'd record them on my dad's four-track. Sometimes I'd sing on the songs he was writing and play drums on them ... He was really into the fact that I was creative and into music. I don't think he'd ever played music with a girl before.

Once, while he was discussing [[anarchism]] and punk rock with friend [[Kathleen Hanna]], another member of Bikini Kill, Hanna spray-painted \"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on Cobain's apartment wall. [[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|Teen Spirit]] was the name of a deodorant Vail wore. Cobain, unaware of the deodorant's existence, interpreted the slogan as having a revolutionary meaning, and it inspired the title of the Nirvana song \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]].\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Queenan|title=Was Smells Like Teen Spirit really named after a deodorant|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/19/popandrock.nirvana|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early musical projects ===\nOn his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar\u2014Kurt chose the guitar. Soon, he was trying to play [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[power ballad]], \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\". He also learned how to play \"[[Louie Louie]],\" [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", and [[the Cars]]' \"[[My Best Friend's Girl (song)|My Best Friend's Girl]]\", before he began working on his own songs.

While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met [[Krist Novoselic]], a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Cobain's earlier band, Fecal Matter.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />\n\n=== Nirvana ===\n[[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Cobain and Novoselic playing at the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards]]]]\n{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}\n<!-- Please don't significantly expand this section, it is intended to simply cover the basics of Cobain's involvement in Nirvana. The details about Nirvana's career are extensively discussed in [[Nirvana (band)]]. -->\n\nAfter months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|45}} Religion appeared to remain a significant muse to Cobain during this time, as he often used Christian related imagery in his work, and developed a budding interest in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy. The band name \"Nirvana\" was taken from the [[Nirvana|Buddhist concept]], which Cobain described as \"freedom from pain, suffering and the external world,\" a concept that he aligned with the [[punk rock]] ethos and [[Punk ideologies|ideology]].\n\nCobain was disenchanted after early touring, due to the band's inability to draw substantial crowds and the difficulty of sustaining themselves. During their first few years playing together, Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a rotating list of drummers. Eventually, the band settled on [[Chad Channing]], with whom Nirvana recorded the album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] in 1989. Cobain, however, became dissatisfied with Channing's style and subsequently fired him which made the band in need of a new drummer. They eventually hired [[Dave Grohl]] who helped the band record their 1991 major-label debut, ''Nevermind''. With ''Nevermind''{{'}}s lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] called \"[[grunge]]\". Since their debut, Nirvana has sold over 25&nbsp;million albums in the United States (U.S.) alone, and over 80&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|title=Top-Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html|title=Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> The success of ''Nevermind'' provided numerous Seattle bands, such as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]], access to wider audiences. As a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the U.S. during the early to middle 1990s. Nirvana was considered the \"flagship band of [[Generation X]],\" and Cobain found himself reluctantly anointed by the media as the generation's \"spokesman.\"<ref name=\"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana2\"/>\n\nCobain struggled to reconcile the massive success of Nirvana with his [[Underground rock|underground]] roots and vision. He also felt persecuted by the media, comparing himself to [[Frances Farmer]]. He began to harbor resentment against people who claimed to be fans of the band, yet refused to acknowledge, or misinterpreted, the band's social and political views. A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and homophobia, he was publicly proud that Nirvana had played at a [[gay rights]] benefit, supporting No-on-Nine, in Oregon in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portside.org/2014-01-07/king-outcast-teens-kurt-cobain-and-politics-nirvana|title=King of the Outcast Teens: Kurt Cobain and the Politics of Nirvana|last=Barrett|first=Dawson|date=January 6, 2014|publisher=Portside|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> The show was held in opposition to [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure Nine]], a ballot measure, that if passed, would have directed schools to teach that homosexuality was \"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hornet.com/stories/nirvana-gay-rights-1992-gop/|title=In 1992, Nirvana Fought an Anti-Gay Ballot Initiative (and Wanted to Burn Down GOP Headquarters)|publisher=Hornet|last=Villarreal|first=David|date=7 December 2017|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref> Cobain was a vocal supporter of the [[pro-choice]] movement and Nirvana was involved in [[L7 (band)|L7]]'s [[Rock for Choice]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Gold|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-29/entertainment/ca-68_1_pop-music-review|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Bands Get Together for Rock for Choice|date=September 29, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> He received [[death threat]]s from a small number of [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]] activists for participating in the pro-choice campaign, with one activist threatening to shoot Cobain as soon as he stepped on a stage.<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|253}}\n\n=== Collaboration with other artists ===\nIn 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American [[alternative rock]] band [[Screaming Trees]] formed a side project known as the Jury.

Nirvana occasionally played cover songs by these bands, including Led Zeppelin's \"[[Heartbreaker (Led Zeppelin song)|Heartbreaker]],\" \"[[Moby Dick (instrumental)|Moby Dick]]\" and \"[[Immigrant Song]],\" Black Sabbath's \"[[Hand of Doom (song)|Hand of Doom]],\" and Kiss' \"Do You Love Me?\" and wrote the ''[[Incesticide]]'' song \"Aero Zeppelin\" as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith. Recollecting touring with his band, Cobain stated, \u201cI used to take a nap in the van and listen to Queen. Over and over again and drain the battery on the van.

His first punk rock album was ''[[Sandinista!]]'' by [[The Clash]],<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|169}} but he became a bigger fan of a fellow 1970s British punk band the [[Sex Pistols]], describing them as \"one million times more important than the Clash\" in his journals.<ref name=\"Cobain, Kurt 2002\"/> He was introduced to 1980s American hardcore bands like [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], [[Bad Brains]], [[Millions of Dead Cops]] and [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] by [[Buzz Osborne]], lead singer and guitarist of the [[Melvins]] and fellow Aberdeen native.

In a 1992 interview with ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Cobain said that hearing their 1988 debut album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'', \"convinced him to abandon his more Black Flag-influenced songwriting in favor of the [[Iggy Pop]]/Aerosmith\u2013type songwriting that appeared on ''Nevermind''.<ref>Cobain, Kurt. \"Kurt Cobain of Nirvana Talks About the Records That Changed His Life.

I have to admit it. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily that I should have been in that band\u2014or at least a Pixies cover band.

It was under recommendation from Sonic Youth's [[Kim Gordon]] that Nirvana signed to [[DGC Records|DGC]] in 1990,<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|162}} and both bands did a two-week tour of Europe in the summer of 1991, as documented in the 1992 documentary, ''[[1991: The Year Punk Broke]]''. In 1993, Cobain said of R.E.M.: \"If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what they've written... I don't know how that band does what they do. God, they're the greatest. They've dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music\".<ref name=\"pixies\"/>\n\nAfter attaining mainstream success, Cobain became a devoted champion of lesser known [[indie rock|indie]] bands, covering songs by [[The Vaselines]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Wipers]] and [[Fang (band)|Fang]] onstage and/or in the studio, wearing [[Daniel Johnston]] [[T-shirts]] during photo shoots, having the [[K Records]] logo tattooed on his forearm, and enlisting bands like [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Shonen Knife]], [[Chokebore]] and [[Half Japanese]] along for the ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour in late 1993 and early 1994. Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him: ex-[[Germs (band)|Germs]] guitarist [[Pat Smear]] joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvana's 1993 ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' appearance to perform three songs from their second album, ''[[Meat Puppets II]]''.\n\nNirvana's ''Unplugged'' set also included renditions of \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold the World]],\" by British rock musician [[David Bowie]], and the American folk song, \"[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]],\" as adapted by the American folk musician [[Lead Belly]]. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer, and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author [[William S. Burroughs]]. \"I remember [Burroughs] saying in an interview, 'These new rock'n'roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul, like Leadbelly,'\" Cobain said. \"I'd never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records, and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music.

The book explored Cobain's drug addiction, as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobain's death, Azerrad republished the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobain's life. The book is notable, as it involved the band members themselves, who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrad's taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain, titled ''[[Kurt Cobain: About a Son]]''. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana, it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.\n\nJournalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] published their investigation of any possible conspiracy surrounding Cobain's death in their 1999 book''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?''. Halperin and Wallace argued that, while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened.<ref>Halperin & Wallace, p. 202</ref> A notable element of the book included the journalists' discussions with Tom Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.\n\nIn 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain, titled ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]''. For the book, Cross conducted over 400 interviews, and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobain's journals, lyrics, and diaries.<ref name=\"Heavierthan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperionbooks.com/book/heavier-than-heaven-a-biography-of-kurt-cobain/|title=Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain|publisher=HyperionBooks.com|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> Cross' biography was met with criticism, including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.<ref>''Nirvana: the True Story'' by [[Everett True]]</ref> Friend [[Everett True]], who derided the book as being inaccurate, omissive, and highly biased; he said ''Heavier than Heaven'' was \"the Courtney-sanctioned version of history\"<ref name=\"SmellsLike2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=184892|title=Smells Like Everett True \u2013 Books \u2013 The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper|publisher=Thestranger.com|date=March 27, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}</ref> or, alternatively, Cross's \"Oh, I think I need to find the new [[Bruce Springsteen]] now\" Kurt Cobain book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|title=MAGNET Interview: Everett True|work=magnetmagazine.com|author=Matthew Fritch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|archivedate=June 17, 2003|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> However, beyond the criticism, the book contained details about Cobain and Nirvana's career that would have otherwise been unnoted.

The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover; the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically (although Cobain generally did not date them). The journal pages are reproduced in color, and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book, released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals, Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road, made lists of what music he was enjoying, and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release, reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words, but were disturbed by what was viewed as an [[Invasion of privacy|invasion of his privacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |title=Nirvana releases a hit and miss|work=Notre Dame Observer|date=November 19, 2002|author=David Hartwig|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 8, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307110632/http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[ECW Press]] released a book titled ''Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music''.

He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love; Love's father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors|Mentors]] bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke]], who claimed Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hoke's last interview, as he died days later, reportedly hit by a train. However, Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying:\n\n{{quote|I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun.

Later, his father enlisted him in a [[Little League Baseball]] team, where Cobain would intentionally [[strike out]] to avoid playing.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|20\u201325}} Cobain befriended a [[gay]] student at school and suffered bullying from peers who concluded that he was gay. In an interview, he said that he liked being associated with a gay identity because he did not like people, and when they thought he was gay they left him alone. He stated, \"I started being really proud of the fact that I was gay even though I wasn't.\" His friend tried to kiss him and Cobain backed away, explaining to his friend that he was not gay, but remained friends with him. In a 1993 interview with ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Cobain claimed that he was \"gay in spirit\" and \"probably could be [[Bisexuality|bisexual]].\" He also stated that he used to spray paint \"God Is Gay\" on pickup trucks in the Aberdeen area.

He then drew an image of then-President [[Ronald Reagan]] that was seen as \"unflattering\".<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|41}} As attested to by several of Cobain's classmates and family members, the first concert he attended was [[Sammy Hagar]] and [[Quarterflash]], held at the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]] in 1983.<ref name=\"cross-2008\" /><ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|44}} Cobain, however, claimed that the first concert he attended was the [[Melvins]], and he wrote prolifically in his journals of the experience.<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|45}} As a teenager living in [[Montesano, Washington]], Cobain eventually found escape through the thriving [[Pacific Northwest]] [[Punk rock|punk]] scene, going to punk rock shows in Seattle.\n\nDuring his second year in high school, Cobain began living with his mother in Aberdeen. Two weeks prior to graduation, he dropped out of [[Aberdeen High School (Washington)|Aberdeen High School]], upon realizing that he did not have enough credits to graduate. His mother gave him a choice: find employment or leave. After one week, Cobain found his clothes and other belongings packed away in boxes.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|35}} Feeling banished from his own mother's home, Cobain stayed with friends, occasionally sneaking back into his mother's basement.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|37}} Cobain also claimed that, during periods of homelessness, he lived under a bridge over the [[Wishkah River]],<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|37}} an experience that inspired the song \"[[Something in the Way]]\".

The couple had a close relationship, but one that was often strained with financial difficulties and Cobain's absence when touring. Marander supported the couple by working at the cafeteria of the [[Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport]], often stealing food. During his time with Marander, Cobain spent most of his time sleeping into the late evening, watching television, and concentrating on art projects. Her insistence that he get a job caused arguments that influenced Cobain to write \"[[About a Girl (Nirvana song)|About a Girl]]\", which was featured on the Nirvana album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]''. Marander is credited with having taken the cover photo for the album. She did not become aware that Cobain wrote \"About a Girl\" about her until years after his death. <ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|88\u201393}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|116\u2013117}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|122}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|134\u2013136}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|143}}<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}}\n\nSoon after his separation from Marander, Cobain began dating [[Tobi Vail]], an influential [[punk zine]]ster of the [[riot grrrl]] band [[Bikini Kill]] who embraced the [[DIY]] ethos. After meeting Vail, Cobain vomited, as he was so completely overwhelmed with anxiety caused by his infatuation with her. This event inspired the lyric \"love you so much it makes me sick,\" which appears in the song \"[[Aneurysm (song)|Aneurysm]]\".<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|152}} While Cobain regarded Vail as his female counterpart, his relationship with her waned; he desired the maternal comfort of a traditional relationship, which Vail regarded as sexist within a [[countercultural]] punk rock community. Vail's lovers were described by her friend Alice Wheeler as \"fashion accessories.\"<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|153}} Cobain and Vail spent most of their time together as a couple discussing political and philosophical issues. In 1990, they collaborated on a musical project called Bathtub is Real, in which they both sang and played guitar and drums. They recorded their songs on a [[Stereo-Pak|four-track tape]] machine that belonged to Vail's father. In [[Everett True]]'s 2009 book ''Nirvana: The Biography'', Vail is quoted as saying:\n\n{{quote|[Kurt] would play the songs he was writing, I would play the songs I was writing and we'd record them on my dad's four-track.

Once, while he was discussing [[anarchism]] and punk rock with friend [[Kathleen Hanna]], another member of Bikini Kill, Hanna spray-painted \"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on Cobain's apartment wall. [[Teen Spirit (deodorant)|Teen Spirit]] was the name of a deodorant Vail wore. Cobain, unaware of the deodorant's existence, interpreted the slogan as having a revolutionary meaning, and it inspired the title of the Nirvana song \"[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]].\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Joe|last=Queenan|title=Was Smells Like Teen Spirit really named after a deodorant|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/19/popandrock.nirvana|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 11, 2015|date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early musical projects ===\nOn his 14th birthday on February 20, 1981, Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar\u2014Kurt chose the guitar. Soon, he was trying to play [[Led Zeppelin]]'s [[power ballad]], \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\". He also learned how to play \"[[Louie Louie]],\" [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[Another One Bites the Dust]]\", and [[the Cars]]' \"[[My Best Friend's Girl (song)|My Best Friend's Girl]]\", before he began working on his own songs.

While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met [[Krist Novoselic]], a fellow devotee of punk rock. Novoselic's mother owned a hair salon, and the pair occasionally practiced in the upstairs room of the salon. A few years later, Cobain tried to convince Novoselic to form a band with him by lending him a copy of a home demo recorded by Cobain's earlier band, Fecal Matter.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />\n\n=== Nirvana ===\n[[File:Nirvana around 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Cobain and Novoselic playing at the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards]]]]\n{{Main|Nirvana (band)}}\n<!-- Please don't significantly expand this section, it is intended to simply cover the basics of Cobain's involvement in Nirvana. The details about Nirvana's career are extensively discussed in [[Nirvana (band)]]. -->\n\nAfter months of asking, Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.<ref name=\"azerrad\" />{{rp|45}} Religion appeared to remain a significant muse to Cobain during this time, as he often used Christian related imagery in his work, and developed a budding interest in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy. The band name \"Nirvana\" was taken from the [[Nirvana|Buddhist concept]], which Cobain described as \"freedom from pain, suffering and the external world,\" a concept that he aligned with the [[punk rock]] ethos and [[Punk ideologies|ideology]].\n\nCobain was disenchanted after early touring, due to the band's inability to draw substantial crowds and the difficulty of sustaining themselves. During their first few years playing together, Novoselic and Cobain were hosts to a rotating list of drummers. Eventually, the band settled on [[Chad Channing]], with whom Nirvana recorded the album ''[[Bleach (Nirvana album)|Bleach]]'', released on [[Sub Pop|Sub Pop Records]] in 1989. Cobain, however, became dissatisfied with Channing's style and subsequently fired him which made the band in need of a new drummer. They eventually hired [[Dave Grohl]] who helped the band record their 1991 major-label debut, ''Nevermind''. With ''Nevermind''{{'}}s lead single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" Nirvana quickly entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] called \"[[grunge]]\". Since their debut, Nirvana has sold over 25&nbsp;million albums in the United States (U.S.) alone, and over 80&nbsp;million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php?content_selector=top-selling-artists|title=Top-Selling Artists|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA)|accessdate=September 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2009/03/21/nirvana-vinyl-releases.html|title=Nirvana catalogue to be released on vinyl|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 21, 2009|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}</ref> The success of ''Nevermind'' provided numerous Seattle bands, such as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Soundgarden]], access to wider audiences. As a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the U.S. during the early to middle 1990s. Nirvana was considered the \"flagship band of [[Generation X]],\" and Cobain found himself reluctantly anointed by the media as the generation's \"spokesman.\"<ref name=\"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana2\"/>\n\nCobain struggled to reconcile the massive success of Nirvana with his [[Underground rock|underground]] roots and vision. He also felt persecuted by the media, comparing himself to [[Frances Farmer]]. He began to harbor resentment against people who claimed to be fans of the band, yet refused to acknowledge, or misinterpreted, the band's social and political views. A vocal opponent of sexism, racism and homophobia, he was publicly proud that Nirvana had played at a [[gay rights]] benefit, supporting No-on-Nine, in Oregon in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portside.org/2014-01-07/king-outcast-teens-kurt-cobain-and-politics-nirvana|title=King of the Outcast Teens: Kurt Cobain and the Politics of Nirvana|last=Barrett|first=Dawson|date=January 6, 2014|publisher=Portside|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> The show was held in opposition to [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (1992)|Ballot Measure Nine]], a ballot measure, that if passed, would have directed schools to teach that homosexuality was \"abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse\u201d.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hornet.com/stories/nirvana-gay-rights-1992-gop/|title=In 1992, Nirvana Fought an Anti-Gay Ballot Initiative (and Wanted to Burn Down GOP Headquarters)|publisher=Hornet|last=Villarreal|first=David|date=7 December 2017|accessdate=7 August 2018}}</ref> Cobain was a vocal supporter of the [[pro-choice]] movement and Nirvana was involved in [[L7 (band)|L7]]'s [[Rock for Choice]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jonathan|last=Gold|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-09-29/entertainment/ca-68_1_pop-music-review|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Bands Get Together for Rock for Choice|date=September 29, 1992|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}</ref> He received [[death threat]]s from a small number of [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]] activists for participating in the pro-choice campaign, with one activist threatening to shoot Cobain as soon as he stepped on a stage.<ref name=\"cross-2001\" />{{rp|253}}\n\n=== Collaboration with other artists ===\nIn 1989, members of Nirvana and fellow American [[alternative rock]] band [[Screaming Trees]] formed a side project known as the Jury.

Cobain even invited his favorite musicians to perform with him: ex-[[Germs (band)|Germs]] guitarist [[Pat Smear]] joined the band in 1993, and the Meat Puppets appeared onstage during Nirvana's 1993 ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' appearance to perform three songs from their second album, ''[[Meat Puppets II]]''.\n\nNirvana's ''Unplugged'' set also included renditions of \"[[The Man Who Sold the World (song)|The Man Who Sold the World]],\" by British rock musician [[David Bowie]], and the American folk song, \"[[In the Pines|Where Did You Sleep Last Night]],\" as adapted by the American folk musician [[Lead Belly]]. Cobain introduced the latter by calling Lead Belly his favorite performer, and in a 1993 interview revealed he had been introduced to him from reading the American author [[William S. Burroughs]]. \"I remember [Burroughs] saying in an interview, 'These new rock'n'roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to something with real soul, like Leadbelly,'\" Cobain said. \"I'd never heard about Leadbelly before so I bought a couple of records, and now he turns out to be my absolute favorite of all time in music.

The book explored Cobain's drug addiction, as well as the countless controversies surrounding the band. After Cobain's death, Azerrad republished the book to include a final chapter discussing the last year of Cobain's life. The book is notable, as it involved the band members themselves, who provided interviews and personal information to Azerrad specifically for the book. In 2006, Azerrad's taped conversations with Cobain were transformed into a documentary about Cobain, titled ''[[Kurt Cobain: About a Son]]''. Though this film does not feature any music by Nirvana, it has songs by the artists that inspired Cobain.\n\nJournalists [[Ian Halperin]] and [[Max Wallace]] published their investigation of any possible conspiracy surrounding Cobain's death in their 1999 book''Who Killed Kurt Cobain?''. Halperin and Wallace argued that, while there was not enough evidence to prove a conspiracy, there was more than enough to demand that the case be reopened.<ref>Halperin & Wallace, p. 202</ref> A notable element of the book included the journalists' discussions with Tom Grant, who had taped nearly every conversation that he had undertaken while he was in Love's employ. Over the next several years, Halperin and Wallace collaborated with Grant to write a second book, 2004's ''[[Love and Death: The Murder of Kurt Cobain]]''.\n\nIn 2001, writer Charles R. Cross published a biography of Cobain, titled ''[[Heavier Than Heaven]]''. For the book, Cross conducted over 400 interviews, and was given access by Courtney Love to Cobain's journals, lyrics, and diaries.<ref name=\"Heavierthan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperionbooks.com/book/heavier-than-heaven-a-biography-of-kurt-cobain/|title=Heavier than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain|publisher=HyperionBooks.com|accessdate=July 26, 2009}}</ref> Cross' biography was met with criticism, including allegations of Cross accepting secondhand (and incorrect) information as fact.<ref>''Nirvana: the True Story'' by [[Everett True]]</ref> Friend [[Everett True]], who derided the book as being inaccurate, omissive, and highly biased; he said ''Heavier than Heaven'' was \"the Courtney-sanctioned version of history\"<ref name=\"SmellsLike2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/Content?oid=184892|title=Smells Like Everett True \u2013 Books \u2013 The Stranger, Seattle's Only Newspaper|publisher=Thestranger.com|date=March 27, 2007|accessdate=April 8, 2012}}</ref> or, alternatively, Cross's \"Oh, I think I need to find the new [[Bruce Springsteen]] now\" Kurt Cobain book.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|title=MAGNET Interview: Everett True|work=magnetmagazine.com|author=Matthew Fritch|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030617162627/http://magnetmagazine.com/interviews/true.html|archivedate=June 17, 2003|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref> However, beyond the criticism, the book contained details about Cobain and Nirvana's career that would have otherwise been unnoted.

The book fills 280 pages with a simple black cover; the pages are arranged somewhat chronologically (although Cobain generally did not date them). The journal pages are reproduced in color, and there is a section added at the back with explanations and transcripts of some of the less legible pages. The writings begin in the late 1980s and were continued until his death. A paperback version of the book, released in 2003, included a handful of writings that were not offered in the initial release. In the journals, Cobain talked about the ups and downs of life on the road, made lists of what music he was enjoying, and often scribbled down lyric ideas for future reference. Upon its release, reviewers and fans were conflicted about the collection. Many were elated to be able to learn more about Cobain and read his inner thoughts in his own words, but were disturbed by what was viewed as an [[Invasion of privacy|invasion of his privacy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |title=Nirvana releases a hit and miss|work=Notre Dame Observer|date=November 19, 2002|author=David Hartwig|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 8, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307110632/http://www.nd.edu/~observer/11192002/Scene/0.html |archivedate=March 7, 2004 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, [[ECW Press]] released a book titled ''Grunge is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music''.

He took a film crew to visit a number of people associated with Cobain and Love; Love's father, Cobain's aunt, and one of the couple's former nannies. Broomfield also spoke to [[The Mentors|Mentors]] bandleader [[Eldon Hoke|Eldon \"El Duce\" Hoke]], who claimed Love offered him $50,000 to kill Cobain. Although Hoke claimed he knew who killed Cobain, he failed to mention a name, and offered no evidence to support his assertion. Broomfield inadvertently captured Hoke's last interview, as he died days later, reportedly hit by a train. However, Broomfield felt he had not uncovered enough evidence to conclude the existence of a conspiracy. In a 1998 interview, Broomfield summed it up by saying:\n\n{{quote|I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun.

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p. 146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p. 25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p. 190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp. 164\u201365.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

For example, [[Pliny the Younger]] postulates that Christians are not Jews since they do not pay the tax, in his letters to [[Trajan]].<ref>Wylen, pp. 190\u201392.</ref><ref>Dunn, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>\n\n===Later rejection of Jewish Christianity===\nJewish Christians constituted a separate community from the [[Pauline Christianity|Pauline Christians]] but maintained a similar faith, differing only in practice. In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u201342.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership. They were considered by Gentile Christians to have unorthodox beliefs, particularly in relation to their views of Christ and Gentile converts. After the condemnation of the Nazarenes, ''Ebionite'' was often used as a general pejorative for all related \"heresies\".<ref name=\"Tabor 1998\">Tabor (1998).</ref><ref>Esler (2004), pp. 157\u201359.</ref>\n\nThere was a post-Nicene \"double rejection\" of the Jewish Christians by both Gentile Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. The true end of ancient Jewish Christianity occurred only in the 5th century.{{sfn|Dunn|1991}} Gentile Christianity became the dominant strand of orthodoxy and imposed itself on the previously Jewish Christian sanctuaries, taking full control of those houses of worship by the end of the 5th century.<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\"/>{{refn|group=note|Jewish Virtual Library: \"A major difficulty in tracing the growth of Christianity from its beginnings as a [[Jewish messianism|Jewish messianic sect]], and its relations to the various other normative-Jewish, sectarian-Jewish, and Christian-Jewish groups is presented by the fact that what ultimately became normative Christianity was originally but one among various contending Christian trends. Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

Much of the original church liturgical services functioned as a means of learning [[Christian theology]]. A final uniformity of liturgical services may have become solidified after the church established a [[Biblical canon]], possibly based on the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] and [[Clementine literature]]. [[Pope Clement I|Clement]] (d. 99) writes that [[liturgy|liturgies]] are \"to be celebrated, and not carelessly nor in disorder\" but the final uniformity of liturgical services only came later, though the ''[[Liturgy of St James]]'' is traditionally associated with James the Just.<ref>The traditional title is: [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.xii.ii.html ''The Divine Liturgy of James the Holy Apostle and Brother of the Lord''];  [[Ante-Nicene Fathers (book)|Ante-Nicene Fathers]] by [[Philip Schaff]] in the public domain</ref>\n\nBooks not accepted by Pauline Christianity are termed [[biblical apocrypha]], though the exact list varies from denomination to denomination.\n\n===Old Testament===\n{{Main|Development of the Old Testament canon}}\n\nThe [[Biblical canon]] began with the Jewish [[Scriptures]].

Even though it is commonly thought that Paul established a Gentile church, it took centuries for a complete break to manifest. Growing tensions led to a starker separation that was virtually complete by the time Jewish Christians refused to join in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Khokba Jewish revolt of 132]].<ref>Davidson, p.146</ref> Certain events are perceived as pivotal in the growing rift between Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] and the consequent dispersion of Jews and Jewish Christians from the city (after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]) ended any pre-eminence of the Jewish-Christian leadership in Jerusalem. Early Christianity grew further apart from Judaism to establish itself as a predominantly Gentile religion, and [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]] became the first Gentile Christian community with stature.<ref>Franzen, p.25</ref>\n\nThe hypothetical [[Council of Jamnia]] c. 85 is often stated to have condemned all who claimed the Messiah had already come, and Christianity in particular, excluding them from attending synagogue.<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

It is probable that the condemnation of Jamnia included many groups, of which the Christians were but one, and did not necessarily mean excommunication. That some of the later church fathers only recommended against [[synagogue]] attendance makes it improbable that an anti-Christian prayer was a common part of the synagogue liturgy. Jewish Christians continued to worship in synagogues for centuries.<ref>Wylen (1995), p.190.</ref><ref>Wright, pp.164-165.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1st century, Judaism was a legal religion with the protection of [[Roman law]], worked out in compromise with the Roman state over two centuries (see [[Anti-Judaism#Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire|Anti-Judaism in the Roman Empire]] for details). In contrast, Christianity was not legalized until the 313 [[Edict of Milan]]. Observant Jews had special rights, including the privilege of abstaining from civic pagan rites. Christians were initially identified with the Jewish religion by the Romans, but as they became more distinct, Christianity became a problem for Roman rulers. Around the year 98, the emperor [[Nerva]] decreed that Christians did not have to pay the [[Fiscus Iudaicus|annual tax upon the Jews]], effectively recognizing them as distinct from [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. This opened the way to Christians being persecuted for disobedience to the emperor, as they refused to worship the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|state pantheon]].<ref name=\"Wylen 1995.

In Christian circles, ''[[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarene]]'' later came to be used as a label for those faithful to Jewish law, in particular for a certain sect. These Jewish Christians, originally the central group in Christianity, generally holding the same beliefs except in their adherence to Jewish law, were not deemed heretical until the dominance of [[orthodoxy]] in the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]].<ref name=\"Dauphin 1993. pp. 235, 240\u2013242\">Dauphin (1993). pp. 235, 240\u2013242.</ref> The [[Ebionites]] may have been a splinter group of Nazarenes, with disagreements over Christology and leadership.

Once the \"gentile Christian\" trend won out, and the [[Pauline theology|teaching]] of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] became accepted as expressing the doctrine of the Church, the Jewish Christian groups were pushed to the margin and ultimately excluded as heretical. Being rejected both by normative Judaism and the Church, they ultimately disappeared. Nevertheless, several Jewish Christian sects (such as the [[Nazarene (sect)|Nazarenes]], [[Ebionites]], [[Elchasaites]], and others) existed for some time, and a few of them seem to have endured for several centuries. Some sects saw in Jesus mainly a [[Prophet#Judaism|prophet]] and not the \"Christ,\" others seem to have believed in him as the Messiah, but did not draw the [[Christology|christological]] and other conclusions that subsequently became fundamental in the teaching of the Church (the divinity of the Christ, [[Trinity|trinitarian conception of the Godhead]], [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|abrogation of the Law]]).

The Greek and Roman ethnic influence was negligible in comparison with that of the Semitic peoples of Arabia and Mesopotamia\u2014Aramaeans, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and Canaanites.\"</ref> Ancient Syria of the first millennium BC was dominated by the Aramaeans;{{sfn|Joseph|2000|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltnzDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 30]}} they originated in the Northern Levant as a continuum of the Bronze Age populations of Syria.{{sfn|Novak|2016|p= 123}} The Seleucids ruled the Syrians as a conquered nation; Syrians were not assimilated into Greek communities, and many local peasants were exploited financially as they had to pay rent for Greek landlords. Outside Greek [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|colonies]], the Syrians lived in districts governed by local temples that did not use the Greek civic system of [[Polis|poleis]] and colonies.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|p= 7}} The situation changed after the Roman conquest in 64 BC; Syrians obtained the citizenship of Greek poleis, and the line separating between the colonists and the colonized blurred. The idioms Syrian and Greek were used by Rome to denote civic societies instead of separate ethnic groups.{{sfn|Andrade|2013|p= 8}}\n\nThe Aramaeans assimilated the earlier populations through their language; combined with the common religion, [[Christianity]], most of the inhabitants turned into Syrians (Aramaeans). Islam and the Arabic language had a similar effect where the Aramaeans themselves became Arabs regardless of their ethnic origin following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]].{{sfn|Joseph|2000|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltnzDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 30]}}\n\n===Arabization===\nOn the eve of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquest of the Levant, 634 AD, Syria's population mainly spoke Aramaic; Greek was the official language of administration. [[Arabization#The Fertile Crescent|Arabization]] and [[Islamization]] of Syria began in the 7th century, and it took several centuries for Islam, the Arab identity, and language to spread;{{sfn|al-Hassan|2001|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=FUPnSxbUREgC&pg=PA59 59]}} the Arabs of the Caliphate did not attempt to spread their language or religion in the early periods of the conquest, and formed an isolated aristocracy.{{sfn|Schulze|2010|p=19}} The Arabs accommodated many new tribes in isolated areas to avoid conflict with the locals; caliph [[Uthman]] ordered his governor, [[Muawiyah I]], to settle the new tribes away from the original population.{{sfn|Kennedy|1992|p= 292}} Syrians who belonged to [[Monophysitism|Monophysitic]] denominations welcomed the Arabs as liberators.{{sfn|Barker|1966|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=LiJljEXvwAoC&pg=PA244 244]}}\n\nThe [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] in the eighth and ninth century sought to integrate the peoples under their authority, and the arabization of the administration was one of the tools.{{sfn|Braida|2012|p= 183}} Arabization gained momentum with the increasing numbers of Muslim converts;{{sfn|al-Hassan|2001|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=FUPnSxbUREgC&pg=PA59 59]}} the ascendancy of Arabic as the formal language of the state prompted the cultural and linguistic assimilation of Syrian converts.{{sfn|Peters|2003|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=HYJ2c9E9IM8C&pg=PA191 191]}} Those who remained [[Christianity in Syria|Christian]] also became arabized;{{sfn|Braida|2012|p= 183}} it was probably during the Abbasid period in the ninth century that Christians adopted Arabic as their first language; the first translation of the gospels into Arabic took place in this century.{{sfn|Braida|2012|p= 182}} Many historians, such as [[Claude Cahen]] and Bernard Hamilton, proposed that the arabization of Christians was completed before the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Ellenblum|2006|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=oiYgyRyL97oC&pg=PA53 53]}} By the thirteenth century, Arabic language achieved dominance in the region and its speakers became Arabs.{{sfn|al-Hassan|2001|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=FUPnSxbUREgC&pg=PA59 59]}}\n\nThose who were able to avoid losing the Aramaic language are divided between two groups:\n[[File:Garshuni-in-Serto.gif|350 px|thumb|Garshuni sample]]\n*The [[Eastern Aramaic languages|Eastern Aramaic]] [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-speaking group, followers of the [[West Syrian Rite|Western-rite]] [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syrian Catholic Church]]; they kept the pre-Islamic [[Terms for Syriac Christians#Syriac identity|Syrian (Syriac)]] identity throughout the ages, asserting their culture in face of the Arabic language dominance. Linguists, such as [[Carl Brockelmann]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Lenormant]], suggested that the rise of the [[Garshuni]] writing (using [[Syriac alphabet]] to write Arabic) was an attempt by the Syriac Orthodox to assert their identity.{{sfn|Braida|2012|pp= 185, 186}} Syriac is still the liturgical language for most of the different Syriac churches in Syria.{{sfn|Brock|2010|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=XzOMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA13 13]}} The Syriac Orthodox Church was known as the Syrian Orthodox Church until 2000, when the holy synod decided to rename it to avoid any nationalistic connotations; the Catholic Church still have \"Syrian\" in its official name.{{sfn|al-Bagdadi|2008|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=lZUBZlth2qgC&pg=PA280 280]}}\n*The [[Western Neo-Aramaic]]-speaking group, that is, the inhabitants of [[Al-Sarkha (Bakhah)|Bakh'a]], [[Jubb'adin]] and [[Ma'loula]].

Bakh'a is steadily losing its dialect; by 1971, people aged younger than 40 could no longer use the Aramaic language properly, although they could understand it.
