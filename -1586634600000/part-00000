After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra's camp. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma.

After getting exceptional hospitality in the ashram, he came to know about the divine cow Nandini. When a famine struck his kingdom he asks his counsel to get Nandini cow from [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]], which the later refuses.\n|-\n|3\n|Angry King Vishwarath reaches the ashram and tries to get the cow forcefully but failed. The humiliated king decides to gain divine power by doing [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapasya]] and abdicates the throne for his son.\n|-\n|4\n|Vishwarath got the boon of various divine weapons from [[Brahma|Lord Brahma]]. He again reaches [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s [[ashram]] to capture Nandini but fails. He vows to gain more power by doing great penance to become a [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishi]].\n|-\n|5\n|Ayodhya King Sathyavrata anoints his son Harishchandra as the new King and decides to ascend heaven with his mortal body. However, his unnatural wishes got refuted by [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]. He tried to lure [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]]'s son Satya to help him achieve his desires. An angry Satya curses Sathyavrata and makes him [[Trishanku]].\n|-\n|6\n|Vishwarath after severe penance and tapasya gained more powers and blessing of Mother Gayatri, Vishwarath the warrior became Vishwamitra the sage.\n|-\n|7\n|A dejected [[Trishanku]] approaches Vishwamitra to achieve his desires. After knowing that [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] refused his wishes, Vishwamitra promises him the impossible. But his [[yajna]] got rejected by Indra and other gods.\n|-\n|8\n|Vishwamitra begins creating alternate heaven for Trishanku when gods dismiss him from Indra's heaven.\n|-\n|9\n|[[B\u1e5bhaspati]] (along with [[Narada]] ) tries to persuade Vishwamitra to abandon creation new heaven for Trishanku which he agrees. However, Narada later instigates him reminding the promise he made to Trishanku. Vishwamitra begins more penance to gain uninterrupted access to heaven. Knowing this Indra and other gods (on the advice of Brhaspati) decide to disrupt his [[tapasya]]. They create a celestial Mahashakti after uniting their powers. But he failed and Vishwamitra killed him with his divine powers.\n|-\n|10\n|[[Indra]] decides to disrupt Vishwamitra's penance by sending [[apsara]] Rambha to seduce him. But an angry Vishwamitra curses her and turned her into a rock. She regretted her actions and asked for forgiveness. He gave her the boon that in future she will be liberated by a Maharishi. After failing repeatedly, Indra decides to disrupt his tapasya himself and went to Vishwamitra disguising as a hungry brahmin. But Vishwamitra recognized him easily and still gave his divine food gained from penance. He embarrasses Indra for his malevolent deeds. A dejected and humiliated Indra leaves for heaven.\n|-\n|11\n|Upon advice of Brhaspati, Indra summons apsara [[Menaka|Meneka]] to seduce Vishwamitra. A reluctant Menaka agrees for the task. She decides to take help from [[Rati]] and [[Kamadeva|Kamadev]].\n|-\n|12\n|After severe attempts Menaka successfully gained the attention of Vishwamitra and made him fell in love with her. \n|-\n|13\n|Both of them got married and thus Indra task finally got fulfilled. He then asks Menaka to return back to heaven but Menaka refuses as she's in love with Vishwamitra too. Indra orders her to return as it'll be unnatural for a celestial being to spend time on earth. A year later Menaka gave birth to a daughter. Narada reminds Indra that Menaka hasn't returned to heaven. \n|-\n|14\n|Menaka finally confesses to Vishwamitra that she was sent on a mission by Indra and now as her task is complete she had to return. An angry and disheartened Vishwamitra abandons Menaka and his daughter and sets out to fulfill his vow to become a Maharishi. Menaka also ascended to heaven leaving their daughter behind. [[Rishi]] [[Kanva]] and his wife Gautami found the girl in the forest and adopted her. As a baby, she was surrounded by Shakunta birds ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924, \u015bakunta). Therefore, he named her Shakuntala (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u0941\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0932\u093e), meaning Shakunta-protected.\n|-\n|15\n|King [[Dushyanta]] arrives in Rishi Kanva's ashram and fell in love with Shakuntala.\n|-\n|16\n|Shakuntala and Dushyant's love blossoms.\n|-\n|17\n|Dushyant proposes Shakuntala for marriage and they have a [[gandharva]] marriage. Having to leave after some time, Dushyant gives Shakuntala a royal ring as a sign of their love, promising her that he will come to her. One day, sage [[Durvasa]] visits the hermitage, but Shakuntala, who is too absorbed in her love for Dushyant, forgets to serve him food. In a fit of anger, sage Durvasa curses her, saying that the person she is thinking about will forget her.\n|-\n|18\n|Shocked friends of Shakuntala begs for forgiveness and the sage, after recollecting his calm, assures her that the person will remember her again when she shows some proof of their acquaintance. Her friends decide not to tell her anything about the curse. Shakuntala got pregnant and Rishi Kanva decides to send her to Dushyanta. \n|-\n|19\n|So, Shakuntala sets off to the capital, [[Hastinapur]], to remind Dushyant of their past love. Dushyanta does not recollect Shakuntala and asks for proof but an accident occurs by which a fish consumes the royal ring, leaving Shakuntala with no formidable proof. A disheartened Shakuntala left the capital. Her mother Menaka helped her and took her to a sage's ashram so that she can give birth to the child. A fisherman brought the lost ring back to the King and his memory and love are rekindled.\n|-\n|20\n|Meanwhile, Shakuntala gave birth to [[Bharata (Mahabharata)|Bharata]]. One day King Dushyanta while hunting met Bharata & Shakuntala, and the couple is finally reunited. A meeting is called in heaven by Indra with combine participation of representatives of earth and heaven. All [[Brahmarshi|Brahmarishis]] are invited and [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] urges Indra to call Maharishi Vishwamitra too as he'll be soon a Brahamrishi. Narada is asked to invite Vishwamitra which he accepts. During the meeting, a discussion arises about the most valuable matter in the universe. [[Vasishtha|Vashishtha]] concluded that there is nothing more precious than truth. He also named Raja [[Harishchandra]] as the king who follows the difficult path of truth. His claim is challenged by Vishwamitra and he proposes to test Harishchandra's integrity. \n|-\n|21\n|To assess Harishchandra's commitment towards truthfulness, Vishwamitra reaches his court and asks for an unusually huge amount of treasure for yajna purpose which the King readily accepts. Even upon insistence from the King and his counsel, Vishwamitra refuses to take the treasure at once and asks the king to set aside the treasure with himself and he will take it when the right time arrives. Later, Viswamitra creates and send wild animals to Harishchandra's kingdom to further test his mettle.\n|-\n|22\n|Using his powers, Vishwamitra creates two Matangi girls and send them to seduce Raja Harishchandra's camp. The girls are not able to seduce Harishchandra. He is rather disgusted with their seductive performance and asked them to leave with some rewards. But the girls refused to take any reward and in turn ask the King to marry them. Harishchandra refuses to marry them as he is already married to Taramati. The girls then offered themselves as concubines which he vehemently refuses. Later a furious Vishwamitra arrives in Harishchandra's court over the rejection of his magical daughters. Even after the strong insistence of Vishwamitra, Harishchandra refuses to marry his daughters and decides to relinquish his kingdom for saving dharma. He hands over his entire kingdom to Vishwamitra and leaves for Kashi with his wife and son.\n|}\n\n== Music ==\nLyrics for various songs were written by Bhring Tupkari and music was composed by Vasu Rao.

While Richard Copsey questioned the fact that any apparition took place with respect to the scapular,<ref>Copsey, Richard.

''The Carmelite Scapular'', \"The Month\", Vol. 150, 1927, pp. 323\u2013237</ref> Over time, the scapular took an increasingly Marian tone, became identified with Carmelite piety toward the Virgin Mary, and the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel began to be called the \"scapular feast\". <ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english Kavanaugh, Kieran. \"Brown Scapular: a 'Silent Devotion'\", ''Zenit'', July 16, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504164642/http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english |date=May 4, 2009 }}</ref> Although the historicity of the scapular vision is rejected, the scapular itself has remained for all Carmelites a sign of Mary's motherly protection and as a personal commitment to follow Jesus in the footsteps of his Mother, the perfect model for all his disciples.\n\nCarmelite tradition has held that, in 1251, the [[Virgin Mary]] made the \"Scapular Promise\" to St. Simon Stock regarding the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], namely: \"whoever dies clothed in this habit shall not suffer the fires of Hell.\"<ref name=\"Thomas Petrisko 2000, page 105\">Petrisko, Thomas.''Inside Heaven and Hell'', St. Andrews Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-1-891903-23-6}} page 105</ref> This is understood to mean that anyone who remains faithful to the Carmelite vocation until death will be granted the grace of final perseverance.<ref name=catechesis>[http://carmelitanacollection.com/catechesis.html Morello, OCD, Sam Anthony and McMahon, O.Carm., Patrick. \"A Catechesis on the Brown Scapular\", ''The Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel: Catechesis and Ritual'', 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109024243/http://carmelitanacollection.com/catechesis.html |date=2016-01-09 }}</ref> The long-standing tradition of the Church has approved the vision of St. Simon Stock as an acceptable cult, but that is distinguishable from authenticating it as a historical experience. \"The question then, from a historical perspective, is not whether Mary appeared to Simon Stock and gave him the scapular, but rather did Simon Stock perceive the Mother of God bestowing this sign of her protection on him and his brothers in Carmel.\"<ref name=catechesis/> The likelihood is \"probably not\". However, wearing the scapular remains a valuable devotion as a sign of one's commitment to Mary, and a pledge of her protection.\n\nAccording to Christian P.

A small number of such confraternities had started sometime in the 15th century, through the preaching of Alan de Rupe. Their numbers began to grow under the supervision of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]]s, which also helped create a more uniform format for the Rosary. An important Apostolic Constitution on the Rosary Confraternity was issued by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1898.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13188b.htm Thurston, Herbert. \"Confraternity of the Holy Rosary.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

The mountains are in the southern portion of the [[Eastern Highlands]], or Manica Highlands, a belt of highlands that extend north and south along the international border, between the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save]] rivers.\n\nThe Chimanimani Mountains include [[Monte Binga]] (2,436 m), the highest peak in [[Mozambique]] and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to diverse forests, savannas, montane grasslands, and heathlands. Zimbabwe's '''Chimanimani National Park''' and Mozambique's adjacent [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] protect parts of the range. These two parks, together with a larger buffer zone, constitute '''Chimanmani Transfrontier Conservation Area'''.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nMuch of the range is composed of quartzite ridges running north and south, with [[Monte Binga]] (2,436 m) as the highest point. Other peaks include Mt. Peza (2152 m), Mt. Dombe (2188 m), and Mawenje or Turret Towers (2362 m) in Zimbabwe, and Mt. Nhamadimo (2144 m) in Mozambique.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

There are no weather stations in the wetter Mozambican portion of the range. The western slopes on the Zimbabean side of the range are in the mountains' rain shadow, and generally drier. Zimbabwean stations at [[Chimanimani]] and [[Chisengu]] reported 1074 mm and 1406 mm, respectively.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). ''Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation''. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref> \n\nThe summer rainy season extends from November to late March or April. Above 1500 meters elevation rain can fall in any season, and frequent mists and overcast days during the dry season reduce stress on plants.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref> \n\n==Ecology==\nThe mountains above 1000 meters are part of the [[Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic]] ecoregion.\n\n===Montane plant communities===\nMontane plant communities (generally above 1000 meters elevation) include grassland, scrub (shrublands), woodland, forest, and lithophytic vegetation. The Chimanimani Mountains' montane plant communities are [[Afromontane]], and share many species with other high-elevation mountain regions scattered from South Africa to Ethiopia. 70 montane plant species are endemic to the Chimanimani Mountains.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\n====Grasslands====\nGrassland is most widespread vegetation, found on level and rolling terrain. Grasslands are of three main types - quartzite grasslands, schist grasslands, and wet or hydromorphic grasslands. The quartzite and schist grassland types are determined by the underlying geology.\n\nThe quartzite grasslands generally grow low, with [[tussock (grass)|tufted grasses]]. Common grasses are ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Sporobolus festivus]], [[Panicum brazzavillense]], [[Elionurus muticus]], [[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]], [[Panicum ecklonii]], [[Rhytachne rottboellioides]],'' and ''[[Trachypogon spicatus]]''. Quartzite grasslands cover an area of 50 to 100 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSchist grasslands grow on soils derived from schist, which are generally red in color and deeper and more nutrient-rich than quartzite-derived soils. Schist grasslands grow taller and denser, with ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' as the dominant grass, along the grasses ''Loudetia simplex, Tristachya hispida, Monocymbium ceresiiforme'', and the sedge ''[[Bulbostylis contexta]]''. The shrubs ''[[Protea caffra]]'' subsp. ''gazensis, Indigofera cecilii'', and ''Morella chimanimaniana'' and the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' are also typical. Schist grasslands cover an area of approximately 150 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n====Shrublands====\nShrublands grow on steeper slopes, are of two main types, Ericaceous and Proteaceous.\n\nEricaceous scrub is found on quartite-derived soils above 1200 meters elevation. It is characterized by shrubs in the heath family [[Ericaceae]], including ''[[Erica hexandra]], [[Philippia simii]], Erica pleiotricha, E. johnstonii'', and ''E. lanceolifera''. The ericaceous scrubland includes many other species, including many of the species endemic to the Eastern Highlands and Chimanimani Mountains.\n\nProteaceous scrub is found on schist-derived soils between 1100 and 1800 meters elevation, interspersed with schist grasslands. Dominant shrubs are from the protea family ([[Proteaceae]]), including ''[[Protea caffra]], [[Protea welwitschii|P . welwitschii]], [[Protea wentzeliana|P . wentzeliana]]'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'', together with smaller shrubs, herbs, and grasses.\n\nOther shrubland types are mixed sclerophyll scrub, which contains a mix of Ericaceous and Proteaceous species, and bracken scrub, characterized by the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' together with shrubs and tall grasses. Bracken scrub is found on richer soils near forest patches.\n\n====Woodlands====\nThe mountains are home to three types of [[miombo woodland]]. Trees are generally 4 to 8 meters high, with 20 to 60% canopy cover, with grasses and bracken covering the ground.\n\n[[Uapaca kirkiana|Mzhenje]] ''(Uapaca kirkiana)'' woodland is found on east-facing slopes below 1200 meters elevation, typically on schist-derived soils. Mzhenge is accompanied by the trees ''[[Brachystegia utilis]], [[Pterocarpus angolensis]]'', and ''[[Pericopsis angolensis]]'' at lower elevations. \n\n[[Brachystegia spiciformis|Msasa]] ''(Brachystegia spiciformis)'' woodland is also found on schist soils. Trees tend to grow low (2 to 4 meters high) and widely scattered at higher elevations. At lower elevations the trees grow higher and closer, and ''Uapaca kirkiana'' and ''[[Faurea saligna]]'' accompany msasa.\n\nWoodland of ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' subsp. ''microphylla'' grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of ''[[Usnea]]'' lichen.\n\n====Forests====\nMontane forests occur in scattered patches, typically in sheltered areas with access to year-round moisture. Small patches of 1 to 5 hectares are most common, with patches up to 30 km in some locations. The largest patch discovered by Timberlake et al. was 240 hectares, on a west-facing slope above the Nyahedzi River.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\nTrees form a closed canopy 10 to 15 meters high. Lianas and epiphytes are common in the canopy, and the understory plants are mostly ferns and mosses. Common forest trees include ''[[Schefflera umbellifera]], [[Ilex mitis]], [[Macaranga mellifera]], [[Maesa lanceolata]], [[Morella pilulifera]], [[Podocarpus milanjianus]]'', and ''[[Syzygium cordatum]]''. ''[[Widdringtonia nodiflora]]'' occurs in drier patches.\n\nA transitional forest type can be found on the edges of forest patches, and along streams and gullies in grassland and shrubland areas, and includes a mix of forest and Ericaceous shrub species, together with grasses and bracken ferns. The transitional forests include the large shrubs and small trees ''[[Philippia mannii]], [[Englerophytum magalismontanum]], [[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', and ''[[Myrsine africana]]''. Groves of the large banana-like shrub ''[[Strelitzia caudata]]'' and the tree fern ''[[Cyathea capensis]]'' grow in sheltered stream-side locales surrounded by more open vegetation.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Ndau people]] have lived in the area around the Chimanimani Mountains for centuries.

Southern Rhodesia declared independence as Rhodesia under an exclusive white-minority government in 1965. The [[Rhodesian Bush War]], or Zimbabwe Independence War, raged from 1964 to 1979. During the war, mountain passes in the Chimanimani area were frequently used by guerilla fighters moving between Zimbabwe and their camps in [[Mozambique]], and the guerrillas laid [[land mines|mines]] along local roads to disrupt the local economy.

The mountains are in the southern portion of the [[Eastern Highlands]], or Manica Highlands, a belt of highlands that extend north and south along the international border, between the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] and [[Save River (Africa)|Save]] rivers.\n\nThe Chimanimani Mountains include [[Monte Binga]] (2,436 m), the highest peak in [[Mozambique]] and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. The mountains are home to diverse forests, savannas, montane grasslands, and heathlands. Zimbabwe's '''Chimanimani National Park''' and Mozambique's adjacent [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] protect parts of the range. These two parks, together with a larger buffer zone, constitute '''Chimanmani Transfrontier Conservation Area'''.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T.

The Chimanimani Mountains' montane plant communities are [[Afromontane]], and share many species with other high-elevation mountain regions scattered from South Africa to Ethiopia. 70 montane plant species are endemic to the Chimanimani Mountains.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\n====Grasslands====\nGrassland is most widespread vegetation, found on level and rolling terrain. Grasslands are of three main types - quartzite grasslands, schist grasslands, and wet or hydromorphic grasslands. The quartzite and schist grassland types are determined by the underlying geology.\n\nThe quartzite grasslands generally grow low, with [[tussock (grass)|tufted grasses]]. Common grasses are ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Sporobolus festivus]], [[Panicum brazzavillense]], [[Elionurus muticus]], [[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]], [[Panicum ecklonii]], [[Rhytachne rottboellioides]],'' and ''[[Trachypogon spicatus]]''. Quartzite grasslands cover an area of 50 to 100 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\nSchist grasslands grow on soils derived from schist, which are generally red in color and deeper and more nutrient-rich than quartzite-derived soils. Schist grasslands grow taller and denser, with ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' as the dominant grass, along the grasses ''Loudetia simplex, Tristachya hispida, Monocymbium ceresiiforme'', and the sedge ''[[Bulbostylis contexta]]''. The low shrubs ''[[Protea gazensis]], Indigofera cecilii'', and ''Morella chimanimaniana'', and the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'', are also typical. Schist grasslands cover an area of approximately 150 km<sup>2</sup>.\n\n====Shrublands====\nShrublands grow on steeper slopes, are of two main types, Ericaceous and Proteaceous.\n\nEricaceous scrub is found on quartite-derived soils above 1200 meters elevation. It is characterized by shrubs in the heath family [[Ericaceae]], including ''[[Erica hexandra]], [[Philippia simii]], Erica pleiotricha, E. johnstonii'', and ''E. lanceolifera''. The ericaceous scrubland includes many other species, including many of the species endemic to the Eastern Highlands and Chimanimani Mountains.\n\nProteaceous scrub is found on schist-derived soils between 1100 and 1800 meters elevation, interspersed with schist grasslands. Dominant shrubs are from the protea family ([[Proteaceae]]), including ''[[Protea caffra]], [[Protea welwitschii|P . welwitschii]], [[Protea wentzeliana|P . wentzeliana]]'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'', together with smaller shrubs, herbs, and grasses.\n\nOther shrubland types are mixed sclerophyll scrub, which contains a mix of Ericaceous and Proteaceous species, and bracken scrub, characterized by the bracken fern ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'' together with shrubs and tall grasses. Bracken scrub is found on richer soils near forest patches.\n\n====Woodlands====\nThe mountains are home to three types of [[miombo woodland]]. Trees are generally 4 to 8 meters high, with 20 to 60% canopy cover, with grasses and bracken covering the ground.\n\n[[Uapaca kirkiana|Mzhenje]] ''(Uapaca kirkiana)'' woodland is found on east-facing slopes below 1200 meters elevation, typically on schist-derived soils. Mzhenge is accompanied by the trees ''[[Brachystegia utilis]], [[Pterocarpus angolensis]]'', and ''[[Pericopsis angolensis]]'' at lower elevations. \n\n[[Brachystegia spiciformis|Msasa]] ''(Brachystegia spiciformis)'' woodland is also found on schist soils. Trees tend to grow low (2 to 4 meters high) and widely scattered at higher elevations. At lower elevations the trees grow higher and closer, and ''Uapaca kirkiana'' and ''[[Faurea saligna]]'' accompany msasa.\n\nWoodland of ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' subsp. ''microphylla'' grows on quartzite outcrops and rocky slopes. The trees grow low and spreading, and are draped with tassels of ''[[Usnea]]'' lichen.\n\n====Forests====\nMontane forests occur in scattered patches, typically in sheltered areas with access to year-round moisture. Small patches of 1 to 5 hectares are most common, with patches up to 30 km in some locations. The largest patch discovered by Timberlake et al. was 240 hectares, on a west-facing slope above the Nyahedzi River.<ref>Timberlake, J.R., Darbyshire, I., Wursten, B., Hadj-Hammou, J., Ballings, P., Mapaura, A., Matimele, H., Banze, A., Chipanga, H., Muassinar, D., Massunde, M., Chelene, I., Osborne, J. & Shah, T. (2016). Chimanimani Mountains: Botany and Conservation. Report produced under CEPF Grant 63512. Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, London. 95 pp.</ref>\n\nTrees form a closed canopy 10 to 15 meters high. Lianas and epiphytes are common in the canopy, and the understory plants are mostly ferns and mosses. Common forest trees include ''[[Schefflera umbellifera]], [[Ilex mitis]], [[Macaranga mellifera]], [[Maesa lanceolata]], [[Morella pilulifera]], [[Podocarpus milanjianus]]'', and ''[[Syzygium cordatum]]''. ''[[Widdringtonia nodiflora]]'' occurs in drier patches.\n\nA transitional forest type can be found on the edges of forest patches, and along streams and gullies in grassland and shrubland areas, and includes a mix of forest and Ericaceous shrub species, together with grasses and bracken ferns. The transitional forests include the large shrubs and small trees ''[[Philippia mannii]], [[Englerophytum magalismontanum]], [[Rapanea melanophloeos]]'', and ''[[Myrsine africana]]''. Groves of the large banana-like shrub ''[[Strelitzia caudata]]'' and the tree fern ''[[Cyathea capensis]]'' grow in sheltered stream-side locales surrounded by more open vegetation.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Ndau people]] have lived in the area around the Chimanimani Mountains for centuries. In the early 19th century, [[Nguni people|Nguni-speaking people]] left what is now South Africa to settle in the Save River valley.
