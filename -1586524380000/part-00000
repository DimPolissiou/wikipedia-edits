{"title_page": "Safety valve", "text_new": "{{Short description|Device for releasing excess pressure in a system}}\n{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Oxygen-Safetyvalve.jpg|thumb|200px| An oxygen safety [[relief valve]]]]\n[[File:Valvole di sicurezza di grandi dimensioni.jpg|thumb|200px|DN250-safety valves]]\n\nA '''safety valve''' is a [[valve]] that acts as a [[fail-safe]]. An example of safety valve is a pressure [[relief valve]] (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a [[boiler]], [[pressure vessel]], or other [[system]], when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. [[Pilot-operated relief valve]]s are a specialized type of pressure safety valve. A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a [[rupture disk]].\n\nSafety valves were first developed for use on steam boilers during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Early boilers operating without them were prone to [[boiler explosion|explosion]] unless carefully operated.\n\nVacuum safety valves (or combined pressure/vacuum safety valves) are used to prevent a tank from collapsing while it is being emptied, or when cold rinse water is used after hot CIP (clean-in-place) or SIP (sterilization-in-place) procedures.\nWhen sizing a vacuum safety valve, the calculation method is not defined in any norm, particularly in the hot CIP / cold water scenario, but some manufacturers <ref>[http://servinox.com/wordpress/index.php/event-autonome-ultra-propre-hsv/?lang=en Safety valve sized regarding hot CIP -> Cold water conditions]</ref> have developed sizing simulations.\n\n==Function and design==\n[[File:Proportional-Safety Valve.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A [[Multiview orthographic projection#Cross-section|cross-section]] of a proportional-safety valve]]\nThe earliest and simplest safety valve was used on a 1679 [[steam digester]] and utilized a weight to retain the steam pressure (this design is still commonly used on [[pressure cooker]]s); however, these were easily tampered with or accidentally released. On the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], the safety valve tended to go off when the engine hit a bump in the track. A valve less sensitive to sudden accelerations used a spring to contain the steam pressure, but these (based on a [[Richard Salter (inventor)|Salter]] [[spring balance]]) could still be screwed down to increase the pressure beyond design limits. This dangerous practice was sometimes used to marginally increase the performance of a steam engine. In 1856, [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof spring safety valve that became universal on railways. The Ramsbottom valve consisted of two plug-type valves connected to each other by a spring-laden pivoting arm, with one valve element on either side of the pivot. Any adjustment made to one of valves in an attempt to increase its operating pressure would cause the other valve to be lifted off its seat, regardless of how the adjustment was attempted. The pivot point on the arm was not symmetrically between the valves, so any tightening of the spring would cause one of the valves to lift. Only by removing and disassembling the entire valve assembly could its operating pressure be adjusted, making impromptu 'tying down' of the valve by locomotive crews in search of more power impossible. The pivoting arm was commonly extended into a handle shape and fed back into the locomotive cab, allowing crews to 'rock' both valves off their seats to confirm they were set and operating correctly.\n\nSafety valves also evolved to protect equipment such as [[pressure vessel]]s (fired or not) and [[heat exchanger]]s. The term '''safety valve''' should be limited to compressible fluid applications (gas, vapour, or steam).\n\nThe two general types of protection encountered in industry are ''thermal protection'' and ''flow protection''.\n\nFor liquid-packed vessels, thermal relief valves are generally characterized by the relatively small size of the valve necessary to provide protection from excess pressure caused by thermal expansion. In this case a small valve is adequate because most liquids are nearly incompressible, and so a relatively small amount of fluid discharged through the relief valve will produce a substantial reduction in pressure.\n\nFlow protection is characterized by safety valves that are considerably larger than those mounted for thermal protection. They are generally sized for use in situations where significant quantities of gas or high volumes of liquid must be quickly discharged in order to protect the integrity of the vessel or pipeline. This protection can alternatively be achieved by installing a [[high integrity pressure protection system]] (HIPPS).\n\n==Technical terms==\nIn the [[oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[petrochemical]], [[chemical plant|chemical manufacturing]], [[natural gas processing]], [[power station|power generation]], food, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, the term '''safety valve''' is associated with the terms '''pressure relief valve''' (PRV), '''pressure safety valve''' (PSV) and '''relief valve'''.\nThe generic term is [[Pressure relief valve]] (PRV) or '''pressure safety valve''' (PSV). PRVs and PSVs are not the same thing, despite what many people think; the difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to open the valve in case of emergency.\n* [[Relief valve]] (RV): an automatic system that is actuated by the static pressure in a liquid-filled vessel. It specifically opens proportionally with increasing pressure{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.\n* Safety valve (SV): an automatic system that relieves the static pressure on a gas. It usually opens completely, accompanied by a popping sound{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.\n* '''Safety relief valve''' (SRV): an automatic system that relieves by static pressure on both gas and liquid.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RhgYLnyTnOwC&pg=6 The Safety Relief Valve Handbook], Hellemans, M.

Early steam locomotives therefore used a simpler arrangement of weights stacked directly upon the valve. This required a smaller valve area, so as to keep the weight manageable, which sometimes proved inadequate to vent the pressure of an unattended boiler, leading to [[boiler explosion|explosion]]s. An even greater hazard was the ease with which such a valve could be tied down, so as to increase the pressure and thus power of the engine, at further risk of explosion.<ref>{{harvnb|Hills|Power from Steam| pages= 144, 146}}</ref>\n\nAlthough deadweight safety valves had a short lifetime on steam locomotives, they remained in use on stationary boilers for as long as steam power remained.<ref name=\"Hills, Power from Steam\" >{{cite book\n  |last=Hills  |first=Richard L.\n  |title=Power from Steam\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6TLOQBhd0YC&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=waggon+boiler&source=web&ots=Bhw0lnxLMq&sig=KlWTOObUms8lvIOq1ly7WlWd7xw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA121,M1\n  |year=1989\n  |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n  |isbn=0-521-45834-X\n  |ref={{harvid|Hills|Power from Steam}}\n  |pages=129\n}}</ref>\n\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Direct spring valves  ===\n[[File:Planet replica.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive ''Planet'' (1830), with a brass-cased [[#Direct spring valves|direct spring valve]]]]\nWeighted valves were sensitive to bouncing from the rough riding of early locomotives.

A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat.<ref name=\"Proc. IME, 1856\" >{{cite journal\n  |title=An improved safety valve\n  |journal=Proc.

Some were separate fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations.<ref name=\"Hewison, p19\" /> Others were contained in a U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the boiler shell. As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the boiler shell, with the springs housed in a recess inside and only the valves and balance lever protruding outside.<ref name=\"Hewison, p19\" /> These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.\n\n: {{cite patent|GB|1299}} 1299: 7 June 1855: Safety valves, feeding apparatus for steam-boilers.\n\nA drawback to the Ramsbottom type was its complexity. Poor maintenance or mis-assembly of the linkage between the spring and the valves could lead to a valve that no longer opened correctly under pressure. The valves could be held against their seats and fail to open or, even worse, to allow the valve to open but insufficiently to vent steam at an adequate rate and so not being an obvious and noticeable fault.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref> Mis-assembly of just this nature led to a fatal boiler explosion in 1909 at Cardiff on the [[Rhymney Railway]], even though the boiler was almost new, at only eight months old.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=115\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n{{visible anchor|Naylor valve}}s were introduced around 1866.

When they opened they also did so partially at first and didn't vent steam quickly until the boiler was well over pressure.<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />\n\n[[File:FRB - The Pop Valve, item 1.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Pop Valve'', a self-published magazine by the American army [[Transportation Corps]] stationed in France in WWI]]\nThe quick-opening \"pop\" valve was a solution to this. Their construction was simple: the existing circular plug valve was changed to an inverted \"top hat\" shape, with an enlarged upper diameter. They fitted into a stepped seat of two matching diameters. When closed, the steam pressure acted only on the crown of the top hat, and was balanced by the spring force. Once the valve opened a little, steam could pass the lower seat and began to act on the larger brim.  This greater area overwhelmed the spring force and the valve flew completely open with a \"pop\". Escaping steam on this larger diameter also held the valve open until pressure had dropped ''below'' that at which it originally opened, providing [[hysteresis]].<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />\n\nThese valves coincided with a change in firing behaviour. Rather than demonstrating their virility by always showing a feather at the valve, firemen now tried to ''avoid'' noisy blowing off, especially around stations or under the large roof of a major station. This was mostly at the behest of stationmasters, but firemen also realised that any blowing off through a pop valve wasted several pounds of boiler pressure; estimated at 20&nbsp;psi lost and 16&nbsp;lbs or more of shovelled coal.{{#tag:ref|These figures are based on two measurements, a drop from 225&nbsp;psi to 205&nbsp;psi for an [[LNER Class V2]] in 1952 and a smaller drop of 10&nbsp;psi estimated in 1953 as 16&nbsp;lbs of coal.<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />|group = note}}<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />\n\nPop valves derived from Adams's patent design of 1873, with an extended lip.

Valves of greater capacity were required, to vent safely the high steam-generating capacity of these large boilers.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers, high-capacity\" >{{harvnb|Marine Steam Boilers|pages=222\u2013223}}</ref> As the force on their valves increased, the issue of the spring's increasing stiffness as its load increased (like the [[#Naylor valve|Naylor valve]]) became more critical.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers\" /> The need to reduced valve feathering became even more important with high-pressure boilers, as this represented both a loss of [[evaporator (marine)|distilled feedwater]] and also a scouring of the valve seats, leading to wear.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers, high-capacity\" />\n\nHigh-lift safety valves are direct-loaded spring types, although the spring does not bear directly on the valve, but on a guide-rod valve stem. The valve is beneath the base of the stem, the spring rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat. This gives a steam flow through the valve equivalent to a valve one and a half or twice as large (depending on detail design).<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers\" >{{cite book\n  |title=Marine Steam Boilers\n  |last=Milton  |first=J.

The exhaust steam is partially trapped on its way out and acts on the base of the spring seat, increasing the lift force on the valve and holding the valve further open.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers\" />\n\nTo optimise the flow through a given diameter of valve, the full-bore design is used. This has a [[Servomechanism|servo]] action, where steam through a narrow control passage is allowed through if it passes a small control valve. This steam is then not exhausted, but is passed to a piston that is used to open the main valve.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers, high-capacity\" />\n\nThere are safety valves known as PSV's and can be connected to pressure gauges (usually with a 1/2\" BSP fitting). These allow a resistance of pressure to be applied to limit the pressure forced on the gauge tube, resulting in prevention of over pressurisation. the matter that has been injected into the gauge, if over pressurised, will be diverted through a pipe in the safety valve, and shall be driven away from the gauge.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:46229 DUCHESS OF HAMILTON at Crewe Bank Shrewsbury.jpg|thumb|right|Steam locomotive [[LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 Duchess of Hamilton|No. 46229, ''Duchess of Hamilton'']] lifts her boiler safety valve after hauling the ''Welsh Marches Pullman'' charter.]]\nThere is a wide range of safety valves having many different applications and performance criteria in different areas.

Cooking at pressure allows the temperature to rise above the normal boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius at [[sea level]]), which speeds up the cooking and makes it more thorough.\n\nPressure cookers usually have two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, one is a nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed rubber [[grommet]] which is ejected in a controlled explosion if the first valve gets blocked.  On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan.  Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]] which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which would happen if the lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).\n\nThe term ''safety valve'' is also used [[metaphor]]ically.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ball valve]]\n* [[Butterfly valve]]\n* [[Control valves]]\n* [[Flow limiter]]\n* [[Globe valve]]\n* [[Needle valve]]\n* [[Pilot-operated relief valve]]\n* [[Relief valve]]\n* [[Safety shutoff valve]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Commons category|Safety valves}}\n{{Reflist|group=note|liststyle=lower-roman}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://articles.compressionjobs.com/articles/oilfield-101/4393-valves-pipelines-gate-globe-needle-angle-plug-ball-butterfly-check?start=3 Schematical overview working principle Safety Relief Valve]\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/psv-sizing-calculator-blocked-liquid-discharge Pressure relief valve sizing calculator] PSV sizing calculator for liquid blocked outlet case.\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/psv-sizing-calculator-blocked-gas-discharge PSV sizing calculator for blocked gas outlet case.] PSV sizing calculator for blocked gas discharge.\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/instrument-sizing/psv-sizing-calculator-fire-case-gas-filled-vessel/ PSV sizing calculator - fire case for gas filled vessel]\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/instrument-sizing/psv-sizing-calculator-fire-case-liquid-filled-vessel/ PSV sizing calculator - fire case for liquid filled vessel]\n\n{{Steam engine configurations|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Safety Valve}}\n[[Category:Steam boiler components]]\n[[Category:Safety valves]]\n[[Category:Locomotive parts]]\n[[Category:Industrial safety devices]]\n[[Category:Valves]]\n[[Category:Safety equipment|Valve]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Device for releasing excess pressure in a system}}\n{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Oxygen-Safetyvalve.jpg|thumb|200px| An oxygen safety [[relief valve]]]]\n[[File:Valvole di sicurezza di grandi dimensioni.jpg|thumb|200px|DN250-safety valves]]\n\nA '''safety valve''' is a [[valve]] that acts as a [[fail-safe]]. An example of safety valve is a pressure [[relief valve]] (PRV), which automatically releases a substance from a [[boiler]], [[pressure vessel]], or other [[system]], when the pressure or temperature exceeds preset limits. [[Pilot-operated relief valve]]s are a specialized type of pressure safety valve. A leak tight, lower cost, single emergency use option would be a [[rupture disk]].\n\nSafety valves were first developed for use on steam boilers during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Early boilers operating without them were prone to [[boiler explosion|explosion]] unless carefully operated.\n\nVacuum safety valves (or combined pressure/vacuum safety valves) are used to prevent a tank from collapsing while it is being emptied, or when cold rinse water is used after hot CIP (clean-in-place) or SIP (sterilization-in-place) procedures.\nWhen sizing a vacuum safety valve, the calculation method is not defined in any norm, particularly in the hot CIP / cold water scenario, but some manufacturers <ref>[http://servinox.com/wordpress/index.php/event-autonome-ultra-propre-hsv/?lang=en Safety valve sized regarding hot CIP -> Cold water conditions]</ref> have developed sizing simulations.\n\n==Function and design==\n[[File:Proportional-Safety Valve.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|A [[Multiview orthographic projection#Cross-section|cross-section]] of a proportional-safety valve]]\nThe earliest and simplest safety valve was used on a 1679 [[steam digester]] and utilized a weight to retain the steam pressure (this design is still commonly used on [[pressure cooker]]s); however, these were easily tampered with or accidentally released. On the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]], the safety valve tended to go off when the engine hit a bump in the track. A valve less sensitive to sudden accelerations used a spring to contain the steam pressure, but these (based on a [[Richard Salter (inventor)|Salter]] [[spring balance]]) could still be screwed down to increase the pressure beyond design limits. This dangerous practice was sometimes used to marginally increase the performance of a steam engine. In 1856, [[John Ramsbottom (engineer)|John Ramsbottom]] invented a tamper-proof spring safety valve that became universal on railways. The Ramsbottom valve consisted of two plug-type valves connected to each other by a spring-laden pivoting arm, with one valve element on either side of the pivot. Any adjustment made to one of valves in an attempt to increase its operating pressure would cause the other valve to be lifted off its seat, regardless of how the adjustment was attempted. The pivot point on the arm was not symmetrically between the valves, so any tightening of the spring would cause one of the valves to lift. Only by removing and disassembling the entire valve assembly could its operating pressure be adjusted, making impromptu 'tying down' of the valve by locomotive crews in search of more power impossible. The pivoting arm was commonly extended into a handle shape and fed back into the locomotive cab, allowing crews to 'rock' both valves off their seats to confirm they were set and operating correctly.\n\nSafety valves also evolved to protect equipment such as [[pressure vessel]]s (fired or not) and [[heat exchanger]]s. The term '''safety valve''' should be limited to compressible fluid applications (gas, vapour, or steam).\n\nThe two general types of protection encountered in industry are ''thermal protection'' and ''flow protection''.\n\nFor liquid-packed vessels, thermal relief valves are generally characterized by the relatively small size of the valve necessary to provide protection from excess pressure caused by thermal expansion. In this case a small valve is adequate because most liquids are nearly incompressible, and so a relatively small amount of fluid discharged through the relief valve will produce a substantial reduction in pressure.\n\nFlow protection is characterized by safety valves that are considerably larger than those mounted for thermal protection. They are generally sized for use in situations where significant quantities of gas or high volumes of liquid must be quickly discharged in order to protect the integrity of the vessel or pipeline. This protection can alternatively be achieved by installing a [[high integrity pressure protection system]] (HIPPS).\n\n==Technical terms==\nIn the [[oil refinery|petroleum refining]], [[petrochemical]], [[chemical plant|chemical manufacturing]], [[natural gas processing]], [[power station|power generation]], food, drinks, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals industries, the term '''safety valve''' is associated with the terms '''pressure relief valve''' (PRV), '''pressure safety valve''' (PSV) and '''relief valve'''.\nThe generic term is [[Pressure relief valve]] (PRV) or '''pressure safety valve''' (PSV). PRVs and PSVs are not the same thing, despite what many people think; the difference is that PSVs have a manual lever to open the valve in case of emergency.\n* [[Relief valve]] (RV): an automatic system that is actuated by the static pressure in a liquid-filled vessel. It specifically opens proportionally with increasing pressure{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}.\n* Safety valve (SV): an automatic system that relieves the static pressure on a gas.

Used when the pressure difference is small, negative or positive and near to atmospheric pressure.\n\nRV, SV and SRV are spring-operated (even spring-loaded). LPSV and VPSV are spring-operated or weight-loaded.\n\n==Legal and code requirements in industry==\nIn most countries, industries are legally required to protect pressure vessels and other equipment by using relief valves. Also, in most countries, equipment design codes such as those provided by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]], [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] and other organizations like ISO (ISO 4126) must be complied with. These codes include design standards for relief valves and schedules for periodic inspection and testing after valves have been removed by the company engineer.<ref>[http://www.onetb.com/asme_code_countries.htm List of countries accepting the ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code]</ref><ref>[http://www.techstreet.com/cgi-bin/detail?product_id=235758 API 520-1, Sizing and Selection of Pressure-Relieving Devices]</ref>\n\nToday, the food, drinks, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals industries call for hygienic safety valves, fully drainable and Cleanable-In-Place.

Early steam locomotives therefore used a simpler arrangement of weights stacked directly upon the valve. This required a smaller valve area, so as to keep the weight manageable, which sometimes proved inadequate to vent the pressure of an unattended boiler, leading to [[boiler explosion|explosion]]s. An even greater hazard was the ease with which such a valve could be tied down, so as to increase the pressure and thus power of the engine, at further risk of explosion.<ref>{{harvnb|Hills|Power from Steam| pages= 144, 146}}</ref>\n\nAlthough deadweight safety valves had a short lifetime on steam locomotives, they remained in use on stationary boilers for as long as steam power remained.<ref name=\"Hills, Power from Steam\" >{{cite book\n  |last=Hills  |first=Richard L.\n  |title=Power from Steam\n  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t6TLOQBhd0YC&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=waggon+boiler&source=web&ots=Bhw0lnxLMq&sig=KlWTOObUms8lvIOq1ly7WlWd7xw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA121,M1\n  |year=1989\n  |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n  |isbn=0-521-45834-X\n  |ref={{harvid|Hills|Power from Steam}}\n  |pages=129\n}}</ref>\n\n{{clear right}}\n\n=== Direct spring valves  ===\n[[File:Planet replica.jpg|thumb|right|Locomotive ''Planet'' (1830), with a brass-cased [[#Direct spring valves|direct spring valve]]]]\nWeighted valves were sensitive to bouncing from the rough riding of early locomotives.

A pair of plug valves were used, held down by a common spring-loaded lever between them with a single central spring. This lever was characteristically extended rearwards, often reaching into the cab on early locomotives. Rather than discouraging the use of the spring lever by the fireman, Ramsbottom's valve encouraged this. Rocking the lever freed up the valves alternately and checked that neither was sticking in its seat.<ref name=\"Proc. IME, 1856\" >{{cite journal\n  |title=An improved safety valve\n  |journal=Proc. Inst. Mech.

Some were separate fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations.<ref name=\"Hewison, p19\" /> Others were contained in a U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the boiler shell. As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the boiler shell, with the springs housed in a recess inside and only the valves and balance lever protruding outside.<ref name=\"Hewison, p19\" /> These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.\n\n: {{cite patent|GB|1299}} 1299: 7 June 1855: Safety valves, feeding apparatus for steam-boilers.\n\nA drawback to the Ramsbottom type was its complexity. Poor maintenance or mis-assembly of the linkage between the spring and the valves could lead to a valve that no longer opened correctly under pressure. The valves could be held against their seats and fail to open or, even worse, to allow the valve to open but insufficiently to vent steam at an adequate rate and so not being an obvious and noticeable fault.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=100\u2013101}}</ref> Mis-assembly of just this nature led to a fatal boiler explosion in 1909 at Cardiff on the [[Rhymney Railway]], even though the boiler was almost new, at only eight months old.<ref>{{harvnb|Hewison|Locomotive Boiler Explosions|pages=115\u2013118}}</ref>\n\n{{visible anchor|Naylor valve}}s were introduced around 1866.

When they opened they also did so partially at first and didn't vent steam quickly until the boiler was well over pressure.<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />\n\n[[File:FRB - The Pop Valve, item 1.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''The Pop Valve'', a self-published magazine by the American army [[Transportation Corps]] stationed in France in WWI]]\nThe quick-opening \"pop\" valve was a solution to this. Their construction was simple: the existing circular plug valve was changed to an inverted \"top hat\" shape, with an enlarged upper diameter. They fitted into a stepped seat of two matching diameters. When closed, the steam pressure acted only on the crown of the top hat, and was balanced by the spring force. Once the valve opened a little, steam could pass the lower seat and began to act on the larger brim.  This greater area overwhelmed the spring force and the valve flew completely open with a \"pop\". Escaping steam on this larger diameter also held the valve open until pressure had dropped ''below'' that at which it originally opened, providing [[hysteresis]].<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />\n\nThese valves coincided with a change in firing behaviour. Rather than demonstrating their virility by always showing a feather at the valve, firemen now tried to ''avoid'' noisy blowing off, especially around stations or under the large roof of a major station. This was mostly at the behest of stationmasters, but firemen also realised that any blowing off through a pop valve wasted several pounds of boiler pressure; estimated at 20&nbsp;psi lost and 16&nbsp;lbs or more of shovelled coal.{{#tag:ref|These figures are based on two measurements, a drop from 225&nbsp;psi to 205&nbsp;psi for an [[LNER Class V2]] in 1952 and a smaller drop of 10&nbsp;psi estimated in 1953 as 16&nbsp;lbs of coal.<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />|group = note}}<ref name=\"Semmens, Steam Locomotives, safety valves\" />\n\nPop valves derived from Adams's patent design of 1873, with an extended lip. R. L. Ross's valves were patented in 1902 and 1904. They were more popular in America at first, but widespread from the 1920s on.<ref name=\"Ahrons, p364\" >{{harvnb|Ahrons|British Steam Railway Locomotive|page=364}}</ref>\n\n[[File:GWR safety valve from Earl Bathurst.jpg|thumb|right|GWR safety valve cover]]\nAlthough showy polished brass covers over safety valves had been a feature of steam locomotives since Stephenson's day, the only railway to maintain this tradition into the era of pop valves was the [[Great Western Railway|GWR]], with their distinctive tapered brass safety valve bonnets and copper-capped chimneys.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Marine and Cockburn high-lift safety valves ===\nDevelopments in high-pressure [[water-tube boiler]]s for [[marine steam engine|marine use]] placed more demands on safety valves. Valves of greater capacity were required, to vent safely the high steam-generating capacity of these large boilers.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers, high-capacity\" >{{harvnb|Marine Steam Boilers|pages=222\u2013223}}</ref> As the force on their valves increased, the issue of the spring's increasing stiffness as its load increased (like the [[#Naylor valve|Naylor valve]]) became more critical.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers\" /> The need to reduced valve feathering became even more important with high-pressure boilers, as this represented both a loss of [[evaporator (marine)|distilled feedwater]] and also a scouring of the valve seats, leading to wear.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers, high-capacity\" />\n\nHigh-lift safety valves are direct-loaded spring types, although the spring does not bear directly on the valve, but on a guide-rod valve stem. The valve is beneath the base of the stem, the spring rests on a flange some height above this. The increased space between the valve itself and the spring seat allows the valve to lift higher, further clear of the seat. This gives a steam flow through the valve equivalent to a valve one and a half or twice as large (depending on detail design).<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers\" >{{cite book\n  |title=Marine Steam Boilers\n  |last=Milton  |first=J. H.\n  |year=1953\n  |publisher=Newnes\n  |ref={{harvid|Marine Steam Boilers}}\n  |pages=216\u2013219\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Cockburn Improved High Lift design has similar features to the Ross pop type. The exhaust steam is partially trapped on its way out and acts on the base of the spring seat, increasing the lift force on the valve and holding the valve further open.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers\" />\n\nTo optimise the flow through a given diameter of valve, the full-bore design is used. This has a [[Servomechanism|servo]] action, where steam through a narrow control passage is allowed though if it passes a small control valve. This steam is then not exhausted, but is passed to a piston that is used to open the main valve.<ref name=\"Marine steam boilers, high-capacity\" />\n\nThere are safety valves known as PSV's and can be connected to pressure gauges (usually with a 1/2\" BSP fitting). These allow a resistance of pressure to be applied to limit the pressure forced on the gauge tube, resulting in prevention of over pressurisation. the matter that has been injected into the gauge, if over pressurised, will be diverted through a pipe in the safety valve, and shall be driven away from the gauge.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:46229 DUCHESS OF HAMILTON at Crewe Bank Shrewsbury.jpg|thumb|right|Steam locomotive [[LMS Princess Coronation Class 6229 Duchess of Hamilton|No. 46229, ''Duchess of Hamilton'']] lifts her boiler safety valve after hauling the ''Welsh Marches Pullman'' charter.]]\nThere is a wide range of safety valves having many different applications and performance criteria in different areas.

Cooking at pressure allows the temperature to rise above the normal boiling point of water (100 degrees Celsius at [[sea level]]), which speeds up the cooking and makes it more thorough.\n\nPressure cookers usually have two safety valves to prevent explosions. On older designs, one is a nozzle upon which a weight sits. The other is a sealed rubber [[grommet]] which is ejected in a controlled explosion if the first valve gets blocked.  On newer generation pressure cookers, if the steam vent gets blocked, a safety spring will eject excess pressure and if that fails, the gasket will expand and release excess pressure downwards between the lid and the pan.  Also, newer generation pressure cookers have a safety [[Interlock (engineering)|interlock]] which locks the lid when internal pressure exceeds atmospheric pressure, to prevent accidents from a sudden release of very hot steam, food and liquid, which would happen if the lid were to be removed when the pan is still slightly pressurised inside (however, the lid will be very hard or impossible to open when the pan is still pressurised).\n\nThe term ''safety valve'' is also used [[metaphor]]ically.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ball valve]]\n* [[Butterfly valve]]\n* [[Control valves]]\n* [[Flow limiter]]\n* [[Globe valve]]\n* [[Needle valve]]\n* [[Pilot-operated relief valve]]\n* [[Relief valve]]\n* [[Safety shutoff valve]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Commons category|Safety valves}}\n{{Reflist|group=note|liststyle=lower-roman}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://articles.compressionjobs.com/articles/oilfield-101/4393-valves-pipelines-gate-globe-needle-angle-plug-ball-butterfly-check?start=3 Schematical overview working principle Safety Relief Valve]\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/psv-sizing-calculator-blocked-liquid-discharge Pressure relief valve sizing calculator] PSV sizing calculator for liquid blocked outlet case.\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/psv-sizing-calculator-blocked-gas-discharge PSV sizing calculator for blocked gas outlet case.] PSV sizing calculator for blocked gas discharge.\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/instrument-sizing/psv-sizing-calculator-fire-case-gas-filled-vessel/ PSV sizing calculator - fire case for gas filled vessel]\n* [http://www.enggcyclopedia.com/calculators/instrument-sizing/psv-sizing-calculator-fire-case-liquid-filled-vessel/ PSV sizing calculator - fire case for liquid filled vessel]\n\n{{Steam engine configurations|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Safety Valve}}\n[[Category:Steam boiler components]]\n[[Category:Safety valves]]\n[[Category:Locomotive parts]]\n[[Category:Industrial safety devices]]\n[[Category:Valves]]\n[[Category:Safety equipment|Valve]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_valve"}

Animation]]. It first aired on [[Kids' WB]] in January 2001. It is a spin-off series based on the character Zeta from the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode of the same name. Consequently, it is set in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. The show was created by Robert Goodman and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=724\u2013725}}</ref>\n\nThe story's main character, Infiltration Unit Zeta, is a humanoid robot (synthoid) designed to carry out covert assassinations on the behalf of the [[National Security Agency]]. When Zeta discovers that one of his targets is innocent, he experiences an [[existential crisis]] about goodness and the value of life; following this epiphany, Zeta finds that he can no longer kill. The newly enlightened Zeta refuses to continue on as an infiltration unit and abandons his mission, going rogue. Zeta is pursued by a team of [[NSA]] agents, led by the obsessed Agent Bennett, and is aided by a 15-year-old runaway, Rosalie \"Ro\" Rowan.\n\nThe series was cancelled after two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Zeta Project'' follows the exploits of Zeta and Ro as they attempt to prove that he is genuinely non-violent, whereas the NSA agents pursuing him believe that the terrorists he was investigating before going rogue have reprogrammed him for some unknown purpose. To prove his innocence, Zeta and Ro search for his creator, the elusive Dr. Selig.\n\n==Characters==\n[[List of DC animated universe characters]]\n* Infiltration Unit Zeta ([[Diedrich Bader]]), nicknamed \"Zee\", the titular character. As an infiltration unit designed to seek and destroy specific people, Zeta has the ability to holographically disguise himself as any individual that he has seen, as well as create custom appearances through mixing and matching various physical traits. Though Zeta no longer possesses the vast array of weapons that he originally came equipped with, his arms are equipped with saw blades and cutting lasers. He also possesses a wide array of other non-lethal tools, such as handheld welding lasers and a computer interface. In addition, Zeta possesses great mechanical strength, has extensible limbs, and is capable of self-repair.\n* Rosalie \"Ro\" Rowan ([[Julie Nathanson]]), a 15-year-old orphan who joined Zeta in his quest to prove his innocence. She usually acts as a wiser older sister to Zeta, who is often clueless about how to properly blend in with humans. She sees Zeta as family, and refuses to abandon him since she owes him her life. In one episode, it is revealed to Ro that she has a brother.\n* Agent James Bennet ([[Kurtwood Smith]]), the leader of the NSA team sent to capture Zeta. He vehemently believes that, regardless of Zeta's behavior, there is some sinister motive behind Zeta's sudden change in attitude and believes that he is working with the terrorist organization Brother's Day. Despite his supposed professionalism, he is seen to disobey orders himself, when it suits him, as well as abuse his authority. Although he overhears Dr. Selig's confession about giving Zeta a conscience, there is no sure sign that he will cease to be Zeta's enemy. \n* Agent West ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), a young, arrogant and egotistical agent whose desire to prove himself only results in annoying his superiors, coworkers, and virtually anyone else he meets, to the point that Ro no longer even considers him to be a threat. He shares a last name and is similar in appearance to [[Wally West]], the only Flash in the DCAU. Both characters are also voiced by Michael Rosenbaum.\n* Agent Lee ([[Lauren Tom]]), a compassionate female agent who comes to see Zeta in a more redeeming light, as he continues to go out of his way to help people. She later quits the team; later episodes imply that she was subsequently promoted, and is now able to occasionally help Zeta escape from the people that she worked for.\n* Agent Rush ([[Erika Alexander]] -Season 1, [[Dominique Jennings]] -Season 2), a by-the-book agent who replaces Lee after she quits the team.\n* Bucky Buenaventura ([[Ulises Cuadra]] -Season 1, Blayn Barbosa -Season 2), a child genius who occasionally aids Zeta and Ro.\n* Dr. Selig, ([[George Segal]] -Season 1, [[Hal Linden]] -Season 2), Zeta's hard-to-find creator.\n* Infiltration Unit 7, (Diedrich Bader -uncredited) - a later infiltration unit model who Zeta comes into conflict with after foiling one of his missions. Infiltration Unit 7 possesses all of Zeta's abilities, greater strength and durability, and a much larger arsenal. It is much less subtle in the execution of its duties than Zeta, and hence, from Zeta's viewpoint, it is evil.\n\n==Episodes==\n=== Season 1 (2001) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FC7309 |overall=5 |title=20 |director=16 |writer=16 |airdate=13 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = The Accomplice\n| DirectedBy      = Curt Geda\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Goodman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|1|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = Zeta is on the run from the [[NSA]].

They investigate, and find out that Sven kidnapped Wade to collect the ransom money from Wade's father. Zeta and Ro go to Sven's boat to stop him, and Sven says that he will kill Wade, Ro, and Zeta and turn the two of them in for the reward money. Zeta reveals that he is a robot to a shocked Wade. The three of them stop Sven, and Wade learns to respect his robots.\n| LineColor = FC7309\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Taffy Time\n| DirectedBy      = Tim Maltby\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Hilary J.

However, Ro realizes that once she is on the show, Bennett will be able to find her and will watch her, so she will never be able to see Zeta again. Zeta insists that she try to find her brother anyway, and so they separate. Later, Zeta sees a girl who had been on the show earlier. She is complaining that the woman she met was an actress, not her real mother. Zeta finds out that the show does not really find lost family members, but instead makes money by turning runaways back to the state. Zeta goes to save Ro. When Ro meets her 'brother,' she realizes that although he looks like her, he looks nothing like the picture she has. Zeta exposes the show to be a fake, and the producer, who did not know what was going on, vows to change it.

The house belongs to Bucky Buenventura, who had taken over the motorcycle. Bucky wants Zeta's help in finding his parents, who were kidnapped by Dr. Tannor. Zeta agrees, and they go with Bucky to the clinic where Dr. Tannor now works. Bucky's parents are working on a machine designed to rejuvenate patients, but it has malfunctioned, turning Bucky's parents and several patients into very small children. Dr. Tannor knocks Zeta out, and tells Bucky that if he fixes the machine, he will give Zeta and the Buenventuras back. Bucky grudgingly begins to fix the machine, but he cannot make it work.

The room is evacuated, and no one notices that Dr. Selig has been trapped in a cryogenic freeze unit. Zeta realizes that since the [[computer]] has malfunctioned, Dr. Selig will die unless Zeta helps him. Zeta controls the freeze unit to keep Dr. Selig's temperature secure until help can arrive.

Animation]]. It first aired on [[Kids' WB]] in January 2001. It is a spin-off series based on the character Zeta from the ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' episode of the same name. Consequently, it is set in the [[DC Animated Universe]]. The show was created by Robert Goodman and [[Warner Bros. Animation]].<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=724-725}}</ref>\n\nThe story's main character, Infiltration Unit Zeta, is a humanoid robot (synthoid) designed to carry out covert assassinations on the behalf of the [[National Security Agency]]. When Zeta discovers that one of his targets is innocent, he experiences an [[existential crisis]] about goodness and the value of life; following this epiphany, Zeta finds that he can no longer kill. The newly enlightened Zeta refuses to continue on as an infiltration unit and abandons his mission, going rogue. Zeta is pursued by a team of [[NSA]] agents, led by the obsessed Agent Bennett, and is aided by a 15-year-old runaway, Rosalie \"Ro\" Rowan.\n\nThe series was cancelled after two seasons.\n\n==Plot==\n''The Zeta Project'' follows the exploits of Zeta and Ro as they attempt to prove that he is genuinely non-violent, whereas the NSA agents pursuing him believe that the terrorists he was investigating before going rogue have reprogrammed him for some unknown purpose. To prove his innocence, Zeta and Ro search for his creator, the elusive Dr. Selig.\n\n==Characters==\n[[List of DC animated universe characters]]\n* Infiltration Unit Zeta ([[Diedrich Bader]]), nicknamed \"Zee\", the titular character. As an infiltration unit designed to seek and destroy specific people, Zeta has the ability to holographically disguise himself as any individual that he has seen, as well as create custom appearances through mixing and matching various physical traits. Though Zeta no longer possesses the vast array of weapons that he originally came equipped with, his arms are equipped with saw blades and cutting lasers. He also possesses a wide array of other non-lethal tools, such as handheld welding lasers and a computer interface. In addition, Zeta possesses great mechanical strength, has extensible limbs, and is capable of self-repair.\n* Rosalie \"Ro\" Rowan ([[Julie Nathanson]]), a 15-year-old orphan who joined Zeta in his quest to prove his innocence. She usually acts as a wiser older sister to Zeta, who is often clueless about how to properly blend in with humans. She sees Zeta as family, and refuses to abandon him since she owes him her life. In one episode, it is revealed to Ro that she has a brother.\n* Agent James Bennet ([[Kurtwood Smith]]), the leader of the NSA team sent to capture Zeta. He vehemently believes that, regardless of Zeta's behavior, there is some sinister motive behind Zeta's sudden change in attitude and believes that he is working with the terrorist organization Brother's Day. Despite his supposed professionalism, he is seen to disobey orders himself, when it suits him, as well as abuse his authority. Although he overhears Dr. Selig's confession about giving Zeta a conscience, there is no sure sign that he will cease to be Zeta's enemy. \n* Agent West ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), a young, arrogant and egotistical agent whose desire to prove himself only results in annoying his superiors, coworkers, and virtually anyone else he meets, to the point that Ro no longer even considers him to be a threat. He shares a last name and is similar in appearance to [[Wally West]], the only Flash in the DCAU. Both characters are also voiced by Michael Rosenbaum.\n* Agent Lee ([[Lauren Tom]]), a compassionate female agent who comes to see Zeta in a more redeeming light, as he continues to go out of his way to help people. She later quits the team; later episodes imply that she was subsequently promoted, and is now able to occasionally help Zeta escape from the people that she worked for.\n* Agent Rush ([[Erika Alexander]] -Season 1, [[Dominique Jennings]] -Season 2), a by-the-book agent who replaces Lee after she quits the team.\n* Bucky Buenaventura ([[Ulises Cuadra]] -Season 1, Blayn Barbosa -Season 2), a child genius who occasionally aids Zeta and Ro.\n* Dr. Selig, ([[George Segal]] -Season 1, [[Hal Linden]] -Season 2), Zeta's hard-to-find creator.\n* Infiltration Unit 7, (Diedrich Bader -uncredited) - a later infiltration unit model who Zeta comes into conflict with after foiling one of his missions. Infiltration Unit 7 possesses all of Zeta's abilities, greater strength and durability, and a much larger arsenal. It is much less subtle in the execution of its duties than Zeta, and hence, from Zeta's viewpoint, it is evil.\n\n==Episodes==\n=== Season 1 (2001) ===\n{{Episode table |background=#FC7309 |overall=5 |title=20 |director=16 |writer=16 |airdate=13 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = The Accomplice\n| DirectedBy      = Curt Geda\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Goodman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2001|1|27}}\n| ShortSummary    = Zeta is on the run from the [[NSA]].

Viswanath]]), despite being in a relationship with a woman named Yamini (not shown on-screen). He is an alcoholic and his teenage son Manohar ([[Ashwin]]) despises him. He has a daughter Manonmani ([[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]]) who was born out of wedlock to Yamini and was raised by Yamini's husband Jacob Zachariah ([[Jayaram (actor)|Jayaram]]) after Yamini's death. She also despises Manoranjan. He has been diagnosed with [[cancer staging|advanced stage]] [[brain cancer]] and has only a few more months to live, which is unknown to anyone including his own family. He is treated by his family doctor Dr. Arpana ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]), with whom he has an [[extramarital affair]].\n\nOne day, Manoranjan decides to withdraw from a film produced by Poornachandra Rao and instead act in a film produced by himself and directed by Margadarsi ([[K. Balachander]]), who was his mentor with whom he had fallen out when he married Varalakshmi and started acting in films directed and produced by Poornachandra Rao, who is a sworn enemy of Margadarsi. Despite their personal differences, Manoranjan wants Margadarsi to be the director of his last film before he dies. Margadarsi initially refuses to direct Manoranjan, but when he hears from Arpana about Manoranjan's terminal illness, he becomes moved and accepts to direct Manoranjan. When Poornachandra Rao and Varalakshmi find out about Manoranjan's plan, they get enraged and leave his house along with Manohar. Undaunted, Manoranjan goes ahead with his film.\n\nManoranjan's film with Margadarsi is titled ''Uttama Villain''. It is a [[fantasy film|fantasy-comedy film]] which tells the story of a street artist named Uttaman (played by Manoranjan) who has dodged death several times and hence is believed to be immortal. With the help of a princess named Karpagavalli (played by [[Pooja Kumar]]), he works to defeat the evil Muttharasan (played by [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]), who is obsessed to gain Karpagavalli and the whole Theeyam empire. During the shooting of the film, Manoranjan's condition worsens, and he is hospitalised several times. Margadarsi convinces Manoranjan to inform his family about his condition. This leads to a rapproachment with Poornachandra Rao (and also between Margadarsi and Poornachandra Rao) and a father-son bonding with Manohar. Varalakshmi, on the other hand, suffers a [[heart attack]] on hearing the news, though she soon recovers. She apologises to Manoranjan for her actions to forcibly separate him from Yamini so that she could marry him. Later, Manoranjan finds out that a letter he had written to Yamini shortly after they had separated, had not been delivered to her. When Manonmani reads this letter, which tells about Manoranjan's support for Yamini's decision to not undergo an [[abortion]] despite being pregnant out of wedlock, her hatred towards her biological father turns to love and she finally accepts him as her father.\n\nAfter completing the shooting of ''Uttama Villain'', Manoranjan becomes very sick, suffering from [[delirium]] as well as slurred speech and movement, and faints. He is immediately rushed to hospital. Margadarsi completes editing the film and plays it in the hospital. The people present in the hospital, including all the loved ones of Manoranjan, enjoy the film, which ends with Uttaman killing Muttharasan in a stage drama (Iraniya Naadagam), thus dodging death yet again. However, in real life, Arpana informs Manohar and Manonmani that Manoranjan had died.\n\nThe film ends with a screening of ''Uttama Villain'' in a theatre, which is enjoyed by the audience and turns out to be a massive hit.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Manoranjan, a popular actor in Tamil Nadu (plays Uthaman)\n* [[K.

Viswanath]]), despite being in a relationship with a woman named Yamini (not shown on-screen). He is an alcoholic and his teenage son Manohar ([[Ashwin]]) despises him. He has a daughter Manonmani ([[Parvathy Thiruvothu|Parvathy]]) who was born out of wedlock to Yamini and was raised by Yamini's husband Jacob Zachariah ([[Jayaram (actor)|Jayaram]]) after Yamini's death. She also despises Manoranjan. He has been diagnosed with [[cancer staging|advanced stage]] [[brain cancer]] and has only a few more months to live, which is unknown to anyone including his own family. He is treated by his family doctor Dr. Arpana ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]), with whom he has an [[extramarital affair]].\n\nOne day, Manoranjan decides to withdraw from a film produced by Poornachandra Rao and instead act in a film produced by himself and directed by Margadarsi ([[K. Balachander]]), who was his mentor with whom he had fallen out when he married Varalakshmi and started acting in films directed and produced by Poornachandra Rao, who is a sworn enemy of Margadarsi. Despite their personal differences, Manoranjan wants Margadarsi to be the director of his last film before he dies. Margadarsi initially refuses to direct Manoranjan, but when he hears from Arpana about Manoranjan's terminal illness, he becomes moved and accepts to direct Manoranjan. When Poornachandra Rao and Varalakshmi find out about Manoranjan's plan, they get enraged and leave his house along with Manohar. Undaunted, Manoranjan goes ahead with his film.\n\nManoranjan's film with Margadarsi is titled ''Uttama Villain''. It is a [[fantasy film|fantasy-comedy film]] which tells the story of a street artist named Uttaman (played by Manoranjan) who has dodged death several times and hence is believed to be immortal. With the help of a princess named Karpagavalli (played by [[Pooja Kumar]]), he works to defeat the evil Muttharasan (played by [[Nassar (actor)|Nassar]]), who is obsessed to gain Karpagavalli and the whole Theeyam empire. During the shooting of the film, Manoranjan's condition worsens, and he is hospitalised several times. Margadarsi convinces Manoranjan to inform his family about his condition. This leads to a rapproachment with Poornachandra Rao (and also between Margadarsi and Poornachandra Rao) and a father-son bonding with Manohar. Varalakshmi, on the other hand, suffers a [[heart attack]] on hearing the news, though she soon recovers. She apologises to Manoranjan for her actions to forcibly separate him from Yamini so that she could marry him. Later, Manoranjan finds out that a letter he had written to Yamini shortly after they had separated, had not been delivered to her. When Manonmani reads this letter, which tells about Manoranjan's support for Yamini's decision to not undergo an [[abortion]] despite being pregnant out of wedlock, her hatred towards her biological father turns to love and she finally accepts him as her father.\n\nAfter completing the shooting of ''Uttama Villain'', Manoranjan becomes very sick, suffering from [[delirium]] as well as slurred speech and movement, and faints. He is immediately rushed to hospital. Margadarsi completes editing the film and plays it in the hospital. The people present in the hospital, including all the loved ones of Manoranjan, enjoy the film, which ends with Uttaman killing Muttharasan in a stage drama (Iraniya Naadagam), thus dodging death yet again. However, in real life, Arpana informs Manohar and Manonmani that Manoranjan had died.\n\nThe film ends with a screening of ''Uttama Villain'' in a theatre, which is enjoyed by the audience and turns out to be a massive hit.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Manoranjan, a popular actor in Tamil Nadu (plays Uthaman)\n* [[K.

Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

[[Let's Play]] videos and comedic formatted shows. Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Due to this popularity, his coverage of [[indie game]]s has created an [[Oprah effect]], boosting sales for titles he plays.

He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nBentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the \"founder of historical [[philology]]\", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenism]], and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Richard Bentley blue plaque Bentley Square Oulton.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Bentley Square, Oulton]]\nBentley was born at [[Oulton, West Yorkshire|Oulton]] near [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, in northern England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}} A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley,{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=for both his father and Grandfather's names}} had suffered for the [[Charles I of England|Royalist]] cause following the [[English Civil War]], leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a [[stonemason]], had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nAfter attending [[grammar school]] in [[Wakefield]], Bentley was an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1676.{{efn|His portrait hangs in the formal dining hall of the College.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}} He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}{{sfn|ACAD|BNTY676R}}\n\n==Academic work==\nHe never became a [[Fellow]], but was appointed to be the headmaster of [[Spalding Grammar School]] before he was 21. [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nIn 1689, Stillingfleet became [[bishop of Worcester]], and Bentley's pupil went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met [[John Mill (theologian)|Dr John Mill]], [[Humphrey Hody]], and [[Edward Bernard]]. Here he studied the manuscripts of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek [[lexicographer]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nThe Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the ''[[editio princeps]]'') from the unique manuscript of the ''[[Greek Chronicle]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was a [[universal history]] (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called [[John Malalas]] or \"John the Rhetor\". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nBentley wrote the ''Epistola ad Johannem Millium'', which is about 100 pages included at the end of the ''Oxford Malalas'' (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]] and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of [[Humphrey Hody|Hody]], Mill or [[Edmund Chilmead]]. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\n[[Image:Bust of Richard Bently by Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Bentley now stands in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]\nIn 1690, Bentley had taken [[deacon]]'s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]], a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures (\"A Confutation of Atheism\"), he endeavours to present [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[physics]] in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nAfter being [[ordain]]ed, Bentley was promoted to a [[prebendal stall]] in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of \u00a3130 for life out of the \u00a3200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal [[chaplaincy]] and the [[Benefice|living]] of [[Hartlebury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nThat same year, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar [[Johann Georg Graevius]] of [[Utrecht]] made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on [[Albert Rubens (1614-1657)|Albert Rubens]], ''De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori'' (1694).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\n===Dissertation on the ''Epistles'' of Phalaris===\nBentley had official apartments in [[St. James's Palace]], and his first care was the royal library in [[Ashburnham House]]. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nThe [[University of Cambridge]] commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted [[John Evelyn]] in his ''Numismata''. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of [[Philostratus]], but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672\u20131715), \"to the joy,\" says [[Friedrich August Wolf|F. A. Wolf]], \"of Olearius and of no one else.\" He supplied [[Graevius]] with collations of [[Cicero]], and [[Joshua Barnes]] with a warning as to the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Euripides]]. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man who was ''perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti'' (boldfaced and lacking in judgement).<ref>{{cite journal|author1-last=Hanink |author1-first=Johanna |title=The Life of the Author in the Letters of Euripides |journal=Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies |date=2010 |volume=50 |issue=4 |page=540}}</ref> For Graevius's ''Callimachus'' (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nHe wrote the ''Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, [[William Wotton]], about to bring out a second edition of his ''Ancient and Modern Learning'', asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Phalaris]], long a subject of academic controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} The [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] editor of Phalaris, [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]], resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} cites Dr [[Alexander Dyce]], ''Bentley's Works, 1836\u20131838''</ref> The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\n===Master of Trinity College===\nIn 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical [[patronage]] recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician [[Rouse Ball]]{{sfn|Ball|1835|p=193}}  with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nAfter ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the [[bishop of Ely]] ([[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]]). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (''The Present State of Trinity College'', etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his ''[[Horace]]'' to the lord treasurer (Harley).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nThe Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nIn 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then [[Thomas Green (bishop)|Thomas Greene]]), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be executed by the vice-master [[Richard Walker (philosopher)|Richard Walker]], who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\n===Later studies===\nDuring his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to [[John Davies (1679\u20131732)|John Davies]]'s edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''Tusculan Disputations''. In the following year, he published his emendations on the ''Plutus'' and ''Nubes'' of [[Aristophanes]], and on the fragments of [[Menander]] and [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]]. He published the last work under the pen name of \"Phileleutherus Lipsiensis.\"  He used it again two years later in his ''Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking'', a reply to [[Anthony Collins]] the [[deism|deist]]. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nAlthough he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his edition quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 [[:wikt:emendations|emendations]] have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nIn 1716, in a letter to [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the [[New Testament]]. During the next four years, assisted by [[J. J. Wetstein]], an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published ''Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament'', with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the [[Vulgate]] with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].<!--EB1911 p. 752; states Nice not Nicaea-->{{sfn|Dyce|1966|p=487}} Bentley's lead manuscript was ''[[Codex Alexandrinus]]'', which he described as \"the oldest and best in the world\".{{sfn|Jebb|1882|p=163}} Bentley used also manuscripts: [[Minuscule 51|51]], [[Minuscule 54|54]], [[Minuscule 60|60]], [[Minuscule 113|113]], [[Minuscule 440|440]], [[Minuscule 507|507]], and [[Minuscule 508|508]].{{sfn|Scrivener|1894|p=198}} [[John Walker (scholar)|John Walker]] worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists.{{sfn|Wordsworth|1901|p=}} Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHis ''[[Terence]]'' (1726) is more important than his ''Horace''; next to the ''Phalaris'', this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the ''Fables'' of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] and the ''Sententiae'' of [[Publilius Syrus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nHis ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1732), suggested by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet [[John Milton]] had employed both an [[amanuensis]] and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} [[A. E. Housman]], who called him \"the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred\" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: \"...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...\".{{sfn|Housman|1989|p=268}}\n\nBentley never published his planned edition of [[Homer]], but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost ''[[digamma]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\n==Relationships and personal life==\nAccording to the anonymous author of his biography in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, [[James Henry Monk]], Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of [[Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet]] of Brampton, [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|Collins|1741|p=364}}  They had three children together:\n*[[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard]] (1708\u20131782), an eccentric, playwright and artist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|''SoPSE''}}{{sfn|Radcliffe|2011}}, and two daughters, one named Johanna.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} {{efn|A portrait, by [[William Wissing]] of his wife Joanna, is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] {{harv|ArtUK}}.}}\n\nHis daughter{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} Johanna Bentley{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} married [[Denison Cumberland]] in 1728, a grandson of [[Richard Cumberland (bishop)|Richard Cumberland]] the [[bishop of Peterborough]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} and himself later a bishop of the [[Church of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}Their son [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] developed as a prolific dramatist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} while earning his living as a civil servant.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects.

At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n*The [[British Museum]] eventually purchased the books, which in many cases had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nAccording to the anonymous author of his biography in the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition, Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only [[John Selden]], and, in a more restricted field, [[Thomas Gataker]] and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]].\n{{quote|Bentley inaugurated a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new path. With him criticism attained its majority. Where scholars had hitherto offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the whole material of learning, gave decisions|Jacob M\u00e4hly (1828\u20131902).<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cites {{harv| M\u00e4hly|1868}}</ref>}}\n\nThe modern German school of [[philology]] recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley \"was the founder of historical philology.\" [[Jakob Bernays]] says of his corrections of the ''Tristia'', \"corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British [[Samson]]\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nBentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as [[Richard Dawes|R Dawes]], [[Jeremiah Markland|J Markland]], [[John Taylor (1704\u20131766)|John Taylor]], [[Jonathan Toup]], [[Thomas Tyrwhitt|T Tyrwhitt]], [[Richard Porson]], [[Peter Paul Dobree]], [[Thomas Kidd (classical scholar)|Thomas Kidd]] and [[James Henry Monk]]. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]] on his edition of [[Julius Pollux]] made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nBentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by [[Alexander Pope]] (he was assigned a niche in ''The Dunciad''),<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cite  Pope ''Dunciad'', b. 4.</ref> [[John Arbuthnot]] and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} His classical controversies also called forth [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Battle of the Books]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Works==\n===Major===\n* ''Works of Richard Bentley'', collected by [[Alexander Dyce]], 1836. v. 1\u20132.

He was Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].\n\nBentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] learning and was known for his literary and textual criticism. Called the \"founder of historical [[philology]]\", Bentley is credited with the creation of the English school of [[Hellenism (Academia)|Hellenism]], and introduced the first competitive written examinations in a Western university.\n\n==Early life and education==\n[[File:Richard Bentley blue plaque Bentley Square Oulton.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque on Bentley Square, Oulton]]\nBentley was born at [[Oulton, West Yorkshire|Oulton]] near [[Rothwell, West Yorkshire|Rothwell]], [[Leeds]], West Yorkshire, in northern England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}} A blue plaque near his birthplace commemorates the fact. His father was Thomas Bentley of Oulton. His grandfather, Captain James Bentley,{{citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=for both his father and Grandfather's names}} had suffered for the [[Charles I of England|Royalist]] cause following the [[English Civil War]], leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Bentley's mother, the daughter of a [[stonemason]], had some education, and was able to give her son his first lessons in [[Latin language|Latin]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nAfter attending [[grammar school]] in [[Wakefield]], Bentley was an undergraduate at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], in 1676.{{efn|His portrait hangs in the formal dining hall of the College.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}}} He afterwards obtained a scholarship and took the degree of B.A. in 1680 (M.A. 1683).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}{{sfn|ACAD|BNTY676R}}\n\n==Academic work==\nHe never became a [[Fellow]], but was appointed to be the headmaster of [[Spalding Grammar School]] before he was 21. [[Edward Stillingfleet]], dean of St Paul's, hired Bentley as tutor to his son, which enabled the younger man to meet eminent scholars, have access to the best private library in England, and become familiar with Dean Stillingfleet. During his six years as tutor, Bentley also made a comprehensive study of [[Greek language|Greek]] and Latin writers, storing up knowledge which he used later.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nIn 1689, Stillingfleet became [[bishop of Worcester]], and Bentley's pupil went to [[Wadham College, Oxford]], accompanied by his tutor. Bentley soon met [[John Mill (theologian)|Dr John Mill]], [[Humphrey Hody]], and [[Edward Bernard]]. Here he studied the manuscripts of the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]], [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi]] and other college libraries. He collected material for literary studies. Among these are a corpus of the fragments of the Greek poets and an edition of the Greek [[lexicographer]]s.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nThe Oxford (Sheldonian) press was about to bring out an edition (the ''[[editio princeps]]'') from the unique manuscript of the ''[[Greek Chronicle]]'' in the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was a [[universal history]] (down to AD 560) of John of Antioch (date uncertain, between 600 and 1000), called [[John Malalas]] or \"John the Rhetor\". The editor, Dr John Mill, principal of [[St Edmund Hall, Oxford|St Edmund Hall]], asked Bentley to review it and make any remarks on the text.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nBentley wrote the ''Epistola ad Johannem Millium'', which is about 100 pages included at the end of the ''Oxford Malalas'' (1691). This short treatise placed Bentley ahead of all living English scholars. The ease with which he restored corrupted passages, the certainty of his [[:wikt:emendation|emendation]] and command over the relevant material, are in a style totally different from the careful and laborious learning of [[Humphrey Hody|Hody]], Mill or [[Edmund Chilmead]]. To the small circle of classical students (lacking the great critical dictionaries of modern times), it was obvious that he was a critic beyond the ordinary.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\n[[Image:Bust of Richard Bently by Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Roubiliac.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of Bentley now stands in the library of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]]]\nIn 1690, Bentley had taken [[deacon]]'s orders. In 1692 he was nominated first [[Boyle Lectures|Boyle lecturer]], a nomination repeated in 1694. He was offered the appointment a third time in 1695 but declined it, as he was involved in too many other activities. In the first series of lectures (\"A Confutation of Atheism\"), he endeavours to present [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] [[physics]] in a popular form, and to frame them (especially in opposition to [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]) into proof of the existence of an intelligent Creator. He had some correspondence with Newton, then living in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], on the subject. The second series, preached in 1694, has not been published and is believed to be lost.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nAfter being [[ordain]]ed, Bentley was promoted to a [[prebendal stall]] in [[Worcester Cathedral]]. In 1693 the curator of the royal library became vacant, and his friends tried to obtain the position for Bentley, but did not have enough influence. The new librarian, a Mr Thynne, resigned in favour of Bentley, on condition that he receive an annuity of \u00a3130 for life out of the \u00a3200 salary. In 1695 Bentley received a royal [[chaplaincy]] and the [[Benefice|living]] of [[Hartlebury]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\nThat same year, he was elected a fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and in 1696 earned the degree of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity). The scholar [[Johann Georg Graevius]] of [[Utrecht]] made a dedication to him, prefixed to a dissertation on [[Albert Rubens (1614-1657)|Albert Rubens]], ''De Vita Fl. Mallii Theodori'' (1694).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=750}}\n\n===Dissertation on the ''Epistles'' of Phalaris===\nBentley had official apartments in [[St. James's Palace]], and his first care was the royal library in [[Ashburnham House]]. He worked to restore the collection from a dilapidated condition. He persuaded the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Earl of Marlborough]] to ask for additional rooms in the palace for the books. This was granted, but Marlborough kept them for personal use. Bentley enforced the law, ensuring that publishers delivered nearly 1000 volumes which had been purchased but not delivered.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nThe [[University of Cambridge]] commissioned him to obtain Greek and Latin fonts for their classical books; he had these made in Holland. He assisted [[John Evelyn]] in his ''Numismata''. Bentley did not settle down to the steady execution of any of the major projects he had started. In 1694, he designed an edition of [[Philostratus]], but abandoned it to Gottfried Olearius (1672\u20131715), \"to the joy,\" says [[Friedrich August Wolf|F. A. Wolf]], \"of Olearius and of no one else.\" He supplied [[Graevius]] with collations of [[Cicero]], and [[Joshua Barnes]] with a warning as to the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Euripides]]. Barnes printed the epistles anyway and declared that no one could doubt their authenticity but a man who was ''perfrictae frontis aut judicii imminuti'' (boldfaced and lacking in judgement).<ref>{{cite journal|author1-last=Hanink |author1-first=Johanna |title=The Life of the Author in the Letters of Euripides |journal=Greek, Roman and Byzantine Studies |date=2010 |volume=50 |issue=4 |page=540}}</ref> For Graevius's ''Callimachus'' (1697), Bentley added a collection of the fragments with notes.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nHe wrote the ''Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris'' (1699), his major academic work, almost accidentally. In 1697, [[William Wotton]], about to bring out a second edition of his ''Ancient and Modern Learning'', asked Bentley to write out a paper exposing the spuriousness of the ''Epistles'' of [[Phalaris]], long a subject of academic controversy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} The [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] editor of Phalaris, [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery|Charles Boyle]], resented Bentley's paper. He had already quarrelled with Bentley in trying to get the manuscript in the royal library collated for his edition (1695). Boyle wrote a response which was accepted by the reading public, although it was much later criticised as showing superficial learning.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} cites Dr [[Alexander Dyce]], ''Bentley's Works, 1836\u20131838''</ref> The demand for Boyle's book required a second printing. When Bentley responded, it was with his dissertation. The truth of its conclusions was not immediately recognised, but it has a high reputation.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\n===Master of Trinity College===\nIn 1700, the commissioners of ecclesiastical [[patronage]] recommended Bentley to the Crown for the mastership of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He arrived an outsider and proceeded to reform the college administration.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}} He started a programme of renovations to the buildings, and used his position to promote learning. He is also credited by the British mathematician [[Rouse Ball]]{{sfn|Ball|1835|p=193}}  with starting the first written examinations in the West in 1702, all those prior to this being oral in nature.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} At the same time, he antagonised the fellows, and the capital programme caused reductions in their incomes, which they resented.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nAfter ten years of stubborn but ineffectual resistance, the fellows appealed to the Visitor, the [[bishop of Ely]] ([[John Moore (Bishop of Ely)|John Moore]]). Their petition was full of general complaints. Bentley's reply (''The Present State of Trinity College'', etc., 1710) is in his most crushing style. The fellows amended their petition and added a charge of Bentley's having committed 54 breaches of the statutes. Bentley appealed directly to the Crown, and backed his application with a dedication of his ''[[Horace]]'' to the lord treasurer (Harley).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nThe Crown lawyers decided against him; the case was heard (1714) and a sentence of expulsion from the mastership was drawn up. Before it was executed, the bishop of Ely died and the process lapsed. The feud continued in various forms at lower levels. In 1718 Cambridge rescinded Bentley's degrees, as punishment for failing to appear in the vice-chancellor's court in a civil suit. It was not until 1724 that he had them restored under the law.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nIn 1733 the fellows of Trinity again brought Bentley to trial before the bishop of Ely (then [[Thomas Green (bishop)|Thomas Greene]]), and he was sentenced to deprivation. The college statutes required the sentence to be executed by the vice-master [[Richard Walker (philosopher)|Richard Walker]], who was a friend of Bentley and refused to act. Although the feud continued until 1738 or 1740 (about thirty years in all), Bentley remained in his post.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\n===Later studies===\nDuring his mastership, except for the first two years, Bentley continuously pursued his studies, although he did not publish much. In 1709 he contributed a critical appendix to [[John Davies (1679\u20131732)|John Davies]]'s edition of [[Cicero]]'s ''Tusculan Disputations''. In the following year, he published his emendations on the ''Plutus'' and ''Nubes'' of [[Aristophanes]], and on the fragments of [[Menander]] and [[Philemon (poet)|Philemon]]. He published the last work under the pen name of \"Phileleutherus Lipsiensis.\"  He used it again two years later in his ''Remarks on a late Discourse of Freethinking'', a reply to [[Anthony Collins]] the [[deism|deist]]. The university thanked him for this work and its support of the Anglican Church and clergy.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nAlthough he had long studied Horace, Bentley wrote his edition quickly in the end, publishing it in 1711 to gain public support at a critical period of the Trinity quarrel. In the preface, he declared his intention of confining his attention to criticism and correction of the text. Some of his 700 or 800 [[:wikt:emendations|emendations]] have been accepted, but the majority were rejected by the early 20th century as unnecessary, although scholars acknowledged they showed his wide learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=751}}\n\nIn 1716, in a letter to [[William Wake]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], Bentley announced his plan to prepare a critical edition of the [[New Testament]]. During the next four years, assisted by [[J. J. Wetstein]], an eminent biblical critic, he collected materials for the work. In 1720 he published ''Proposals for a New Edition of the Greek Testament'', with examples of how he intended to proceed. By comparing the text of the [[Vulgate]] with that of the oldest Greek manuscripts, Bentley proposed to restore the Greek text as received by the church at the time of the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]].<!--EB1911 p. 752; states Nice not Nicaea-->{{sfn|Dyce|1966|p=487}} Bentley's lead manuscript was ''[[Codex Alexandrinus]]'', which he described as \"the oldest and best in the world\".{{sfn|Jebb|1882|p=163}} Bentley used also manuscripts: [[Minuscule 51|51]], [[Minuscule 54|54]], [[Minuscule 60|60]], [[Minuscule 113|113]], [[Minuscule 440|440]], [[Minuscule 507|507]], and [[Minuscule 508|508]].{{sfn|Scrivener|1894|p=198}} [[John Walker (scholar)|John Walker]] worked over many manuscripts for the project, particularly in Paris with the help of the [[Congregation of Saint Maur|Maur]]ists.{{sfn|Wordsworth|1901|p=}} Numerous subscribers were obtained to support publication of the work, but he never completed it.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nHis ''[[Terence]]'' (1726) is more important than his ''Horace''; next to the ''Phalaris'', this most determined his reputation. In 1726 he also published the ''Fables'' of [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] and the ''Sententiae'' of [[Publilius Syrus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nHis ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1732), suggested by [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]], has been criticised as the weakest of his work. He suggested that the poet [[John Milton]] had employed both an [[amanuensis]] and an editor, who were responsible for clerical errors and interpolations, but it is unclear whether Bentley believed his own position.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} [[A. E. Housman]], who called him \"the greatest scholar that England or perhaps that Europe ever bred\" nevertheless criticised his poetic sensibility severely: \"...we are not all so easily found out as Bentley, because we have not Bentley's intrepid candour. There is a sort of savage nobility about his firm reliance on his own bad taste...\".{{sfn|Housman|1989|p=268}}\n\nBentley never published his planned edition of [[Homer]], but some of his manuscript and marginal notes are held by Trinity College. Their chief importance is in his attempt to restore the metre by the insertion of the lost ''[[digamma]]''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\n==Relationships and personal life==\nAccording to the anonymous author of his biography in the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], Bentley was self-assertive and presumptuous, which alienated some people. But, [[James Henry Monk]], Bentley's biographer, charged him (in his first edition, 1830) with an indecorum of which he was not guilty. Bentley seemed to inspire mixed feelings of admiration and repugnance.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1701, Bentley married Joanna (died 1740), daughter of [[Sir John Bernard, 2nd Baronet]] of Brampton, [[Huntingdonshire]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|Collins|1741|p=364}}  They had three children together:\n*[[Richard Bentley (writer)|Richard]] (1708\u20131782), an eccentric, playwright and artist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}{{sfn|''SoPSE''}}{{sfn|Radcliffe|2011}}, and two daughters, one named Johanna.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} {{efn|A portrait, by [[William Wissing]] of his wife Joanna, is in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] {{harv|ArtUK}}.}}\n\nHis daughter{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} Johanna Bentley{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} married [[Denison Cumberland]] in 1728, a grandson of [[Richard Cumberland (bishop)|Richard Cumberland]] the [[bishop of Peterborough]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} and himself later a bishop of the [[Church of Ireland]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}Their son [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] developed as a prolific dramatist,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} while earning his living as a civil servant.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn old age, Bentley continued to read; and enjoyed the society of his friends and several rising scholars, J Markland, John Taylor, and his nephews Richard and Thomas Bentley, with whom he discussed classical subjects. He died on the 14 July 1742 of [[pleurisy]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\n==Legacy and honours==\n*Bentley left about \u00a35,000 in his estate (which would have the buying power of nearly \u00a3500,000 in 2010{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n*He bequeathed a few Greek manuscripts, brought from [[Mount Athos]], to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n*He bequeathed his books and papers to his nephew Richard Bentley, a fellow of Trinity. At his own death in 1786, the younger Bentley left the papers to the Trinity College library.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n*The [[British Museum]] eventually purchased the books, which in many cases had valuable manuscript notes, and holds them in its collection.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nAccording to the anonymous author of his biography in the ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition, Bentley was the first Englishman to be ranked with the great heroes of classical learning. Before him there were only [[John Selden]], and, in a more restricted field, [[Thomas Gataker]] and [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]].\n{{quote|Bentley inaugurated a new era of the art of criticism. He opened a new path. With him criticism attained its majority. Where scholars had hitherto offered suggestions and conjectures, Bentley, with unlimited control over the whole material of learning, gave decisions|Jacob M\u00e4hly (1828\u20131902).<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cites {{harv| M\u00e4hly|1868}}</ref>}}\n\nThe modern German school of [[philology]] recognised his genius. Bunsen wrote that Bentley \"was the founder of historical philology.\" [[Jakob Bernays]] says of his corrections of the ''Tristia'', \"corruptions which had hitherto defied every attempt even of the mightiest, were removed by a touch of the fingers of this British [[Samson]]\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nBentley was credited with creating the English school of Hellenists, by which the 18th century was distinguished, including scholars such as [[Richard Dawes|R Dawes]], [[Jeremiah Markland|J Markland]], [[John Taylor (1704\u20131766)|John Taylor]], [[Jonathan Toup]], [[Thomas Tyrwhitt|T Tyrwhitt]], [[Richard Porson]], [[Peter Paul Dobree]], [[Thomas Kidd (classical scholar)|Thomas Kidd]] and [[James Henry Monk]]. Although the Dutch school of the period had its own tradition, it was also influenced by Bentley. His letters to [[Tiberius Hemsterhuis]] on his edition of [[Julius Pollux]] made the latter one of Bentley's most devoted admirers.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}}\n\nBentley inspired a following generation of scholars. Self-taught, he created his own discipline; but no contemporary English guild of learning could measure his power or check his eccentricities. He defeated his academic adversaries in the Phalaris controversy. The attacks by [[Alexander Pope]] (he was assigned a niche in ''The Dunciad''),<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} cite  Pope ''Dunciad'', b. 4.</ref> [[John Arbuthnot]] and others demonstrated their inability to appreciate his work, as they considered textual criticism as pedantry.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} His classical controversies also called forth [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Battle of the Books]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn a university where the instruction of youth or the religious controversy of the day was the chief occupation, Bentley was unique. His learning and original views seem to have been developed before 1700. After this period, he acquired little and made only spasmodic efforts to publish.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=752}} However A.E.Housman believed that the edition of [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]] (1739) was Bentley's greatest work.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Works==\n===Major===\n* ''Works of Richard Bentley'', collected by [[Alexander Dyce]], 1836. v. 1\u20132.
