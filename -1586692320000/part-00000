In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application's [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose.\n\nRPA tools have strong technical similarities to [[graphical user interface testing]] tools. These tools also automate interactions with the GUI, and often do so by [[programming by demonstration|repeating a set of demonstration actions]] performed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems that allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receiving [[email]] containing an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into a [[bookkeeping]] system. \n\n==Historic evolution==\n\nAs a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form of [[screen scraping]], which can be traced back to early forms of malware. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting of [[API]] integration into other enterprise applications, connectors into [[ITSM]] systems, [[terminal services]] and even some types of [[AI]]/[[ML]] services such as [[image recognition]].

The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in a [[virtual environment]] and not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent of [[virtualization]] technology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.<ref>[http://www.kpmg-institutes.com/content/dam/kpmg/sharedservicesoutsourcinginstitute/pdf/2015/robotics-improve-legacy-sourcing.pdf]</ref>\n\nThere are however several risks with RPA.
