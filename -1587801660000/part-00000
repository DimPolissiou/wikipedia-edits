The temple is an important pilgrimage destination. The present temple was rebuilt from the 10th century onwards, on the site of an earlier temple, and begun by King [[Anantavarman Codaganga|Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva]], first of the [[Eastern Ganga dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.asianart.com/articles/patachitra/index.html#4 |title=Bernard Cesarone: Pata-chitras of Odisha |first=Bernard |last= Cesarone|work=asianart.com |year=2012 |quote=This temple was built in approximately 1135-1150 by Codaganga, a king of the Eastern Ganga dynasty |accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Puri temple is famous for its annual [[Rath Yatra|Ratha yatra]], or [[Temple car|chariot]] festival, in which the three principal [[deities]] are pulled on huge and elaborately decorated [[temple car]]s.

Ramanuja established the Emar Mutt near the temple and the Govardhan Mutt, which is the seat of one of the four Shankaracharyas.

A 1134\u20131135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=50}}\n\nAccording to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by [[Anangabhima-deva II]]: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=50-51}} This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=51}} The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings, including those of the Ganga dynasty and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryvamshi]] (Gajapati) dynasty.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=51-52}}\n\n==Deities==\n[[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]] are a trio of deities worshipped at the temple.

Having heard about the deity, King [[Indradyumna]] sent a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to locate the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his best but could not locate the place. But at last he managed to marry Viswavasu's daughter Lalita. At repeated request of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped.\n\nVidyapati was very intelligent. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on the way. The seeds germinated after a few days, which enabled him to find out the cave later on. On hearing from him, King [[Indradyumna]] proceeded immediately to Odra desha (Odisha) on a pilgrimage to see and worship the Deity. But the deity had disappeared. The king was disappointed. The Deity was hidden in sand. The king was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast unto death at Mount Neela, Then a celestial voice cried 'thou shalt see him.'  Afterward, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. Sri [[Narasimha]] Murti brought by Narada was installed in the temple. During sleep, the king had a vision of Lord [[Jagannath]]. Also an astral voice directed him to receive the fragrant tree on the seashore and make idols out of it. Accordingly, the king got the image of Lord [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]], [[Subhadra]] and Chakra [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshan]] made out of the wood of the divine tree and installed them in the temple.\n\n'''[[Indradyumna]]'s prayer to Lord Brahma'''\n\nKing [[Indradyumna]] put up for [[Jagannath]] the tallest monument of the world. It was 1,000 cubits high. He invited Lord [[Brahma]], the cosmic creator, consecrate the temple and the images.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |title=Sri Jagannath Puri Dham Information - Jagannath |work=jagannathpuri-info.net |year=2012 |quote=The King wanted Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704050957/http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |archive-date=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nBrahma came all the way from Heaven for this purpose. Seeing the temple he was immensely pleased with him. Brahma asked [[Indradyumna]] as to in what way can he (Brahma) fulfill the king's desire, since was very much pleased with him for his having put the most beautiful Temple for Lord [[Vishnu]]. With folded hands, [[Indradyumna]] said, \"My Lord if you are really pleased with me, kindly bless me with one thing, and it is that I should be issueless and that I should be the last member of my family.\" In case anybody left alive after him, he would only take pride as the owner of the temple and would not work for the society.\n\n====Legend surrounding the Temple origin====\nThe traditional story concerning the origins of the Lord Jagannath temple is that here the original image of Jagannath (a [[deity]] form of [[Vishnu]]) at the end of [[Treta yuga]] manifested near a [[banyan]] tree, near [[Coast|seashore]] in the form of an [[Blue Sapphire|Indranila mani]] or the Blue Jewel.  It was so dazzling that it could grant instant [[moksha]], so the God [[Dharma]] or [[Yama]] wanted to hide it in the earth and was successful. In Dvapara Yuga King Indradyumna of [[Avanti (India)|Malwa]] wanted to find that mysterious image and to do so he performed harsh [[penance]]s to obtain his goal. Vishnu then instructed him to go to the Puri [[Coast|seashore]] and find a floating log to make an image from its trunk.\n\nThe King found the log of wood. He did a yajna from which God Yajna [[Nrisimha]] appeared and instructed that [[Narayana]] should be made as fourfold expansion, i.e. Paramatma as ''Vasudeva'', his Vyuha as ''Samkarshana'', Yogamaya as ''Subhadra'', and his Vibhava as''Sudarsana''. [[Vishwakarma]] appeared in the form of an artisan and prepared images of Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and Subhadra from the tree.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.templenet.com/Orissa/puri.html\n|title=Jagannath Temple at Puri\n|accessdate=12 September 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen this log, radiant with light was seen floating in the sea, Narada told the king to make three idols out of it and place them in a pavilion. Indradyumna got Visvakarma, the architect of Gods, to build a magnificent temple to house the idols and Vishnu himself appeared in the guise of a carpenter to make the idols on condition that he was to be left undisturbed until he finished the work.\n\nBut just after two weeks, the Queen became very anxious. She took the carpenter to be dead as no sound came from the temple. Therefore, she requested the king to open the door. Thus, they went to see Vishnu at work at which the latter abandoned his work leaving the idols unfinished. The idol was devoid of any hands. But a divine voice told Indradyumana to install them in the temple. It has also been widely believed that in spite of the idol being without hands, it can watch over the world and be its lord. Thus the idiom.\n\n[[File:Rath Yatra Puri 07-11027.jpg|thumb|x216px|text|The [[Rath Yatra]] in Puri in modern times showing the three chariots of the deities with the Temple in the background.]]\n\n==Invasions and desecrations of the Temple==\nThe temple annals, the [[Madala Panji]] records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dash |first1=Abhimanyu |title=Invasions on the Temple of Lord Jagannath, Puri |journal=Orissa Review |date=July 2011 |pages=82\u201389 |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |accessdate=4 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125621/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> In 1692, Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] ordered to close the temple until he wanted to reopen it otherwise it would be demolished, the local Mughal officials who came to carry out the job were requested by the locals and the temple was merely closed.

Another legend claims him to be [[Nilamadhava]], an image of Narayana made of blue stone and worshipped by the aboriginals. He was brought to [[Nilagiri]] (blue mountain) or Nilachala and installed there as Shri [[Jagannath]] in company with [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]]. The images made of wood are also claimed to have their distant linkage with the aboriginal system of worshipping wooden poles. To cap it all the Daitapatis, who have a fair share of responsibilities to perform rituals of the Temple, are claimed to be descendants of the aboriginals or hill tribes of Odisha. So we may safely claim that the beginning of the cultural history of Shrikshetra is found in the fusion of Hindu and Tribal Cultures. The three deities came to be claimed as the symbols of [[Samyak Darshan]], [[Samyak Jnana]] and [[Samyak Charita]] usually regarded as Triratha (of the [[Jain]] culture), an assimilation of which leads to [[Moksha]] ([[salvation]]) or the ultimate bliss...\n\nJagannath is worshipped as Vishnu or [[Narayana]] or [[Krishna]] and Lord [[Balabhadra]] as [[Shesha]]. Simultaneously, the deities are regarded as the [[bhairava]] with [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] (the [[devi]] or the consort of Shiva) installed in the campus of the temple. So ultimately we find a fusion of [[Saivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] of the Hindu religion with [[Jainism]] and up to an extent Buddhism in the culture of Jagannath and the cultural tradition so reverently held together in Shrikshetra.\n\n===Acharyas and Jagannatha Puri===\nAll of the renowned acharyas including [[Madhvacharya]] have been known to visit this kshetra. [[Adi Shankara]] established his [[Govardhana matha]] here.  There is also evidence that [[Guru Nanak]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ramanujacharya]], and [[Nimbarkacharya]] had visited this place. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] stayed here for 24 years, establishing that the love of God can be spread by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Srimad Vallabhacharya visited Jagannath Puri and performed a 7-day recitation of Srimad Bhagvat. His sitting place is still famous as \"baithakji.\" It confirms his visit to [[Puri]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Srimandir/srimandirenglish/Epdf/Ech1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410074454/http://orissagov.nic.in/e-magazine/Srimandir/srimandirenglish/Epdf/Ech1.pdf |archivedate=10 April 2009  }}</ref>\n\nA famous incident took place when Vallabhachrya visited. There was a discourse being held between the Brahmins and 4 questions were asked. Who is the highest of Gods, What is the highest of mantras, What is the highest scripture and What is the highest service. The discourse went on for many days with many schools of thought. Finally Shri Vallabh said to ask Lord Jagannath to confirm Shri Vallabh's answers. A pen and paper were left in the inner sanctum. After some time, the doors were opened and 4 answers were written. 1) The Son of Devaki (Krishna) is the God of Gods 2) His name is the highest of mantras 3) His song is the highest scripture (Bhagavat Geeta) 4) Service to Him is the Highest service. The king was shocked and declared Shri Vallabh the winner of the discourse. Some of the pandits who participated became jealous of Shri Vallabh and wanted to test Him. The next day was Ekadashi, a fasting day where one must fast from grains. The pandits gave Shri Vallabh rice Prasad of Shri Jagannathji (The temple is famous for this). If Shri Vallabh ate it, He would break His vow of fasting but if He did not take it, He would disrespect Lord Jagannath. Shri Vallabh accepted the prasad in his hand and spent the rest of the day and night explaining slokas of the greatness of Prasad and ate the rice the next morning.\n\n===Char Dham===\nThe temple is one of the holiest [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] ''[[Char Dham]]'' (four divine sites) sites comprising [[Rameswaram]], [[Badrinath]], [[Puri]] and [[Dwarka]].{{sfn|Mahadev Chakravarti|1986|p=140}} Though the origins are not clearly known, the [[Advaita]] school of Hinduism propagated by [[Sankaracharya]], who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mittal|first=Sushil|title=The Hindu World|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-64470-0|page=482}}</ref> The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are [[Badrinath Temple]] at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarakadheesh Temple]] at Dwarka in the West and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] at Rameswaram in the South.

They are named after the sculptures of animals guarding them. The other entrances are the '''Hathidwara''' or the Elephant Gate, the '''Vyaghradwara''' or the Tiger Gate and the '''Ashwadwara''' or the Horse Gate.\n\n===Minor temples===\n[[File:Minor temples in Jagannath Puri.jpg|thumb|Cluster of minor temples in the southern part of Jagannath temple complex, including the [[Vimala Temple]] (extreme right). c. 1890.]]\nThere are numerous smaller temples and shrines within the Temple complex where active worship is regularly conducted. The [[Vimala Temple]] (Bimala Temple) is considered one of the most important of the [[Shaktipeeth]]s marks the spot where the Goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]'s navel fell. It is located near [[Pancha Tirtha of Puri|Rohini Kund]] in the temple complex. Until food offered to Jagannath is offered to Goddess Vimala it is not considered [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]].\n\nThe temple of [[Mahalakshmi]] has an important role in rituals of the main temple. It is said that preparation of [[naivedhya|naivedya]] as offering for Jagannath is supervised by Mahalakshmi. The Kanchi Ganesh Temple is dedicated to [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]. Tradition says the King of [[Kanchipuram]] (Kanchi) in ancient times gifted the idol, when Gajapati Purushottama Deva married Padmavati, the ''kanchi'' princess. There are other shrines namely [[utkala brahmin|Muktimandap]], [[Surya]], [[Saraswati]], [[Bhuvaneshwari]], [[Narasimha]], [[Rama]], [[Hanuman]] and [[Shiva|Eshaneshwara]].\n\n===The Mandapas===\n[[File:Dola Mandap.jpg|thumb|150px|The Dola Mandapa in 1890 where the annual Dol Yatra is held.]]\nThere are many [[Mandapa]]s or Pillared halls on raised platforms within the temple complex meant for religious congregations.

The '''Dola Mandapa''' is noteworthy for a beautifully carved stone [[Torana]] or arch which is used for constructing a swing for the annual Dol Yatra festival. During the festival the idol of Dologobinda is placed on the swing. The Snana Bedi is a rectangular stone platform where idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra are placed for ceremonial bathing during the annual [[Snana Yatra]].\n\n==Daily food offerings==\n{{Main|Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)}}\nDaily offerings are made to the Lord six times a day.

There are many festivals each year attended by millions of people. The most important festival is the [[Temple car|Rath]] Yatra or the Chariot festival in June. This spectacular festival includes a procession of three huge chariots bearing the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra through the '''Bada Danda''' meaning the Grand Avenue of Puri till their final destination the [[Gundicha Temple]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.templenet.com/Orissa/puri.html\n|title=Jagannath Temple at Puri\n|accessdate=20 September 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nEarly European observers told tales of devotees being crushed under the wheels of these chariots, whether by accident or even as a form of meritorious suicide akin to [[Sati (practice)|suttee]].  These reports gave rise to the loan word [[juggernaut]] suggesting an immense, unstoppable, threatening entity or process operated by fanatics.\nMany festivals like [[holi|Dol Yatra]] in spring and [[raksha bandhan|Jhulan Yatra]] in monsoon are celebrated by temple every year. '''Pavitrotsava''' and '''Damanaka utsava''' are celebrated as per [[panchanga]] or [[panjika]].There are special ceremonies in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] and [[Pausha]].\n\nThe annual ''shodasha dinatmaka'' or 16-day puja beginning 8 days prior to [[Mahalaya]] of [[Ashwin]] month for Goddess [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] and ending on [[Vijayadashami]], is of great importance, in which both the utsava murty of lord [[krishna|Madanmohan]] and [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] take part.\n* Pana Sankranti: Also known or [[Vishuva Sankranti]] and [[Mesha (Indian astrology)|Mesha]] [[Sankranti]]: Special rituals are performed at the temple.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fullodisha.com/puri/temple_festivals.htm |title=Festivals of lord jagannath, puri festivals   |work=fullorissa.com |year=2010  |quote=Pana Sankranti or Mahabishuba sankranti: |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chandan Yatra===\n{{main|Chandan Yatra}}\nIn [[Akshaya Tritiya]] every year the [[Chandan Yatra]] festival marks the commencement of the construction of the Chariots of the Rath Yatra.\n\n===Snnana Yatra===\nOn the [[Full Moon|Purnima]] of the month of [[Jyestha]] the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of [[Snana Yatra]].\n\n===Anavasara or Anasara===\n{{main|Snana Yatra}}\nLiterally means vacation.

This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey ([[yatra]]) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct.{{sfn|O. M. Starza|1993|p=16}} The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne.{{Sfn|Das|1982|p=40}} The huge chariots of Jagannath pulled during Rath Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word [[Juggernaut]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Juggernaut-Definition and Meaning|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/juggernaut|publisher=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref> The Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra.\n\nThe most significant ritual associated with the Ratha-Yatra is the ''chhera pahara''. During the festival, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati King]] wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the ''Chera Pahara'' (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion.  As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]n kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Lord Jagannath yatra to begin soon|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|accessdate=28 November 2012|newspaper=IBN Live|date=4 July 2008}}</ref>\n''Chera pahara'' is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at [[Mausi Maa Temple]] and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.\n\nAs per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in ''Pahandi vijay''.\n\nIn the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the [[Gundicha Temple]], where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in ''bahuda yatra''. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered ''Poda Pitha,'' a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the Odisha people only.\n\nThe observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in [[Brahma Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], and [[Skanda Purana]]. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In [[Moghul]] period also, King Ramsingh of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]] has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Kings of [[Mayurbhanj District|Mayurbhanj]] and [[Parlakhemundi]] were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.\n\nMoreover, Starza{{sfn|O. M. Starza|1993|p=133}} notes that the ruling [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. [[Friar Odoric]] of Pordenone visited India in 1316\u20131318, some 20 years after [[Marco Polo]] had dictated the account of his travels while in a [[Genoa|Genoese]] prison.{{sfn|Partha Mitter|1977|p=10}} In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \"idols\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \"church\" with song and music.{{sfn|O.

A 1134\u20131135 CE inscription records his donation to the temple. Therefore, the temple construction must have started sometime after 1112 CE.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=50}}\n\nAccording to a story in the temple chronicles, it was founded by [[Anangabhima-deva II]]: different chronicles variously mention the year of construction as 1196, 1197, 1205, 1216, or 1226.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=50-51}} This suggests that the temple's construction was completed or that the temple was renovated during the reign of Anantavarman's son Anangabhima.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|p=51}} The temple complex was further developed during the reigns of the subsequent kings, including those of the Ganga dynasty and the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Suryvamshi]] (Gajapati) dynasty.{{sfn|Suryanarayan Das|2010|pp=51-52}}\n\n==Deities==\n[[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]] are a trio of deities worshipped at the temple.

Having heard about the deity, King [[Indradyumna]] sent a Brahmin priest, Vidyapati to locate the deity, who was worshipped secretly in a dense forest by Viswavasu. Vidyapati tried his best but could not locate the place. But at last he managed to marry Viswavasu's daughter Lalita. At repeated request of Vidyapti, Viswavasu took his son-in-law blind folded to a cave where Lord Neela Madhaba was worshipped.\n\nVidyapati was very intelligent. He dropped mustard seeds on the ground on the way. The seeds germinated after a few days, which enabled him to find out the cave later on. On hearing from him, King [[Indradyumna]] proceeded immediately to Odra desha (Odisha) on a pilgrimage to see and worship the Deity. But the deity had disappeared. The king was disappointed. The Deity was hidden in sand. The king was determined not to return without having a darshan of the deity and observed fast unto death at Mount Neela, Then a celestial voice cried 'thou shalt see him.'  Afterward, the king performed a horse sacrifice and built a magnificent temple for Vishnu. Sri [[Narasimha]] Murti brought by Narada was installed in the temple. During sleep, the king had a vision of Lord [[Jagannath]]. Also an astral voice directed him to receive the fragrant tree on the seashore and make idols out of it. Accordingly, the king got the image of Lord [[Jagannath]], [[Balabhadra]], [[Subhadra]] and Chakra [[Sudarshana Chakra|Sudarshan]] made out of the wood of the divine tree and installed them in the temple.\n\n'''[[Indradyumna]]'s prayer to Lord Brahma'''\n\nKing [[Indradyumna]] put up for [[Jagannath]] the tallest monument of the world. It was 1,000 cubits high. He invited Lord [[Brahma]], the cosmic creator, consecrate the temple and the images.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |title=Sri Jagannath Puri Dham Information - Jagannath |work=jagannathpuri-info.net |year=2012 |quote=The King wanted Lord Brahma to consecrate the temple |accessdate=26 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704050957/http://www.jagannathpuri-info.net/storypuri.php |archive-date=4 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nBrahma came all the way from Heaven for this purpose. Seeing the temple he was immensely pleased with him. Brahma asked [[Indradyumna]] as to in what way can he (Brahma) fulfill the king's desire, since was very much pleased with him for his having put the most beautiful Temple for Lord [[Vishnu]]. With folded hands, [[Indradyumna]] said, \"My Lord if you are really pleased with me, kindly bless me with one thing, and it is that I should be issueless and that I should be the last member of my family.\" In case anybody left alive after him, he would only take pride as the owner of the temple and would not work for the society.\n\n====Legend surrounding the Temple origin====\nThe traditional story concerning the origins of the Lord Jagannath temple is that here the original image of Jagannath (a [[deity]] form of [[Vishnu]]) at the end of [[Treta yuga]] manifested near a [[banyan]] tree, near [[Coast|seashore]] in the form of an [[Blue Sapphire|Indranila mani]] or the Blue Jewel.  It was so dazzling that it could grant instant [[moksha]], so the God [[Dharma]] or [[Yama]] wanted to hide it in the earth and was successful. In Dvapara Yuga King Indradyumna of [[Avanti (India)|Malwa]] wanted to find that mysterious image and to do so he performed harsh [[penance]]s to obtain his goal. Vishnu then instructed him to go to the Puri [[Coast|seashore]] and find a floating log to make an image from its trunk.\n\nThe King found the log of wood. He did a yajna from which God Yajna [[Nrisimha]] appeared and instructed that [[Narayana]] should be made as fourfold expansion, i.e. Paramatma as ''Vasudeva'', his Vyuha as ''Samkarshana'', Yogamaya as ''Subhadra'', and his Vibhava as''Sudarsana''. [[Vishwakarma]] appeared in the form of an artisan and prepared images of Jagannath, [[Balabhadra]] and Subhadra from the tree.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.templenet.com/Orissa/puri.html\n|title=Jagannath Temple at Puri\n|accessdate=12 September 2006\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen this log, radiant with light was seen floating in the sea, Narada told the king to make three idols out of it and place them in a pavilion. Indradyumna got Visvakarma, the architect of Gods, to build a magnificent temple to house the idols and Vishnu himself appeared in the guise of a carpenter to make the idols on condition that he was to be left undisturbed until he finished the work.\n\nBut just after two weeks, the Queen became very anxious. She took the carpenter to be dead as no sound came from the temple. Therefore, she requested the king to open the door. Thus, they went to see Vishnu at work at which the latter abandoned his work leaving the idols unfinished. The idol was devoid of any hands. But a divine voice told Indradyumana to install them in the temple. It has also been widely believed that in spite of the idol being without hands, it can watch over the world and be its lord. Thus the idiom.\n\n[[File:Rath Yatra Puri 07-11027.jpg|thumb|x216px|text|The [[Rath Yatra]] in Puri in modern times showing the three chariots of the deities with the Temple in the background.]]\n\n==Invasions and desecrations of the Temple==\nThe temple annals, the [[Madala Panji]] records that the Jagannath temple at Puri has been invaded and plundered eighteen times.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dash |first1=Abhimanyu |title=Invasions on the Temple of Lord Jagannath, Puri |journal=Orissa Review |date=July 2011 |pages=82\u201389 |url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |accessdate=4 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125621/http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2011/july/engpdf/82-89.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2014 }}</ref> In 1692, Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] ordered to close the temple until he wanted to reopen it otherwise it would be demolished, the local Mughal officials who came to carry out the job were requested by the locals and the temple was merely closed.

Another legend claims him to be [[Nilamadhava]], an image of Narayana made of blue stone and worshipped by the aboriginals. He was brought to [[Nilagiri]] (blue mountain) or Nilachala and installed there as Shri [[Jagannath]] in company with [[Balabhadra]] and [[Subhadra]]. The images made of wood are also claimed to have their distant linkage with the aboriginal system of worshipping wooden poles. To cap it all the Daitapatis, who have a fair share of responsibilities to perform rituals of the Temple, are claimed to be descendants of the aboriginals or hill tribes of Odisha. So we may safely claim that the beginning of the cultural history of Shrikshetra is found in the fusion of Hindu and Tribal Cultures. The three deities came to be claimed as the symbols of [[Samyak Darshan]], [[Samyak Jnana]] and [[Samyak Charita]] usually regarded as Triratha (of the [[Jain]] culture), an assimilation of which leads to [[Moksha]] ([[salvation]]) or the ultimate bliss...\n\nJagannath is worshipped as Vishnu or [[Narayana]] or [[Krishna]] and Lord [[Balabhadra]] as [[Shesha]]. Simultaneously, the deities are regarded as the [[bhairava]] with [[Vimala Temple|Vimala]] (the [[devi]] or the consort of Shiva) installed in the campus of the temple. So ultimately we find a fusion of [[Saivism]], [[Shaktism]] and [[Vaishnavism]] of the Hindu religion with [[Jainism]] and up to an extent Buddhism in the culture of Jagannath and the cultural tradition so reverently held together in Shrikshetra.\n\n===Acharyas and Jagannatha Puri===\nAll of the renowned acharyas including [[Madhvacharya]] have been known to visit this kshetra. [[Adi Shankara]] established his [[Govardhana matha]] here.  There is also evidence that [[Guru Nanak]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ramanujacharya]], and [[Nimbarkacharya]] had visited this place. Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu of [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]] stayed here for 24 years, establishing that the love of God can be spread by chanting the Hare Krishna mantra. Srimad Vallabhacharya visited Jagannath Puri and performed a 7-day recitation of Srimad Bhagvat.

Who is the highest of Gods, What is the highest of mantras, What is the highest scripture and What is the highest service. The discourse went on for many days with many schools of thought. Finally Shri Vallabh said to ask Lord Jagannath to confirm Shri Vallabh's answers. A pen and paper were left in the inner sanctum. After some time, the doors were opened and 4 answers were written. 1) The Son of Devaki (Krishna) is the God of Gods 2) His name is the highest of mantras 3) His song is the highest scripture (Bhagavat Geeta) 4) Service to Him is the Highest service. The king was shocked and declared Shri Vallabh the winner of the discourse. Some of the pandits who participated became jealous of Shri Vallabh and wanted to test Him. The next day was Ekadashi, a fasting day where one must fast from grains. The pandits gave Shri Vallabh rice Prasad of Shri Jagannathji (The temple is famous for this). If Shri Vallabh ate it, He would break His vow of fasting but if He did not take it, He would disrespect Lord Jagannath. Shri Vallabh accepted the prasad in his hand and spent the rest of the day and night explaining slokas of the greatness of Prasad and ate the rice the next morning.\n\n===Char Dham===\nThe temple is one of the holiest [[Vaishnava]] [[Hindu]] ''[[Char Dham]]'' (four divine sites) sites comprising [[Rameswaram]], [[Badrinath]], [[Puri]] and [[Dwarka]].{{sfn|Mahadev Chakravarti|1986|p=140}} Though the origins are not clearly known, the [[Advaita]] school of Hinduism propagated by [[Sankaracharya]], who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mittal|first=Sushil|title=The Hindu World|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-203-64470-0|page=482}}</ref> The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are [[Badrinath Temple]] at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarakadheesh Temple]] at Dwarka in the West and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] at Rameswaram in the South.

The [[Vimala Temple]] (Bimala Temple) is considered one of the most important of the [[Shaktipeeth]]s marks the spot where the Goddess [[Sati (goddess)|Sati]]'s navel fell. It is located near [[Pancha Tirtha of Puri|Rohini Kund]] in the temple complex. Until food offered to Jagannath is offered to Goddess Vimala it is not considered [[Mahaprasad (Jagannath Temple)|Mahaprasad]].\n\nThe temple of [[Mahalakshmi]] has an important role in rituals of the main temple. It is said that preparation of [[naivedhya|naivedya]] as offering for Jagannath is supervised by Mahalakshmi. The Kanchi Ganesh Temple is dedicated to [[Uchchhishta Ganapati]]. Tradition says the King of [[Kanchipuram]] (Kanchi) in ancient times gifted the idol, when Gajapati Purushottama Deva married Padmavati, the ''kanchi'' princess.

'''Pavitrotsava''' and '''Damanaka utsava''' are celebrated as per [[panchanga]] or [[panjika]].There are special ceremonies in the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]] and [[Pausha]].\n\nThe annual ''shodasha dinatmaka'' or 16-day puja beginning 8 days prior to [[Mahalaya]] of [[Ashwin]] month for Goddess [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] and ending on [[Vijayadashami]], is of great importance, in which both the utsava murty of lord [[krishna|Madanmohan]] and [[Bhairavi|Vimala]] take part.\n* Pana Sankranti: Also known or [[Vishuva Sankranti]] and [[Mesha (Indian astrology)|Mesha]] [[Sankranti]]: Special rituals are performed at the temple.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fullodisha.com/puri/temple_festivals.htm |title=Festivals of lord jagannath, puri festivals   |work=fullorissa.com |year=2010  |quote=Pana Sankranti or Mahabishuba sankranti: |accessdate=16 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Chandan Yatra===\n{{main|Chandan Yatra}}\nIn [[Akshaya Tritiya]] every year the [[Chandan Yatra]] festival marks the commencement of the construction of the Chariots of the Rath Yatra.\n\n===Snnana Yatra===\nOn the [[Full Moon|Purnima]] of the month of [[Jyestha]] the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of [[Snana Yatra]].\n\n===Anavasara or Anasara===\n{{main|Snana Yatra}}\nLiterally means vacation.

This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey ([[yatra]]) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct.{{sfn|O. M.

During the festival, the [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati King]] wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the ''Chera Pahara'' (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion.  As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]]n kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Karan|first=Jajati|title=Lord Jagannath yatra to begin soon|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/lord-jagannath-yatra-to-begin-soon/68263-3-2.html|accessdate=28 November 2012|newspaper=IBN Live|date=4 July 2008}}</ref>\n''Chera pahara'' is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at [[Mausi Maa Temple]] and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.\n\nAs per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in ''Pahandi vijay''.\n\nIn the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the [[Gundicha Temple]], where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in ''bahuda yatra''. On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered ''Poda Pitha,'' a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the Odisha people only.\n\nThe observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in [[Brahma Purana]], [[Padma Purana]], and [[Skanda Purana]]. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In [[Moghul]] period also, King Ramsingh of [[Jaipur]], [[Rajasthan]] has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], Kings of [[Mayurbhanj District|Mayurbhanj]] and [[Parlakhemundi]] were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.\n\nMoreover, Starza{{sfn|O. M. Starza|1993|p=133}} notes that the ruling [[Eastern Ganga Dynasty|Ganga dynasty]] instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. [[Friar Odoric]] of Pordenone visited India in 1316-1318, some 20 years after [[Marco Polo]] had dictated the account of his travels while in a [[Genoa|Genoese]] prison.{{sfn|Partha Mitter|1977|p=10}} In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \"idols\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \"church\" with song and music.{{sfn|O.

They are (1) the creed ([[Shahada]]), (2) daily prayers ([[Salah]]), (3) almsgiving ([[Zakat]]), (4) fasting during [[Ramadan]] ([[Fasting in Islam|Sawm]]) and (5) the pilgrimage to Mecca ([[Hajj]]) at least once in a lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|title = Hajj \u2013 ReligionFacts|url = http://www.religionfacts.com/hajj|website = www.religionfacts.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21}}</ref> Both [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] sects agree on the essential details for the performance of these acts.<ref>[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1859?_hi=32&_pos=3 Pillars of Islam], Oxford Islamic Studies Online</ref> Apart from these, Muslims also perform other religious acts.

However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term ''ulema'' ({{lang-ar| \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621}}) is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of [[Islamic studies|Islamic sciences]]. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a [[mufti]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0641\u062a\u064a}}) and often issues legal opinions, called [[fatwa]]s. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a [[faqih]] ({{lang-ar|\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0647}}). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a [[muhaddith]]. A [[qadi]] is a judge in an Islamic court. [[Honorific]] titles given to scholars include [[sheikh]], [[mullah]] and [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|mawlawi]].

Islam is set to grow faster than any other major world religion, reaching a total number of 2.76&nbsp;billion (an increase of 73%). Causes of this trend involve high [[Birth rate|fertility rates]] as a factor, with Muslims having a rate of 3.1 compared to the world average of 2.5, and the minimum replacement level for a population at 2.1. Another factor is also due to fact that Islam has the highest number of adherents under the age of 15 (34% of the total religion) of any major religion, compared with Christianity's 27%. 60% of Muslims are between the ages of 16 and 59, while only 7% are aged 60+ (the smallest percentage of any major religion). Countries such as [[Nigeria]] and [[North Macedonia]] are expected to have Muslim majorities by 2050. In India, the Muslim population will be larger than any other country.

However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term ''ulema'' ({{lang-ar| \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621}}) is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of [[Islamic studies|Islamic sciences]]. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a [[mufti]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0641\u062a\u064a}}) and often issues legal opinions, called [[fatwa]]s. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a [[faqih]] ({{lang-ar|\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0647}}). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a [[muhaddith]]. A [[qadi]] is a judge in an Islamic court. [[Honorific]] titles given to scholars include [[sheikh]], [[mullah]] and [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|mawlawi]]. [[Imam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645}}) is a leadership position, often used in the context of conducting Islamic worship services.\n\n===Schools of jurisprudence===\n[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|right|257px|Islamic [[madh'hab|schools of law]] in the [[Muslim world]]]]\n{{Main|Madhhab}}\nA school of jurisprudence is referred to as a ''madhab'' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628}}). The four major Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and sometimes [[\u1e92\u0101hir\u012b]] while the three major Shia schools are [[Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]. Each differ in their methodology, called ''[[Usul al-fiqh]]'' (\"principles of jurisprudence\"). The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called [[taqlid]]. The term ''ghair muqallid'' literally refers to those who do not use taqlid and by extension do not have a [[madhab]].<ref>''Encyclopedeia of Eminent Thinkers''. p. 38, K.S.

The [[Bayt al-mal]] or the welfare state was for the Muslim and Non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The [[Bayt al-mal]] ran for hundreds of years under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century and continued through the [[Umayyad]] period and well into the [[Abbasid]] era.

In November 1918, the monarchies were abolished and the nobility lost its political power during the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was thus abolished in favour of a republic\u2014the [[Free State of Prussia]], a [[states of the Weimar Republic|state]] of Germany from 1918 until 1933.

The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that {{lang|de|[[Junker (Prussia)|Junkers]]}} and other Prussian \u00e9lites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians.\n\nThe Kingdom ended in 1918 along with other German monarchies that collapsed as a result of the [[German Revolution]]. In the [[Weimar Republic]], the [[Free State of Prussia]] lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the [[Preu\u00dfenschlag|1932 coup]] led by [[Franz von Papen]]. Subsequently, it was effectively dismantled into Nazi German ''[[Gaue]]'' in 1935. Nevertheless, some Prussian ministries were kept and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] remained in his role as [[Minister President of Prussia]] until the end of [[World War II]]. [[Former eastern territories of Germany]] that made up a significant part of Prussia lost the majority of their German population after 1945 as the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]] both absorbed these territories and had most of its German inhabitants [[flight and expulsion of Germans|expelled]] by 1950. Prussia, deemed ''a bearer of militarism and reaction'' by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was [[Abolition of Prussia|officially abolished by an Allied declaration]] in 1947. The international status of the former eastern territories of Germany was disputed until the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] in 1990, while its return to Germany remains a topic among [[far right]] politicians, the [[Federation of Expellees]] and various political revisionists.\n\nThe term ''Prussian'' has often been used, especially outside Germany, to emphasise professionalism, aggressiveness, militarism and conservatism of the {{lang|de|[[Junker]]}} class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire.\n\n==Symbols==\n{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}\nThe main [[coat of arms of Prussia]], as well as the [[flag of Prussia]], depicted a [[black eagle]] on a white background.\n\nThe black and white [[national colours]] were already used by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and by the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]]. The Teutonic Order wore a white coat [[embroidery|embroidered]] with a black cross with gold insert and black imperial eagle. The combination of the black and white colours with the white and red [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] colours of the free cities [[Bremen]], Hamburg and [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]], as well as of [[Brandenburg]], resulted in the black-white-red commercial flag of the [[North German Confederation]], which became the flag of the German Empire in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n''[[Suum cuique]]'' (\"to each, his own\"), the motto of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]] created by King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701, was often associated with the whole of Prussia. The [[Iron Cross]], a military decoration created by King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] in 1813, was also commonly associated with the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The region, originally populated by Baltic [[Old Prussians]] who were Christianised, became a favoured location for immigration by (later mainly Protestant) [[Germans]] (''see [[Ostsiedlung]]''), as well as [[Poles]] and [[Lithuanians]] along the border regions.\n\n==Territory==\nBefore its abolition, the territory of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] included the provinces of [[West Prussia Province|West Prussia]]; [[East Prussia Province|East Prussia]]; [[Brandenburg Province|Brandenburg]]; [[Province of Saxony|Saxony]] (including much of the present-day state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and parts of the state of [[Thuringia]] in Germany); [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]]; [[Rhineland Province|Rhineland]]; [[Westphalia Province|Westphalia]]; [[Silesia Province|Silesia]] (without [[Czech Silesia|Austrian Silesia]]); [[Lusatia]]; [[Schleswig-Holstein]]; [[Hanover Province|Hanover]]; [[Hesse-Nassau Province|Hesse-Nassau]]; and a small detached area in the south called [[Hohenzollern Province|Hohenzollern]], the ancestral home of the Prussian ruling family. The land that the Teutonic Knights occupied was flat and covered with rich soil. The land was perfectly suited to the large-scale raising of wheat.<ref>H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' (1978) p. 35.</ref> The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising and selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the \"bread basket of Western Europe\" (in German, ''Kornkammer'', or granary). The port cities of Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) in Pomerania, Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]) in Prussia, [[Riga]] in Livonia, K\u00f6nigsberg ([[Kaliningrad]]), and Memel ([[Klaip\u0117da]]) rose on the back of this wheat production. Wheat production and trade brought Prussia into close relationship with the [[Hanseatic League]] during the period of time from 1356 (official founding of the Hanseatic League) until the decline of the League in about 1500.\n\nThe expansion of Prussia based on its connection with the [[Hanseatic League]] cut both [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] off from the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] and trade abroad.<ref>Robert S.

As a symbol of vassalage, Albert received a standard with the Prussian coat of arms from the Polish king. The black Prussian eagle on the flag was augmented with a letter \"S\" (for Sigismundus) and had a crown placed around its neck as a symbol of submission to Poland. Albert I, a member of a cadet branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] became a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant and secularized the Order's Prussian territories.<ref>H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' p. 33.</ref> This was the area east of the mouth of the [[Vistula]] River, later sometimes called \"Prussia proper\". For the first time, these lands came into the hands of a branch of the Hohenzollern family, who already ruled the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], since the 15th century. Furthermore, with his renunciation of the Order, Albert could now marry and produce legitimate heirs.\n\n===Brandenburg-Prussia===\n{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia|Holy Roman Empire}}\n\nBrandenburg and Prussia united two generations later. In 1594 [[Duchess Anna of Prussia|Anna]], granddaughter of Albert I and daughter of Duke [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] (reigned 1568\u20131618), married her cousin [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[John Sigismund, Margrave of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. When Albert Frederick died in 1618 without male heirs, John Sigismund was granted the right of succession to the Duchy of Prussia, then still a Polish fief. From this time the Duchy of Prussia was in [[personal union]] with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The resulting state, known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], consisted of geographically disconnected territories in Prussia, Brandenburg, and the [[Rhineland]] lands of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]].\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), various armies repeatedly marched across the disconnected Hohenzollern lands, especially the occupying [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]]. The ineffective and militarily weak Margrave [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg|George William]] (1619\u20131640) fled from Berlin to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the historic capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], in 1637. His successor, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William I]] (1640\u20131688), reformed the [[Prussian Army|army]] to defend the lands.\n\nFrederick William I went to [[Warsaw]] in 1641 to render [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]] of Poland for the Duchy of Prussia, which was still held in [[fief]] from the Polish crown. In January 1656, during the first phase of the [[Second Northern War]] (1654\u20131660), he received the duchy [[Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg (1656)|as a fief from the Swedish king]] who later granted him full sovereignty in the [[Treaty of Labiau]] (November 1656). In 1657 the Polish king renewed this grant in the treaties of [[Treaty of Wehlau|Wehlau]] and [[Treaty of Bromberg|Bromberg]]. With Prussia, the Brandenburg [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] now held a territory free of any feudal obligations, which constituted the basis for their later elevation to kings.\n\n[[File:Keurvorst Frederik Willem I en Louise Henri\u00ebtte van Oranje.jpg|thumb|left| The \"[[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Great Elector]]\" and [[Luise Henriette of Nassau|his wife]]]]\n\nFrederick William I became known{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} as the \"Great Elector\" for his achievements in organizing the electorate, which he accomplished by establishing an [[absolute monarchy]] in Brandenburg-Prussia. Above all, he emphasised the importance of a [[Prussian Army|powerful military]] to protect the state's disconnected territories, while the [[Edict of Potsdam]] (1685) opened Brandenburg-Prussia for the immigration of [[Protestant]] refugees (especially [[Huguenot]]s), and he established a bureaucracy to carry out state administration efficiently.\n\n===Kingdom of Prussia===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia}}\n[[File:Frederick I of Prussia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[King in Prussia]]]]\n\nOn 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, upgraded Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]]. In the [[Crown Treaty]] of 16 November 1700, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], allowed Frederick only to title himself \"[[King in Prussia]]\", not \"[[King of Prussia]]\". The state of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] became commonly known as \"Prussia\", although most of its territory, in Brandenburg, Pomerania, and western Germany, lay outside Prussia proper. The Prussian state grew in splendour during the reign of Frederick I, who sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 4</ref>\n\nFrederick I was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] (1713\u20131740), the austere \"Soldier King\", who did not care for the arts but was thrifty and practical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He is considered the creator of the vaunted Prussian bureaucracy and the professionalised standing army, which he developed into one of the most powerful in Europe, although his troops [[Siege of Stralsund (1711\u20131715)|only briefly saw action]] during the [[Great Northern War]]. In view of the size of the army in relation to the total population, [[Andr\u00e9 Boniface Louis Riqueti de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] said later: \"Prussia, is not a state with an army, but an army with a state.\" Frederick William also settled more than 20,000 Protestant refugees from [[Salzburg]] in thinly populated eastern Prussia, which was eventually extended to the west bank of the [[Neman River|River Memel]], and other regions.

[[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had died on 20 October 1740. He was succeeded to the throne by his daughter, [[Maria Theresa]].\n\nBy defeating the Austrian Army at the [[Battle of Mollwitz]] on 10 April 1741, Frederick succeeded in conquering [[Lower Silesia]] (the northwestern half of Silesia).<ref>Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: the Magnificent Enigma'', pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> In the next year, 1742, he conquered [[Upper Silesia]] (the southeastern half). Furthermore, in the third Silesian War (usually grouped with the [[Seven Years' War]]) Frederick won a victory over Austria at the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on 1 October 1756. In spite of some impressive victories afterward, his situation became far less comfortable the following years, as he failed in his attempts to knock Austria out of the war and was gradually reduced to a desperate defensive war. However, he never gave up and on 3 November 1760 the Prussian king won another battle, the hard-fought [[Battle of Torgau]]. Despite being several times on the verge of defeat Frederick, [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|allied with]] [[UK|Great Britain]], [[Hanover]] and [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], was finally able to hold the whole of Silesia against a coalition of [[Saxony]], [[Austria]], France and Russia.<ref>Hermann Kinder & Werner Hilgermann, ''The Anchor Atlas of World History: Volume 1'' (1974) pp. 282\u2013283.</ref> [[Voltaire]], a close friend of the king, once described Frederick the Great's Prussia by saying \"...it was [[Sparta]] in the morning, [[Athens]] in the afternoon.\" \n\n[[File:Friedrich ii campenhausen.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]], \"the Great\"]]\n\nSilesia, full of rich soils and prosperous manufacturing towns, became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth.<ref>James K.

At the same time he built up Prussia's military power and participated in the [[Partition of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] with Austria and Russia in 1772, an act that geographically connected the Brandenburg territories with those of Prussia proper. During this period, he also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe, such as the [[Huguenots]].

Prussia suffered a devastating defeat against [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s troops in the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], leading Frederick William III and his family to flee temporarily to [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]]. Under the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in 1807, the state lost about one third of its area, including the areas gained from the second and third [[Partitions of Poland]], which now fell to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. Beyond that, the king was obliged to pay a large indemnity, to cap his army at 42,000 men, and to let the French garrison troops throughout Prussia, effectively making the Kingdom a French satellite.<ref name=\"Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 11\">Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 11</ref>\n\nIn response to this defeat, reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] set about modernising the Prussian state. Among their reforms were the liberation of peasants from [[serfdom]], the [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation of Jews]] and making full citizens of them. The school system was rearranged, and in 1818 free trade was introduced. The process of army reform ended in 1813 with the introduction of compulsory military service for men.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 10</ref> By 1813, Prussia could mobilize almost 300,000 soldiers, more than half of which were conscripts of the ''Landwehr'' of variable quality. The rest consisted of regular soldiers that were deemed excellent by most observers, and very determined to repair the humiliation of 1806.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|defeat of Napoleon in Russia]], Prussia quit its alliance with France and took part in the [[Sixth Coalition]] during the \"Wars of Liberation\" (''Befreiungskriege'') against the French occupation. Prussian troops under Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]] contributed crucially (with the British) in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] of June 1815 to the final victory over Napoleon. Prussia's reward in 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]] was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the [[Rhineland]], [[Westphalia]], 40% of Saxony and some other territories. These western lands were of vital importance because they included the [[Ruhr Area]], the centre of Germany's fledgling industrialisation, especially in the arms industry. These territorial gains also meant the doubling of Prussia's population. In exchange, Prussia withdrew from areas of central Poland to allow the creation of [[Congress Poland]] under Russian sovereignty.<ref name=\"Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 11\" /> In 1815 Prussia became part of the [[German Confederation]].\n\n====Wars of liberation====\n{{Main|German revolutions of 1848\u201349}}\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia (1847).jpg|upright|thumb|King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]]]\n\nThe first half of the 19th century saw a prolonged struggle in Germany between liberals, who wanted a united, federal Germany under a democratic constitution, and [[Conservatism|conservatives]], who wanted to maintain Germany as a patchwork of independent, monarchical states with Prussia and Austria competing for influence. One small movement that signaled a desire for German unification in this period was the [[Burschenschaft]] student movement, by students who encouraged the use of the black-red-gold flag, discussions of a unified German nation, and a progressive, liberal political system. Because of Prussia's size and economic importance, smaller states began to join its free trade area in the 1820s. Prussia benefited greatly from the creation in 1834 of the German Customs Union ([[Zollverein]]), which included most German states but excluded Austria.<ref name=\"Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 12\" />\n\nIn 1848 the liberals saw an opportunity when [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions broke out across Europe]]. Alarmed, King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] agreed to convene a National Assembly and grant a constitution. When the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] offered Frederick William the crown of a united Germany, he refused on the grounds that he would not accept a crown from a revolutionary assembly without the sanction of Germany's other monarchs.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 13\u201314</ref>\n\nThe Frankfurt Parliament was forced to dissolve in 1849, and Frederick William issued [[Constitution of Prussia (1848)|Prussia's first constitution]] by his own authority in 1850. This conservative document provided for a two-house parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Landtag]]'' was elected by all taxpayers, who were divided into [[Prussian three-class franchise|three classes]] whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. Women and those who paid no taxes had no vote. This allowed just over one-third of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The upper house, which was later renamed the ''[[Prussian House of Lords|Herrenhaus]]'' (\"House of Lords\"), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the [[Junker]]s, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 14</ref>\n\n====Wars of unification====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0057, Otto von Bismarck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto von Bismarck]]]]\n\nIn 1862 King [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck was determined to defeat both the liberals and conservatives and increase Prussian supremacy and influence among the German states. There has been much debate as to whether Bismarck actually planned to create a united Germany when he set out on this journey, or whether he simply took advantage of the circumstances that fell into place. Certainly his memoirs paint a rosy picture of an idealist {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but these were written with the benefit of hindsight and certain crucial events could not have been predicted. What is clear is that Bismarck curried support from large sections of the people by promising to lead the fight for greater German unification. He eventually guided Prussia through three wars, which together brought William the position of [[German Emperor]].\n\n=====Schleswig Wars=====\nThe Kingdom of [[Denmark]] was at the time in personal union with the Duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]], both of which had close ties with each other, although only Holstein was part of the [[German Confederation]]. When the Danish government tried to integrate Schleswig, but not Holstein, into the Danish state, Prussia led the German Confederation against Denmark in the [[First War of Schleswig]] (1848\u20131851). Because [[Russian Empire|Russia]] supported Austria, Prussia also conceded predominance in the German Confederation to Austria in the [[Punctation of Olm\u00fctz]] in 1850.\n\nIn 1863, Denmark introduced a shared constitution for Denmark and Schleswig. This led to conflict with the German Confederation, which authorised the occupation of Holstein by the Confederation, from which Danish forces withdrew. <!-- not a direct annexation. A similar construction with DK, Schl, and Hol. had existed shortly c. 10 years before --> In 1864, Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border between Holstein and Schleswig initiating the [[Second War of Schleswig]].<!--Since Schleswig was not a member of the German Confederation, the Confederation could only authorise a Confederate intervention in Holstein, not in non-member Schleswig. That initiative came from Prussia. --> The Austro-Prussian forces defeated the Danes, who surrendered both territories. In the resulting [[Gastein Convention]] of 1865 Prussia took over the administration of Schleswig while Austria assumed that of Holstein.\n\n=====Austro-Prussian War=====\n{{Main|Austro-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Ac.prussiamap3.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of Prussia, 1807\u20131871]]\n\nBismarck realised that the dual administration of Schleswig and Holstein was only a temporary solution, and tensions rose between Prussia and Austria. The struggle for supremacy in Germany then led to the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866), triggered by the dispute over Schleswig and Holstein, with Bismarck using proposed injustices as the [[Casus belli|reason for war]].\n\nOn the Austrian side stood the south German states (including [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]), some central German states (including [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] in the north. On the side of Prussia were Italy, most north German states, and some smaller central German states. Eventually, the better-armed Prussian troops won the crucial victory at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] under [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]]. The century-long struggle between Berlin and Vienna for dominance of Germany was now over. As a side show in this war, Prussia defeated Hanover in the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]] (1866). While Hanover hoped in vain for help from Britain (as they had previously been in personal union), Britain stayed out of a confrontation with a continental great power and Prussia satisfied its desire for merging the once separate territories and gaining strong economic and strategic power, particularly from the full access to the resources of the Ruhr.\n\nBismarck desired Austria as an ally in the future, and so he declined to annex any Austrian territory. But in the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] in 1866, Prussia annexed four of Austria's allies in northern and central Germany\u2014[[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] and [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]]. Prussia also won full control of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. As a result of these territorial gains, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the northern two-thirds of Germany and contained two-thirds of Germany's population. The German Confederation was dissolved, and Prussia impelled the 21 states north of the [[Main (river)|Main]] River into forming the [[North German Confederation]].\n\nPrussia was the dominant state in the new confederation, as the kingdom comprised almost four-fifths of the new state's territory and population. Prussia's near-total control over the confederation was secured in the constitution drafted for it by Bismarck in 1867. Executive power was held by a president, assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him. The presidency was a hereditary office of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] rulers of Prussia. There was also a two-house parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Diet), was elected by universal male [[suffrage]]. The upper house, or ''Bundesrat'' (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes, and could easily control proceedings through alliances with the other states.\n\nAs a result of the peace negotiations, the states south of the Main remained theoretically independent, but received the (compulsory) protection of Prussia. Additionally, mutual defence treaties were concluded. However, the existence of these treaties was kept secret until Bismarck made them public in 1867, when France tried to [[Luxembourg Crisis|acquire Luxembourg]].\n\n=====Franco-Prussian War=====\n{{Main|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm I. .JPG|thumb|upright|Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]]]]\n\nThe controversy with the [[Second French Empire]] over the candidacy of a [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] to the Spanish throne was escalated both by France and Bismarck. With his [[Ems Dispatch]], Bismarck took advantage of an incident in which the French ambassador had approached William. The government of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], expecting another civil war among the German states, declared war against Prussia, continuing [[Franco-German enmity]]. However, honouring their treaties, the German states joined forces and quickly defeated France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. Following victory under Bismarck's and Prussia's leadership, [[Baden]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], which had remained outside the North German Confederation, accepted incorporation into a united [[German Empire]].\n\nThe empire was a \"Lesser German\" solution (in German, \"[[kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung]]\") to the question of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one state, because it excluded Austria, which remained connected to [[Hungary]] and whose territories included non-German populations. On 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]]), William was proclaimed \"German [[Kaiser|Emperor]]\" (not \"Emperor of Germany\") in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] outside Paris, while [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|the French capital was still under siege]].\n\n====German Empire====\n{{Main|German Empire}}\n[[File:prussiamap.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Prussia in the German Empire from 1871 to 1918]]\nThe two decades after the [[unification of Germany]] were the peak of Prussia's fortunes, but the seeds for potential strife were built into the Prusso-German political system.\n\nThe constitution of the German Empire was a slightly amended version of the North German Confederation's constitution. Officially, the German Empire was a federal state. In practice, Prussia's relationship with the rest of the empire was somewhat confusing. The Hohenzollern kingdom included three-fifths of the German territory and two-thirds of its population. The [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] was, in practice, an enlarged Prussian army, although the other kingdoms ([[Bavaria]], Saxony and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]) retained their own armies. The imperial crown was a hereditary office of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], the royal house of Prussia. The prime minister of Prussia was, except for two brief periods (January\u2013November 1873 and 1892\u201394), also imperial chancellor. But the empire itself had no right to collect taxes directly from its subjects; the only incomes fully under federal control were the customs duties, common excise duties, and the revenue from postal and telegraph services. While all men above age 25 were eligible to vote in imperial elections, Prussia retained its restrictive three-class voting system. This effectively required the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor to seek majorities from legislatures elected by two different franchises. In both the kingdom and the empire, the original constituencies were never redrawn to reflect changes in population, meaning that rural areas were grossly overrepresented by the turn of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Emperor Friedrich III.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]]]]\n\nAs a result, Prussia and the German Empire were something of a paradox. Bismarck knew that his new [[German Reich]] was now a colossus out of all proportion to the rest of the continent. With this in mind, he declared Germany a satisfied power, using his talents to preserve peace, for example at the [[Congress of Berlin]]. Bismarck had barely any success in some of his domestic policies, such as the anti-Catholic ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', but he also had mixed success on ones like [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|Germanisation]] or [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|expulsion]] of Poles of foreign nationality (Russian or Austro-Hungarian).\n\n[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] became emperor in March 1888, after the death of his father, but he died of cancer only 99 days later. [[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany - 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]]] At age 29, Wilhelm became [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] after a difficult youth and conflicts with his British mother [[Victoria, Princess Royal]]. He turned out to be a man of limited experience, narrow and reactionary views, poor judgment, and occasional bad temper, which alienated former friends and allies.\n\n===Railways===\n{{Main|Prussian state railways}}\nPrussia nationalised its railways in the 1880s in an effort both to lower rates on freight service and to equalise those rates among shippers. Instead of lowering rates as far as possible, the government ran the railways as a profitmaking endeavour, and the railway profits became a major source of revenue for the state. The nationalisation of the railways slowed the economic development of Prussia because the state favoured the relatively backward agricultural areas in its railway building. Moreover, the railway surpluses substituted for the development of an adequate tax system.<ref>Rainer Fremdling, \"Freight Rates and State Budget: The Role of the National Prussian Railways 1880\u20131913,\" ''Journal of European Economic History'', Spring 1980, Vol. 9#1 pp 21\u201340</ref>\n\n===The Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic===\n{{Main|Free State of Prussia}}\nBecause of the [[German Revolution]] of 1918, Wilhelm II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia. Prussia was proclaimed a \"Free State\" (i.e. a republic, German: ''Freistaat'') within the new [[Weimar Republic]] and in 1920 received a democratic constitution.\n\nAlmost all of Germany's territorial losses, specified in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], were areas that had been part of Prussia: [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] to [[Belgium]]; [[South Jutland County|North Schleswig]] to Denmark; the [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel Territory]] to Lithuania; the [[Hlu\u010d\u00ednsko|Hultschin area]] to [[Czechoslovakia]]. Many of the areas Prussia annexed in the [[partitions of Poland]], such as the Provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], as well as eastern [[Upper Silesia]], went to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] became the [[Free City of Danzig]] under the administration of the [[League of Nations]]. Also, the [[Saargebiet]] was created mainly from formerly Prussian territories. [[East Prussia]] became an exclave, only reachable by ship (the [[Seedienst Ostpreu\u00dfen|Sea Service East Prussia]]) or by a railway through the [[Polish corridor]].\n\n[[File:Weimar Republic states map.svg|thumb|upright=1.65|left|Federal states of the Weimar Republic, with Prussia in light gray. After [[World War I]] the Provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia Province|West Prussia]] came largely to the [[Second Polish Republic|2nd Polish Republic]]; [[Posen-West Prussia]] and the [[Regierungsbezirk Westpreu\u00dfen|West Prussia district]] were formed from the remaining parts.]]\n\nThe German government seriously considered breaking up Prussia into smaller states, but eventually traditionalist sentiment prevailed and Prussia became by far the largest state of the [[Weimar Republic]], comprising 60% of its territory. With the abolition of the older Prussian franchise, it became a stronghold of the left. Its incorporation of \"Red Berlin\" and the industrialised Ruhr Area, both with working class majorities, ensured left-wing dominance.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp 620\u2013624</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1932, Prussia was governed by a coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre]] and [[German Democratic Party|German Democrats]]; from 1921 to 1925, coalition governments included the [[German People's Party]]. Unlike in other states of the German Reich, majority rule by democratic parties in Prussia was never endangered. Nevertheless, in [[East Prussia]] and some rural areas, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] gained more and more influence and popular support, especially from the lower middle class starting in 1930. Except for Catholic [[Upper Silesia]], the Nazi Party in 1932 became the largest party in most parts of the Free State of Prussia. However, the democratic parties in coalition remained a majority, while Communists and Nazis were in the opposition.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp 630\u2013639</ref>\n\nThe East Prussian [[Otto Braun]], who was Prussian minister-president almost continuously from 1920 to 1932, is considered one of the most capable Social Democrats in history. He implemented several trend-setting reforms together with his minister of the interior, [[Carl Severing]], which were also models for the later [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG). For instance, a Prussian minister-president could be forced out of office only if there was a \"positive majority\" for a potential successor. This concept, known as the [[constructive vote of no confidence]], was carried over into the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the FRG. Most historians regard the Prussian government during this time as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', p 652</ref>\n\nIn contrast to its pre-war authoritarianism, Prussia was a pillar of democracy in the Weimar Republic. This system was destroyed by the ''[[Preu\u00dfenschlag]]'' (\"Prussian coup\") of [[Reich Chancellor]] [[Franz von Papen]]. In this [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], the government of the Reich deposed the Prussian government on 20 July 1932, under the pretext that the latter had lost control of public order in Prussia (during the [[Altona Bloody Sunday|Bloody Sunday]] of [[Altona, Hamburg]], which was still part of Prussia at that time) and by using fabricated evidence that the Social Democrats and the Communists were planning a joint ''putsch''. The Defence Minister General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], who was the prime mover behind the coup manufactured evidence that the Prussian police under Braun's orders were favouring the Communist ''[[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]]'' in street clashes with the SA as part of an alleged plan to foment a Marxist revolution, which he used to get an emergency decree from President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] imposing ''Reich'' control on Prussia.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, John ''The Nemesis of Power'', London: Macmillan, 1967 page 253.</ref> Papen appointed himself Reich commissioner for Prussia and took control of the government. The ''Preu\u00dfenschlag'' made it easier, only half a year later, for Hitler to take power decisively in Germany, since he had the whole apparatus of the Prussian government, including the police, at his disposal.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp 647\u2013648</ref>\n\n===Prussia and the Third Reich===\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]]]]\n[[File:Former eastern territories of Germany.png|thumb|{{legend|#676767|Territory lost after World War I}}\n{{legend|#000000|Territory lost after World War II}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|Present-day Germany}}]]\n\nAfter the appointment of Hitler as the new chancellor, the Nazis used the absence of [[Franz von Papen]] as an opportunity to appoint [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] federal commissioner for the Prussian ministry of the interior. The [[March 1933 German federal election|Reichstag election]] of 5 March 1933 strengthened the position of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP or \"Nazi\" Party), although they did not achieve an absolute majority.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp. 655\u2013670</ref>\n\nThe [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] having been [[Reichstag fire|set on fire]] a few weeks earlier on 27 February, a new [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] was opened in the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] of [[Potsdam]] on 21 March 1933 in the presence of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. In a propaganda-filled meeting between Hitler and the Nazi Party, the \"marriage of old Prussia with young Germany\" was celebrated, to win over the Prussian monarchists, conservatives and nationalists and induce them into supporting and subsequently voting in favor of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C06886, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Paul von Hindenburg]]]]\n\nIn the centralised state created by the Nazis in the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" (\"[[:de:Gesetz \u00fcber den Neuaufbau des Reichs|Gesetz \u00fcber den Neuaufbau des Reichs]]\", 30 January 1934) and the \"[[Reichsstatthalter#Reich Governors Law .281935.29|Law on Reich Governors]]\" (\"Reichsstatthaltergesetz\", 30 January 1935) the states were dissolved, in fact if not in law. The federal state governments were now controlled by governors for the Reich who were appointed by the chancellor. Parallel to that, the organisation of the party into districts (''[[Gau (German)|Gaue]]'') gained increasing importance, as the official in charge of a ''Gau'' (the head of which was called a ''[[Gauleiter]]'') was again appointed by the chancellor who was at the same time chief of the Nazi Party.\n\nThis centralistic policy went even further in Prussia. From 1934 to 1945, almost all ministries were merged and only a few departments were able to maintain their independence. Hitler himself became formally the governor of Prussia. However, his functions were exercised by Hermann G\u00f6ring as Prussian prime minister.\n\nAs provided for in the \"[[Greater Hamburg Act]]\" (\"Gro\u00df-Hamburg-Gesetz\"), certain exchanges of territory took place. Prussia was extended on 1 April 1937, for instance, by the incorporation of the Free and Hanseatic City of [[L\u00fcbeck]].\n\nThe Prussian lands transferred to Poland after the Treaty of Versailles were re-annexed during [[World War II]]. However, most of this territory was not reintegrated back into Prussia but assigned to separate ''Gaue'' of [[Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Wartheland]] during much of the duration of the war.\n\n===The end of Prussia===\n[[File:Germany former prussian lander.png|upright|thumb|Map of the current [[states of Germany]] that are completely or mostly situated inside the old borders of [[Imperial Germany]]'s [[Kingdom of Prussia]]]]\n\nThe areas east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], mainly Eastern Prussia, Western Prussia, and Silesia, were ceded over to Poland in 1945 due to the [[Treaty of Potsdam]] between three of the Allies: the United States, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. This included important Prussian cities like Danzig, K\u00f6nigsberg, Breslau, and Stettin. [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|The population fled]], mostly to the Western zones, or was driven out. The number of casualties is estimated 2 to 4 million, including those who fled the Soviet army during the last months of the war before the treaty.\n\nAs part of their wartime goals, the Western allies sought the [[abolition of Prussia]]. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was initially content to retain the name, Russians having a different historical view of their neighbour and sometime former ally. Nonetheless by Law No. 46, which was accepted and implemented by the [[Allied Control Council]] on 25 February 1947, Prussia was officially proclaimed to be dissolved.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp. 670\u2013682</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet occupation zone]], which became [[East Germany]] (officially, the German Democratic Republic) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were reorganised into the states of [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]], with the remaining parts of the [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]] going to [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. These states were ''de facto'' abolished in 1952 in favour of ''[[Administrative divisions of East Germany#Division into Bezirke|Bezirke]]'' (districts), but were [[Administrative divisions of East Germany#Restoration of the L\u00e4nder|recreated]] after [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nIn the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Western Zones of occupation]], which became [[West Germany]] (officially, the Federal Republic of Germany) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were divided up among [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Lower Saxony, [[Hesse]], Rhineland-Palatinate and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] were later merged with [[Baden]] to create the state of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The Saar region, which had been administered by the French as [[Saar Protectorate|a protectorate]] separate from the rest of Western Germany, was admitted to the Federal Republic of Germany as [[Saarland|a separate state]] in 1956 following a plebiscite.\n\nOne year later, in 1957, the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] was established and implemented by federal statutes in West Germany in response to a ruling from the [[Federal Constitutional Court|Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]. The fundamental goal of this institution is protecting the cultural legacy of Prussia. It continues to operate from its headquarters in Berlin to this very day.\n\n==Administrative and constitutional frameworks==\n{{Main|Free State of Prussia|Brandenburg-Prussia|Kingdom of Prussia}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century the [[List of rulers of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] had become highly dependent on the Estates (representing counts, lords, knights, and towns, but not

Crown Jewels]], [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Berlin]]]]\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia functioned as an [[absolute monarchy]] until the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], after which Prussia became a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg]] was elected{{by whom|date=March 2015}} as Prussia's first [[Prime Minister of Prussia|prime minister]] (''Ministerpr\u00e4sident''). [[Constitution of Prussia (1848)|Prussia's first constitution]] dated from 1848. The [[Constitution of Prussia (1850)|1850 Prussian Constitution]] established a [[Bicameralism|two-chamber]] parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Prussian Landtag|Landtag]]'' represented all taxpayers, who were [[Prussian three-class franchise|divided into three classes]] according to the amount of taxes paid. This allowed just over 25% of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population. The upper house (First Chamber or ''Erste Kammer''), later renamed the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (''Herrenhaus''), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the [[Junker]]s, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. The [[Prussian Secret Police]], formed in response to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], aided the conservative government.\n\nUnlike its authoritarian pre-1918 predecessor, Prussia from 1918 to 1932 was a promising democracy within Germany. The abolition of the political power of the aristocracy transformed Prussia into a region strongly dominated by the left wing of the political spectrum, with \"Red Berlin\" and the industrial centre of the [[Ruhr Area]] exerting major influence. During this period a coalition of centre-left parties ruled, predominantly under the leadership (1920\u20131932) of East Prussian [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Otto Braun]]. While in office Braun implemented several reforms (together with his Minister of the Interior, [[Carl Severing]]) that became models for the later [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. For instance, a Prussian prime minister could only be forced out of office if there was a \"positive majority\" for a potential successor{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. This concept, known as the [[constructive vote of no confidence]], became part of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Most{{quantify|date=March 2015}} historians regard the Prussian government during the 1920s as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.\n\nSimilar to other German states both [[States of Germany|now]] and [[Weimar Republic#Constituent states of Germany during the Weimar period|at the time]], [[Executive (government)|executive power]] remained vested in a [[Minister-President|Minister-President of Prussia]] and in laws established by a [[Landtag]] elected by the people.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Population===\nIn 1871, Prussia's population numbered 24.69 million, accounting for 60% of the [[German Empire]]'s population.<ref name=\"Handbuch\">{{Cite book |title=Handbuch der preussischen Geschichte |last=B\u00fcsch |first=Otto |last2=Ilja Mieck |last3=Wolfgang Neugebauer |publisher=de Gruyter |year=1992 |isbn=978-3-11-008322-4 |editor-last=Otto B\u00fcsch |volume=2 |location=Berlin |pages=42 |language=German}}</ref> In 1910, the population had increased to 40.17 million (62% of the Empire's population).<ref name=Handbuch/> In 1914, Prussia had an area of 354,490&nbsp;km\u00b2.

In the wake of the [[Reformation]], Prussia was dominated by two major [[Protestant]] confessions: Lutheranism and [[Calvinism]]. The majority of the Prussian population was Lutheran, although there were dispersed [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] minorities in central and western parts of the state especially [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. In 1613, [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Grand Duke of Prussia]] declared himself for the Reformed creed and transferred the [[Berlin Cathedral]] from the Lutheran to the Reformed church. Lutherans and Reformed congregations all over the kingdom were merged in 1817 by the [[Prussian Union of churches]], which came under tight royal control.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Clark |first=Christopher |year=1996 |title=Confessional Policy and the Limits of State Action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817-40 |journal=The Historical Journal |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=985\u20131004 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X00024730 |jstor=2639865}}</ref> In Protestant regions, writes Nipperdey:\n{{bquote|Much of religious life was often conventional and superficial by any normal, human standard.

Prussian monarchs, beginning with [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] opened the country to the fleeing French Calvinist refugees. In Berlin, they built and worshipped at their own church called the [[French Cathedral]] on [[Gendarmenmarkt]]. Time passed by, and the French Reformed assimilated into the wider Protestant community in Prussia. East Prussia's southern region of [[Masuria]] was mostly made up of [[Germanisation|Germanised]] [[Lutheran]] [[Masurians]].\n\nAfter 1814, Prussia contained millions of Roman Catholics in the west and in the east. There were substantial populations in the [[Rhineland]], parts of [[Westphalia]], eastern parts of [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Ermland]] and the [[Province of Posen]].<ref>Helmut Walser Smith, ed.. ''Protestants, Catholics and Jews in Germany, 1800\u20131914'' (Bloomsbury Academic, 2001)</ref> Communities in Poland were often ethnically [[Polish people|Polish]], although this is not the case of eastern Silesia as the majority of Catholics there were German. During the 19th-century [[Kulturkampf]], Prussian Catholics were forbidden from fulfilling any official functions for the state and were largely distrusted.\n\nPrussia contained a relatively large Jewish community, which was mostly concentrated in large urban areas. According to the 1880 census, it was the biggest one in Germany with 363,790 individuals.\n\nIn 1925, 64.9% of the Prussian population was [[Protestant]], 31.3% was [[Roman Catholic]], 1.1% was [[Jewish]], 2.7% was placed in other religious categories.<ref>Grundriss der Statistik.

The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically, and became the core of the [[North German Confederation]] in 1867, and then of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that {{lang|de|[[Junker (Prussia)|Junkers]]}} and other Prussian \u00e9lites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians.\n\nThe Kingdom ended in 1918 along with other German monarchies that collapsed as a result of the [[German Revolution]]. In the [[Weimar Republic]], the [[Free State of Prussia]] lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the [[Preu\u00dfenschlag|1932 coup]] led by [[Franz von Papen]]. Subsequently, it was effectively dismantled into Nazi German ''[[Gaue]]'' in 1935. Nevertheless, some Prussian ministries were kept and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] remained in his role as [[Minister President of Prussia]] until the end of [[World War II]]. [[Former eastern territories of Germany]] that made up a significant part of Prussia lost the majority of their German population after 1945 as the [[People's Republic of Poland]] and the [[Soviet Union]] both absorbed these territories and had most of its German inhabitants [[flight and expulsion of Germans|expelled]] by 1950. Prussia, deemed ''a bearer of militarism and reaction'' by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], was [[Abolition of Prussia|officially abolished by an Allied declaration]] in 1947. The international status of the former eastern territories of Germany was disputed until the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany]] in 1990, while its return to Germany remains a topic among [[far right]] politicians, the [[Federation of Expellees]] and various political revisionists.\n\nThe term ''Prussian'' has often been used, especially outside Germany, to emphasise professionalism, aggressiveness, militarism and conservatism of the {{lang|de|[[Junker]]}} class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire.\n\n==Symbols==\n{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}\nThe main [[coat of arms of Prussia]], as well as the [[flag of Prussia]], depicted a [[black eagle]] on a white background.\n\nThe black and white [[national colours]] were already used by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and by the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]].

The land that the Teutonic Knights occupied was flat and covered with rich soil. The land was perfectly suited to the large-scale raising of wheat.<ref>H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' (1978) p. 35.</ref> The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising and selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the \"bread basket of Western Europe\" (in German, ''Kornkammer'', or granary). The port cities of Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) in Pomerania, Danzig ([[Gda\u0144sk]]) in Prussia, [[Riga]] in Livonia, K\u00f6nigsberg ([[Kaliningrad]]), and Memel ([[Klaip\u0117da]]) rose on the back of this wheat production. Wheat production and trade brought Prussia into close relationship with the [[Hanseatic League]] during the period of time from 1356 (official founding of the Hanseatic League) until the decline of the League in about 1500.\n\nThe expansion of Prussia based on its connection with the [[Hanseatic League]] cut both [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] off from the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] and trade abroad.<ref>Robert S.

As a symbol of vassalage, Albert received a standard with the Prussian coat of arms from the Polish king. The black Prussian eagle on the flag was augmented with a letter \"S\" (for Sigismundus) and had a crown placed around its neck as a symbol of submission to Poland. Albert I, a member of a cadet branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]] became a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant and secularized the Order's Prussian territories.<ref>H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' p. 33.</ref> This was the area east of the mouth of the [[Vistula]] River, later sometimes called \"Prussia proper\". For the first time, these lands came into the hands of a branch of the Hohenzollern family, who already ruled the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], since the 15th century. Furthermore, with his renunciation of the Order, Albert could now marry and produce legitimate heirs.\n\n===Brandenburg-Prussia===\n{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia|Holy Roman Empire}}\n\nBrandenburg and Prussia united two generations later. In 1594 [[Duchess Anna of Prussia|Anna]], granddaughter of Albert I and daughter of Duke [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] (reigned 1568\u20131618), married her cousin [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[John Sigismund, Margrave of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. When Albert Frederick died in 1618 without male heirs, John Sigismund was granted the right of succession to the Duchy of Prussia, then still a Polish fief. From this time the Duchy of Prussia was in [[personal union]] with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The resulting state, known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], consisted of geographically disconnected territories in Prussia, Brandenburg, and the [[Rhineland]] lands of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]].\n\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), various armies repeatedly marched across the disconnected Hohenzollern lands, especially the occupying [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]]. The ineffective and militarily weak Margrave [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg|George William]] (1619\u20131640) fled from Berlin to [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], the historic capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], in 1637. His successor, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William I]] (1640\u20131688), reformed the [[Prussian Army|army]] to defend the lands.\n\nFrederick William I went to [[Warsaw]] in 1641 to render [[homage (feudal)|homage]] to King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa]] of Poland for the Duchy of Prussia, which was still held in [[fief]] from the Polish crown. In January 1656, during the first phase of the [[Second Northern War]] (1654\u20131660), he received the duchy [[Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg (1656)|as a fief from the Swedish king]] who later granted him full sovereignty in the [[Treaty of Labiau]] (November 1656). In 1657 the Polish king renewed this grant in the treaties of [[Treaty of Wehlau|Wehlau]] and [[Treaty of Bromberg|Bromberg]]. With Prussia, the Brandenburg [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] now held a territory free of any feudal obligations, which constituted the basis for their later elevation to kings.\n\n[[File:Keurvorst Frederik Willem I en Louise Henri\u00ebtte van Oranje.jpg|thumb|left| The \"[[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Great Elector]]\" and [[Luise Henriette of Nassau|his wife]]]]\n\nFrederick William I became known{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} as the \"Great Elector\" for his achievements in organizing the electorate, which he accomplished by establishing an [[absolute monarchy]] in Brandenburg-Prussia. Above all, he emphasised the importance of a [[Prussian Army|powerful military]] to protect the state's disconnected territories, while the [[Edict of Potsdam]] (1685) opened Brandenburg-Prussia for the immigration of [[Protestant]] refugees (especially [[Huguenot]]s), and he established a bureaucracy to carry out state administration efficiently.\n\n===Kingdom of Prussia===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia}}\n[[File:Frederick I of Prussia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[King in Prussia]]]]\n\nOn 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, upgraded Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]]. In the [[Crown Treaty]] of 16 November 1700, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], allowed Frederick only to title himself \"[[King in Prussia]]\", not \"[[King of Prussia]]\". The state of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] became commonly known as \"Prussia\", although most of its territory, in Brandenburg, Pomerania, and western Germany, lay outside Prussia proper. The Prussian state grew in splendour during the reign of Frederick I, who sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 4</ref>\n\nFrederick I was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] (1713\u20131740), the austere \"Soldier King\", who did not care for the arts but was thrifty and practical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He is considered the creator of the vaunted Prussian bureaucracy and the professionalised standing army, which he developed into one of the most powerful in Europe, although his troops [[Siege of Stralsund (1711\u20131715)|only briefly saw action]] during the [[Great Northern War]]. In view of the size of the army in relation to the total population, [[Andr\u00e9 Boniface Louis Riqueti de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] said later: \"Prussia, is not a state with an army, but an army with a state.\" Frederick William also settled more than 20,000 Protestant refugees from [[Salzburg]] in thinly populated eastern Prussia, which was eventually extended to the west bank of the [[Neman River|River Memel]], and other regions.

[[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had died on 20 October 1740. He was succeeded to the throne by his daughter, [[Maria Theresa]].\n\nBy defeating the Austrian Army at the [[Battle of Mollwitz]] on 10 April 1741, Frederick succeeded in conquering [[Lower Silesia]] (the northwestern half of Silesia).<ref>Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: the Magnificent Enigma'', pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> In the next year, 1742, he conquered [[Upper Silesia]] (the southeastern half). Furthermore, in the third Silesian War (usually grouped with the [[Seven Years' War]]) Frederick won a victory over Austria at the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on 1 October 1756. In spite of some impressive victories afterward, his situation became far less comfortable the following years, as he failed in his attempts to knock Austria out of the war and was gradually reduced to a desperate defensive war. However, he never gave up and on 3 November 1760 the Prussian king won another battle, the hard-fought [[Battle of Torgau]]. Despite being several times on the verge of defeat Frederick, [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|allied with]] [[UK|Great Britain]], [[Hanover]] and [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], was finally able to hold the whole of Silesia against a coalition of [[Saxony]], [[Austria]], France and Russia.<ref>Hermann Kinder & Werner Hilgermann, ''The Anchor Atlas of World History: Volume 1'' (1974) pp. 282\u2013283.</ref> [[Voltaire]], a close friend of the king, once described Frederick the Great's Prussia by saying \"...it was [[Sparta]] in the morning, [[Athens]] in the afternoon.\" \n\n[[File:Friedrich ii campenhausen.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]], \"the Great\"]]\n\nSilesia, full of rich soils and prosperous manufacturing towns, became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth.<ref>James K.

At the same time he built up Prussia's military power and participated in the [[Partition of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] with Austria and Russia in 1772, an act that geographically connected the Brandenburg territories with those of Prussia proper. During this period, he also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe, such as the [[Huguenots]].

Prussia suffered a devastating defeat against [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s troops in the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], leading Frederick William III and his family to flee temporarily to [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]]. Under the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in 1807, the state lost about one third of its area, including the areas gained from the second and third [[Partitions of Poland]], which now fell to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. Beyond that, the king was obliged to pay a large indemnity, to cap his army at 42,000 men, and to let the French garrison troops throughout Prussia, effectively making the Kingdom a French satellite.<ref name=\"Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 11\">Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 11</ref>\n\nIn response to this defeat, reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] set about modernising the Prussian state. Among their reforms were the liberation of peasants from [[serfdom]], the [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation of Jews]] and making full citizens of them. The school system was rearranged, and in 1818 free trade was introduced. The process of army reform ended in 1813 with the introduction of compulsory military service for men.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 10</ref> By 1813, Prussia could mobilize almost 300,000 soldiers, more than half of which were conscripts of the ''Landwehr'' of variable quality. The rest consisted of regular soldiers that were deemed excellent by most observers, and very determined to repair the humiliation of 1806.\n\nAfter the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|defeat of Napoleon in Russia]], Prussia quit its alliance with France and took part in the [[Sixth Coalition]] during the \"Wars of Liberation\" (''Befreiungskriege'') against the French occupation. Prussian troops under Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]] contributed crucially (with the British) in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] of June 1815 to the final victory over Napoleon. Prussia's reward in 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]] was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the [[Rhineland]], [[Westphalia]], 40% of Saxony and some other territories. These western lands were of vital importance because they included the [[Ruhr Area]], the centre of Germany's fledgling industrialisation, especially in the arms industry. These territorial gains also meant the doubling of Prussia's population. In exchange, Prussia withdrew from areas of central Poland to allow the creation of [[Congress Poland]] under Russian sovereignty.<ref name=\"Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 11\" /> In 1815 Prussia became part of the [[German Confederation]].\n\n====Wars of liberation====\n{{Main|German revolutions of 1848\u201349}}\n[[File:Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia (1847).jpg|upright|thumb|King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]]]\n\nThe first half of the 19th century saw a prolonged struggle in Germany between liberals, who wanted a united, federal Germany under a democratic constitution, and [[Conservatism|conservatives]], who wanted to maintain Germany as a patchwork of independent, monarchical states with Prussia and Austria competing for influence. One small movement that signaled a desire for German unification in this period was the [[Burschenschaft]] student movement, by students who encouraged the use of the black-red-gold flag, discussions of a unified German nation, and a progressive, liberal political system. Because of Prussia's size and economic importance, smaller states began to join its free trade area in the 1820s. Prussia benefited greatly from the creation in 1834 of the German Customs Union ([[Zollverein]]), which included most German states but excluded Austria.<ref name=\"Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 12\" />\n\nIn 1848 the liberals saw an opportunity when [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions broke out across Europe]]. Alarmed, King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] agreed to convene a National Assembly and grant a constitution. When the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] offered Frederick William the crown of a united Germany, he refused on the grounds that he would not accept a crown from a revolutionary assembly without the sanction of Germany's other monarchs.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 13\u201314</ref>\n\nThe Frankfurt Parliament was forced to dissolve in 1849, and Frederick William issued [[Constitution of Prussia (1848)|Prussia's first constitution]] by his own authority in 1850. This conservative document provided for a two-house parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Landtag]]'' was elected by all taxpayers, who were divided into [[Prussian three-class franchise|three classes]] whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. Women and those who paid no taxes had no vote. This allowed just over one-third of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The upper house, which was later renamed the ''[[Prussian House of Lords|Herrenhaus]]'' (\"House of Lords\"), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the [[Junker]]s, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 14</ref>\n\n====Wars of unification====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0057, Otto von Bismarck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Otto von Bismarck]]]]\n\nIn 1862 King [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck was determined to defeat both the liberals and conservatives and increase Prussian supremacy and influence among the German states. There has been much debate as to whether Bismarck actually planned to create a united Germany when he set out on this journey, or whether he simply took advantage of the circumstances that fell into place. Certainly his memoirs paint a rosy picture of an idealist {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}, but these were written with the benefit of hindsight and certain crucial events could not have been predicted. What is clear is that Bismarck curried support from large sections of the people by promising to lead the fight for greater German unification. He eventually guided Prussia through three wars, which together brought William the position of [[German Emperor]].\n\n=====Schleswig Wars=====\nThe Kingdom of [[Denmark]] was at the time in personal union with the Duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]], both of which had close ties with each other, although only Holstein was part of the [[German Confederation]]. When the Danish government tried to integrate Schleswig, but not Holstein, into the Danish state, Prussia led the German Confederation against Denmark in the [[First War of Schleswig]] (1848\u20131851). Because [[Russian Empire|Russia]] supported Austria, Prussia also conceded predominance in the German Confederation to Austria in the [[Punctation of Olm\u00fctz]] in 1850.\n\nIn 1863, Denmark introduced a shared constitution for Denmark and Schleswig. This led to conflict with the German Confederation, which authorised the occupation of Holstein by the Confederation, from which Danish forces withdrew. <!-- not a direct annexation. A similar construction with DK, Schl, and Hol. had existed shortly c. 10 years before --> In 1864, Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border between Holstein and Schleswig initiating the [[Second War of Schleswig]].<!--Since Schleswig was not a member of the German Confederation, the Confederation could only authorise a Confederate intervention in Holstein, not in non-member Schleswig. That initiative came from Prussia. --> The Austro-Prussian forces defeated the Danes, who surrendered both territories. In the resulting [[Gastein Convention]] of 1865 Prussia took over the administration of Schleswig while Austria assumed that of Holstein.\n\n=====Austro-Prussian War=====\n{{Main|Austro-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Ac.prussiamap3.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Expansion of Prussia, 1807\u20131871]]\n\nBismarck realised that the dual administration of Schleswig and Holstein was only a temporary solution, and tensions rose between Prussia and Austria. The struggle for supremacy in Germany then led to the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866), triggered by the dispute over Schleswig and Holstein, with Bismarck using proposed injustices as the [[Casus belli|reason for war]].\n\nOn the Austrian side stood the south German states (including [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]), some central German states (including [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] in the north. On the side of Prussia were Italy, most north German states, and some smaller central German states. Eventually, the better-armed Prussian troops won the crucial victory at the [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]] under [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]]. The century-long struggle between Berlin and Vienna for dominance of Germany was now over. As a side show in this war, Prussia defeated Hanover in the [[Battle of Langensalza (1866)|Battle of Langensalza]] (1866). While Hanover hoped in vain for help from Britain (as they had previously been in personal union), Britain stayed out of a confrontation with a continental great power and Prussia satisfied its desire for merging the once separate territories and gaining strong economic and strategic power, particularly from the full access to the resources of the Ruhr.\n\nBismarck desired Austria as an ally in the future, and so he declined to annex any Austrian territory. But in the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] in 1866, Prussia annexed four of Austria's allies in northern and central Germany\u2014[[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] and [[Free City of Frankfurt|Frankfurt]]. Prussia also won full control of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. As a result of these territorial gains, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the northern two-thirds of Germany and contained two-thirds of Germany's population. The German Confederation was dissolved, and Prussia impelled the 21 states north of the [[Main (river)|Main]] River into forming the [[North German Confederation]].\n\nPrussia was the dominant state in the new confederation, as the kingdom comprised almost four-fifths of the new state's territory and population. Prussia's near-total control over the confederation was secured in the constitution drafted for it by Bismarck in 1867. Executive power was held by a president, assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him. The presidency was a hereditary office of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] rulers of Prussia. There was also a two-house parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Diet), was elected by universal male [[suffrage]]. The upper house, or ''Bundesrat'' (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes, and could easily control proceedings through alliances with the other states.\n\nAs a result of the peace negotiations, the states south of the Main remained theoretically independent, but received the (compulsory) protection of Prussia. Additionally, mutual defence treaties were concluded. However, the existence of these treaties was kept secret until Bismarck made them public in 1867, when France tried to [[Luxembourg Crisis|acquire Luxembourg]].\n\n=====Franco-Prussian War=====\n{{Main|Franco-Prussian War}}\n[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm I. .JPG|thumb|upright|Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]]]]\n\nThe controversy with the [[Second French Empire]] over the candidacy of a [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] to the Spanish throne was escalated both by France and Bismarck. With his [[Ems Dispatch]], Bismarck took advantage of an incident in which the French ambassador had approached William. The government of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], expecting another civil war among the German states, declared war against Prussia, continuing [[Franco-German enmity]]. However, honouring their treaties, the German states joined forces and quickly defeated France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. Following victory under Bismarck's and Prussia's leadership, [[Baden]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], which had remained outside the North German Confederation, accepted incorporation into a united [[German Empire]].\n\nThe empire was a \"Lesser German\" solution (in German, \"[[kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung]]\") to the question of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one state, because it excluded Austria, which remained connected to [[Hungary]] and whose territories included non-German populations. On 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]]), William was proclaimed \"German [[Kaiser|Emperor]]\" (not \"Emperor of Germany\") in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] outside Paris, while [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)|the French capital was still under siege]].\n\n====German Empire====\n{{Main|German Empire}}\n[[File:prussiamap.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Prussia in the German Empire from 1871 to 1918]]\nThe two decades after the [[unification of Germany]] were the peak of Prussia's fortunes, but the seeds for potential strife were built into the Prusso-German political system.\n\nThe constitution of the German Empire was a slightly amended version of the North German Confederation's constitution. Officially, the German Empire was a federal state. In practice, Prussia's relationship with the rest of the empire was somewhat confusing. The Hohenzollern kingdom included three-fifths of the German territory and two-thirds of its population. The [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] was, in practice, an enlarged Prussian army, although the other kingdoms ([[Bavaria]], Saxony and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]) retained their own armies. The imperial crown was a hereditary office of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], the royal house of Prussia. The prime minister of Prussia was, except for two brief periods (January\u2013November 1873 and 1892\u201394), also imperial chancellor. But the empire itself had no right to collect taxes directly from its subjects; the only incomes fully under federal control were the customs duties, common excise duties, and the revenue from postal and telegraph services. While all men above age 25 were eligible to vote in imperial elections, Prussia retained its restrictive three-class voting system. This effectively required the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor to seek majorities from legislatures elected by two different franchises. In both the kingdom and the empire, the original constituencies were never redrawn to reflect changes in population, meaning that rural areas were grossly overrepresented by the turn of the 20th century.\n\n[[File:Emperor Friedrich III.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]]]]\n\nAs a result, Prussia and the German Empire were something of a paradox. Bismarck knew that his new [[German Reich]] was now a colossus out of all proportion to the rest of the continent. With this in mind, he declared Germany a satisfied power, using his talents to preserve peace, for example at the [[Congress of Berlin]]. Bismarck had barely any success in some of his domestic policies, such as the anti-Catholic ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', but he also had mixed success on ones like [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|Germanisation]] or [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|expulsion]] of Poles of foreign nationality (Russian or Austro-Hungarian).\n\n[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] became emperor in March 1888, after the death of his father, but he died of cancer only 99 days later. [[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany - 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]]]] At age 29, Wilhelm became [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] after a difficult youth and conflicts with his British mother [[Victoria, Princess Royal]]. He turned out to be a man of limited experience, narrow and reactionary views, poor judgment, and occasional bad temper, which alienated former friends and allies.\n\n===Railways===\n{{Main|Prussian state railways}}\nPrussia nationalised its railways in the 1880s in an effort both to lower rates on freight service and to equalise those rates among shippers. Instead of lowering rates as far as possible, the government ran the railways as a profitmaking endeavour, and the railway profits became a major source of revenue for the state. The nationalisation of the railways slowed the economic development of Prussia because the state favoured the relatively backward agricultural areas in its railway building. Moreover, the railway surpluses substituted for the development of an adequate tax system.<ref>Rainer Fremdling, \"Freight Rates and State Budget: The Role of the National Prussian Railways 1880\u20131913,\" ''Journal of European Economic History'', Spring 1980, Vol. 9#1 pp 21\u201340</ref>\n\n===The Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic===\n{{Main|Free State of Prussia}}\nBecause of the [[German Revolution]] of 1918, Wilhelm II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia. Prussia was proclaimed a \"Free State\" (i.e. a republic, German: ''Freistaat'') within the new [[Weimar Republic]] and in 1920 received a democratic constitution.\n\nAlmost all of Germany's territorial losses, specified in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], were areas that had been part of Prussia: [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] to [[Belgium]]; [[South Jutland County|North Schleswig]] to Denmark; the [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel Territory]] to Lithuania; the [[Hlu\u010d\u00ednsko|Hultschin area]] to [[Czechoslovakia]]. Many of the areas Prussia annexed in the [[partitions of Poland]], such as the Provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], as well as eastern [[Upper Silesia]], went to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. [[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]] became the [[Free City of Danzig]] under the administration of the [[League of Nations]]. Also, the [[Saargebiet]] was created mainly from formerly Prussian territories. [[East Prussia]] became an exclave, only reachable by ship (the [[Seedienst Ostpreu\u00dfen|Sea Service East Prussia]]) or by a railway through the [[Polish corridor]].\n\n[[File:Weimar Republic states map.svg|thumb|upright=1.65|left|Federal states of the Weimar Republic, with Prussia in light gray. After [[World War I]] the Provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia Province|West Prussia]] came largely to the [[Second Polish Republic|2nd Polish Republic]]; [[Posen-West Prussia]] and the [[Regierungsbezirk Westpreu\u00dfen|West Prussia district]] were formed from the remaining parts.]]\n\nThe German government seriously considered breaking up Prussia into smaller states, but eventually traditionalist sentiment prevailed and Prussia became by far the largest state of the [[Weimar Republic]], comprising 60% of its territory. With the abolition of the older Prussian franchise, it became a stronghold of the left. Its incorporation of \"Red Berlin\" and the industrialised Ruhr Area, both with working class majorities, ensured left-wing dominance.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp 620\u2013624</ref>\n\nFrom 1919 to 1932, Prussia was governed by a coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre]] and [[German Democratic Party|German Democrats]]; from 1921 to 1925, coalition governments included the [[German People's Party]]. Unlike in other states of the German Reich, majority rule by democratic parties in Prussia was never endangered. Nevertheless, in [[East Prussia]] and some rural areas, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] gained more and more influence and popular support, especially from the lower middle class starting in 1930. Except for Catholic [[Upper Silesia]], the Nazi Party in 1932 became the largest party in most parts of the Free State of Prussia. However, the democratic parties in coalition remained a majority, while Communists and Nazis were in the opposition.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp 630\u2013639</ref>\n\nThe East Prussian [[Otto Braun]], who was Prussian minister-president almost continuously from 1920 to 1932, is considered one of the most capable Social Democrats in history. He implemented several trend-setting reforms together with his minister of the interior, [[Carl Severing]], which were also models for the later [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG). For instance, a Prussian minister-president could be forced out of office only if there was a \"positive majority\" for a potential successor. This concept, known as the [[constructive vote of no confidence]], was carried over into the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the FRG. Most historians regard the Prussian government during this time as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', p 652</ref>\n\nIn contrast to its pre-war authoritarianism, Prussia was a pillar of democracy in the Weimar Republic. This system was destroyed by the ''[[Preu\u00dfenschlag]]'' (\"Prussian coup\") of [[Reich Chancellor]] [[Franz von Papen]]. In this [[coup d'\u00e9tat]], the government of the Reich deposed the Prussian government on 20 July 1932, under the pretext that the latter had lost control of public order in Prussia (during the [[Altona Bloody Sunday|Bloody Sunday]] of [[Altona, Hamburg]], which was still part of Prussia at that time) and by using fabricated evidence that the Social Democrats and the Communists were planning a joint ''putsch''. The Defence Minister General [[Kurt von Schleicher]], who was the prime mover behind the coup manufactured evidence that the Prussian police under Braun's orders were favouring the Communist ''[[Rotfrontk\u00e4mpferbund]]'' in street clashes with the SA as part of an alleged plan to foment a Marxist revolution, which he used to get an emergency decree from President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] imposing ''Reich'' control on Prussia.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, John ''The Nemesis of Power'', London: Macmillan, 1967 page 253.</ref> Papen appointed himself Reich commissioner for Prussia and took control of the government. The ''Preu\u00dfenschlag'' made it easier, only half a year later, for Hitler to take power decisively in Germany, since he had the whole apparatus of the Prussian government, including the police, at his disposal.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp 647\u2013648</ref>\n\n===Prussia and the Third Reich===\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]]]]\n[[File:Former eastern territories of Germany.png|thumb|{{legend|#676767|Territory lost after World War I}}\n{{legend|#000000|Territory lost after World War II}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|Present-day Germany}}]]\n\nAfter the appointment of Hitler as the new chancellor, the Nazis used the absence of [[Franz von Papen]] as an opportunity to appoint [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] federal commissioner for the Prussian ministry of the interior. The [[March 1933 German federal election|Reichstag election]] of 5 March 1933 strengthened the position of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP or \"Nazi\" Party), although they did not achieve an absolute majority.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp. 655\u2013670</ref>\n\nThe [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] having been [[Reichstag fire|set on fire]] a few weeks earlier on 27 February, a new [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] was opened in the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] of [[Potsdam]] on 21 March 1933 in the presence of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. In a propaganda-filled meeting between Hitler and the Nazi Party, the \"marriage of old Prussia with young Germany\" was celebrated, to win over the Prussian monarchists, conservatives and nationalists and induce them into supporting and subsequently voting in favor of the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C06886, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Paul von Hindenburg]]]]\n\nIn the centralised state created by the Nazis in the \"Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich\" (\"[[:de:Gesetz \u00fcber den Neuaufbau des Reichs|Gesetz \u00fcber den Neuaufbau des Reichs]]\", 30 January 1934) and the \"[[Reichsstatthalter#Reich Governors Law .281935.29|Law on Reich Governors]]\" (\"Reichsstatthaltergesetz\", 30 January 1935) the states were dissolved, in fact if not in law. The federal state governments were now controlled by governors for the Reich who were appointed by the chancellor. Parallel to that, the organisation of the party into districts (''[[Gau (German)|Gaue]]'') gained increasing importance, as the official in charge of a ''Gau'' (the head of which was called a ''[[Gauleiter]]'') was again appointed by the chancellor who was at the same time chief of the Nazi Party.\n\nThis centralistic policy went even further in Prussia. From 1934 to 1945, almost all ministries were merged and only a few departments were able to maintain their independence. Hitler himself became formally the governor of Prussia. However, his functions were exercised by Hermann G\u00f6ring as Prussian prime minister.\n\nAs provided for in the \"[[Greater Hamburg Act]]\" (\"Gro\u00df-Hamburg-Gesetz\"), certain exchanges of territory took place. Prussia was extended on 1 April 1937, for instance, by the incorporation of the Free and Hanseatic City of [[L\u00fcbeck]].\n\nThe Prussian lands transferred to Poland after the Treaty of Versailles were re-annexed during [[World War II]]. However, most of this territory was not reintegrated back into Prussia but assigned to separate ''Gaue'' of [[Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Wartheland]] during much of the duration of the war.\n\n===The end of Prussia===\n[[File:Germany former prussian lander.png|upright|thumb|Map of the current [[states of Germany]] that are completely or mostly situated inside the old borders of [[Imperial Germany]]'s [[Kingdom of Prussia]]]]\n\nThe areas east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], mainly Eastern Prussia, Western Prussia, and Silesia, were ceded over to Poland in 1945 due to the [[Treaty of Potsdam]] between three of the Allies: the United States, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. This included important Prussian cities like Danzig, K\u00f6nigsberg, Breslau, and Stettin. [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u201350)|The population fled]], mostly to the Western zones, or was driven out. The number of casualties is estimated 2 to 4 million, including those who fled the Soviet army during the last months of the war before the treaty.\n\nAs part of their wartime goals, the Western allies sought the [[abolition of Prussia]]. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] was initially content to retain the name, Russians having a different historical view of their neighbour and sometime former ally. Nonetheless by Law No. 46, which was accepted and implemented by the [[Allied Control Council]] on 25 February 1947, Prussia was officially proclaimed to be dissolved.<ref>Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'', pp. 670\u2013682</ref>\n\nIn the [[Soviet occupation zone]], which became [[East Germany]] (officially, the German Democratic Republic) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were reorganised into the states of [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]], with the remaining parts of the [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]] going to [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. These states were ''de facto'' abolished in 1952 in favour of ''[[Administrative divisions of East Germany#Division into Bezirke|Bezirke]]'' (districts), but were [[Administrative divisions of East Germany#Restoration of the L\u00e4nder|recreated]] after [[German reunification]] in 1990.\n\nIn the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Western Zones of occupation]], which became [[West Germany]] (officially, the Federal Republic of Germany) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were divided up among [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], Lower Saxony, [[Hesse]], Rhineland-Palatinate and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Hohenzollern]] were later merged with [[Baden]] to create the state of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The Saar region, which had been administered by the French as [[Saar Protectorate|a protectorate]] separate from the rest of Western Germany, was admitted to the Federal Republic of Germany as [[Saarland|a separate state]] in 1956 following a plebiscite.\n\nOne year later, in 1957, the [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] was established and implemented by federal statutes in West Germany in response to a ruling from the [[Federal Constitutional Court|Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]]. The fundamental goal of this institution is protecting the cultural legacy of Prussia. It continues to operate from its headquarters in Berlin to this very day.\n\n==Administrative and constitutional frameworks==\n{{Main|Free State of Prussia|Brandenburg-Prussia|Kingdom of Prussia}}\n\nIn the mid-16th century the [[List of rulers of Brandenburg|margraves of Brandenburg]] had become highly dependent on the Estates (representing counts, lords, knights, and towns, but not prelates, due to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1538).<ref name=\"Kotulla262\">Kotulla (2008), p. 262</ref> The margraviate's liabilities and tax income as well as the margrave's finances were in

Crown Jewels]], [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Berlin]]]]\n\nThe Kingdom of Prussia functioned as an [[absolute monarchy]] until the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], after which Prussia became a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg]] was elected{{by whom|date=March 2015}} as Prussia's first [[Prime Minister of Prussia|prime minister]] (''Ministerpr\u00e4sident''). [[Constitution of Prussia (1848)|Prussia's first constitution]] dated from 1848. The [[Constitution of Prussia (1850)|1850 Prussian Constitution]] established a [[Bicameralism|two-chamber]] parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Prussian Landtag|Landtag]]'' represented all taxpayers, who were [[Prussian three-class franchise|divided into three classes]] according to the amount of taxes paid. This allowed just over 25% of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population. The upper house (First Chamber or ''Erste Kammer''), later renamed the [[Prussian House of Lords]] (''Herrenhaus''), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the [[Junker]]s, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. The [[Prussian Secret Police]], formed in response to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], aided the conservative government.\n\nUnlike its authoritarian pre-1918 predecessor, Prussia from 1918 to 1932 was a promising democracy within Germany. The abolition of the political power of the aristocracy transformed Prussia into a region strongly dominated by the left wing of the political spectrum, with \"Red Berlin\" and the industrial centre of the [[Ruhr Area]] exerting major influence. During this period a coalition of centre-left parties ruled, predominantly under the leadership (1920\u20131932) of East Prussian [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Otto Braun]]. While in office Braun implemented several reforms (together with his Minister of the Interior, [[Carl Severing]]) that became models for the later [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. For instance, a Prussian prime minister could only be forced out of office if there was a \"positive majority\" for a potential successor{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. This concept, known as the [[constructive vote of no confidence]], became part of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Most{{quantify|date=March 2015}} historians regard the Prussian government during the 1920s as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.\n\nSimilar to other German states both [[States of Germany|now]] and [[Weimar Republic#Constituent states of Germany during the Weimar period|at the time]], [[Executive (government)|executive power]] remained vested in a [[Minister-President|Minister-President of Prussia]] and in laws established by a [[Landtag]] elected by the people.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Population===\nIn 1871, Prussia's population numbered 24.69 million, accounting for 60% of the [[German Empire]]'s population.<ref name=\"Handbuch\">{{Cite book |title=Handbuch der preussischen Geschichte |last=B\u00fcsch |first=Otto |last2=Ilja Mieck |last3=Wolfgang Neugebauer |publisher=de Gruyter |year=1992 |isbn=978-3-11-008322-4 |editor-last=Otto B\u00fcsch |volume=2 |location=Berlin |pages=42 |language=German}}</ref> In 1910, the population had increased to 40.17 million (62% of the Empire's population).<ref name=Handbuch/> In 1914, Prussia had an area of 354,490&nbsp;km\u00b2.

In the wake of the [[Reformation]], Prussia was dominated by two major [[Protestant]] confessions: Lutheranism and [[Calvinism]]. The majority of the Prussian population was Lutheran, although there were dispersed [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] minorities in central and western parts of the state especially [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Rhine Province|Rhineland]], [[Province of Westphalia|Westphalia]] and [[Province of Hesse-Nassau|Hesse-Nassau]]. In 1613, [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Grand Duke of Prussia]] declared himself for the Reformed creed and transferred the [[Berlin Cathedral]] from the Lutheran to the Reformed church. Lutherans and Reformed congregations all over the kingdom were merged in 1817 by the [[Prussian Union of churches]], which came under tight royal control.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Clark |first=Christopher |year=1996 |title=Confessional Policy and the Limits of State Action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817-40 |journal=The Historical Journal |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=985\u20131004 |doi=10.1017/S0018246X00024730 |jstor=2639865}}</ref> In Protestant regions, writes Nipperdey:\n{{bquote|Much of religious life was often conventional and superficial by any normal, human standard. The state and the bureaucracy kept their distance, preferring to spoon-feed the churches and treat them like children. They saw the churches as channels for education, as a means of instilling morality and obedience, or for propagating useful things, just like bee-keeping or potato-farming.<ref>Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (Princeton University Press, 2014) p 356</ref>}}\n\nPrussia received significant [[Huguenot]] population after the issuing of the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]] by [[Louis XIV of France]] and the following [[dragonnades]]. Prussian monarchs, beginning with [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg]] opened the country to the fleeing French Calvinist refugees. In Berlin, they built and worshipped at their own church called the [[French Cathedral]] on [[Gendarmenmarkt]]. Time passed by, and the French Reformed assimilated into the wider Protestant community in Prussia. East Prussia's southern region of [[Masuria]] was mostly made up of [[Germanisation|Germanised]] [[Lutheran]] [[Masurians]].\n\nAfter 1814, Prussia contained millions of Roman Catholics in the west and in the east. There were substantial populations in the [[Rhineland]], parts of [[Westphalia]], eastern parts of [[Province of Silesia|Silesia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Ermland]] and the [[Province of Posen]].<ref>Helmut Walser Smith, ed.. ''Protestants, Catholics and Jews in Germany, 1800\u20131914'' (Bloomsbury Academic, 2001)</ref> Communities in Poland were often ethnically [[Polish people|Polish]], although this is not the case of eastern Silesia as the majority of Catholics there were German. During the 19th-century [[Kulturkampf]], Prussian Catholics were forbidden from fulfilling any official functions for the state and were largely distrusted.\n\nPrussia contained a relatively large Jewish community, which was mostly concentrated in large urban areas. According to the 1880 census, it was the biggest one in Germany with 363,790 individuals.\n\nIn 1925, 64.9% of the Prussian population was [[Protestant]], 31.3% was [[Roman Catholic]], 1.1% was [[Jewish]], 2.7% was placed in other religious categories.<ref>Grundriss der Statistik.

Poles in this Polish-majority province (62% Polish, 38% German) resisted German rule. Also, the southeast portion of Silesia ([[Upper Silesia]]) had a Polish majority. But Catholics and Jews did not have equal status with Protestants.<ref>Hajo Holborn, ''History of Modern Germany: 1648\u20131840'' 2:274</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, the [[Second Polish Republic]] was granted not only these two areas, but also areas with a German majority in the Province of West Prussia.

One day, the sadistic hunting fanatic Shaw drives into town with a one-antlered deer who was strapped to the hood of his truck. After Boog frees him, the deer follows Boog home to find him sleeping in the garage. To wake Boog up, the deer throws rabbits at the window and introduces himself as Elliot. He tells him to be \"free\" from his garage captivity and introduces Boog to a world of sweet temptations he has never known. When Boog becomes sick from eating too many candy bars, events quickly spiral out of control, as the two raid the town's grocery store. Elliot escapes before Boog is caught by a friend of Beth's police officer Gordy. At the nature show, Elliot being chased by Shaw, sees Boog, which \"attacks\" him. This causes the whole audience to panic.\n\nShaw attempts to shoot Boog and Elliot, but Beth sedates them both with a [[tranquilizer gun]] just before Shaw fires his gun. Shaw flees before Gordy can arrest him for shooting a gun in the town. The two troublemakers are banned from the town and forced into the Timberline [[United States National Forest|National Forest]], only three days before open season starts, but they are relocated above the waterfalls, where they will be safe from the hunters. Since he lacks any outdoor survival skills, Boog reluctantly takes Elliot as his accident prone guide to get him back home to Timberline to reunite with Beth, but in the woods, they quickly learn that it is every animal for itself. The two run into their share of forest animals, which they think they are pests. The only forest animals they befriend are skunks, Maria and Rosie, ducks, Serge and Deni, various unnamed panic stricken rabbits, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] accented squirrel, McSquizzy, along with his roguish gang, Reilly, a beaver and his construction worker team, a porcupine named Buddy that is in search of a friend, and the herd of deer led by Ian and his assistant, Giselle with whom Elliot is in love.\n\nWith each adverse encounter, Boog learns a little about self-reliance and Elliot gains self-respect and they start to become friends. The next day, it is revealed that Elliot has absolutely no idea where he and Boog are going and has been leading Boog in a big circle. After accidentally causing a flood at Reilly's dam, Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw; Boog then loses his toy bear, Dinkleman, as the [[current (stream)|current]] makes the doll float out of Boog's paw. They end up in a waterfall, which floods and sends the animals falling down into the hunting grounds. After thinking Shaw is dead, at first everyone is furious at Boog, but then he accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home and driving everyone to the hunting grounds. Boog storms off, but unwittingly ends up in Shaw's log cabin, where he is discovered by Shaw, who survived and pursues him to the city road where Boog happens upon the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of deserting his companions, Boog reconciles with Elliot and helps the animals defend themselves using supplies taken from an RV owned by couple named Bob and Bobbie, who are looking for [[Bigfoot]], while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie joins with the forest animals.\n\nThe next day, the animals overpower the hunters, causing the hunters to retreat in defeat after McSquizzy blows up their trucks with a propane tank ignited by using an emergency flare. Shaw returns for a final confrontation and seemingly shoots Elliot, allowing Boog to furiously confront Shaw and quickly overpowers him and ties him up with his own gun. Boog accompanies Elliot, who is actually alive but his second antler is broken by the shot. The forest animals thank Boog for his help and then proceed to take out their vengeance on Shaw by smothering him with honey and pillow feathers and banish him from Timberline. While he gets banished, Shaw suddenly gets struck by Bob and Bobbie, who humorously mistake him for a Sasquatch and strap him on top of their trailer. Beth later returns in a helicopter to take Boog back home where he will be safe, but realizing how the adventures changed him, Boog decides to remain in the forest with his new friends.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Boog, a 900 pound, suave [[grizzly bear]]\n* [[Ashton Kutcher]] as Elliot, a hyperactive and clumsy, but quick witted [[mule deer]] who got his antler  broken off by Shaw's truck.

One day, the sadistic hunting fanatic Shaw drives into town with a one-antlered deer who was strapped to the hood of his truck. After Boog frees him, the deer follows Boog home to find him sleeping in the garage. To wake Boog up, the deer throws rabbits at the window and introduces himself as Elliot. He tells him to be \"free\" from his garage captivity and introduces Boog to a world of sweet temptations he has never known. When Boog becomes sick from eating too many candy bars, events quickly spiral out of control, as the two raid the town's grocery store. Elliot escapes before Boog is caught by a friend of Beth's police officer Gordy. At the nature show, Elliot being chased by Shaw, sees Boog, which \"attacks\" him. This causes the whole audience to panic.\n\nShaw attempts to shoot Boog and Elliot, but Beth sedates them both with a [[tranquilizer gun]] just before Shaw fires his gun. Shaw flees before Gordy can arrest him for shooting a gun in the town. The two troublemakers are banned from the town and forced into the Timberline [[United States National Forest|National Forest]], only three days before open season starts, but they are relocated above the waterfalls, where they will be safe from the hunters. Since he lacks any outdoor survival skills, Boog reluctantly takes Elliot as his accident prone guide to get him back home to Timberline to reunite with Beth, but in the woods, they quickly learn that it is every animal for itself. The two run into their share of forest animals, which they think they are pests. The only forest animals they befriend are skunks, Maria and Rosie, ducks, Serge and Deni, various unnamed panic stricken rabbits, the [[Scotland|Scottish]] accented squirrel, McSquizzy, along with his roguish gang, Reilly, a beaver and his construction worker team, a porcupine named Buddy that is in search of a friend, and the herd of deer led by Ian and his assistant, Giselle with whom Elliot is in love.\n\nWith each adverse encounter, Boog learns a little about self-reliance and Elliot gains self-respect and they start to become friends. The next day, it is revealed that Elliot has absolutely no idea where he and Boog are going and has been leading Boog in a big circle. After accidentally causing a flood at Reilly's dam, Boog and Elliot are confronted by Shaw; Boog then loses his toy bear, Dinkleman, as the [[current (stream)|current]] makes the doll float out of Boog's paw. They end up in a waterfall, which floods and sends the animals falling down into the hunting grounds. After thinking Shaw is dead, at first everyone is furious at Boog, but then he accuses Elliot of lying to him about leading him home and driving everyone to the hunting grounds. Boog storms off, but unwittingly ends up in Shaw's log cabin, where he is discovered by Shaw, who survived and pursues him to the city road where Boog happens upon the glowing lights of Timberline. Instead of deserting his companions, Boog reconciles with Elliot and helps the animals defend themselves using supplies taken from an RV owned by couple named Bob and Bobbie, who are looking for [[Bigfoot]], while their pet dachshund Mr. Weenie joins with the forest animals.\n\nThe next day, the animals overpower the hunters, causing the hunters to retreat in defeat after McSquizzy blows up their trucks with a propane tank ignited by using an emergency flare. Shaw returns for a final confrontation and seemingly shoots Elliot, allowing Boog to furiously confront Shaw and quickly overpowers him and ties him up with his own gun. Boog accompanies Elliot, who is actually alive but his second antler is broken by the shot. The forest animals thank Boog for his help and then proceed to take out their vengeance on Shaw by smothering him with honey and pillow feathers and banish him from Timberline. While he gets banished, Shaw suddenly gets struck by Bob and Bobbie, who humorously mistake him for a Sasquatch and strap him on top of their trailer.
