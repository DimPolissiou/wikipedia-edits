The match decided the winner of the [[1950\u201351 DDR-Oberliga]], the 2nd season of the [[DDR-Oberliga]], the top-level football league in [[East Germany]]. The match was necessary as both teams finished the season level on points. At the time, the rules stated that if this were to occur, a playoff would be necessary to decide the national champion. With a 2\u20130 victory, Chemie Leipzig secured the championship for their 1st national title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/ddrhist.html|title=East Germany 1946-1990|accessdate=29 October 2016|website=RSSSF.com|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation]]}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe final phase of the championship for a long time was a three-way battle between [[FSV Zwickau|Motor Zwickau]], Chemie Leipzig, and Turbine Erfurt. However, as Zwickau lost both games against these direct opponents, they ended up finishing third. Two matchdays before the end of the season saw Leipzig leading Erfurt by a point. But on the final day they lost their table lead after a 2\u20133 defeat against [[Fortuna Babelsberg|Rotation Babelsberg]]. At the same time, Erfurt won 2\u20130 against Zwickau, meaning Chemie Leipzig and Turbine Erfurt were level on points at the top of the table.\n\n==Match==\n\n===Summary===\nWhile Chemie Leipzig were able to compete with their starting players, Turbine Erfurt were without defender [[Helmut Nordhaus]] and center-forward [[Wolfgang Nitsche]], two important players. Both were suspended due to being disciplined in the international match between East Germany and Poland. Erfurt had another loss to cope with, as twelve minutes into the game, striker [[Heinz Hammer]] had to be substituted out due to an injury. Prior to that, Leipzig's attacker [[Georg Zenker]] had proven the dangerousness of his team with a good opportunity. At first the game was open, and Erfurt had an opportunity to take the lead in the 25th minute. However, [[Heinz Wozniakowski]]'s free kick hit the post. Erfurt were thankful for the weak performance of the left attack side of Leipzig of [[Heinz Fr\u00f6hlich]] and [[Rolf Grupe]], and the absence of Nordhaus remained unnoticed for the time being.\n\nThe second half began with a strong offensive by Turbine Erfurt. In this period, the defence organized by [[Werner Eilitz]] of Leipzig proved its class. Leipzig had already conceded the fewest goals in the past Oberliga season, and now also stood up to the test of Erfurt. In the 52nd minute Erfurt scored what should have been a goal, but was falsely disallowed by referee Liebschner because of alleged offside player. In the middle of Erfurt's strong period, Chemie countered with surprising play. [[Rudolf Krause (footballer)|Rudolf Krause]] got past two Erfurt players and slotted the ball to [[Gerhard Helbig]], who took the ball and scored past the Erfurt keeper for a 1\u20130 lead. Five minutes later, both players again found themselves combining. This time, Krause scored Leipzig's second goal with a 16-meter-long shot. Although Erfurt's best player, [[Jochen M\u00fcller (footballer, born 1925)|Jochen M\u00fcller]], continued his efforts, Erfurt could no longer turn the result, and the match finished as a 2\u20130 win for Chemie.\n\n===Details===\n{{Football box\n|date       = {{Start date|1951|5|20|df=y}}\n|time       =\n|team1      = [[FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt|Turbine Erfurt]]\n|score      = 0\u20132\n|report     = https://www.dfb.de/historie/ddr-fussball/ddr-oberliga/?spieledb_path=%2Fmatches%2F1967668\n|team2      = [[BSG Chemie Leipzig (1950)|Chemie Leipzig]]\n|goals1     =\n|goals2     =\n* [[Gerhard Helbig|Helbig]] {{goal|65}}\n* [[Rudolf Krause (footballer)|Krause]] {{goal|70}}\n|stadium    = [[Sportforum Chemnitz|Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stadion]], [[Chemnitz]]\n|attendance = 60,000\n|referee    = [[Kurt Liebschner]] ([[Wei\u00dfenfels]])\n}}\n\n{| width=92%\n|-\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la =\n |pattern_b  =\n |pattern_ra =\n |pattern_sh =\n |pattern_so =\n |leftarm    = FF0000\n |body       = FF0000\n |rightarm   = FF0000\n |shorts     =\n |socks      =\n |title      = {{nowrap|Turbine Erfurt}}\n}}\n|{{Football kit\n |pattern_la =\n |pattern_b  =\n |pattern_ra =\n |pattern_sh =\n |pattern_so =\n |leftarm    = 009F3C\n |body       = 009F3C\n |rightarm   = 009F3C\n |shorts     =\n |socks      =\n |title      = {{nowrap|Chemie Leipzig}}\n}}\n|}\n\n{| width=\"100%\"\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||'''1''' ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Heinz Senftleben]]\n|-\n|RB ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Wilhelm Hoffmeyer]]\n|-\n|LB ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Hans Machts]]\n|-\n|RH ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Karl-Heinz L\u00f6ffler]]\n|-\n|CH ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Hans Birke]]\n|-\n|LH ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Jochen M\u00fcller (footballer, born 1925)|Jochen M\u00fcller]]\n|-\n|OR ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Eduard Francke]]\n|-\n|IR ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Heinz Hammer]] || {{suboff|12}}\n|-\n|CF ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Heinz Wozniakowski]]\n|-\n|IL ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Winfried Herz]]\n|-\n|OL ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Helmut Lipper]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Substitute:'''\n|-\n|FW ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Erich Martin]] || || {{subon|12}}\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Manager:'''\n|-\n|colspan=3|{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} Fischer\n|}\n|valign=\"top\"|[[File:Turbine Erfurt vs Chemie Leipzig 1951-05-20.svg|300px]]\n|valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"|\n{| style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n!width=25| !!width=25|\n|-\n|GK ||'''1''' ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[G\u00fcnter Busch (footballer, born 1930)|G\u00fcnter Busch]]\n|-\n|RB ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Werner Brembach]]\n|-\n|LB ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Walter Rose (footballer)|Walter Rose]]\n|-\n|RH ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Horst Scherbaum]]\n|-\n|CH ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Werner Eilitz]]\n|-\n|LH ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Gerhard Polland]]\n|-\n|OR ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Gerhard Helbig]]\n|-\n|IR ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Rudolf Krause (footballer)|Rudolf Krause]]\n|-\n|CF ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Georg Zenker]]\n|-\n|IL ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Heinz Fr\u00f6hlich]]\n|-\n|OL ||        ||{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Rolf Grupe]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|'''Manager:'''\n|-\n|colspan=3|{{flagicon|GDR|1949}} [[Rolf Kukowitsch]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;General references\n* DDR-Sportzeitung ''[[Deutsches Sportecho]]'', 21 and 25 May 1951\n* Baingo/Horn: ''Geschichte der DDR-Oberliga''.

Later in 1218, a German army led by Oliver of Cologne, and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] which attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards [[Cairo]] in July 1221, but were turned back after their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat.  A nighttime attack by Sultan [[Al-Kamil]] resulted in a great number of crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army.  Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of [[Christendom]] to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2\u201323|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.\n\nIn 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew had the largest royal army in the history of the crusades (20,000 knights and 12,000 castle-garrisons).{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>\nAt their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]]. After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubids]] in [[Syria]]. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: ''Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time'' (page 210)</ref> In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders - Masters of Hospitallers, Templars and Teutonic knights with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade - held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.<ref>Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard: ''A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East'' (page 358)</ref>\n\nKing Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Jordan River]] on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.<ref>(Jean Richard: ''The Crusades'', c 1071-c. 1291) page 298.</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title= The Crusades: A History of One of the Most Epic Military Campaigns of All Time |author= Jonathan Howard |year= 2011 |publisher= BookCaps Study Guides [for Kindle; Golgotha Press for paperback] |page= |isbn= 9781610428040 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWEUg5pMqJYC&pg=PT22 |access-date=12 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAndrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.<ref name=Howard/>\n\n===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===\nLater in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Keykavus I]], Seljuq Sultan of Rum in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RAbaJ3EbWjUC&pg=PR11&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title=The 14th and Final Crusade to the Middle East: Crusades from the 11th Century to the 21st Century |last1=Conte |first1=Joseph J. |website=[[Google Books]] |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn=9781452055466 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWQFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT203&dq=kaykaus+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=kaykaus%20fifth%20crusade&f=false |title= A Clash of Thrones: The Power-crazed Medieval Kings, Popes and Emperors of Europe |last1=Rawson|first1=Andrew |website=[[Google Books]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9780750966788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UCblDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT301&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title= Afghanistan's Experiences: The History of the Most Horrifying Events Involving Politics, Religion, and Terrorism |last1=Hadi |first1=Hamdi |website=[[Google Books]] |date=31 March 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9781524600068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tKSjW-j2G1YC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=sultanate+of+rum+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=sultanate%20of%20rum%20fifth%20crusade&f=false\n |title= Franks and Saracens: Reality and Fantasy in the Crusades and Terrorism |last1=Avner |first1=Falk|website=[[Google Books]] |date=2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016|isbn= 9781855757332 }}</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nIn July 1218 the crusaders began their [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u201319)|siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

Later in 1218, a German army led by Oliver of Cologne, and a mixed army of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers led by [[William I, Count of Holland]] joined the crusade. In order to attack [[Damietta]] in Egypt, they allied in [[Anatolia]] with the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm]] which attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.\n\nAfter occupying the port of [[Damietta]], the Crusaders marched south towards [[Cairo]] in July 1221, but were turned back after their dwindling supplies led to a forced retreat.  A nighttime attack by Sultan [[Al-Kamil]] resulted in a great number of crusader losses, and eventually in the surrender of the army.  Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe.\n\n==Preparations==\n[[Pope Innocent III]] had already planned since 1208 a crusade to recapture Jerusalem. In April 1213 he issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Quia maior]]'', calling all of [[Christendom]] to join a new [[crusade]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Thomas W.|date=2019|title=How to craft a crusade call: Pope Innocent III and Quia maior (1213)|journal=Historical Research|language=en|volume=92|issue=255|pages=2\u201323|doi=10.1111/1468-2281.12258|issn=1468-2281}}</ref> This was followed by another papal bull, the ''Ad Liberandam'' in 1215.<ref name=\"cf\">{{Citation |author=Christopher Tyerman| authorlink = Christopher Tyerman |title=God's war: a new history of the Crusades |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-02387-0 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/godswarnewhistor00tyer }}</ref>\n\n===France===\nThe message of the crusade was preached in France by [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]; unlike other Crusades, few French knights joined, as they were already fighting the [[Albigensian Crusade]] against the [[Heresy|heretical]] [[Cathar]] sect in southern France.\n\nIn 1215 Pope Innocent III summoned the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], where, along with the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Raoul of Merencourt]], he discussed the recovery of the Holy Land, among other church business. Pope Innocent wanted it to be led by the [[papacy]], as the [[First Crusade]] should have been, to avoid the mistakes of the [[Fourth Crusade]], which had been taken over by the [[Venice|Venetians]]. Pope Innocent planned for the crusaders to meet at [[Brindisi]] in 1216, and prohibited trade with the Muslims, to ensure that the crusaders would have ships and weapons. Every crusader would receive an [[indulgence]], including those who simply helped pay the expenses of a crusader, but did not go on crusade themselves.\n\n===Hungary and Germany===\n[[Oliver of Paderborn]] had preached the crusade in [[Holy Roman Empire]], and [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II]] attempted to join in 1215. Frederick was the last monarch Innocent wanted to join, as he had challenged the [[Papacy]] (and would do so in the years to come). Innocent died in 1216 and was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius III]], who barred Frederick from participating, but organized crusading armies led by King [[Andrew II of Hungary]] and [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]]. Andrew had the largest royal army in the history of the crusades (20,000 knights and 12,000 castle-garrisons).{{citation needed|date = January 2013}}\n\n===Portugal===\nAccording to [[Oliver of Paderborn]], the ''[[Gesta crucignorum rhenanorum]] '' and ''[[De itinere frisonum]]'', many of the Crusaders from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and [[Friesland]] decided to go to the [[Holy Land]] by their traditional sea journey. The fleet made their first stop at [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] on the southern coast of England. There they elected their leaders and the laws by which they would organize their venture. From there led by Counts [[William I of Holland]] and [[George of Weid]] they continued on their way south to Lisbon. As in previous crusading seaborne journeys, the fleet was dispersed by storms and only gradually managed to reach the Portuguese city of Lisbon after making a stopover at the famous shrine of [[Santiago de Compostela]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"A Frisian Perspective on Crusading in Iberia as Part of the Sea Journey to the Holy Land 1217-1218\", ''Studies in Medieval and Renaissance History'' 15 (2019)</ref>\nAt their arrival in Portugal as during the second Crusade, the Bishop of Lisbon and other members of the Portuguese clergy attempted to persuade the crusaders to help them capture the [[Almohad]] controlled city of [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]]. The [[Frisians]] according to ''[[De itinere frisonum]],'' however, refused on account of [[Innocent III]]'s disqualification of the venture at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]].<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 62. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref> The other members of the fleet, however, were convinced by the Portuguese and started the siege of the city in August 1217. The Crusaders finally captured [[Alc\u00e1cer do Sal]] with the help of the [[Military order (religious society)|military orders]] on October 1217, after they repel an attempt by the governors of [[Seville]], [[Badajoz]], and [[Ja\u00e9n, Spain|Ja\u00e9n]] to relieve the besieged garrison. According to William of Holland in his letter to [[Pope Honorius III]] the Almohad leader of the garrison with 2000 of his followers converted to Christianity after they had surrendered the town to the crusading forces. From there on the Crusading fleet continued on its journey to the Levant.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, Lucas, \"Was the Portuguese Led Military Campaign against Alc\u00e1cer do Sal in the Autumn of 1217 Part of the Fifth Crusade?\", ''Al-Masaq'' 30:1 (2019), 64. https://doi.org/10.1080/09503110.2018.1542573</ref>\n\n===Georgia===\nPope Innocent had managed to secure Georgia's participation in the crusade. Georgia's largely isolationist policies had allowed it to accumulate a powerful army and a very large concentration of knights. However, the reconnaissance force under the Mongols [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai]] destroyed the entire Georgian army in two successive battles, most notably at the [[Battle of Khunan]]. After the death of Georgian King [[George IV of Georgia|George IV Lasha]], his sister [[Rusudan of Georgia|Queen Rusudan]] wrote to the Pope informing him that Georgia was unable to fulfill its promise to assist in the Crusade because its army had been destroyed by unknown savages. It has been speculated that the oddly passive behavior of the Crusaders in the later years was due to them waiting for the Georgian army to join the fray.<ref>Frank McLynn, Genghis Khan. DaCapo Press (2015), 322-327.</ref>\n\nDecades after this Crusade, Mongol ruler Hulegu Khan would take a census of the Kingdom of Georgia to ascertain how many troops it could muster. According to contemporary sources, the kingdom was judged to be able to field nine tumens.<ref>M.F. Brosset, \"Historie de la Georgie,\" I (St. Petersburg, 1849), pp. 548-549.</ref> A tumen was nominally 10,000 men, but usually averaged 5,000 in reality.<ref>David Morgan, \"The Mongols,\" 1986, p. 72. Morgan expresses skepticism that a tumen actually consisted of 10,000 men and notes that most were 3,000 to 7,000 men.</ref> If Hulegu's census was accurate, then the kingdom of Georgia in the 13th century was capable of mustering 45,000 soldiers. Had a force this size joined the Fifth Crusade, it would have more than doubled the Crusaders' strength.\n\n==Campaign==\n[[File:Ondrej.jpg|thumb|left|180px|King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]]]\n\n===Holy Land===\nThe first to take up the cross in the Fifth Crusade was King [[Andrew II of Hungary]].<ref>[[Alexander Mikaberidze]]: ''Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1 (page 311)</ref> In July 1217, Andrew departed from [[Zagreb]], accompanied by [[Leopold VI of Austria]] and [[Otto I, Duke of Merania]].{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|\u00c9rszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=133}} King Andrew's army was so large{{mdash}}at least 10,000 mounted soldiers and even much more \"uncountable\" infantrymen{{mdash}}that most of it stayed behind when Andrew and his men embarked in Split two months later.{{sfn|Van Cleve|1969|pp=387\u2013388}}{{sfn|Runciman|1989b|pp=147\u2013148}} They were transported by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] fleet, which was the largest European fleet in the era. {{sfn|Richard|1999|p=297}} Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217, in [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. They landed on 9 October on [[Cyprus]] from where they sailed to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and joined [[John of Brienne]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Hugh I of Cyprus]], and Prince [[Bohemond IV of Antioch]] to fight against the [[Ayyubids]] in [[Syria]]. Until his return to Hungary, King Andrew remained the leader of Christian forces in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Thomas Keightley, Dionysius Lardner: ''Outlines of history: from the earliest period to the present time'' (page 210)</ref> In October 1217, the leaders of the crusaders - Masters of Hospitalers, Templars and Teutons with the leaders and dignitaries of the crusade - held a war council in Acre, over which King Andrew II presided.<ref>Kenneth M. Setton, Norman P. Zacour, Harry W. Hazard: ''A History of the Crusades: The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East'' (page 358)</ref>\n\nKing Andrew's well-mounted army defeated sultan [[Al-Adil I]] at [[Bethsaida]] on the [[Jordan River]] on 10 November 1217. Muslim forces retreated in their fortresses and towns. In Jerusalem, the walls and fortifications were demolished to prevent the Christians from being able to defend the city, if they did manage to reach it and take it. Muslims fled the city, afraid that there would be a repeat of the bloodbath of the [[First Crusade]] in 1099. The crusaders' catapults and [[trebuchet]]s did not arrive in time, so they had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the [[Lebanon]] and on [[Mount Tabor]]. Afterwards, Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics. At the beginning of 1218 Andrew, who was very sick, decided to return to Hungary.<ref>(Jean Richard: ''The Crusades'', c 1071-c. 1291) page 298.</ref><ref name=Howard>{{cite book |title=The Crusades: A History of One of the Most Epic Military Campaigns of All Time |series= |author=Jonathan Howard |year= 2011 |location= |publisher=BookCaps Study Guides [for Kindle; Golgotha Press for paperback] |page= |isbn=9781610428040 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YWEUg5pMqJYC&pg=PT22&lpg=PT22&dq=%22jordan%22+%22King+Andrew%22+%221217%22+november+%22Bethsaida%22#v=onepage&q=%22jordan%22%20%22King%20Andrew%22%20%221217%22%20november%20%22Bethsaida%22&f=false|accessdate=12 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAndrew and his army departed to Hungary in February 1218, and Bohemund and Hugh also returned home.<ref name=Howard/>\n\n===Alliance with the Sultanate of Rum===\nLater in 1218 Oliver of Cologne arrived with a new German army and the count of Holland [[William I, Count of Holland|William I]] arrived with a mixed army consisting of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Flemish people|Flemish]] and [[Frisians|Frisian]] soldiers. With Leopold and John they discussed attacking [[Damietta]] in Egypt. To accomplish this, they allied with [[Keykavus I]], Seljuq Sultan of Rum in [[Anatolia]], who attacked the Ayyubids in Syria in an attempt to free the Crusaders from fighting on two fronts.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RAbaJ3EbWjUC&pg=PR11&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title=The 14th and Final Crusade to the Middle East: Crusades from the 11th Century to the 21st Century |last1=Conte |first1=Joseph J. |website=[[Google Books]] |date=4 December 2008 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn=9781452055466 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bWQFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT203&dq=kaykaus+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=kaykaus%20fifth%20crusade&f=false |title= A Clash of Thrones: The Power-crazed Medieval Kings, Popes and Emperors of Europe |last1=Rawson|first1=Andrew |website=[[Google Books]] |date=10 December 2015 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9780750966788 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=UCblDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT301&dq=fifth+crusade+alliance#v=onepage&q=fifth%20crusade%20alliance&f=false |title= Afghanistan's Experiences: The History of the Most Horrifying Events Involving Politics, Religion, and Terrorism |last1=Hadi |first1=Hamdi |website=[[Google Books]] |date=31 March 2016 |accessdate=30 August 2016|isbn= 9781524600068 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tKSjW-j2G1YC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=sultanate+of+rum+fifth+crusade#v=onepage&q=sultanate%20of%20rum%20fifth%20crusade&f=false\n |title= Franks and Saracens: Reality and Fantasy in the Crusades and Terrorism |last1=Avner |first1=Falk|website=[[Google Books]] |date=2010 |accessdate=31 August 2016|isbn= 9781855757332 }}</ref>\n\n===Egypt===\nIn July 1218 the crusaders began their [[Siege of Damietta (1218\u201319)|siege of Damietta]], and despite resistance from the unprepared sultan [[Al-Adil]], the tower outside the city was taken on August 25. They could not gain Damietta itself, and in the ensuing months diseases killed many of the crusaders, including [[Robert of Cour\u00e7on]]. Al-Adil also died and was succeeded by [[Al-Kamil]]. Meanwhile, Honorius III sent [[Pelagius of Albano]] to lead the crusade in 1219 . Al-Kamil tried to negotiate peace with the crusaders. He offered to trade [[Damietta]] for [[Jerusalem]], but Pelagius would not accept these offers. After hearing this [[William I, Count of Holland]] left the crusade and sailed home.  In August or September, [[Francis of Assisi]] arrived in the crusader camp and crossed over to preach to Al-Kamil. By November, the crusaders had worn out the sultan's forces, and were finally able to occupy the port.\n\nImmediately the papal and secular powers fought for control of the town, with [[John of Brienne]] claiming it for himself in 1220. Pelagius would not accept this, and John returned to Acre later that year. Pelagius hoped Frederick II would arrive with a fresh army, but he never did; instead, after a year of inactivity in both Syria and Egypt, [[John of Brienne]] returned. \n\nThen in July 1221, excited by rumors that the army of one King David, a descendant of the legendary [[Prester John]], was on its way from the east to the Holy Land to join the crusade, the crusaders at Damietta marched south towards [[Cairo]].<ref>Christopher Eric Taylor, ''Waiting for Prester John: The Legend, the Fifth Crusade, and Medieval Christian Holy War'', 2011, University of Texas at Austin.</ref> This move was observed by the forces of Al-Kamil, and frequent raids along the flanks of the army led to the withdrawal of some 2000 German troops who refused to continue the advance and returned to Damietta.\n\nBy now Al-Kamil was able to ally with the other [[Ayyubid]]s in Syria, who had defeated [[Keykavus I]]. The crusader march to [[Cairo]] was disastrous; the river [[Nile]] flooded ahead of them, stopping the crusader advance. A dry canal that they had previously crossed by flooded, thus blocking the crusader army's retreat. With supplies dwindling, a forced retreat began, culminating in a nighttime attack by Al-Kamil which resulted in a great number of crusader losses and eventually in the surrender of the army under Pelagius.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe terms of this surrender meant the relinquishing of [[Damietta]] to Al-Kamil in exchange for the release of the crusaders. Al-Kamil agreed to an eight-year peace agreement with Europe and to return a piece of the [[True Cross]]. However, the relic was never returned as Al-Kamil did not, in fact, have it.\n\nThe failure of the Crusade caused an outpouring of anti-papal sentiment from the [[Occitan]] poet [[Guilhem Figueira]]. The more orthodox [[Gormonda de Monpeslier]] responded to Figueira's ''D'un sirventes far'' with a song of her own, ''Greu m'es a durar''. Instead of blaming Pelagius or the Papacy, she laid the blame on the \"foolishness\" of the wicked.\n\n==Impact on literature==\nThe ''[[Pal\u00e4stinalied]]'' is a famous lyric poem by [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] written in [[Middle High German]] describing a [[pilgrim]] travelling to the [[Holy Land]] during the height of the Fifth Crusade.<ref>Kaye, Haley Caroline, \"The Troubadours and the Song of the Crusades\" (2016).Senior Projects Spring 2016.Paper 280. http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=senproj_s2016.

At the same time for the amateur championship registered a new club from Khmelnytskyi, ''[[FC Dynamo Khmelnytskyi|FC Podillia-Khmelnytskyi Khmelnytskyi]]''. So, since spring 2007 there were two clubs Podillia, one at professional level playing in Krasyliv and other - amateur playing in Khmelnytskyi. One of the reasons was the prior merger of [[FC Podillya Khmelnytskyi|Podillia]] with [[FC Krasyliv]] back in 2004. At the end of 2006-07 season Podillia Krasyliv changed back to [[FC Krasyliv]] and was scheduled to play in the [[2007-08 Ukrainian Second League]], but withdrew just before the start of season.\n\nInstead of Krasyliv to the [[Ukrainian Second League]] applied the newly revived [[FC Dynamo Khmelnytskyi|FC Podillia-Khmelnytskyi Khmelnytskyi]]. In such manner there was created a club's continium.\n\n===Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk===\n[[FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk]] was relegated to the [[Ukrainian Second League]], while another team form local university FC Fakel Ivano-Frankivsk obtain promotion to the [[Ukrainian First League]]. The city municipality on whose balance ended up both clubs decided to keep one and dissolve another one. So, in the [[2007-08 Ukrainian Second League]] season there were no clubs playing from [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], while a new team [[FSC Prykarpattia Ivano-Frankivsk]] was created in place of Fakel to participate in the [[2007-08 Ukrainian First League]] season.\n\n==See also==\n* [[2006\u201307 Ukrainian Premier League]]\n* [[2006\u201307 Ukrainian Second League]]\n* [[2006\u201307 Ukrainian Cup]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{in lang|uk}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080806154300/http://pfl.com.ua/1.php Persha Liha at Official Site of the Professional Football league of Ukraine]\n*[http://www.ua-football.com/ukrainian/first/467aff04.html 38th round of season and final league table] - UA-Football.com {{in lang|ru}}\n\n{{Ukrainian First League Seasons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2006-07 Ukrainian First League}}\n[[Category:Ukrainian First League seasons]]\n[[Category:2006\u201307 in Ukrainian association football leagues]]\n[[Category:2006\u201307 in European second tier association football leagues|Ukra]]\n", "name_user": "Jolicnikola", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFinal standings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_Ukrainian_First_League"}

It has been used in two connotations, the first in an ethnic or [[supra-ethnic]] connotation, and the second as a term for citizens of the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Cultural and political advocates of Yugoslav identity have historically ascribed the identity to be applicable to all people of South Slav heritage, including those of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]]. Attempts at uniting Bulgaria into Yugoslavia were however unsuccessful and therefore Bulgarians were not included in the panethnic identification.\n\nSince the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] and the establishment of South Slavic [[nation state]]s, the term ''ethnic Yugoslavs'' has been used to refer to those who exclusively view themselves as Yugoslavs with no other ethnic [[self-identification]], many of these being of mixed ancestry.<ref>https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1188/MR1188.ch3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, influential public intellectuals [[Jovan Cviji\u0107]] and [[Vladimir Dvornikovi\u0107]] advocated that ''Yugoslavs'', as a supra-ethnic nation, had \"many tribal ethnicities, such as Croats, Serbs, and others within it\".<ref name=wachte>{{cite book |last=Wachte |first=Andrew | title=Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation Literature and Cultural Politics in Yugoslavia |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1998 |pages=92\u201394 |isbn=0-8047-3181-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the official designation for those who declared themselves simply as ''Yugoslav'' was with quotation marks, \"Yugoslavs\" (introduced in census 1971). The quotation marks were originally meant to distinguish Yugoslav ethnicity from Yugoslav citizenship \u2013 which was written without quotation marks. The majority of those who had once identified as ethnic \"Yugoslavs\" reverted to or adopted traditional ethnic and national identities. Some also decided to turn to sub-national regional identifications, especially in multi-ethnic historical regions like [[Istria]], [[Vojvodina]], or [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] (hence [[Bosnians]]). The Yugoslav designation, however, continues to be used by many, especially by the descendants of Yugoslav migrants in the United States, Canada, and Australia while the country still existed.\n\n==History==\n===Yugoslavism and Yugoslavia===\n {{main|Yugoslavism}}\nSince the late 18th century, when traditional European ethnic affiliations started to mature into modern ethnic identities, there have been numerous attempts to define a common [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] ethnic identity. The word ''Yugoslav'', meaning \"South Slavic\", was first used by [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] in 1849.<ref>Enciklopedia Jugoslavije, Zagreb 1990, pp. 128-130.</ref> The first modern iteration of Yugoslavism was the [[Illyrian movement]] in [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Habsburg Croatia]]. It identified South Slavs with ancient [[Illyrians]] and sought to construct a common language based on the [[Shtokavian dialect]].<ref name=singleton>{{cite book |last=Singleton |first=Frederick Bernard | title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |page=93 |isbn=0-521-27485-0}}</ref> The movement was led by [[Ljudevit Gaj]], whose [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|script]] became one of two official scripts used for the [[Serbo-Croatian language]].<ref name=singleton/>\n\nAmong notable supporters of Yugoslavism and a Yugoslav identity active at the beginning of the 20th century were famous sculptor [[Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107]] (1883\u20131962), who called Serbian folk hero [[Prince Marko]] \"our Yugoslav people with its gigantic and noble heart\" and wrote poetry speaking of a \"Yugoslav race\";<ref name=\"Ivo Bana\u010d 1984.

An amalgamation of the most fertile qualities of our three tribes [Serbs, Croats, Slovenes] will come forth every more strongly, and thus will be constructed the type of single Yugoslav civilization-the final and most important goal of our country.\"<ref name=\"wachte\"/>\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]] shot and killed [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], the heir to the Austrian throne, and his wife, in Sarajevo.

The preamble stated that the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were \"the same by blood, by language, by the feelings of their unity, by the continuity and integrity of the territory which they inhabit undivided, and by the common vital interests of their national survival and manifold development of their moral and material life.\" The state was created as the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], a constitutional monarchy under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. The term \"Yugoslavs\" was used to refer to all of its inhabitants, but particularly to those of South Slavic ethnicity. Some Croatian nationalists viewed the Serb plurality and Serbian royal family as hegemonic. Eventually, a conflict of interest sparked among the Yugoslav peoples. In 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] sought to resolve a deep political crisis brought on by ethnic tensions by assuming dictatorial powers in the [[6 January Dictatorship]], renaming the country \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\", and officially pronouncing that there is one single Yugoslav nation with three tribes. The Yugoslav ethnic designation was thus imposed for a period of time on all South Slavs in Yugoslavia. Changes in Yugoslav politics after King Alexander's death in 1934 brought an end to this policy, but the designation continued to be used by some people.\n\nPhilosopher [[Vladimir Dvornikovi\u0107]] advocated the establishment of a Yugoslav ethnicity in his 1939 book entitled \"The [[Characterology]] of the Yugoslavs\". His views included eugenics and cultural blending to create one, strong Yugoslav nation.<ref name=wachte/>\n\nThere had on three occasions been efforts to make Bulgaria a part of Yugoslavia or part of an even larger federation: through [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] during and after [[World War I]]; through [[Zveno]] during the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934]], and through [[Georgi Dimitrov]] during and after [[World War II]], but for various reasons, each attempt turned out to be unsuccessful.<ref>Ahmet Ersoy, Maciej G\u00f3rny, Vangelis Kechriotis.

Traditional ethnic identities again became the primary ethnic designations used by most inhabitants of Yugoslavia. However, many people still declared themselves as \"Yugoslavs\" because they wanted to express an identification with Yugoslavia as a whole, but not specifically with any of its peoples.\n\n[[Josip Broz Tito]] expressed his desire for an undivided Yugoslav ethnicity when he stated, \"I would like to live to see the day when Yugoslavia would become amalgamated into a firm community, when she would no longer be a formal community but a community of a single Yugoslav nation.\"<ref>Norbu, Dawa (3\u20139 April 1999). \"The Serbian Hegemony, Ethnic Heterogeneity and Yugoslav Break-Up\". ''Economic and Political Weekly'' '''34''' (14): 835.</ref>\n\nThe Yugoslavs censuses reflected the Tito's ideal, with \"Yugoslav\" being an available identification for both ethnicity and nationality. In general, the Yugoslav identity was more common in the multiethnic regions of the country, i.e the more multiethnic the constituent republic, the higher the percentage; therefore the highest were in Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia (especially Vojvodina), and Bosnia and Herzegovina and the lowest were in Slovenia, Macedonia, and Kosovo. The 1971 census recorded 273,077 Yugoslav, or 1.33% of the total population. The 1981 census recorded 1,216,463 or 5.4% Yugoslavs.\n\n*In the 1991 census, 5.54% (242,682) of the inhabitants of [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared themselves to be Yugoslav.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine \u2013 Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.</ref> The Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1990 ratified a Presidency of seven members. One of the seven was to be elected amongst/by the republic's Yugoslavs, thereby introducing the Yugoslavs next to Muslims by nationality, Serbs and Croats into the Constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina although on an inferior level. However, because of the [[Bosnian War]] that erupted in 1992, this Constitution was short-lived and unrealized.\n\n*Approximately 5% of the population of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]] also declared themselves Yugoslav in the same census. \n\n*The 1981 census showed that Yugoslavs made up around 8.2% of the population in [[SR Croatia|Croatia]], this being the highest ever percentage of ''Yugoslavs'' within a constituent republic's borders. The percentage was the highest in multiethnic regions and cities with large non-Croatian population and among those of mixed ancestry. The 1991 census data indicated that the number of Yugoslavs had dropped to 2% of the population in Croatia. The 2001 census in Croatia (the first since independence) registered 176 Yugoslavs, less than 0.001% of the population at the time.<ref name=\"Croatia census data\">[http://www.vojska.net/eng/armed-forces/croatia/about/population/ Population of Croatia 1931\u20132001]</ref> The next census in 2011 registered 331 Yugoslavs in Croatia (>0.01% of the population).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/H01_01_05/H01_01_05.html|title=Dr\u017eavni zavod za statistiku Republike Hrvatske|website=www.dzs.hr}}</ref>\n\n*In the autonomous region of [[SAP Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], marked by its traditionally multiethnic make-up, recorded a similar percentage as Croatia at the 1981 census, with ~8% of its 2 million inhabitants declaring themselves Yugoslav.\n\nJust before and after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, most Yugoslavs reverted to their ethnic and regional identities. Nevertheless, the concept has survived in parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (where most towns have a tiny percentage), and [[Serbia and Montenegro]] (2003\u20132006), which kept the name \"Yugoslavia\" the longest, right up to February 2003.\n\n==Successor states==\n {{see also|Yugo-nostalgia}}\n===Self-identification===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+ Percentage identifying as Yugoslav\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\" | Number (census year)\n|-\n| {{flag|Bosnia and Herzegovina}} || 2,507 (2013)\n|-\n| {{Flag|Croatia}} ||331 (2011)<ref name=\"HR\">[http://www.dzs.hr/Hrv/censuses/census2011/results/htm/H01_01_05/H01_01_05.html Croatian 2011 Census, detailed classification by nationality]</ref>\n|-\n| {{Flag|North Macedonia}}|| N/A\n|-\n| {{Flag|Montenegro}} ||1,154 (2011)<ref name=monstat>[http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/popis2011/saopstenje/saopstenje%281%29.pdf Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Montenegro 2011] Monstat \u2013 Statistical Office of Montenegro</ref>\n|-\n|{{flag|Kosovo}}|| N/A\n|-\n| {{Flag|Serbia}}|| 23,303 (2011)<ref name=\"serbcens\">{{cite book | url = http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/Popis2011/Nacionalna%20pripadnost-Ethnicity.pdf | work = 2011 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Serbia | title = Population : ethnicity : data by municipalities and cities | publisher = Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia | location = Belgrade | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-86-6161-023-3 | pages = 14, 20 | accessdate = 2012-12-02}}</ref>\n|-\n| {{Flag|Slovenia}} ||527 (2002)<ref name=slostat>{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.si/popis2002/en/rezultati/rezultati_red.asp?ter=SLO&st=7|title=Statisti\u010dni urad RS - Popis 2002|website=www.stat.si}}</ref>\n|-\n!

It has been used in two connotations, the first in an ethnic or [[supra-ethnic]] connotation, and the second as a term for citizens of the former [[Yugoslavia]]. Cultural and political advocates of Yugoslav identity have historically ascribed the identity to be applicable to all people of South Slav heritage, including those of modern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Serbia]], and [[Slovenia]]. Attempts at uniting Bulgaria into Yugoslavia were however unsuccessful and therefore Bulgarians were not included in the panethnic identification.\n\nSince the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] and the establishment of South Slavic [[nation state]]s, the term ''ethnic Yugoslavs'' has been used to refer to those who exclusively view themselves as Yugoslavs with no other ethnic [[self-identification]], many of these being of mixed ancestry.<ref>https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1188/MR1188.ch3.pdf</ref>\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, influential public intellectuals [[Jovan Cviji\u0107]] and [[Vladimir Dvornikovi\u0107]] advocated that ''Yugoslavs'', as a supra-ethnic nation, had \"many tribal ethnicities, such as Croats, Serbs, and others within it\".<ref name=wachte>{{cite book |last=Wachte |first=Andrew | title=Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation Making a Nation, Breaking a Nation Literature and Cultural Politics in Yugoslavia |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=1998 |pages=92\u201394 |isbn=0-8047-3181-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], the official designation for those who declared themselves simply as ''Yugoslav'' was with quotation marks, \"Yugoslavs\" (introduced in census 1971). The quotation marks were originally meant to distinguish Yugoslav ethnicity from Yugoslav citizenship \u2013 which was written without quotation marks. The majority of those who had once identified as ethnic \"Yugoslavs\" reverted to or adopted traditional ethnic and national identities. Some also decided to turn to sub-national regional identifications, especially in multi-ethnic historical regions like [[Istria]], [[Vojvodina]], or [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] (hence [[Bosnians]]). The Yugoslav designation, however, continues to be used by many, especially by the descendants of Yugoslav migrants in the United States, Canada, and Australia while the country still existed.\n\n==History==\n===Yugoslavism and Yugoslavia===\n {{main|Yugoslavism}}\nSince the late 18th century, when traditional European ethnic affiliations started to mature into modern ethnic identities, there have been numerous attempts to define a common [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] ethnic identity.

The preamble stated that the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes were \"the same by blood, by language, by the feelings of their unity, by the continuity and integrity of the territory which they inhabit undivided, and by the common vital interests of their national survival and manifold development of their moral and material life.\" The state was created as the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], a constitutional monarchy under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. The term \"Yugoslavs\" was used to refer to all of its inhabitants, but particularly to those of South Slavic ethnicity. Some Croatian nationalists viewed the Serb plurality and Serbian royal family as hegemonic. Eventually, a conflict of interest sparked among the Yugoslav peoples. In 1929, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] sought to resolve a deep political crisis brought on by ethnic tensions by assuming dictatorial powers in the [[6 January Dictatorship]], renaming the country \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\", and officially pronouncing that there is one single Yugoslav nation with three tribes. The Yugoslav ethnic designation was thus imposed for a period of time on all South Slavs in Yugoslavia. Changes in Yugoslav politics after King Alexander's death in 1934 brought an end to this policy, but the designation continued to be used by some people.\n\nPhilosopher [[Vladimir Dvornikovi\u0107]] advocated the establishment of a Yugoslav ethnicity in his 1939 book entitled \"The [[Characterology]] of the Yugoslavs\". His views included eugenics and cultural blending to create one, strong Yugoslav nation.<ref name=wachte/>\n\nThere had on three occasions been efforts to make Bulgaria a part of Yugoslavia or part of an even larger federation: through [[Aleksandar Stamboliyski]] during and after [[World War I]]; through [[Zveno]] during the [[Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat of 1934]], and through [[Georgi Dimitrov]] during and after [[World War II]], but for various reasons, each attempt turned out to be unsuccessful.<ref>Ahmet Ersoy, Maciej G\u00f3rny, Vangelis Kechriotis.

Traditional ethnic identities again became the primary ethnic designations used by most inhabitants of Yugoslavia. However, many people still declared themselves as \"Yugoslavs\" because they wanted to express an identification with Yugoslavia as a whole, but not specifically with any of its peoples.\n\n[[Josip Broz Tito]] expressed his desire for an undivided Yugoslav ethnicity when he stated, \"I would like to live to see the day when Yugoslavia would become amalgamated into a firm community, when she would no longer be a formal community but a community of a single Yugoslav nation.\"<ref>Norbu, Dawa (3\u20139 April 1999). \"The Serbian Hegemony, Ethnic Heterogeneity and Yugoslav Break-Up\". ''Economic and Political Weekly'' '''34''' (14): 835.</ref>\n\nThe Yugoslavs censuses reflected the Tito's ideal, with \"Yugoslav\" being an available identification for both ethnicity and nationality. In general, the Yugoslav identity was more common in the multiethnic regions of the country, i.e the more multiethnic the constituent republic, the higher the percentage; therefore the highest were in Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia (especially Vojvodina), and Bosnia and Herzegovina and the lowest were in Slovenia, Macedonia, and Kosovo. The 1971 census recorded 273,077 Yugoslav, or 1.33% of the total population. The 1981 census recorded 1,216,463 or 5.4% Yugoslavs.\n\n*In the 1991 census, 5.54% (242,682) of the inhabitants of [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] declared themselves to be Yugoslav.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine \u2013 Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.</ref> The Constitution of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1990 ratified a Presidency of seven members. One of the seven was to be elected amongst/by the republic's Yugoslavs, thereby introducing the Yugoslavs next to Muslims by nationality, Serbs and Croats into the Constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina although on an inferior level. However, because of the [[Bosnian War]] that erupted in 1992, this Constitution was short-lived and unrealized.\n\n*Approximately 5% of the population of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]] also declared themselves Yugoslav in the same census. \n\n*The 1981 census showed that Yugoslavs made up around 8.2% of the population in [[SR Croatia|Croatia]], this being the highest ever percentage of ''Yugoslavs'' within a constituent republic's borders. The percentage was the highest in multiethnic regions and cities with large non-Croatian population and among those of mixed ancestry.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas'').

The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city.

On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas'').

The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[loam|loessial]] [[plateau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201033 |publisher=City of Belgrade (official website) |title=Natural Features |accessdate=12 December 2012}}</ref><!--{{cite conference |url=http://www.geo.uni.lodz.pl/~icuc5/text/P_1_10.pdf |title=Topoclimate and air pollution effects on respiratory diseases occurrences in Belgrade |first=Verica |last=Gbur\u010dik |author2=Valentina Gbur\u010dik|author3=Ljubinka Mar\u010deti\u0107|author4=Slobodan To\u0161ovi\u0107 |publisher=Institute of Public Health of Belgrade |format=PDF}}-->\n\nOne of the characteristics of the city terrain is [[mass wasting]]. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

{"title_page": "Music theory", "text_new": "{{short description|Considers the practices and possibilities of music}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Gaffurio Pythagoras.png|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Iubal]], [[Pythagoras]] and [[Philolaus]] engaged in theoretical investigations, in a woodcut from [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], ''Theorica music\u00e6'' (1492).]]\n\n'''Music theory''' is the study of the practices and possibilities of [[music]]. ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term \"music theory\". The first is the \"[[Elements of music|rudiments]]\", that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation); the second is learning scholars views on music from antiquity to the present; the third a sub-topic of [[musicology]] that \"seeks to define processes and general principles in music\". The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis \"in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016|isbn=9780199579037|date=January 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of \"music\" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.<ref>See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains \"musica instrumentalis\" as beneath the \"true\" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' (\"It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows\").</ref> However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.<ref>See, for example, chapters 4\u20137 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nMusic theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15\u201317}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.\n\nIn modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|MA]] or [[PhD]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|Prehistoric music}}\n\nPreserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|G\u01d4d\u00ed]], and [[Anasazi flute]].\n\n===Antiquity===\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}\n\nSeveral surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.<ref>{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|K\u00fcmmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}</ref> The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, \"All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years.\"{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43\u201344}}\n\n====China====\n{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}\n\nMuch of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.<ref name=\"oxfordmusiconline.com\">Joseph S.C. Lam, \"China.\", \u00a7II, \"History and Theory\", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 15 November 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.</ref>\n\nThe earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.<ref>Robert Bagley, \"The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory\", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41\u201390.</ref>\n\nChinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[L\u00fcshi chunqiu]] from about 239&nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the \"Yellow Bell.\" He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''l\u00fcl\u00fc'' or later the ''shierl\u00fc''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}\n\nThe ''l\u00fcl\u00fc'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40\u201341}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''l\u00fcl\u00fc'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41\u201342}}\n\nThe two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the \"Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds,\" or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&nbsp;BCE) as pitches of \"superior generation,\" that is, the pitches of Ling Lun's male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of \"inferior generation,\" that is, the pitches of Ling Lun's female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}\n\n<blockquote>Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' (\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468\u2013c376&nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi's claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' (\"Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants\").<ref name=\"oxfordmusiconline.com\"/></blockquote>\n\n====India====\nThe [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 \u2013 1000&nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking. The [[Natya Shastra]], written between 200&nbsp;BCE to 200&nbsp;CE, discusses intervals (''\u015arutis''), scales (''Gr\u0101mas''), consonances and dissonances, classes of melodic structure (''M\u016brchan\u0101s'', modes?), melodic types (''J\u0101tis''), instruments, etc.<ref>''The N\u0101\u021bya\u015b\u0101stra, A Treatise on Hindu Dramaturgy and Histrionics, attributed to Bharata-Muni'', translated from the Sanskrit with introduction and notes by Manomohan Ghosh, vol.

Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=\u00a75 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes.

This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony \"come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account\" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=\u00a75 Early Middle Ages}}\n\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (\"The art of measured chant\") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.\n\n===Modern===\n\n====Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries====\n* B\u1fb1qiy\u1fb1 N\u1fb1yin\u1fd1 (Uzbekistan, 17th century CE), Uzbek author and music theorist.

The music focuses on the solfege \"fa, sol, la\" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving \"shape notes\", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for \"singing by note\" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=978-0-8203-0426-7|location=United States of America|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sacredharp00buel/page/4 4\u20135, 60\u201361]|url=https://archive.org/details/sacredharp00buel/page/4}}</ref>\n\n{{see |List of music theorists#19th century}}\n\n===Contemporary===\n{{see also|List of music theorists#20th century|List of music theorists#21st century}}\n\n==Fundamentals of music==\n{{Main|Aspect of music}}\nMusic is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; \"music theory\" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}\n\n===Pitch===\n{{Main|Pitch (music)}}\n[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]\nPitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\n\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class\u2014the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}\n\n[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.\n\n===Scales and modes===\n{{Main|Musical scale| Musical mode}}\n[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]\nNotes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nThe most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)\u2014they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73\u201374}}\n\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.\n\n===Consonance and dissonance===\n{{Main|Consonance and dissonance}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Perfect octave on C.png\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = A consonance\n| caption1 = The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}\n| image2 = Minor second on C.png\n| width2 = 175\n| alt2 = A dissonance\n| caption2 = The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}\n| footer = \n}}\n[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.\nConsonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and \"wants to\" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nContext and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the [[Common practice period|Common practice era]], the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s concept of \"emancipated\" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as \"higher,\" more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}<!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.-->}}\n\n===Rhythm===\n{{Main|Rhythm}}\n[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]\nRhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.\n\nThrough increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented.

The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note\u2014so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.\n\nA series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]].

For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. It is part of a chord, but is not one of the chord tones (1 3 5 7). Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) \"resolves\" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments.<ref>https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/14206/6/06_chapter%202.pdf</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=November 2019|reason=Self-contradictory, self-published?}}\n\n===Timbre===\n{{Main|Timbre}}\n[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups. Below is the E9 chord audio:\n[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).ogg]] ]]Timbre, sometimes called \"color\", or \"tone color,\" is the principal phenomenon that allows us to distinguish one instrument from another when both play at the same pitch and volume, a quality of a voice or instrument often described in terms like bright, dull, shrill, etc. It is of considerable interest in music theory, especially because it is one component of music that has as yet, no standardized nomenclature. It has been called \"... the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,\"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.\n\n[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nA voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and \"sweet\" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Dynamics====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n{{Relevance inline|section|date=September 2015|reason=What has this entire section to do with theory?}}\n{{Main|Dynamics (music)}}\n[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]\nIn music, \"[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]\" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.\n\nThe conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally \"half soft\") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or \"pushed\" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').\n\nGreater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''pi\u00f9 piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''diminuendo'' or ''decrescendo''), often called \"[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]\" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.\n\n====Articulation====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n{{Main|Articulation (music)}}\n[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[Accent (music)|accent]], [[tenuto]].]]\nArticulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.\n\nFor example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as \"separated\" or \"detached\" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).\n\nThere is a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are\u2014from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' (\"separated\", \"detached\"); ''[[martel\u00e9 (bowstroke)|martel\u00e9]]'' (heavily accented or \"hammered\").{{Contradiction inline|date=March 2020|reason=The accompanying illustration names \"staccato\", \"tenuto\", and three other articulations not listed here. Are these synonyms and, if so, which are synonyms of which? Neither list is cited to a reliable source.}} Many of these can be combined to create certain \"in-between\" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.\n\n===Texture===\n{{Main|Musical texture}}\n[[File:Sousa - \"Washington Post March,\" m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s \"[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]],\" mm. 1\u20137{{audio|Sousa - \"Washington Post March,\" m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]\nIn [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many \"layers\" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.\n\nThe thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}\n\nCommon types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}<!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.-->\n\n===Form or structure===\n[[File:Canon example.png|thumb|A musical [[canon (music)|canon]].

All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.\n\nExpression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}<!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--> Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?-->}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?-->}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?-->}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?-->}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?-->}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kod\u00e1ly Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.\n\nIn standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.\n\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.\n\n==Music theory as academic discipline==\nThe scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{Main|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}\n[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created.

Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.\n{{audio|Debussy Pelleas et Melisande-prelude opening.mid|Play}}]]\nMusical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], \"analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards.\"{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]]'s claim that, \"to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}</ref>\n\n[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868\u20131935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.<ref>Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erl\u00e4uterungen'' (\"Elucidations\"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8\u20139, pp. 49\u201351, vol. 10, pp. 40\u20132; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201\u201305; 2, p. 193-97.

The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially \u00a7 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.</ref> The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.\n\nAlthough Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=\u00a7 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.\n\nTransformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects\u2014such as the \"C [[major chord]]\" or \"G major chord\"\u2014to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been \"transformed\" into the second by the \"[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation.\"  (Symbolically, one might write \"Dominant(C major) = G major.\") While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, \"[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'\"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}\n\n===Music perception and cognition===\n{{Further|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}\n[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]\nMusic psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]].

As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.-->\n\nMusic can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or \"basic musical language.\"{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}\n\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432\u201333}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that \"since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}\n\nMusical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's \"most striking and distinctive characteristic\" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[\u00e9tude]]s (meaning \"study\") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Main|Music and mathematics}}\n[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is \"the basis of sound\" and sound itself \"in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties\", simply because nature itself \"is amazingly mathematical\".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42\u201343}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22\u201324}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.\n[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]\nIn the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}\n\n===Serial composition and set theory===\n[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]\n{{Further|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}\nIn music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \"[[parameter (music)|parameters]]\"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]<ref>{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}</ref>\n\n\"Integral serialism\" or \"total serialism\" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post\u2013World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are \"general serialism\" and \"multiple serialism\".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5\u20136}}\n\nMusical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOne branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Musical semiotics===\n{{Further|music semiology|Jean-Jacques Nattiez}}\n[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|upright|Semiotician [[Roman Jakobson]]]]\nMusic semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels.

The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music's Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard B. Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.\n\n===Education and careers===\n[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]\nMusic theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.{{sfn|McCreless|n.d.}} A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.{{sfn|McCreless|n.d.}} This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Mee\u00f9s|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.\n\nAs part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory PhD programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).\n\nMost music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}<!--How competitive is \"very\"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--> Applicants must hold a completed PhD or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired\u2014called an \"ABD\", for \"[[All But Dissertation]]\" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and PhD students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[AP Music Theory]]\n*[[List of music theorists]]\n*[[Music psychology]]\n*[[Musicology]]\n*[[Theory of painting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|33em}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2011}}|reference=Anon.

''The Oxford Companion to Music'' describes three interrelated uses of the term \"music theory\". The first is the \"[[Elements of music|rudiments]]\", that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation); the second is learning scholars views on music from antiquity to the present; the third a sub-topic of [[musicology]] that \"seeks to define processes and general principles in music\". The musicological approach to theory differs from music analysis \"in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Fallows|first1=David|title=Theory|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t114/e6759.|website=The Oxford Companion to Music|publisher=Oxford Music Online|accessdate=11 September 2016|isbn=9780199579037|date=January 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMusic theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see [[Definition of music]]), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of \"music\" in the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice.<ref>See Boethius's ''De institutione musica'', in which he disdains \"musica instrumentalis\" as beneath the \"true\" musician who studies music in the abstract: ''Multo enim est maius atque auctius scire, quod quisque faciat, quam ipsum illud efficere, quod sciat'' (\"It is much better to know what one does than to do what one knows\").</ref> However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.<ref>See, for example, chapters 4\u20137 of Christensen, Thomas (2002). ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nMusic theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts [[composers]] and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from [[Music of ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Chinese Music|China]],{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc=15\u201317}} and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see [[History of music]] and [[Musical instrument]]). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.\n\nIn modern academia, music theory is a subfield of [[musicology]], the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, ''music theory'' is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03b1, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle.{{sfn|OED|2005}} As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=Theory, theorists. 1. Definitions}} A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the [[Master of Arts|MA]] or [[PhD]] level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of [[musical acoustics]], considerations of [[musical notation]], and techniques of tonal [[Musical composition|composition]] ([[harmony]] and [[counterpoint]]), among other topics.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{Main|Prehistoric music}}\n\nPreserved prehistoric instruments, artifacts, and later depictions of performance in artworks can give clues to the structure of pitch systems in prehistoric cultures. See for instance [[Paleolithic flutes]], [[Gudi (instrument)|G\u01d4d\u00ed]], and [[Anasazi flute]].\n\n===Antiquity===\n\n====Mesopotamia====\n{{see also|Music of Mesopotamia}}\n\nSeveral surviving Sumerian and Akkadian clay tablets include musical information of a theoretical nature, mainly lists of intervals and tunings.<ref>{{harvnb|Mirelman|2010}}; {{harvnb|Mirelman|2013}}; {{harvnb|Wulstan|1968}}; {{harvnb|K\u00fcmmel|1970}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer|1971}}; {{harvnb|Kilmer and Mirelman|n.d.}}</ref> The scholar Sam Mirelman reports that the earliest of these texts dates from before 1500&nbsp;BCE, a millennium earlier than surviving evidence from any other culture of comparable musical thought. Further, \"All the Mesopotamian texts [about music] are united by the use of a terminology for music that, according to the approximate dating of the texts, was in use for over 1,000 years.\"{{sfn|Mirelman|2013|loc=43\u201344}}\n\n====China====\n{{see also|Music of China|Chinese musicology}}\n\nMuch of Chinese music history and theory remains unclear.<ref name=\"oxfordmusiconline.com\">Joseph S.C. Lam, \"China.\", \u00a7II, \"History and Theory\", ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 15 November 2015, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/43141pg2.</ref>\n\nThe earliest texts about Chinese music theory are inscribed on the stone and bronze bells excavated in 1978 from the tomb of Marquis Yi (died 433&nbsp;BCE) of the Zeng state. They include more than 2800 words describing theories and practices of music pitches of the time. The bells produce two intertwined pentatonic scales three tones apart with additional pitches completing the chromatic scale.<ref>Robert Bagley, \"The Prehistory of Chinese Music Theory\", ''Proceedings of the British Academy'' 131, 2004 (Lectures), pp. 41\u201390.</ref>\n\nChinese theory starts from numbers, the main musical numbers being twelve, five and eight. Twelve refers to the number of pitches on which the scales can be constructed. The [[L\u00fcshi chunqiu]] from about 239&nbsp;BCE recalls the legend of Ling Lun. On order of the Yellow Emperor, Ling Lun collected twelve bamboo lengths with thick and even nodes. Blowing on one of these like a pipe, he found its sound agreeable and named it ''huangzhong'', the \"Yellow Bell.\" He then heard phoenixes singing. The male and female phoenix each sang six tones. Ling Lun cut his bamboo pipes to match the pitches of the phoenixes, producing twelve pitch pipes in two sets: six from the male phoenix and six from the female: these were called the ''l\u00fcl\u00fc'' or later the ''shierl\u00fc''.{{sfn|Service|2013}}\n\nThe ''l\u00fcl\u00fc'' formed the ritual scale to which many instruments were tuned. The name of the lowest sound, ''huangzhong'' also implied 'musical correctness.' Its pitch formed a pitch standard, setting the base pitch of zithers, flutes and singers of imperial court orchestras. Straight-walled pitch pipes without finger holes were made of cast metal, their lengths specified by court regulations.{{sfn|Crease|2011|loc=40\u201341}} The resulting chromatic scale provided twelve fundamental notes for the construction of the musical scales themselves. The ''l\u00fcl\u00fc'' also has a cosmological value: its notes describe the energetic frequency of the twelve months of the year, the daily rhythm of the twelve bi-hours of the Chinese clock, the twelve main acupuncture meridians, etc.{{sfn|Wu and Wu|2014|loc=41\u201342}}\n\nThe two sets of tones (male and female) dividing the twelve-tone scale were generated by the \"Method of Subtracting and Adding Thirds,\" or ''sanfen sunyi'', which involved alternately rising a fifth and descending a fourth through the subtraction or addition of a third of the length of the preceding pitch pipe. The resulting pitches produced by adding a third (and descending a fourth) were referred to by [[Sima Qian]] in the [[Records of the Grand Historian]] (91&nbsp;BCE) as pitches of \"superior generation,\" that is, the pitches of Ling Lun's male phoenix; the pitches produced by subtracting a third (and ascending a fifth) were referred to as pitches of \"inferior generation,\" that is, the pitches of Ling Lun's female phoenix.{{sfn|Service|2013}}\n\n<blockquote>Apart from technical and structural aspects, ancient Chinese music theory also discusses topics such as the nature and functions of music. The ''Yueji'' (\"Record of music\", c1st and 2nd centuries BCE), for example, manifests Confucian moral theories of understanding music in its social context. Studied and implemented by Confucian scholar-officials [...], these theories helped form a musical Confucianism that overshadowed but did not erase rival approaches. These include the assertion of Mozi (c468\u2013c376&nbsp;BCE) that music wasted human and material resources, and Laozi's claim that the greatest music had no sounds. [...] Even the music of the ''qin'' zither, a genre closely affiliated with Confucian scholar-officials, includes many works with Daoist references, such as ''Tianfeng huanpei'' (\"Heavenly Breeze and Sounds of Jade Pendants\").<ref name=\"oxfordmusiconline.com\"/></blockquote>\n\n====India====\nThe [[Samaveda]] and [[Yajurveda]] (c. 1200 \u2013 1000&nbsp;BCE) are among the earliest testimonies of Indian music, but they contain no theory properly speaking.

Boethius represented Classical authority on music during the Middle Ages, as the Greek writings on which he based his work were not read or translated by later Europeans until the 15th century.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=\u00a75 Early Middle Ages}} This treatise carefully maintains distance from the actual practice of music, focusing mostly on the mathematical proportions involved in tuning systems and on the moral character of particular modes.

This was the source of the hexachordal [[solmization]] that was to be used until the end of the Middle Ages. Guido also wrote about emotional qualities of the modes, the phrase structure of plainchant, the temporal meaning of the neumes, etc.; his chapters on polyphony \"come closer to describing and illustrating real music than any previous account\" in the Western tradition.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.|loc=\u00a75 Early Middle Ages}}\n\nDuring the thirteenth century, a new rhythm system called [[mensural notation]] grew out of an earlier, more limited method of notating rhythms in terms of fixed repetitive patterns, the so-called rhythmic modes, which were developed in France around 1200. An early form of mensural notation was first described and codified in the treatise ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' (\"The art of measured chant\") by [[Franco of Cologne]] (c. 1280). Mensural notation used different note shapes to specify different durations, allowing scribes to capture rhythms which varied instead of repeating the same fixed pattern; it is a proportional notation, in the sense that each note value is equal to two or three times the shorter value, or half or a third of the longer value. This same notation, transformed through various extensions and improvements during the Renaissance, forms the basis for rhythmic notation in European classical music today.\n\n===Modern===\n\n====Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries====\n* B\u1fb1qiy\u1fb1 N\u1fb1yin\u1fd1 (Uzbekistan, 17th century CE), Uzbek author and music theorist.

The music focuses on the solfege \"fa, sol, la\" on the music scale. Sacred Harp also employs a different notation involving \"shape notes\", or notes that are shaped to correspond to a certain solfege syllable on the music scale. Sacred Harp music and its music theory originated with Reverend Thomas Symmes in 1720, where he developed a system for \"singing by note\" in order to help his church members with note accuracy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sacred Harp: A Tradition and Its Music|last=Cobb, Jr.|first=Buell E.|publisher=The University of Georgia Press Athens|year=1978|isbn=978-0-8203-0426-7|location=United States of America|pages=[https://archive.org/details/sacredharp00buel/page/4 4\u20135, 60\u201361]|url=https://archive.org/details/sacredharp00buel/page/4}}</ref>\n\n{{see |List of music theorists#19th century}}\n\n===Contemporary===\n{{see also|List of music theorists#20th century|List of music theorists#21st century}}\n\n==Fundamentals of music==\n{{Main|Aspect of music}}\nMusic is composed of [[aural]] phenomena; \"music theory\" considers how those phenomena apply in music. Music theory considers melody, rhythm, counterpoint, harmony, form, tonal systems, scales, tuning, intervals, consonance, dissonance, durational proportions, the acoustics of pitch systems, composition, performance, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, electronic sound production, etc.{{sfn|Palisca and Bent|n.d.}}\n\n===Pitch===\n{{Main|Pitch (music)}}\n[[File:Middle C.png|thumb|Middle C (261.626&nbsp;Hz) {{audio|Middle C.mid|Play}}.]]\nPitch is the lowness or highness of a [[Musical tone|tone]], for example the difference between [[middle C]] and a higher C. The frequency of the sound waves producing a pitch can be measured precisely, but the perception of pitch is more complex because single notes from natural sources are usually a complex mix of many frequencies. Accordingly, theorists often describe pitch as a subjective sensation.{{sfn|Hartmann|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nSpecific frequencies are often assigned letter names. Today most orchestras assign [[Concert A]] (the A above [[middle C]] on the piano) to the frequency of 440&nbsp;Hz. This assignment is somewhat arbitrary; for example, in 1859 France, the same A was tuned to 435&nbsp;Hz. Such differences can have a noticeable effect on the timbre of instruments and other phenomena. Thus, in [[historically informed performance]] of older music, tuning is often set to match the tuning used in the period when it was written. Additionally, many cultures do not attempt to standardize pitch, often considering that it should be allowed to vary depending on genre, style, mood, etc.\n\nThe difference in pitch between two notes is called an [[interval (music)|interval]]. The most basic interval is the [[unison]], which is simply two notes of the same pitch. The [[octave]] interval is two pitches that are either double or half the frequency of one another. The unique characteristics of octaves gave rise to the concept of [[pitch class]]: pitches of the same letter name that occur in different octaves may be grouped into a single \"class\" by ignoring the difference in octave. For example, a high C and a low C are members of the same pitch class\u2014the class that contains all C's. {{sfn|Bartlette and Laitz|2010|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2014}}}}\n\n[[Musical tuning|Musical tuning systems]], or temperaments, determine the precise size of intervals. Tuning systems vary widely within and between world cultures. In [[Western culture]], there have long been several competing tuning systems, all with different qualities. Internationally, the system known as [[equal temperament]] is most commonly used today because it is considered the most satisfactory compromise that allows instruments of fixed tuning (e.g. the piano) to sound acceptably in tune in all keys.\n\n===Scales and modes===\n{{Main|Musical scale| Musical mode}}\n[[File:C major scale.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A pattern of whole and half steps in the Ionian mode or major scale on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]\nNotes can be arranged in a variety of [[scale (music)|scale]]s and [[musical mode|modes]]. Western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of twelve tones, called a [[chromatic scale]], within which the interval between adjacent tones is called a half step or [[semitone]]. Selecting tones from this set of 12 and arranging them in patterns of semitones and whole tones creates other scales.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nThe most commonly encountered scales are the seven-toned [[major scale|major]], the [[harmonic minor]], the [[melodic minor]], and the [[natural minor]]. Other examples of scales are the [[octatonic scale]] and the [[pentatonic]] or five-tone scale, which is common in [[folk music]] and [[blues]]. Non-Western cultures often use scales that do not correspond with an equally divided twelve-tone division of the octave. For example, classical [[Ottoman classical music|Ottoman]], [[Persian classical music|Persian]], [[Indian classical music|Indian]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] musical systems often make use of multiples of quarter tones (half the size of a semitone, as the name indicates), for instance in 'neutral' seconds (three quarter tones) or 'neutral' thirds (seven quarter tones)\u2014they do not normally use the quarter tone itself as a direct interval.{{sfn|Touma|1996|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nIn traditional Western notation, the scale used for a composition is usually indicated by a [[key signature]] at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be [[Transposition (music)|transposed]] from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a [[whole tone]]. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes the relationship of the overall pitch [[range (music)|range]] compared to the range of the instruments or voices that perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.{{sfn|Forsyth|1935|loc=73\u201374}}\n\nThe interrelationship of the keys most commonly used in Western tonal music is conveniently shown by the [[circle of fifths]]. Unique key signatures are also sometimes devised for a particular composition. During the Baroque period, emotional associations with specific keys, known as the [[doctrine of the affections]], were an important topic in music theory, but the unique tonal colorings of keys that gave rise to that doctrine were largely erased with the adoption of equal temperament. However, many musicians continue to feel that certain keys are more appropriate to certain emotions than others. [[Indian classical music]] theory continues to strongly associate keys with emotional states, times of day, and other extra-musical concepts and notably, does not employ equal temperament.\n\n===Consonance and dissonance===\n{{Main|Consonance and dissonance}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Perfect octave on C.png\n| width1 = 175\n| alt1 = A consonance\n| caption1 = The [[perfect octave]], a consonant interval {{audio|Perfect octave on C.mid|Play}}\n| image2 = Minor second on C.png\n| width2 = 175\n| alt2 = A dissonance\n| caption2 = The [[minor second]], a dissonant interval {{audio|Minor second on C.mid|Play}}\n| footer = \n}}\n[[Consonance and dissonance]] are subjective qualities of the sonority of intervals that vary widely in different cultures and over the ages.\nConsonance (or concord) is the quality of an interval or chord that seems stable and complete in itself. Dissonance (or discord) is the opposite in that it feels incomplete and \"wants to\" resolve to a consonant interval. Dissonant intervals seem to clash. Consonant intervals seem to sound comfortable together. Commonly, perfect fourths, fifths, and octaves and all major and minor thirds and sixths are considered consonant. All others are dissonant to greater or lesser degree.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}\n\nContext and many other aspects can affect apparent dissonance and consonance. For example, in a Debussy prelude, a major second may sound stable and consonant, while the same interval may sound dissonant in a Bach fugue. In the [[Common practice period|Common practice era]], the perfect fourth is considered dissonant when not supported by a lower third or fifth. Since the early 20th century, [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s concept of \"emancipated\" dissonance, in which traditionally dissonant intervals can be treated as \"higher,\" more remote consonances, has become more widely accepted.{{sfn|Latham|2002|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}<!--Better would be the title of the article in this dictionary, added to the entry in the list of references, in which case a page number would be superfluous.-->}}\n\n===Rhythm===\n{{Main|Rhythm}}\n[[File:Metric levels.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Metric level]]s: beat level shown in middle with division levels above and multiple levels below.]]\nRhythm is produced by the sequential arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] measures music in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]]. The [[time signature]] or meter signature specifies how many beats are in a measure, and which value of written note is counted or felt as a single beat.\n\nThrough increased stress, or variations in duration or articulation, particular tones may be accented.

The tones of a melody are usually drawn from pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melody may consist, to increasing degree, of the figure, motive, semi-phrase, antecedent and consequent phrase, and period or sentence. The period may be considered the complete melody, however some examples combine two periods, or use other combinations of constituents to create larger form melodies.{{sfn|Stein|1979|loc=3\u201347}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Chord===\n{{Main|Chord (music)}}\n[[File:C triad.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|C Major triad represented in [[staff notation]].<br />{{Audio|Just major triad on C.mid|Play}} in [[just intonation]]<br />{{Audio|Major triad on C.mid|Play}} in [[Equal temperament]]<br />{{Audio|Quarter-comma meantone major chord on C.mid|Play}} in [[Meantone temperament|1/4-comma meantone]]<br />{{Audio|Young temperament major chord on C.mid|Play}} in [[Young temperament]]<br />{{Audio|Pythagorean major chord on C.mid|Play}} in [[Pythagorean tuning]] ]]\nA chord, in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of three or more [[Musical note|note]]s that is heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc=67, 359|quote=A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously.\" \"A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time.}}{{sfn|K\u00e1rolyi|1965|loc=63|quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}} These need not actually be played together: [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords may, for many practical and theoretical purposes, constitute chords.

The most [[Common chord (music)|common chord]]s are the ''[[major chord|major]]'' and ''[[minor chord|minor]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]'' and then the ''[[augmented triad|augmented]]'' and ''[[diminished triad|diminished]] [[Triad (music)|triads]]''. The descriptions ''major'', ''minor'', ''augmented'', and ''diminished'' are sometimes referred to collectively as chordal ''quality''. Chords are also commonly classed by their [[root (chord)|root]] note\u2014so, for instance, the chord '''C''' major may be described as a triad of major quality built on the note '''C'''. Chords may also be classified by [[Inverted chord|inversion]], the order in which the notes are stacked.\n\nA series of chords is called a [[chord progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords have been accepted as establishing [[Key (music)|key]] in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]].

For example, a [[lead sheet]] may indicate chords such as C major, D minor, and G dominant seventh. In many types of music, notably Baroque, Romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with \"tensions\". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass. It is part of a chord, but is not one of the chord tones (1 3 5 7). Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) \"resolves\" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between \"tense\" and \"relaxed\" moments.<ref>https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/14206/6/06_chapter%202.pdf</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=November 2019|reason=Self-contradictory, self-published?}}\n\n===Timbre===\n{{Main|Timbre}}\n[[File:9577 Guitarz1970 Clean E9 Guitar Chord (Mike Tribulas).jpg|thumb|right|[[Spectrogram]] of the first second of an E9 chord played on a Fender Stratocaster guitar with noiseless pickups.

It has been called \"... the psychoacoustician's multidimensional waste-basket category for everything that cannot be labeled pitch or loudness,\"{{sfn|McAdams and Bregman|1979|loc=34}} but can be accurately described and analyzed by [[Fourier analysis]] and other methods{{sfn|Mannell|n.d.}} because it results from the combination of all sound [[Audio frequency|frequencies]], attack and release envelopes, and other qualities that a tone comprises.\n\n[[Timbre]] is principally determined by two things: (1) the relative balance of [[overtones]] produced by a given instrument due its construction (e.g. shape, material), and (2) the [[Envelope (waves)|envelope]] of the sound (including changes in the overtone structure over time). Timbre varies widely between different instruments, voices, and to lesser degree, between instruments of the same type due to variations in their construction, and significantly, the performer's technique. The timbre of most instruments can be changed by employing different techniques while playing. For example, the timbre of a trumpet changes when a mute is inserted into the bell, the player changes their embouchure, or volume.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nA voice can change its timbre by the way the performer manipulates their vocal apparatus, (e.g. the shape of the vocal cavity or mouth). Musical notation frequently specifies alteration in timbre by changes in sounding technique, volume, accent, and other means. These are indicated variously by symbolic and verbal instruction. For example, the word ''dolce'' (sweetly) indicates a non-specific, but commonly understood soft and \"sweet\" timbre. ''Sul tasto'' instructs a string player to bow near or over the fingerboard to produce a less brilliant sound. ''Cuivre'' instructs a brass player to produce a forced and stridently brassy sound. Accent symbols like ''marcato'' (^) and dynamic indications (''pp'') can also indicate changes in timbre.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Dynamics====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n{{Relevance inline|section|date=September 2015|reason=What has this entire section to do with theory?}}\n{{Main|Dynamics (music)}}\n[[File:Music hairpins.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|An illustration of hairpins in musical notation.]]\nIn music, \"[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]\" normally refers to variations of intensity or volume, as may be measured by physicists and audio engineers in [[decibels]] or [[phon]]s. In music notation, however, dynamics are not treated as absolute values, but as relative ones. Because they are usually measured subjectively, there are factors besides amplitude that affect the performance or perception of intensity, such as timbre, vibrato, and articulation.\n\nThe conventional indications of dynamics are abbreviations for Italian words like ''forte'' ('''''f''''') for loud and ''piano'' ('''''p''''') for soft. These two basic notations are modified by indications including ''mezzo piano'' ('''''mp''''') for moderately soft (literally \"half soft\") and ''mezzo forte'' ('''''mf''''') for moderately loud, ''sforzando'' or ''sforzato'' ('''''sfz''''') for a surging or \"pushed\" attack, or ''fortepiano'' ('''''fp''''') for a loud attack with a sudden decrease to a soft level. The full span of these markings usually range from a nearly inaudible ''pianissississimo'' ('''''pppp''''') to a loud-as-possible ''fortissississimo'' ('''''ffff''''').\n\nGreater extremes of '''''pppppp''''' and '''''fffff''''' and nuances such as '''''p+''''' or ''pi\u00f9 piano'' are sometimes found. Other systems of indicating volume are also used in both notation and analysis: dB (decibels), numerical scales, colored or different sized notes, words in languages other than Italian, and symbols such as those for progressively increasing volume (''crescendo'') or decreasing volume (''diminuendo'' or ''decrescendo''), often called \"[[Dynamics (music)|hairpins]]\" when indicated with diverging or converging lines as shown in the graphic above.\n\n====Articulation====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n{{Main|Articulation (music)}}\n[[File:Notation accents1.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Examples of articulation marks. From left to right: [[staccato]], [[staccatissimo]], [[martellato]], [[Accent (music)|accent]], [[tenuto]].]]\nArticulation is the way the performer sounds notes. For example, ''[[staccato]]'' is the shortening of duration compared to the written note value, ''[[legato]]'' performs the notes in a smoothly joined sequence with no separation. Articulation is often described rather than quantified, therefore there is room to interpret how to execute precisely each articulation.\n\nFor example, ''staccato'' is often referred to as \"separated\" or \"detached\" rather than having a defined or numbered amount by which to reduce the notated duration. Violin players use a variety of techniques to perform different qualities of ''staccato.'' The manner in which a performer decides to execute a given articulation is usually based on the context of the piece or phrase, but many articulation symbols and verbal instructions depend on the instrument and musical period (e.g. viol, wind; classical, baroque; etc.).\n\nThere is a set of articulations that most instruments and voices perform in common. They are\u2014from long to short: ''legato'' (smooth, connected); ''[[tenuto]]'' (pressed or played to full notated duration); ''[[marcato]]'' (accented and detached); ''staccato'' (\"separated\", \"detached\"); ''[[martel\u00e9 (bowstroke)|martel\u00e9]]'' (heavily accented or \"hammered\").{{Contradiction inline|date=March 2020|reason=The accompanying illustration names \"staccato\", \"tenuto\", and three other articulations not listed here. Are these synonyms and, if so, which are synonyms of which? Neither list is cited to a reliable source.}} Many of these can be combined to create certain \"in-between\" articulations. For example, ''[[portato]]'' is the combination of ''tenuto'' and ''staccato''. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as ''[[spicatto]]'' for bowed strings, where the bow bounces off the string.\n\n===Texture===\n{{Main|Musical texture}}\n[[File:Sousa - \"Washington Post March,\" m. 1-7.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Introduction to [[John Philip Sousa|Sousa]]'s \"[[The Washington Post (march)|Washington Post March]],\" mm. 1\u20137{{audio|Sousa - \"Washington Post March,\" m. 1-7.mid|Play}} features [[octave doubling]] {{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|p=133}} and a homorhythmic texture.]]\nIn [[music]], texture is how the [[melody|melodic]], [[rhythm]]ic, and [[harmony|harmonic]] materials are combined in a [[musical composition|composition]], thus determining the overall quality of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices. For example, a thick texture contains many \"layers\" of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass.\n\nThe thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A lightly textured piece will have light, sparse scoring. A thickly or heavily textured piece will be scored for many instruments. A piece's texture may be affected by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used.{{sfn|Benward and Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody, secondary melody, parallel supporting melody, static support, harmonic support, rhythmic support, and harmonic and rhythmic support.{{sfn|Isaac and Russell|2003|loc=136}}\n\nCommon types included [[monophonic]] texture (a single melodic voice, such as a piece for solo soprano or solo flute), biphonic texture (two melodic voices, such as a duo for bassoon and flute in which the bassoon plays a drone note and the flute plays the melody), [[polyphonic]] texture and [[homophonic]] texture (chords accompanying a melody).{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}<!--Especially for the drone accompaniment, which is usually regarded as a type of monophony.-->\n\n===Form or structure===\n[[File:Canon example.png|thumb|A musical [[canon (music)|canon]].

All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced by a combination of other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is more than the sum of measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.\n\nExpression on instruments can be closely related to the role of the breath in singing, and the voice's natural ability to express feelings, sentiment and deep emotions.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}<!--Does this mean that keyboard and stringed instruments are essentially inexpressive?--> Whether these can somehow be categorized is perhaps the realm of academics, who view expression as an element of musical performance that embodies a consistently recognizable [[emotion]], ideally causing a [[emotional contagion|sympathetic emotional response]] in its listeners.{{sfn|London|n.d.}} The emotional content of musical expression is distinct from the emotional content of specific sounds (e.g., a startlingly-loud 'bang') and of learned associations (e.g., a [[national anthem]]), but can rarely be completely separated from its context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe components of musical expression continue to be the subject of extensive and unresolved dispute.{{sfn|Avison|1752|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--Where does Avison say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?-->}}{{sfn|Christiani|1885|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--Where does Christiani say there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?-->}}{{sfn|Lussy|1892|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--On what page(s) does Lussy state there is an extensive and unresolved dispute, or indeed that there is any dispute at all?-->}}{{sfn|Darwin|1913|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--Where does Darwin state that there is a continuing and unresolved dispute?-->}}{{sfn|Sorantin|1932|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--On what page(s) does Sorantin contend that there is an extensive and unresolved dispute on thesubject?-->}}{{sfn|Davies|1994|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}<!--On what page does Davies say the components of expression continue to be subject to unresolved dispute?

This is most often achieved by the use of commonly understood graphic symbols and written verbal instructions and their abbreviations. There are many systems of music notation from different cultures and different ages. Traditional Western notation evolved during the Middle Ages and remains an area of experimentation and innovation.{{Sfnm|Read|1969|1loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}|Stone|1980|2loc={{Page needed|date=August 2014}}}}In the 2000s, computer [[file formats]] have become important as well.{{sfn|Castan|2009}} Spoken language and [[Kod\u00e1ly Method#Hand signs|hand signs]] are also used to symbolically represent music, primarily in teaching.\n\nIn standard Western music notation, tones are represented graphically by symbols (notes) placed on a [[Staff (music)|staff]] or staves, the vertical axis corresponding to pitch and the horizontal axis corresponding to time. Note head shapes, stems, flags, ties and dots are used to indicate duration. Additional symbols indicate keys, dynamics, accents, rests, etc. Verbal instructions from the [[Conducting|conductor]] are often used to indicate tempo, technique, and other aspects.\n\nIn Western music, a range of different music notation systems are used. In Western [[Classical music]], conductors use printed scores that show all of the instruments' parts and orchestra members read parts with their musical lines written out. In popular styles of music, much less of the music may be notated. A rock band may go into a recording session with just a handwritten [[chord chart]] indicating the song's [[chord progression]] using chord names (e.g., C major, D minor, G7, etc.). All of the chord voicings, rhythms and accompaniment figures are improvised by the band members.\n\n==Music theory as academic discipline==\nThe scholarly study of music theory in the twentieth century has a number of different subfields, each of which takes a different perspective on what are the primary phenomenon of interest and the most useful methods for investigation.\n\n===Analysis===\n{{Main|Musical analysis|Schenkerian analysis|Transformational theory}}\n[[File:Debussy Pelleas et Melisande prelude opening.PNG|thumb|upright=1.3|Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created.

Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I-VII-V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I-V, seeing the G in the second measure as an [[musical ornamentation|ornament]], and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I-VII.\n{{audio|Debussy Pelleas et Melisande-prelude opening.mid|Play}}]]\nMusical analysis is the attempt to answer the question ''how does this music work?'' The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to [[Ian Bent]], \"analysis, as a pursuit in its own right, came to be established only in the late 19th century; its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However, it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards.\"{{sfn|Bent|1987|loc=6}} [[Adolf Bernhard Marx]] was influential in formalising concepts about composition and music understanding towards the second half of the 19th century. The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as [[Edgard Var\u00e8se]]'s claim that, \"to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Bernard|1981|loc=1}}</ref>\n\n[[Schenkerian analysis]] is a method of musical analysis of tonal music based on the theories of [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1868\u20131935). The goal of a Schenkerian analysis is to interpret the underlying structure of a tonal work and to help reading the score according to that structure. The theory's basic tenets can be viewed as a way of defining [[tonality]] in music. A Schenkerian analysis of a passage of music shows hierarchical relationships among its pitches, and draws conclusions about the structure of the passage from this hierarchy. The analysis makes use of a specialized symbolic form of musical notation that Schenker devised to demonstrate various [[Schenkerian analysis#Techniques of prolongation|techniques of elaboration]]. The most fundamental concept of Schenker's theory of tonality may be that of ''tonal space''.<ref>Schenker described the concept in a paper titled ''Erl\u00e4uterungen'' (\"Elucidations\"), which he published four times between 1924 and 1926: ''Der Tonwille'' {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 8\u20139, pp. 49\u201351, vol. 10, pp. 40\u20132; ''Das Meisterwerk in der Musik'', {{Full citation needed|date=August 2015}} vol. 1, pp. 201\u201305; 2, p. 193-97.

The concept of tonal space is still present in {{harvtxt|Schenker|n.d.|loc=especially \u00a7 13}}, but less clearly than in the earlier presentation.</ref> The intervals between the notes of the tonic triad form a ''tonal space'' that is filled with passing and neighbour notes, producing new triads and new tonal spaces, open for further elaborations until the surface of the work (the score) is reached.\n\nAlthough Schenker himself usually presents his analyses in the generative direction, starting from the [[fundamental structure]] (''Ursatz'') to reach the score, the practice of Schenkerian analysis more often is reductive, starting from the score and showing how it can be reduced to its fundamental structure. The graph of the ''Ursatz'' is arrhythmic, as is a strict-counterpoint cantus firmus exercise.{{sfn|Schenker|n.d.|loc=\u00a7 21{{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} Even at intermediate levels of the reduction, rhythmic notation (open and closed noteheads, beams and flags) shows not rhythm but the hierarchical relationships between the pitch-events. Schenkerian analysis is ''subjective''. There is no mechanical procedure involved and the analysis reflects the musical intuitions of the analyst.{{sfn| Snarrenberg|1997|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} The analysis represents a way of hearing (and reading) a piece of music.\n\nTransformational theory is a branch of music theory developed by [[David Lewin]] in the 1980s, and formally introduced in his 1987 work, ''Generalized Musical Intervals and Transformations''. The theory, which models [[Transformation (music)|musical transformations]] as elements of a [[Group theory|mathematical group]], can be used to analyze both [[tonality|tonal]] and [[atonal music]]. The goal of transformational theory is to change the focus from musical objects\u2014such as the \"C [[major chord]]\" or \"G major chord\"\u2014to relations between objects. Thus, instead of saying that a C major chord is followed by G major, a transformational theorist might say that the first chord has been \"transformed\" into the second by the \"[[dominant (music)|Dominant]] operation.\"  (Symbolically, one might write \"Dominant(C major) = G major.\") While traditional [[set theory (music)|musical set theory]] focuses on the makeup of musical objects, transformational theory focuses on the [[interval (music)|intervals]] or types of musical motion that can occur. According to Lewin's description of this change in emphasis, \"[The transformational] attitude does not ask for some observed measure of extension between reified 'points'; rather it asks: 'If I am ''at'' s and wish to get to t, what characteristic ''gesture'' should I perform in order to arrive there?'\"{{sfn|Lewin|1987|loc=159}}\n\n===Music perception and cognition===\n{{Further|Music psychology|Fred Lerdahl|Ray Jackendoff}}\n[[File:Diana deutsch scale fig3b.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|[[Deutsch's scale illusion]]: an [[auditory illusion]] in which two scales are presented with successive tones alternating between each ear but are perceived as simultaneous, unbroken scales.{{sfn|Bregman|1994|loc=76}}]]\nMusic psychology or the psychology of music may be regarded as a branch of both [[psychology]] and [[musicology]]. It aims to explain and understand [[music]]al [[behavior]] and [[experience]], including the processes through which music is perceived, created, responded to, and incorporated into everyday life.{{sfn|Tan, Peter, and Rom|2010|loc=2}}{{sfn|Thompson|n.d.|loc=320}} Modern music psychology is primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; its knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[Human subject research|human participants]].

The term \"piano trio\" also refers to works composed for such a group.]]\nA music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of [[music]] as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.{{sfn|Samson|n.d.}} It is to be distinguished from ''[[musical form]]'' and ''musical style'', although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.{{sfn|Wong|2011}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2014}}<!--An electronic search of this web article finds only one occurrence of the word \"form\", as part of the compound expression ; the word \"style\" does not occur at all. As a result, this citation confirms neither the claim that genre should be distinguished from form and style, nor the claim that they are sometimes used interchangeably in practice.-->\n\nMusic can be divided into different [[genres]] in many different ways. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. There are even varying academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317 are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"{{sfn|Green|1979|loc=1}} Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that came from the same style or \"basic musical language.\"{{sfn|van der Merwe|1989|loc=3}}\n\nOthers, such as Allan F. Moore, state that ''genre'' and ''style'' are two separate terms, and that secondary characteristics such as subject matter can also differentiate between genres.{{sfn|Moore|2001|loc=432\u201333}} A music genre or subgenre may also be defined by the [[musical technique]]s, the style, the cultural context, and the content and spirit of the themes. Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that \"since the early 1980s, genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".{{sfn|Laurie|2014|loc=284}}\n\nMusical technique is the ability of [[musical instrument|instrumental]] and [[Human voice|vocal]] musicians to exert optimal control of their instruments or [[vocal cords]] to produce precise musical effects. Improving technique generally entails practicing exercises that improve muscular sensitivity and agility. To improve technique, musicians often practice fundamental patterns of notes such as the [[Natural minor|natural]], [[Minor scale|minor]], [[Major scale|major]], and [[chromatic scale]]s, [[Minor triad|minor]] and [[major triad]]s, [[Dominant seventh chord|dominant]] and [[diminished seventh]]s, formula patterns and [[arpeggio]]s. For example, [[Triad (music)|triads]] and [[Seventh chord|sevenths]] teach how to play chords with accuracy and speed. [[Scale (music)|Scales]] teach how to move quickly and gracefully from one note to another (usually by step). Arpeggios teach how to play [[broken chord]]s over larger intervals. Many of these components of music are found in compositions, for example, a scale is a very common element of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Romantic music|romantic]] era compositions.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n[[Heinrich Schenker]] argued that musical technique's \"most striking and distinctive characteristic\" is [[repetition (music)|repetition]].{{sfn|Kivy|1993|loc=327}} Works known as [[\u00e9tude]]s (meaning \"study\") are also frequently used for the improvement of technique.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{Main|Music and mathematics}}\n[[Music]] theorists sometimes use [[mathematics]] to understand music, and although music has no [[axiomatic]] foundation in modern mathematics, mathematics is \"the basis of sound\" and sound itself \"in its musical aspects... exhibits a remarkable array of number properties\", simply because nature itself \"is amazingly mathematical\".{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42\u201343}} The attempt to structure and communicate new ways of composing and hearing music has led to musical applications of [[set theory]], [[abstract algebra]] and [[number theory]]. Some composers have incorporated the [[golden ratio]] and [[Fibonacci numbers]] into their work.{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=chapter 6, ''passim''}}{{sfn|Garland and Kahn|1995|loc={{Page needed|date=July 2015}}}} There is a long history of examining the relationships between music and mathematics. Though ancient Chinese, Egyptians and Mesopotamians are known to have studied the mathematical principles of sound,{{sfn|Smith Brindle|1987|loc=42}} the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]] (in particular [[Philolaus]] and [[Archytas]]){{sfn|Purwins|2005|loc=22\u201324}} of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of [[musical scale]]s in terms of numerical [[ratio]]s.\n[[File:HarmonicIdentities.Names.Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|400px|The first 16 harmonics, their names and frequencies, showing the exponential nature of the octave and the simple fractional nature of non-octave harmonics.]]\nIn the modern era, musical [[set theory]] uses the language of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze the structure of a piece of (typically atonal) music using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as [[transposition (music)|transposition]] and [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called [[isometries]] because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an [[abelian group]] with 12 elements. It is possible to describe [[just intonation]] in terms of a [[free abelian group]].{{sfn|Wohl|2005}}\n\n===Serial composition and set theory===\n[[File:Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.PNG|thumb|Tone row from [[Alban Berg]]'s ''[[Lyric Suite (Berg)|Lyric Suite]]'', mov. I. {{audio|Berg's Lyric Suite Mov. I tone row B-P.mid|Play}}]]\n{{Further|serialism|set theory (music)|Arnold Schoenberg|Milton Babbitt|David Lewin|Allen Forte}}\nIn music theory, serialism is a method or technique of [[Musical composition|composition]] that uses a series of values to manipulate different [[aspect of music|musical elements]]. Serialism began primarily with [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s [[twelve-tone technique]], though his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as one example of [[atonality|post-tonal]] thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the [[chromatic scale]], forming a [[tone row|row]] or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's [[melody]], [[harmony]], structural progressions, and [[variation (music)|variations]]. Other types of serialism also work with [[set (music)|sets]], collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \"[[parameter (music)|parameters]]\"), such as [[duration (music)|duration]], [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], and [[timbre]]. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the [[visual arts]], [[design]], and [[architecture]]<ref>{{harvnb|Bandur|2001|loc=5, 12, 74}}; {{harvnb|Gerstner|1964|loc=passim}}</ref>\n\n\"Integral serialism\" or \"total serialism\" is the use of series for aspects such as duration, dynamics, and register as well as pitch. {{sfn|Whittall|2008|loc=273}} Other terms, used especially in Europe to distinguish post\u2013World War II serial music from twelve-tone music and its American extensions, are \"general serialism\" and \"multiple serialism\".{{sfn|Grant|2001|loc=5\u20136}}\n\nMusical set theory provides concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by [[Howard Hanson]] (1960) in connection with tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with atonal music by theorists such as [[Allen Forte]] (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and can be applied to tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOne branch of musical set theory deals with collections (sets and permutations) of pitches and pitch classes (pitch-class set theory), which may be ordered or unordered, and can be related by musical operations such as [[Transposition (music)|transposition]], [[Melodic inversion|inversion]], and [[Complement (music)|complementation]]. The methods of musical set theory are sometimes applied to the analysis of rhythm as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Musical semiotics===\n{{Further|music semiology|Jean-Jacques Nattiez}}\n[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|upright|Semiotician [[Roman Jakobson]]]]\nMusic semiology ([[semiotics]]) is the study of signs as they pertain to [[music]] on a variety of levels.

The work of [[Philip Tagg]] (''Ten Little Tunes'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Fernando the Flute'',{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} ''Music's Meanings''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}) provides one of the most complete and systematic analysis of the relation between musical structures and connotations in western and especially popular, television and film music. The work of [[Leonard B. Meyer]] in ''Style and Music''{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} theorizes the relationship between ideologies and musical structures and the phenomena of style change, and focuses on romanticism as a case study.\n\n===Education and careers===\n[[File:Pat Carpenter picture.JPG|thumb|[[Columbia University]] music theorist Pat Carpenter in a 2013 photo]]\nMusic theory in the practical sense has been a part of education at conservatories and music schools for centuries, but the status music theory currently has within academic institutions is relatively recent. In the 1970s, few universities had dedicated music theory programs, many music theorists had been trained as composers or historians, and there was a belief among theorists that the teaching of music theory was inadequate and that the subject was not properly recognised as a scholarly discipline in its own right.{{sfn|McCreless|n.d.}} A growing number of scholars began promoting the idea that music theory should be taught by theorists, rather than composers, performers or music historians.{{sfn|McCreless|n.d.}} This led to the founding of the [[Society for Music Theory]] in the United States in 1977. In Europe, the French ''[http://www.sfam.org Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Analyse musicale]'' was founded in 1985. It called the First European Conference of Music Analysis for 1989, which resulted in the foundation of the ''[http://www.sbam.be Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 belge d'Analyse musicale]'' in Belgium and the ''[http://www.gatm.it Gruppo analisi e teoria musicale]'' in Italy the same year, the ''[http://www.sma.ac.uk Society for Music Analysis]'' in the UK in 1991, the ''[http://verenigingvoormuziektheorie.net Vereniging voor Muziektheorie]'' in the Netherlands in 1999 and the ''[http://www.gmth.de/home.aspx Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Musiktheorie]'' in Germany in 2000.{{sfn|Mee\u00f9s|2015|loc=111}} They were later followed by the [http://eng.otmroo.ru Russian Society for Music Theory] in 2013 and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20180328133232/http://ptam.org.pl/ Polish Society for Music Analysis] in 2015, and others are in construction. These societies coordinate the publication of music theory scholarship and support the professional development of music theory researchers.\n\nAs part of their initial training, music theorists will typically complete a [[B.Mus]] or a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in music (or a related field) and in many cases an M.A. in music theory. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree to a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an M.A. In the 2010s, given the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of university graduate programs, some applicants for music theory PhD programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may apply with a B.Mus and a Masters in Music Composition or Philosophy of Music).\n\nMost music theorists work as instructors, lecturers or professors in [[college]]s, [[University|universities]] or [[Music school|conservatories]]. The job market for tenure-track professor positions is very competitive.{{Vague|date=August 2015}}<!--How competitive is \"very\"? As competitive as for, say, a position as an airline pilot?--> Applicants must hold a completed PhD or the equivalent degree (or expect to receive one within a year of being hired\u2014called an \"ABD\", for \"[[All But Dissertation]]\" stage) and (for more senior positions) have a strong record of publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding music theorists are only able to find insecure positions as [[sessional lecturer]]s. The job tasks of a music theorist are the same as those of a professor in any other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in this area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as [[Music appreciation|Music Appreciation]] or Introduction to Music Theory), conducting research in this area of expertise, publishing research articles in peer-reviewed journals, authoring book chapters, books or textbooks, traveling to conferences to present papers and learn about research in the field, and, if the program includes a [[graduate school]], supervising M.A. and PhD students and giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some music theory professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] or [[Chairman|Chair]] of the School of Music.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[AP Music Theory]]\n*[[List of music theorists]]\n*[[Music psychology]]\n*[[Musicology]]\n*[[Theory of painting]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin|33em}}\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|2011}}|reference=Anon.

The bridge was designed by [[David Lennox]] and built from 1832 to 1833 by James Randall and other [[convict]]s. It is also known as '''Lennox Bridge''' or '''The Horseshoe Bridge'''. The property is owned by Blue Mountains City Council. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-24>{{cite NSW SHR|5045255|Lennox Bridge|hr=00024|fn=S90/07399 & HC 30149|accessdate=1 June 2018}}</ref> The stone [[arch bridge]] is a single arch of {{convert|6|m}} span and is {{convert|9|m}} above water level, with a road width of {{convert|9|m}}.<ref name=ADoB_David_Lennox/>\n\n== History ==\nThe first road up the eastern slopes of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], built by [[William Cox]] (1814-15), was in [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie|Macquarie]]'s words \"pretty steep and sharp\" and was found to be subject to serious washways. This road was superseded in 1824 by what was known as the Bathurst Road (now Old Bathurst Road). It avoided watercourses, but its grade was very steep and this rendered it hazardous to travellers. When [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] was appointed as [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. Mitchell surveyed and recommended the construction of a road along this route midway between the other two in preference to the Governor's suggestion of stationing a permanent repair gang on the Old Bathurst Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |title=Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone |work=Australia For Everyone |publisher= |date=2019 |access-date=3 April 2020 }}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|'Mr David Lennox, who left his stone wall at my request, and with his sleeves still tucked up, came with me to my office, and undertook to plan the stone bridges required, make the centring arches and to carry on such works by directing and instructing the common labourers then at the disposal of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].'|[[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]], Letter to Perry, 22 March 1833.<ref name=nswshr-24-244>{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mitchell (explorer) |title=Letter to Perry |date=22 March 1833 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>}}\n\nAnd on 1 October 1832, only seven weeks after his arrival in the colony, Lennox was appointed (subject to London's confirmation) Sub-Inspector of Bridges in New South Wales. His first task was to plan and organise the spanning of [[Lapstone, New South Wales|Lapstone]] Creek on Mitchell's Pass.

At forty-five years of age Lennox began service under Major Mitchell. Prior to arriving in the Colony he had spent seventeen years on public works executed at the expense of the British Government. During this time he constructed a number of wooden bridges associated with the Gloucester-Berkeley Canal and a stone bridge near [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]]. In 1832, two years after the death of his wife, Lennox arrived on the Colony on the ''[[Florentia (1821 ship)|Florentia]]''. Not long after his arrival, he was discovered by Major Mitchell. On 1 October 1832, following the review of his credentials, Lennox was appointed to the Roads Department as the Sub-Inspector of Bridges. Within six weeks of his appointment Lennox and his men had cut most of the stone and procured lime for mortar. By July 1833, the bridge was complete. The success of Lennox's design is demonstrated through its on-going stability and continued use. Major restoration and safety improvement work was not required until the 1950s.\n\nLennox Bridge is also associated with at least twenty convicts, an overseer, a constable and an armed sentry that worked on the site between October 1832 and July 1833, the construction gang worked from 7am to 4pm, when they returned to their stockade at [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]]. The work involved stone cutting and setting, carpentry and masonry required to construct the bridge. Following completion of the bridge Lennox requested to retain the: services of eight convicts: William Brady, John Carsons, Robert Hyams, John Johnson, Patrick Malowney (Maloney), Thomas Nelson, James Randall and Daniel Williams. The sentences of six of the eight convicts were remitted. The remaining two were reduced after a further six months of work.<ref name=nswshr-24-247>Low, 1983, p12</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe original bridge, on a horse-shoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive, The stonework has been restored some infelicities have been allowed on the revetment and the changes made in 1976 by introducing concrete to the stone-cut water channel beneath the bridge are unpleasing but David Lennox's concept for the bridge of a very pretty small gorge remains aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge was carried on a single semi-circular stone arch of ten feet radius. The roadway was thirty feet wide at the crown of the arch and the same height above the bed or the gully. After bearing over one hundred and seventy years of traffic and one major restoration still stands stable. The bridge is a very fine example of the work of David Lennox and represents the first scientifically constructed stone arched bridge of its magnitude In Australia.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is exceptionally rare. No other bridges of similar age or design have survived on the Australian mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is the oldest scientifically constructed stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland. Having gained his bridge construction experience before arriving in the colony it is highly representative of the techniques used to construct stone bridges at the time in England.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Lennox_horseshoe2.JPG\nFile:Lennox_Bridge_surface.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian Roads}}}}\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Lennox Bridge|url=http://www.bluemountainscitytourism.com.au/product/lennox-bridge-in-the-blue-mountains-9058925}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Lennox Bridge|dno=5045255|id=00024|year=2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Lennox Bridge, Glenbrook}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n{{Blue Mountains topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lennox Bridge}}\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1833 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1833]]\n[[Category:Stone bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Stone arch bridges]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Glenbrook, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Convictism in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Transport in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales)]]\n[[Category:Arch bridges in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Lennox Bridge, Parramatta}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n<!-- Article title: Lennox Bridge, Blaxland SHRNo:24 DatabaseNo:5045255 -->\n{{Infobox bridge\n|bridge_name   = Lennox Bridge, Glenbrook\n|image         = Lennox Bridge, Glenbrook.jpg\n|image_size    = 270\n|caption       = The oldest surviving stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland\n| pushpin_map         = Australia Sydney\n| pushpin_relief      = 1\n| pushpin_map_size    = 270\n| pushpin_map_alt     = \n| pushpin_map_caption = Location on the western boundary of [[Sydney|greater metropolitan Sydney]]\n| coordinates   = {{Coord|33|45|15|S|150|37|56|E|region:AU-NSW_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n|official_name = \n| named_for    = [[David Lennox]]\n|carries       = {{nowrap|Mitchell's Pass {{small|(Downhill only)}}}} {{bulleted list|Light [[motor vehicle]]s|[[Pedestrian]]s|[[Bicycle]]s}}\n|crosses       = Brookside Creek / Lapstone Creek\n|locale        = [[Glenbrook, New South Wales|Glenbrook]], [[City of Blue Mountains]], [[New South Wales]], Australia\n|maint         = \n|id            = \n|designer      = [[David Lennox]]\n| engineering  = [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]\n|design        = [[Arch bridge]]\n|material      = Stone\n|spans         = 1\n|pierswater    = \n|mainspan      = {{convert|6|m|ft}}\n|length        = \n|width         = {{convert|9|m|ft}}\n|height        = {{convert|9|m|ft}} at highest point\n|load          = {{convert|2|t|ST+LT}}\n|clearance     = \n|below         =\n|traffic       = \n|begin         = 1832\n|complete      = 1833\n|open          = 1833\n|heritage      =\n|collapsed     =\n|preceded      =\n|followed      =\n|closed        = 1967-1982\n|toll          = \n| map_type            = \n| map_relief          = \n| map_dot_label       = \n| map_image           = \n| map_size            = \n| map_alt             = \n| mapframe            = yes\n| mapframe_zoom       = 14\n| mapframe_width      = \n| mapframe_height     = \n| mapframe_marker     = \n| mapframe_marker_color = \n| mapframe_lat        = \n| mapframe_long       = \n| map_caption         = \n| references   = <ref name=BMCC_Report>[http://www.bmcc.nsw.gov.au/download.cfm?f=2AD5C485-423B-CE58-ADE76653E0B28C4E Blue Mountains City Council Report]</ref><ref name=ADoB_David_Lennox>{{cite AuDB|title=Lennox, David (1788\u20131873)|author=Antill, J.

This road was superseded in 1824 by what was known as the Bathurst Road (now Old Bathurst Road). It avoided watercourses, but its grade was very steep and this rendered it hazardous to travellers. When [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Major Thomas Mitchell]] was appointed as [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell's attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. Mitchell surveyed and recommended the construction of a road along this route midway between the other two in preference to the Governor's suggestion of stationing a permanent repair gang on the Old Bathurst Road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitsydneyaustralia.com.au/mitchells-pass.html |title=Mitchell's Pass, Lapstone |work=Australia For Everyone |publisher= |date=2019 |access-date=3 April 2020 }}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|'Mr David Lennox, who left his stone wall at my request, and with his sleeves still tucked up, came with me to my office, and undertook to plan the stone bridges required, make the centring arches and to carry on such works by directing and instructing the common labourers then at the disposal of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]].'|[[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]], Letter to Perry, 22 March 1833.<ref name=nswshr-24-244>{{cite book|author=Mitchell, Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Mitchell (explorer) |title=Letter to Perry |date=22 March 1833 }}</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>}}\n\nAnd on 1 October 1832, only seven weeks after his arrival in the colony, Lennox was appointed (subject to London's confirmation) Sub-Inspector of Bridges in New South Wales.

It was necessary part of the road communications between Sydney and the West for over a century and proved remarkably durable. It has State significance as the oldest bridge permitting vehicle transport on a route essential to the state's development.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nDavid Lennox was born at Ayr, in Scotland in 1788. At forty-five years of age Lennox began service under Major Mitchell. Prior to arriving in the Colony he had spent seventeen years on public works executed at the expense of the British Government. During this time he constructed a number of wooden bridges associated with the Gloucester-Berkeley Canal and a stone bridge near [[Gloucester, New South Wales|Gloucester]]. In 1832, two years after the death of his wife, Lennox arrived on the Colony on the ''[[Florentia (1821 ship)|Florentia]]''. Not long after his arrival, he was discovered by Major Mitchell. On 1 October 1832, following the review of his credentials, Lennox was appointed to the Roads Department as the Sub-Inspector of Bridges. Within six weeks of his appointment Lennox and his men had cut most of the stone and procured lime for mortar. By July 1833, the bridge was complete. The success of Lennox's design is demonstrated through its on-going stability and continued use. Major restoration and safety improvement work was not required until the 1950s.\n\nLennox Bridge is also associated with at least twenty convicts, an overseer, a constable and an armed sentry that worked on the site between October 1832 and July 1833, the construction gang worked from 7am to 4pm, when they returned to their stockade at [[Emu Plains, New South Wales|Emu Plains]]. The work involved stone cutting and setting, carpentry and masonry required to construct the bridge. Following completion of the bridge Lennox requested to retain the: services of eight convicts: William Brady, John Carsons, Robert Hyams, John Johnson, Patrick Malowney (Maloney), Thomas Nelson, James Randall and Daniel Williams. The sentences of six of the eight convicts were remitted. The remaining two were reduced after a further six months of work.<ref name=nswshr-24-247>Low, 1983, p12</ref><ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe original bridge, on a horse-shoe curve, was daring, experimental and remarkably attractive, The stonework has been restored some infelicities have been allowed on the revetment and the changes made in 1976 by introducing concrete to the stone-cut water channel beneath the bridge are unpleasing but David Lennox's concept for the bridge of a very pretty small gorge remains aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge was carried on a single semi-circular stone arch of ten feet radius. The roadway was thirty feet wide at the crown of the arch and the same height above the bed or the gully. After bearing over one hundred and seventy years of traffic and one major restoration still stands stable. The bridge is a very fine example of the work of David Lennox and represents the first scientifically constructed stone arched bridge of its magnitude In Australia.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is exceptionally rare. No other bridges of similar age or design have survived on the Australian mainland.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nLennox Bridge is the oldest scientifically constructed stone arch bridge on the Australian mainland. Having gained his bridge construction experience before arriving in the colony it is highly representative of the techniques used to construct stone bridges at the time in England.<ref name=nswshr-24/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Lennox_horseshoe2.JPG\nFile:Lennox_Bridge_surface.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian Roads}}}}\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Lennox Bridge|url=http://www.bluemountainscitytourism.com.au/product/lennox-bridge-in-the-blue-mountains-9058925}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Lennox Bridge|dno=5045255|id=00024|year=2018|accessdate=1 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Lennox Bridge, Glenbrook}}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n{{Blue Mountains topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lennox Bridge}}\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1833 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1833]]\n[[Category:Stone bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Stone arch bridges]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Glenbrook, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Convictism in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Transport in the Blue Mountains (New South Wales)]]\n[[Category:Arch bridges in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "| starts              =  | ends                =", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennox_Bridge,_Glenbrook"}

Moreover, he illustrates that data binding in very large applications can result in considerable memory consumption.\n\n==Implementations==\n===.NET frameworks===\n*[https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism/ Prism Library]\n*[https://github.com/CaliburnFx/Caliburn Caliburn] / [https://caliburnmicro.com/ Caliburn.Micro]\n*[https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExpress.Mvvm.Free DevExpress MVVM]\n*[https://www.dotvvm.com/ DotVVM] open source project\n*[http://www.mvvmlight.net/ MVVMLight Toolkit]\n*[https://reactiveui.net/ ReactiveUI]\n*[https://github.com/MugenMvvmToolkit/MugenMvvmToolkit Mugen MVVM Toolkit]\n*[https://github.com/nventive/Uno Uno Framework - Open Source]\n*[http://www.roboticarmsoftware.com/Rascl.aspx# Rascl]\n*[https://www.mvvmcross.com/ MvvmCross]\n\n===JavaScript frameworks===\n*[[Angular (application platform)|Angular]]\n*[https://aurelia.io Aurelia]\n*[http://durandaljs.com/ Durandal]\n*[[Ember.js]]\n*[[Ext_JS]]\n*[[Knockout (web framework)|Knockout.js]]\n*[https://github.com/Tencent/omi/blob/master/tutorial/omi-mvvm.md Omi.js]\n*[http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html Oracle JET]\n*[[Svelte]]\n*[[Vue.js]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Common layers in an information system logical architecture]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url=https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/How-to-implement-MVVM-71a65441 |title=How to implement MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) in TDD (test-driven development) |website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]] |publisher=Microsoft}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/johngossman/2005/10/08/introduction-to-modelviewviewmodel-pattern-for-building-wpf-apps/ |title=Introduction to Model/View/ViewModel pattern for building WPF apps |website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]] |publisher=Microsoft}}\n* [https://github.com/simbo1905/ZkToDo2/blob/b97b353d399ad012577bef7f880f9e3167ed70a3/src/main/java/org/zkforge/zktodo2/ZkToDoViewModel.java MVVM validation logic], written in Java by Tim Clare\n* {{cite web |url=http://addyosmani.com/blog/understanding-mvvm-a-guide-for-javascript-developers/ |title=Understanding MVVM: A Guide for JavaScript Developers |website=AddysOnmani.com}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.learnmvvm.com/ |title=MVVM Step by step tutorial |website=learnmvvm.com}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Model-view-viewmodel}}\n[[Category:Software design patterns]]\n[[Category:Architectural pattern (computer science)]]\n[[Category:.NET Framework terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Snizzbut", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:flowed first sentence into opening paragraph", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel"}
