In May, Dole joined the battle against \"violent and sexually degrading music\". They all targeted Time Warner apparently since its [[Record label#Major labels|major music company]] Warner Music Group, as the only publicly traded American music company, was singularly vulnerable to public pressure.

Still, while gaining only some 2.5% of its own income from Interscope, Time Warner was in some 40% of households via cable television, and needed congressional approvals to expand in cable.
