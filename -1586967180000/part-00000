It was one of the launch titles for the DS in Japan. The game was released on the [[Wii U]] [[Virtual Console]] in 2015.\n\nThe game revolves around [[Yoshi]] and [[Baby Mario]]/[[Baby Luigi]]. Its graphical style and the cast of characters originate from ''[[Yoshi's Island|Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''. The game heavily utilizes the DS's touch screen capabilities and makes use of the microphone as well. The challenge in the game comes from replaying the same modes over and over to get the best possible score, similar to the classic [[arcade game]]s of the 1980s. Therefore, the difficulty of the game is based primarily on improving one's own skill.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game begins with three different gameplay modes: \"Score Attack\", \"Marathon\", and the \"multiplayer vs. mode\". Additionally, the player can unlock \"Time Attack\" and \"Challenge modes\" by getting the [[high score]] in the \"Score Attack\" and \"Marathon\" modes. When the high score on the two new modes is achieved, the mini-game \"Balloon Trip\" is unlocked. There are two basic level types: a vertical level, where the player must lead Baby Mario through the sky safely to the ground; and a [[side-scrolling]] level, where the player takes control over different colored Yoshis, carrying Baby Mario on their back.\n\nAs opposed to the earlier ''Yoshi'' games, in ''Yoshi Touch & Go'', the player cannot take direct control over the characters. Instead, the Yoshis move from the left to the right automatically at a certain speed. However, the player can draw lines on the lower screen with the stylus, which creates clouds that will support a character. This attribute allows the creation of alternate routes to avoid enemies and obstacles. If the drawn clouds are impeding progress, they disappear by blowing into the microphone. Enemies can be dispatched by drawing circles on them, which puts most of them into a bubble. In the side-scrolling level, a Yoshi can make an egg out of fruits by leading them to its mouth. By tapping on the screen, the Yoshi will launch an egg in that direction, which is useful for defeating enemies or collecting coins and fruits. By tapping on a Yoshi himself, the player can make him jump, and tapping him again while he's in midair will cause him to do a flutter-kick jump.\n\nThe [[Nintendo DS]]'s two screens act as one tall screen, whereas the player can only create clouds on the lower one. However, by throwing eggs in the upper screen it is possible to collect coins or fruits from there. The wireless \"multiplayer vs. mode\" is an exception to this general layout, as only the lower screen shows the player's view, while the upper screen shows that of the enemy. In the multiplayer mode, the goal is to be faster than the opponent. By clearing out enemies on their own screen, the player can cause spiky obstacles to appear on the opponent's screen.\n\nIn some modes, there is a star point counter. Once this reaches 100, a [[Starman (Nintendo)|Super Star]] will appear. If Yoshi touches it or the player drags it to Yoshi, Baby Mario will temporarily become Super Baby [[Mario]], who is considerably faster than Yoshi and has unlimited stars (instead of eggs) to throw. The star points will then return to zero. Also, by feeding fruits to Yoshi a certain number of eggs will be replenished. The number of replenished eggs depends on the fruit consumed (for instance, an apple only refills one egg, while melons refill twenty).\n\nThe color of Yoshi that Baby Mario rides depends on the player's score in the vertical falling part of the game. If the player gets 60 points, he will ride a light blue Yoshi, and then the color will go up a level for every other 20 points scored (for instance, pink Yoshi at 80 points, blue Yoshi at 100 points, etc.). The only two exceptions are white and orange Yoshi: In Marathon mode, when Baby Mario changes Yoshis, depending on the player's performance he might start riding a white Yoshi, who will switch to black Yoshi unless it's at the 10,000&nbsp;meters mark, in which case he will switch over to orange Yoshi. It will then switch to purple Yoshi at 20,000&nbsp;meters in Marathon. In challenge mode, after the high score is beaten, getting 0 points in the Baby Mario segment of future games will unlock a fast purple Yoshi. The same applies to time attack where a white Yoshi, which has unlimited eggs, can be unlocked.\n\n==Development==\nAccording to director [[Hiroyuki Kimura]] and designer Keizo Ohta, ''Yoshi Touch & Go'' was originally planned to be designed for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] as \"Balloon Trip\".<ref name=\"N-Sider\">{{cite web | url=http://www.n-sider.com/articleview.php?articleid=425 | title=The Making of Yoshi Touch  & Go | publisher=N-Sider | date=April 10, 2005 | accessdate=2006-01-30}}</ref> A demo of the game was first exhibited during the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] of 2004 and gained positive responses, causing the executives of Nintendo to greenlight the project.

Spurred by an incident involving [[Chloe Cooley]], a slave brought to Canada by an [[American Loyalist]], Lieutenant-Governor of [[Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] tabled the [[Act Against Slavery]] in 1793.

CBN</ref>\n\nIn 1807, Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]], which outlawed the international slave trade, but not slavery itself. The legislation was timed to coincide with the expected prohibition from 1808 of international slave trading by the United States, Britain's chief rival in maritime commerce. This legislation imposed fines that did little to deter slave trade participants. Abolitionist [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] realized that trading had continued and as a new MP successfully introduced the [[Slave Trade Felony Act 1811]] which at last made the overseas slave trade a felony act throughout the empire. The [[Royal Navy]] established the [[West Africa Squadron]] to suppress the [[Atlantic slave trade]] by patrolling the coast of West Africa. It did suppress the slave trade, but did not stop it entirely. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans.<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated/exhibitions/museums/chasing.html  1807 - The Abolition of Slavery The abolition of the slave trade- Chasing Freedom: The Royal Navy and the suppression of the transatlantic slave trade Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth Historic Dockyard] ''history.ac.uk'', accessed 30 August 2019</ref> They resettled many in Jamaica and the Bahamas.<ref name=\"Naval Museum - Chasing Freedom\">{{cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Information Sheet |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |accessdate=2 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |accessdate=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 }}</ref> Britain also used its influence to coerce other countries to agree to [[Abolition of slavery timeline#1800\u20131849|treaties]] to end their slave trade and allow the Royal Navy to [[Blockade of Africa|seize their slave ships]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falola|first1=Toyin|last2=Warnock|first2=Amanda|title=Encyclopedia of the middle passage|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313334801|pages=xxi, xxxiii\u2013xxxiv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&lpg=PR34&pg=PR21#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels by the Royal Navy|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Petition-slavery-1826.jpg|thumb|right|280px|illustration from the book: ''The Black Man's Lament, or, how to make sugar'' by [[Amelia Opie]].

[[Eric Williams]] presented economic data in ''Capitalism and Slavery'' to show that the slave trade itself generated only small profits compared to the much more lucrative sugar plantations of the Caribbean, and therefore slavery continued to thrive on those estates. However, from 1823 the British Caribbean sugar industry went into terminal decline, and the British parliament no longer felt they needed to protect the economic interests of the West Indian sugar planters.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref> In 1823, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in London.

It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by the Baptist minister [[Samuel Sharpe]]. The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832. Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries.

Spurred by an incident involving [[Chloe Cooley]], a slave brought to Canada by an [[American Loyalist]], Lieutenant-Governor of [[Upper Canada]] [[John Graves Simcoe]] tabled the [[Act Against Slavery]] in 1793. Passed by the local [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada|Legislative Assembly]], it was the first legislation to outlaw the slave trade in a part of the British Empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Chloe-Cooley-ENG.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206103609/http://www.heritagetrust.on.ca/CorporateSite/media/oht/PDFs/Chloe-Cooley-ENG.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe British were, by the late eighteenth century, the biggest proponents of the abolition of slavery worldwide, having previously been the world's largest slave dealers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Abina and The Important Men, A Graphic History|last=Getz|first=Trevor|last2=Clarke|first2=Liz|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=122}}</ref> William Wilberforce had  written in his diary in 1787 that his great purpose in life was to suppress the slave trade before waging a 20-year fight on the industry.<ref>[https://www.cbn.com/special/amazingGrace/articles/Wilberforce-bio.aspx William Wilberforce: A Man for All Seasons]. CBN</ref>\n\nIn 1807, Parliament passed the [[Slave Trade Act of 1807]], which outlawed the international slave trade, but not slavery itself. The legislation was timed to coincide with the expected prohibition from 1808 of international slave trading by the United States, Britain's chief rival in maritime commerce. This legislation imposed fines that did little to deter slave trade participants. Abolitionist [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]] realized that trading had continued and as a new MP successfully introduced the [[Slave Trade Felony Act 1811]] which at last made the overseas slave trade a felony act throughout the empire. The [[Royal Navy]] established the [[West Africa Squadron]] to suppress the [[Atlantic slave trade]] by patrolling the coast of West Africa. It did suppress the slave trade, but did not stop it entirely. Between 1808 and 1860, the West Africa Squadron captured 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans.<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/1807commemorated/exhibitions/museums/chasing.html  1807 - The Abolition of Slavery The abolition of the slave trade- Chasing Freedom: The Royal Navy and the suppression of the transatlantic slave trade Royal Naval Museum, Portsmouth Historic Dockyard] ''history.ac.uk'', accessed 30 August 2019</ref> They resettled many in Jamaica and the Bahamas.<ref name=\"Naval Museum - Chasing Freedom\">{{cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Information Sheet |publisher=Royal Naval Museum |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |accessdate=2 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Chasing Freedom Exhibition: the Royal Navy and the Suppression of the Transatlantic Slave Trade |accessdate=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210021701/http://www.royalnavalmuseum.org/visit_see_victory_cfexhibition_infosheet.htm |archivedate=10 December 2009 }}</ref> Britain also used its influence to coerce other countries to agree to [[Abolition of slavery timeline#1800\u20131849|treaties]] to end their slave trade and allow the Royal Navy to [[Blockade of Africa|seize their slave ships]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falola|first1=Toyin|last2=Warnock|first2=Amanda|title=Encyclopedia of the middle passage|date=2007|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=9780313334801|pages=xxi, xxxiii\u2013xxxiv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UjRYKePKrB8C&lpg=PR34&pg=PR21#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels by the Royal Navy|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Petition-slavery-1826.jpg|thumb|right|280px|illustration from the book: ''The Black Man's Lament, or, how to make sugar'' by [[Amelia Opie]].

[[Eric Williams]] presented economic data in ''Capitalism and Slavery'' to show that the slave trade itself generated only small profits compared to the much more lucrative sugar plantations of the Caribbean, and therefore slavery continued to thrive on those estates. However, from 1823 the British Caribbean sugar industry went into terminal decline, and the British parliament no longer felt they needed to protect the economic interests of the West Indian sugar planters.<ref>Eric Williams, ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (London: Andre Deutsch, 1964).</ref> In 1823, the [[Anti-Slavery Society]] was founded in London.

It was organised originally as a peaceful strike by the Baptist minister [[Samuel Sharpe]]. The rebellion was suppressed by the militia of the Jamaican plantocracy and the British garrison ten days later in early 1832. Because of the loss of property and life in the 1831 rebellion, the British Parliament held two inquiries.

It was and is still specially prized for its high stamina while fighting external threats especially wild animals and other dogs. It has a fish-like body, broader at the chest and narrower at the waist which enables it to twist and turn at high speeds irrespective of its huge frame. \n\nThe dog is found in [[Iran]] in the cities of [[Bukan]], Mahabad, Saqez, Sanandaj, Piranshahr; most of the cities of West Azerbaijan; and parts of [[Kurdistan]]. There are dogs in the Iraqi Kurdistan such as the city of Pshdar (Qaladze), and some of them are considered as Pshdar .This breed has been a native breed which formed due to natural selection and a bit human interference. {{clarification needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe coats of Kurdish mastiff can be yellow, white, red, burgundy, blue and black. The breed has loose skin, large [[dewlap]]s, and non-cartilaginous (soft and floppy) ears. The breed is longer and stronger than the other Asian mastiffs.  Its body length is especially eye-catching since it has a long and slender body resembling the Lion.\nThis breed has the most endurnce of any breeds. Even today some illegal dog fights are arranged which attract a lot of spectators. The kurdish shepherd dog can fight for nearly 30 minutes and has a lot of stamina.

It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.\n\nThe Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including [[Arduino]], [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] and P5.js.\n\n==History==\nThe project was initiated in 2001 by [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with [[Daniel Shiffman]], who joined as a third project lead.

There are several variants and related projects:\n\n===Design By Numbers===\nProcessing was based on the original work done on [[Design By Numbers]] project at MIT. It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment.\n\n===Processing.js===\n{{Main|Processing.js}}\nIn 2008, [[John Resig]] ported Processing to [[JavaScript]] using the [[Canvas element]] for rendering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/|title=John Resig - Processing.js<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> allowing Processing to be used in modern web browsers without the need for a Java plugin. Since then, the open source community including students at [[Seneca College]] in Toronto have taken over the project.\n\nProcessing.js is also used to advocate very basic programming to Students of all ages on [[Khan Academy]] by creating drawings and animations. Learners showcase their creations to other learners.\n\n===P5js===\nIn 2013, [[Lauren McCarthy]] created P5.js (also referred to as p5.js), a native [[JavaScript]] alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. McCarthy also teaches an introductory course to p5.js on [[Kadenze]].<ref>[https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with p5.js on Kadenze]</ref>\n\n===Processing.py===\nPython Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit.

It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage.\n\nThe Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including [[Arduino]], [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]] and P5.js.\n\n==History==\nThe project was initiated in 2001 by [[Casey Reas]] and [[Ben Fry]], both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. In 2012, they started the Processing Foundation along with [[Daniel Shiffman]], who joined as a third project lead. [[Johanna Hedva]] joined the Foundation in 2014 as Director of Advocacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://processingfoundation.org/people|title=People|website=processingfoundation.org|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Processing had the URL at proce55ing.net, because the ''processing'' domain was taken. Eventually Reas and Fry acquired the domain processing.org.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://processing.org/discourse/alpha/board_Collaboration_action_display_num_1074297082.html|title=Processing 1.0 _ALPHA_ - processing.org|website=processing.org}}</ref> Although the name had a combination of letters and numbers, it was still pronounced ''processing''. They do not prefer the environment being referred to as ''Proce55ing''. Despite the domain name change, Processing still uses the term ''p5'' sometimes as a shortened name (''p5'' specifically is used, not ''p55''), for example p5.js is a reference to that.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/2443|title=What means number 5 in name \"p5\"? \u00b7 Issue #2443 \u00b7 processing/p5.js|website=GitHub}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n{{Infobox software\n| name = Processing IDE\n| logo = [[File:Processing 3 logo.png|80px|Processing logo]]\n| logo caption = \n| screenshot = ProcessingIDE english.png\n| screenshot size = 250px\n| caption = Screenshot of Processing's integrated development environment.\n| collapsible = \n| author = \n| developer = \n| released = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued = \n| latest release version = 3.4.0\n| latest release date = {{Start date and age|2018|07|26}}\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date = \n| status = \n| programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[GLSL]], [[JavaScript]]\n| operating system = [[Cross-platform]]\n| platform = \n| size = \n| language = \n| genre = [[Integrated development environment]]\n| license = \n| website = {{URL|//processing.org}}\n| frequently updated = <!-- DO NOT include this parameter unless you know what it does -->\n}}\nProcessing includes a ''sketchbook'', a minimal alternative to an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE) for organizing projects.<ref name=\"Greenberg2007\">{{cite book|author=Ira Greenberg|title=Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKgfVpWPb0sC&pg=PA151|date=31 December 2007|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-0310-0|pages=151\u2013}}</ref>\n\nEvery Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the <code>PApplet</code> [[Java class]] (formerly a subclass of Java's built-in Applet) which implements most of the Processing language's features.<ref name=\"Meyer2018\">{{cite book|author=Jeanine Meyer|title=Programming 101: The How and Why of Programming Revealed Using the Processing Programming Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yypgDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121|date=15 June 2018|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4842-3697-0|pages=121\u2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen programming in Processing, all additional classes defined will be treated as [[inner class]]es when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling.<ref name=\"Greenberg2010\">{{cite book|author=Ira Greenberg|title=The Essential Guide to Processing for Flash Developers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pVhzd6h20IC&pg=PA412|date=25 March 2010|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-1980-4|pages=412\u2013}}</ref> This means that the use of [[static variable]]s and [[Static methods|methods]] in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode.\n\nProcessing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch. This allows for complex [[data types]] that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as: [[Integer (computer science)|int]] (integer), [[Character (computing)|char]] (character), [[Floating point|float]] (real number), and color (RGB, [[RGBA color space|RGBA]], hex).\n\n==Examples==\nThe simplest possible version of a \"Hello World\" program in Processing is:\n\n<source lang=\"arduino\">\n//This prints \"Hello World.\" to the IDE console.\nprintln(\"Hello World.\");\n</source>\n\nHowever, due to the more visually-oriented nature of Processing, the following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language.\n\n<source lang=\"arduino\">\n//Hello mouse.\nvoid setup() {\n  size(400, 400);\n  stroke(255);\n  background(192, 64, 0);\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  line(150, 25, mouseX, mouseY);\n}\n</source>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2005 Reas and Fry won the Golden Nica award from [[Ars Electronica]] in its Net Vision category for their work on Processing.<ref name=\"Hoy2017\">{{cite book|author=Meredith Hoy|title=From Point to Pixel: A Genealogy of Digital Aesthetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0NwDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA142|date=3 January 2017|publisher=Dartmouth College Press|isbn=978-1-5126-0023-0|pages=142\u2013}}</ref>\n\nBen Fry won the 2011 National Design Award given by the [[Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum]] in the category of Interaction Design. The award statement says:\n\n<blockquote>\"Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science, Ben Fry pursues a long-held fascination with visualizing data. As Principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston, Fry develops software, printed works, installations, and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents. With Casey Reas, he founded the Processing Project, an open-source programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactive-media software. It provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts.\"<ref>http://cdn.cooperhewitt.org/2011/05/26/Final%20-%20CHNDM%20NDA%202011%20Winner%20Release%205-26-11.pdf</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==License==\nProcessing's core libraries, the code included in exported applications and applets, is licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], allowing users to release their original code with a choice of license.\n\nThe IDE is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]].\n\n==Related projects==\n\nProcessing is not a single language, but rather, an arts-oriented approach to learning, teaching, and making things with code. There are several variants and related projects:\n\n===Design By Numbers===\nProcessing was based on the original work done on [[Design By Numbers]] project at MIT. It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment.\n\n===Processing.js===\n{{Main|Processing.js}}\nIn 2008, [[John Resig]] ported Processing to [[JavaScript]] using the [[Canvas element]] for rendering,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ejohn.org/blog/processingjs/|title=John Resig - Processing.js<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref> allowing Processing to be used in modern web browsers without the need for a Java plugin. Since then, the open source community including students at [[Seneca College]] in Toronto have taken over the project.\n\nProcessing.js is also used to advocate very basic programming to Students of all ages on [[Khan Academy]] by creating drawings and animations. Learners showcase their creations to other learners.\n\n===P5js===\nIn 2013, [[Lauren McCarthy]] created P5.js (also referred to as p5.js), a native [[JavaScript]] alternative to Processing.js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation. McCarthy also teaches an introductory course to p5.js on [[Kadenze]].<ref>[https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js/info Introduction to Programming for the Visual Arts with p5.js on Kadenze]</ref>\n\n===Processing.py===\nPython Mode for Processing, or Processing.py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit. It was chiefly developed by Jonathan Feinberg starting in 2010, with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov.<ref name=\"ParrishFry2016\">{{cite book|author1=Allison Parrish|author2=Ben Fry|author3=Casey Reas|title=Getting Started with Processing.py: Making Interactive Graphics with Processing's Python Mode|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ddYlDAAAQBAJ|date=11 May 2016|publisher=Maker Media, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4571-8679-0}}</ref>\n\n===Wiring, Arduino, and Fritzing===\nProcessing has spawned another project, [[Wiring (development platform)|Wiring]], which uses the Processing IDE with a collection of libraries written in the [[C++]] language as a way to teach artists how to program [[microcontroller]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://circuitcellar.com/ee-tips/processing-wiring-and-arduino-ee-tip-101/|title=Processing, Wiring, and Arduino (EE Tip 101) - Circuit Cellar|date=18 September 2013|publisher=}}</ref> There are now two separate hardware projects, Wiring and [[Arduino]], using the Wiring environment and language.\n[[Fritzing]] is another software environment of the same sort, which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product.\n\n===Mobile Processing===\nAnother spin-off project, now defunct, is Mobile Processing by Francis Li, which allowed software written using the Processing language and environment to run on Java powered mobile devices. Today some of the same functionality is provided by Processing itself.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Android - Processing\n| accessdate = 2013-06-03\n| url = http://wiki.processing.org/w/Android\n}}</ref>\n\n===iProcessing===\niProcessing was built to help people develop native [[iPhone]] applications using the Processing language. It is an integration of the Processing.js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone.<ref>{{cite

Music|date=11 February 2010|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Spde===\nSpde (Scala Processing Development Environment) replaces Processing's reduced Java syntax and custom preprocessor with the off-the-shelf [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] programming language which also runs on the [[Java platform]] and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods, while also allowing more concise code, and supporting [[functional programming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://technically.us/spde/About|title=Spde: Spde|publisher=Technically.us|accessdate=2013-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite

''ruby-processing'')  is a [[wrapper library|wrapper]] for Processing in the [[Ruby (language)|Ruby]] language, that runs on the Java platform using JRuby.\n\n===Quil===\nQuil is an interactive animation library for [[Clojure]] and ClojureScript based on Processing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.quil.info/|title=Quil: animation in Clojure}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |

Titan is far colder than Earth, and its surface lacks stable liquid [[water]], factors which have led some scientists to consider life there unlikely. On the other hand, its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are bodies of liquid [[methane]] and [[ethane]], and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell; some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide pre-biotic chemistry for [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|living cells different from those on Earth]].\n\nIn June 2010, scientists analysing data from the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens]]'' mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes.<ref name=\"life?\"/> The ''Cassini\u2013Huygens'' mission was not equipped to look directly for micro-organisms or to provide a thorough inventory of complex [[organic compound]]s.\n\n==Chemistry==\n\nTitan's consideration as an environment for the study of prebiotic chemistry or potentially exotic life stems in large part due to the diversity of the organic chemistry that occurs in its atmosphere, driven by photochemical reactions in its outer layers.

Titan is far colder than Earth, and its surface lacks stable liquid [[water]], factors which have led some scientists to consider life there unlikely. On the other hand, its thick atmosphere is chemically active and rich in carbon compounds. On the surface there are bodies of liquid [[methane]] and [[ethane]], and it is likely that there is a layer of liquid water under its ice shell; some scientists speculate that these liquid mixes may provide pre-biotic chemistry for [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|living cells different from those on Earth]].\n\nIn June 2010, scientists analysing data from the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens]]'' mission reported anomalies in the atmosphere near the surface which could be consistent with the presence of methane-producing organisms, but may alternatively be due to non-living chemical or meteorological processes.<ref name=\"life?\"/> The ''Cassini\u2013Huygens'' mission was not equipped to look directly for micro-organisms or to provide a thorough inventory of complex [[organic compound]]s.\n\n==Chemistry==\n\nTitan's consideration as an environment for the study of prebiotic chemistry or potentially exotic life stems in large part due to the diversity of the organic chemistry that occurs in its atmosphere, driven by photochemical reactions in its outer layers.

He started on the [[euphonium]] and played in jazz bands when he was in school. He found a way to hear jazz at the [[Village Vanguard]], though as he got older he got interested in rock, punk, and rockabilly. He was a member of the Bloodless Pharaohs and [[the Tomcats]], which he began with his brother, Gary. The Tomcats became the [[Stray Cats]] when double bassist [[Lee Rocker]] and drummer [[Slim Jim Phantom]] joined and Gary left the band. In 1980, thinking they might have more success in England than in America, they sold their instruments to pay for airplane tickets and flew to London.<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Brian Setzer |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-setzer-mn0000519637/biography |website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter performing in London for a few months, they met [[Dave Edmunds]], a guitarist and record producer who shared their love of rockabilly and 1950s' rock and roll. Edmunds produced their debut album, ''[[Stray Cats (album)|Stray Cats]]'' ([[Arista Records|Arista]], 1981), which yielded two hit singles, \"[[Stray Cat Strut]]\" and \"[[Rock This Town]]\". The second album, ''[[Gonna Ball]]'' (Arista, 1982), was less successful. The band returned to America and released ''[[Built for Speed (Stray Cats album)|Built for Speed]]'' ([[EMI]], 1982), produced again by Dave Edmunds, with songs collected from their first two albums. Helped by their music videos on MTV, the Stray Cats became popular in America. Their next album, ''[[Rant n' Rave with the Stray Cats]]'' (EMI, 1983) produced the hit \"[[(She's) Sexy + 17]]\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\" />\n\nThe Stray Cats disbanded in 1984, though they reunited occasionally, recorded, and toured.

He found widespread success in the early 1980s with the 1950s-style [[rockabilly]] group [[Stray Cats]], and revitalized his career in the early 1990s with his [[swing revival]] band, [[the Brian Setzer Orchestra]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Stray Cats===\nSetzer was born April 1959 in [[Massapequa, New York|Massapequa]], New York. He started on the [[euphonium]] and played in jazz bands when he was in school. He found a way to hear jazz at the [[Village Vanguard]], though as he got older he got interested in rock, punk, and rockabilly. He was a member of the Bloodless Pharaohs and [[the Tomcats]], which he began with his brother, Gary. The Tomcats became the [[Stray Cats]] when double bassist [[Lee Rocker]] and drummer [[Slim Jim Phantom]] joined and Gary left the band. In 1980, thinking they might have more success in England than in America, they sold their instruments to pay for airplane tickets and flew to London.<ref name=\"Erlewine\">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Brian Setzer |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/brian-setzer-mn0000519637/biography |website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter performing in London for a few months, they met [[Dave Edmunds]], a guitarist and record producer who shared their love of rockabilly and 1950s' rock and roll. Edmunds produced their debut album, ''[[Stray Cats (album)|Stray Cats]]'' ([[Arista Records|Arista]], 1981), which yielded two hit singles, \"[[Stray Cat Strut]]\" and \"[[Rock This Town]]\". The second album, ''[[Gonna Ball]]'' (Arista, 1982), was less successful. The band returned to America and released ''[[Built for Speed (Stray Cats album)|Built for Speed]]'' ([[EMI]], 1982), produced again by Dave Edmunds, with songs collected from their first two albums. Helped by their music videos on MTV, the Stray Cats became popular in America. Their next album, ''[[Rant n' Rave with the Stray Cats]]'' (EMI, 1983) produced the hit \"[[(She's) Sexy + 17]]\".<ref name=\"Erlewine\" />\n\nThe Stray Cats disbanded in 1984, though they reunited occasionally, recorded, and toured. After recording three albums with different producers, they returned to Dave Edmunds for ''[[Choo Choo Hot Fish]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"Erlewine\" />\n\n===The Brian Setzer Orchestra===\n[[File:Brian Setzer performs with his orchestra in the East Room of the White House.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Brian Setzer Orchestra performing in the White House during a visit from Japanese Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]], June 29, 2006]]\nAfter the Stray Cats disbanded in 1984, Setzer began a solo career that included working as a sideman for other acts, such as [[the Honeydrippers]] led by [[Robert Plant]].<ref name=\"Erlewine\" /> On his first solo album, ''[[The Knife Feels Like Justice]]'' (EMI, 1986), he turned away from rockabilly and moved toward rhythm and blues ([[rhythm and blues|R&B]]) and the [[heartland rock]] of [[John Mellencamp]].

Gill added that in a letter to Sagar, he had written about the Ramayana as a subject for the television series was ideal in that it was \"a repository of moral and social values\" and that its message was \"secular and universal\". He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R. Chopra]] over the production of the series ''[[Mahabharat (1988 TV series)|Mahabharat]]'' based on [[Mahabharata|another epic of the same name]], and mentioned that both he and Sagar accepted to his suggestions and constituted panels of experts and scholars to conceptualize the production.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gill|first1=S.

K. Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nOn public demand, the series is re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one show in morning (9:00am to 10:30am IST) and one show in night (9:00pm to 10:30pm IST) during the [[2020 coronavirus lockdown in India|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!

He added that he had noted in the letter that Sagar's \"real challenge would lie in seeing the epic \"with the eyes of a modern man and relating its message to the spiritual and emotional needs of our age\". Gill added that he also wrote a similar letter to [[B. R.

K. Bose, the media director of Hindustan Thompson Associates, remarked, \"The unique thing about the Ramayana was its consistency. Other programmes like ''[[Buniyaad]]'' and even ''[[Hum Log (TV series)|Hum Log]]'' did achieve viewership of around 80 per cent and more, on occasion. In the case of Ramayana that figure had been maintained almost from the beginning.\" He added, \"Starting at around 50 per cent the 80 per cent figure was reached within a few months and never went down.\" He noted that the viewership was more than 50 per cent even in the predominantly non-Hindi speaking southern Indian States of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. He also added that the show's popularity spanned across religions and was watched by people of the [[Islam]] faith in high numbers as well. He mentioned that it was common among people threatening to burn down the local electricity board headquarters during a [[power outage]].<ref name=\"ie1988\" />\n\nThe success of the series was documented well by the media. Soutik Biswas of ''[[BBC]]'' recalled that when the series was telecast every Sunday morning, \"streets would be deserted, shops would be closed and people would bathe and garland their TV sets before the serial began.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Biswas|first1=Soutik|title=Ramayana: An 'epic' controversy|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-15363181|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 February 2018|date=19 October 2011}}</ref> Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph|the Telegraph]]'', [[William Dalrymple (historian)|William Dalrymple]] noted, \"In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dalrymple|first1=William|authorlink1=William Dalrymple (historian)|title=All Indian life is here|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=15 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902143318/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/23/art.ramayana|archivedate=2 September 2013|date=23 August 2008}}</ref> However, critics dismissed the series calling it a \"technically flawed melodrama\".<ref name=\"Lutgendorf\"/>\n\n===Impact===\nThe telecast of ''Ramayan'' was seen as a precursor to the [[Ayodhya dispute]]. Arvind Rajagopal in his book ''Politics After Television: Hindu Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India'' (2000) wrote that with the series, the government \"violated a decades-old taboo on religious partisanship, and Hindu nationalists made the most of the opportunity.\" He added that it \"confirm[ed] to the idea of Hindu awakening\" and the rise of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] capitalizing on this.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=5\u201318 August 2000|volume=17|issue=16|title=Hindutva at play|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|magazine=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214161744/http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1716/17160760.htm|archive-date=14 February 2018|accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Manik Sharma  of ''[[Hindustan Times]]'' voiced similar views in that the series \"played in the backdrop of a Hindutva shift in Indian politics, under the aegis of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and its political outfit, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). While the media and cultural commentators struggled to consider Sagar's epic one way or the other, there were some who saw it as a catalyst, even if unintended, to the turmoil that the movement resulted in.\"<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nRegarding initial apprehensions about the series being aired by a government-owned broadcaster, its hitherto producer Sharad Dutt said that \"a lot of people within the channel's office weren't supportive of the idea to begin with. But it had no motivation with what was going on politically. The Congress was in power and it had no agenda of the sort.\" He however felt the execution was poor and remembered questioning Sagar upon watching \"the tape\" if he had \"made Ramayana or [[Ramlila|Ram-Leela]]\".<ref name=\"ht1\"/> Sharma noted that the political clout the series held could be adjudged by the fact that Sagar and [[Arun Govil]] (who played Rama) \"were repeatedly courted by both the Congress and the BJP to campaign for them\", and that [[Deepika Chikhalia]] (Sita) and [[Arvind Trivedi]] (Ravana) went on to become [[Member of Parliament (India)|members of parliament]].<ref name=\"ht1\"/>\n\nOn public demand, the series is re-telecast from 28 March 2020 with one show in morning (9:00am to 10:30am IST) and one show in night (9:00pm to 10:30pm IST) during the [[2020 coronavirus lockdown in India|lockdown of 21 days due to coronavirus]] on [[DD National]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-prasar-bharati-to-re-telecast-ramayan-from-march-28-on-public-demand-during-lockdown/349524|title=Prasar Bharati To Re-Telecast 'Ramayan' From March 28 On 'Public Demand' During Lockdown|last=|first=|date=|website=www.outlookindia.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tv/good-news-iconic-show-ramayana-to-re-telecast-starting-tomorrow/articleshow/74840124.cms|title=Good News!
