The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis.\n\nMany suggestions encourage Hubbard to believe in his own occult powers: \n* \"That I believe in my gods and spiritual things.\"\n* \"That my magical work is powerful and effective.\"\n* \"You are psychic.\"\n\nSeveral suggestions reference a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]]:\n* \"You can do [[automatic writing]] whenever you wish. You do not care what comes out on the paper when your Guardian dictates.\"<ref name=\"Wright53-4\">Wright, p. 53-4</ref> \n* \"Nothing can intervene between you and your Guardian.

She advises you.\"\n* \"The most thrilling thing in your life is your love and consciousness of your Guardian.\"\n* \"You can talk with her and audibly hear her voice above all others.\"\n\nAnother suggestion involves numerology: \"That the numbers 7, 25 and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me.\"\n\nScholars have noted that the Affirmations contain themes that reappeared later in Scientology.<ref>{{harvnb|Urban|2006}}</ref> One Affirmation foreshadows Hubbard's future interest in mental healing: \"You understand all the workings of the minds of humans around you, for you are a doctor of minds, bodies and influences.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=liDmBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT33|title=Inside Scientology|first=Janet|last=Reitman|publisher=Best Selling Books|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Lawrence Wright]] suggests \"Hubbard is using techniques on himself that he would later develop into Dianetics.\" He draws parallels with the practice of \"[[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]]\" used in Dianetics and Scientology, noting that the Affimations and Dianetics both involve tackling difficult memories that hold back mental and spiritual progress.\n\nThe Affirmations became public knowledge during the 1984 [[Church of Scientology of California v. Armstrong|lawsuit against Hubbard's former archivist]]. In that settlement, Armstrong was required to return \"all originals and copies of the documents commonly known as the 'Affirmations' written by L. Ron Hubbard\". As religious studies scholar Hugh Urban comments, \"here the church clearly indicates that the text was ''written by L.

The Affirmations appear to have been intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis.\n\nMany suggestions encourage Hubbard to believe in his own occult powers: \n* \"That I believe in my gods and spiritual things.\"\n* \"That my magical work is powerful and effective.\"\n* \"You are psychic.\"\n\nSeveral suggestions reference a [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]]:\n* \"You can do [[automatic writing]] whenever you wish.

Armstrong|lawsuit against Hubbard's former archivist]]. In that settlement, Armstrong was required to return \"all originals and copies of the documents commonly known as the 'Affirmations' written by L. Ron Hubbard\".

{"title_page": "MacBook", "text_new": "The '''MacBook''' is a brand of [[Macintosh]] [[laptop]] computers by [[Apple Inc.]] that merged the [[PowerBook]] and [[iBook]] lines during [[Apple's transition to Intel processors]]. The current lineup consists of the [[MacBook Air]] (2008\u2013present) and the [[MacBook Pro]] (2006\u2013present). A different MacBook line existed from [[MacBook (2006\u20132012)|2006 to 2012]] and [[MacBook (2015\u20132019)|2015 to 2019]].\n\n== Overview ==\nThe MacBook family were initially housed in designs similar to the iBook and PowerBook lines which preceded them, now making use of a unibody [[aluminium|aluminum]] construction first introduced with the MacBook Air. This new construction also has a black plastic keyboard that was first used on the MacBook Air, which itself was inspired by the sunken keyboard of the original polycarbonate MacBooks. The now standardized keyboard brings congruity to the MacBook line, with black keys on a metallic aluminum body.\n\nThe lids of the MacBook family are held closed by a magnet with no mechanical latch, a design element first introduced with the polycarbonate MacBook. Memory, drives, and batteries were accessible in the old MacBook lineup, though the newest compact lineup solders or glues all such components in place. All of the current MacBooks feature backlit keyboards.\n\nThe MacBook was discontinued from February 2012 until March 2015, when a new model featuring an ultraportable design and an all-metal enclosure was introduced. It was again discontinued in July 2019 following a price reduction of the 3rd generation MacBook Air and discontinuation of the 2nd generation model.\n\n==MacBook family models ==\n{{Further|Comparison of Macintosh models}}\n\n=== Current === \n==== MacBook Air ====\nThe [[MacBook Air]] is Apple's least expensive notebook computer. While the 1st generation was released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the 2006 - 2012 MacBook, lowered prices on subsequent iterations and the discontinuation of that MacBook has made it serve as the entry-level Macintosh portable. The 2010 to 2017 base model came with a 13-inch screen, and was Apple's thinnest notebook computer until the introduction of the MacBook in March 2015. This MacBook Air model features two USB Type-A 3.0 ports and a Thunderbolt 2 port, as well as an [[SDXC]] card slot (only on the 13inch model). This model of MacBook Air did not have a Retina Display. A MacBook Air model with an 11-inch screen was available from October 2010 to October 2016. In 2017, the MacBook Air received a small refresh, with the processor speed increased to 1.8 GHz.\n\nOn October 30, 2018, the MacBook Air underwent a major design change, dropping the USB Type-A ports, [[MagSafe]], and the SD card slot in favor of two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports and a headphone jack. It was updated with a [[Retina display]] and [[Amber Lake (microarchitecture)|Intel Y-series Amber Lake]] i5 CPUs, as well as a Force Touch trackpad, a third generation butterfly mechanism keyboard, and the [[Touch ID]] sensor found in the fourth generation MacBook Pro, but without the Touch Bar.

The current generation 13-inch MacBook Pro was introduced on October 27, 2016, which is thinner and lighter than the third generation MacBook Pro. It features a touch-sensitive OLED display strip located in place of the [[function keys]], a [[Touch ID]] sensor integrated with the power button, a butterfly mechanism keyboard similar to the MacBook, and four USB-C ports that also serve as Thunderbolt 3 ports. The 13-inch model was also available in a less expensive configuration with conventional function keys and only two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, but since July 2019, the base MacBook Pro model has the Touch Bar as well as quad-core processors, similar to the higher-end models, although it still has only two USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/|title=MacBook Pro|accessdate=October 27, 2016|website=Apple.com|publisher=Apple}}</ref>\n\nOn November 13, 2019, Apple released the 16-inch MacBook Pro, replacing the 15-inch model of the previous generation, and replacing the butterfly keyboard with a scissor mechanism keyboard (dubbed the Magic Keyboard by Apple), reverting to the old \"inverted-T\" arrow key layout, replacing the virtual [[Esc key|Escape key]] on the Touch Bar with a physical key, and replacing the [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[AMD Polaris|Polaris]] and [[Radeon RX Vega series|Vega]] graphics from the 15-inch model with options from AMD's [[Radeon RX 5000 series|Navi]] graphics architecture, as well as reengineering the speakers, microphone array, and the thermal system compared to the 15-inch; the latter had thermal limitations in the 15-inch model due to its design. In addition, the 16-inch is available with up to 64 GB of DDR4 2667 MHz RAM and up to 8 TB of SSD storage.

It is the fourth and final film in [[The Karate Kid (franchise)|''The Karate Kid'' film series]]. It was directed by [[Christopher Cain]], written by [[Mark W. Lee]], and produced by [[Jerry Weintraub]], with music by [[Bill Conti]]. It is the only film in the series not to feature [[Ralph Macchio]] in the lead role as [[Daniel LaRusso]]. \n\nIt was released on September 9, 1994. Upon its release, ''The Next Karate Kid'' was a critical and commercial failure; though many critics praised the acting, they ultimately saw the film as unnecessary.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nMr. Miyagi travels to [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] to attend a commendation for Japanese-American soldiers, who fought in the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]] during [[World War II]]. He meets Louisa Pierce, the widow of his commanding officer and a lieutenant, Jack. At Pierce's home, they catch up on old times and war stories.\n\nMiyagi is also introduced to Pierce's granddaughter, Julie, a high school teenage girl struggling with anger issues due to her parents' death in a car accident. Her behavior has led to friction between Julie and her grandmother, along with her fellow students and teachers. She sneaks into the school at night to care for an injured [[Harris's hawk]], whom she names Angel, which she keeps in a pigeon coop on the roof.\n\nMiyagi invites Louisa to stay at his house in Los Angeles to enjoy peace and quiet tending his garden while he stays in Boston as Julie's caretaker. At school, Julie meets and befriends Eric McGowen, a teenage security guard-in-training and a pledge for a shady school security [[fraternity]], the Alpha Elite. The members are taught to enforce the school rules, mostly by using physical force, by a self-styled colonel, Dugan. The leader (and Dugan's toughest, strongest, and most aggressive student) is the short-fused Ned, who makes repeated unsuccessful sexual advances on Julie. Eric learns of Angel and promises to feed her while Julie is with Miyagi.\n\nWhen Julie survives almost being hit by a car by jumping into a tiger position, she finally learns to confide in Miyagi when he approves of Julie's talent. She reveals that she was taught karate by her father, who learned from her grandfather, Miyagi's student.\n\nThe next time Julie sneaks into the school to feed Angel, she is detected by the Alpha Elite, and chased through the school. Julie hides in the cafeteria until Ned finds her, at which point she hits a fire alarm with her backpack so Ned would let go of her. Escaping the school, she is arrested by the police and gets suspended for two weeks by Colonel Dugan. Miyagi uses this time to take Julie to a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery]] to teach her the true ways of karate and how to handle her anger issues. Julie learns through direct lessons about balance, coordination, awareness and respect for all life. She befriends several monks, including the Grand Abbot. The monks host a birthday party for her, giving her a cake and an arrow that Miyagi had caught while it was in flight in a demonstration of [[Zen in the Art of Archery|Zen archery]], as well as conceding to her wish that they visit her in Boston. (They visit during Julie's school [[prom]], where they go bowling with Miyagi. A local player racistly challenges them, loses the match to impossible odds, and accepts their tutelage in how to bowl a strike blind.)\n\nUpon Julie returning to school, she discovers that Angel was relocated at some point to the animal sanctuary; Miyagi assists Julie in releasing the bird back to the wild, using [[Reiki|the pain suppression technique from the first film]] to heal Angel's wing. In preparation for prom, Miyagi teaches Julie how to dance, and purchases her a dress. Julie goes to the prom with Eric, but under the orders of Colonel Dugan, the Alpha Elite bungee jump in. When one of the members breaks his arm, Eric shows concern, but Ned tells him to mind his own business.\n\nEric drives Julie home and kisses her. Ned follows them, and smashes Eric's car windows with a baseball bat. Ned challenges Eric to a fight at the docks, and is joined by Colonel Dugan and the Alpha Elite. They set fire to Eric's car and severely beat him, but Eric is saved by Julie and Miyagi.\n\nNed tries to grab Julie, but she challenges him to a fight. She holds her own, using the karate she has learned, even when Ned throws sand in her face. Julie defeats Ned and turns her back on him; Colonel Dugan bullies the rest of the group to continue the fight, but they refuse. Miyagi challenges Colonel Dugan to fight and wins, leaving the Alpha Elite disappointed in their instructor. The film concludes with Angel flying freely above the water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Julie Pierce\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Colonel Paul Dugan\n* [[Constance Towers]] as Louisa Pierce\n* [[Chris Conrad (actor)|Chris Conrad]] as Eric McGowen\n* Michael Cavalieri as Ned Randall\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Charlie\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Angel the Hawk (voice)\n* Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot Monk\n\n\n==Reception {{anchor|Critics}}==\n''The Next Karate Kid'' has been critically panned.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Last': A Clear Remembrance of 'Karate Kid' Past  |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date=1994-09-12|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-12/entertainment/ca-47633_1_karate-kid|accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> However, many critics praised Swank, and it is still considered to be her break-out performance.

It is the fourth and final film in [[The Karate Kid (franchise)|''The Karate Kid'' film series]]. It was directed by [[Christopher Cain]], written by [[Mark W. Lee]], and produced by [[Jerry Weintraub]], with music by [[Bill Conti]]. It is the only film in the series not to feature [[Ralph Macchio]] in the lead role as [[Daniel LaRusso]]. \n\nIt was released on September 9, 1994. Upon its release, ''The Next Karate Kid'' was a critical and commercial failure; though many critics praised the acting, they ultimately saw the film as unnecessary.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nMr. Miyagi travels to [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]] to attend a commendation for Japanese-American soldiers, who fought in the [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd Regimental Combat Team]] during [[World War II]]. He meets Louisa Pierce, the widow of his commanding officer and a lieutenant, Jack. At Pierce's home, they catch up on old times and war stories.\n\nMiyagi is also introduced to Pierce's granddaughter, Julie, a high school teenage girl struggling with anger issues due to her parents' death in a car accident. Her behavior has led to friction between Julie and her grandmother, along with her fellow students and teachers. She sneaks into the school at night to care for an injured [[Harris's hawk]], whom she names Angel, which she keeps in a pigeon coop on the roof.\n\nMiyagi invites Louisa to stay at his house in Los Angeles to enjoy peace and quiet tending his garden while he stays in Boston as Julie's caretaker. At school, Julie meets and befriends Eric McGowen, a teenage security guard-in-training and a pledge for a shady school security [[fraternity]], the Alpha Elite. The members are taught to enforce the school rules, mostly by using physical force, by a self-styled colonel, Dugan. The leader (and Dugan's toughest, strongest, and most aggressive student) is the short-fused Ned, who makes repeated unsuccessful sexual advances on Julie. Eric learns of Angel and promises to feed her while Julie is with Miyagi.\n\nWhen Julie survives almost being hit by a car by jumping into a tiger position, she finally learns to confide in Miyagi when he approves of Julie's talent. She reveals that she was taught karate by her father, who learned from her grandfather, Miyagi's student.\n\nThe next time Julie sneaks into the school to feed Angel, she is detected by the Alpha Elite, and chased through the school. Julie hides in the cafeteria until Ned finds her, at which point she hits a fire alarm with her backpack so Ned would let go of her. Escaping the school, she is arrested by the police and gets suspended for two weeks by Colonel Dugan. Miyagi uses this time to take Julie to a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery]] to teach her the true ways of karate and how to handle her anger issues. Julie learns through direct lessons about balance, coordination, awareness and respect for all life. She befriends several monks, including the Grand Abbot. The monks host a birthday party for her, giving her a cake and an arrow that Miyagi had caught while it was in flight in a demonstration of [[Zen in the Art of Archery|Zen archery]], as well as conceding to her wish that they visit her in Boston. (They visit during Julie's school [[prom]], where they go bowling with Miyagi. A local player racistly challenges them, loses the match to impossible odds, and accepts their tutelage in how to bowl a strike blind.)\n\nUpon Julie returning to school, she discovers that Angel was relocated at some point to the animal sanctuary; Miyagi assists Julie in releasing the bird back to the wild, using [[Reiki|the pain suppression technique from the first film]] to heal Angel's wing. In preparation for prom, Miyagi teaches Julie how to dance, and purchases her a dress. Julie goes to the prom with Eric, but under the orders of Colonel Dugan, the Alpha Elite bungee jump in. When one of the members breaks his arm, Eric shows concern, but Ned tells him to mind his own business.\n\nEric drives Julie home and kisses her. Ned follows them, and smashes Eric's car windows with a baseball bat. Ned challenges Eric to a fight at the docks, and is joined by Colonel Dugan and the Alpha Elite. They set fire to Eric's car and severely beat him, but Eric is saved by Julie and Miyagi.\n\nNed tries to grab Julie, but she challenges him to a fight. She holds her own, using the karate she has learned, even when Ned throws sand in her face. Julie defeats Ned and turns her back on him; Colonel Dugan bullies the rest of the group to continue the fight, but they refuse. Miyagi challenges Colonel Dugan to fight and wins, leaving the Alpha Elite disappointed in their instructor. The film concludes with Angel flying freely above the water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n* [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]] as [[Mr. Miyagi]]\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as Julie Pierce\n* [[Michael Ironside]] as Colonel Paul Dugan\n* [[Constance Towers]] as Louisa Pierce\n* [[Chris Conrad (actor)|Chris Conrad]] as Eric McGowen\n* Michael Cavalieri as Ned Randall\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Charlie\n* [[Frank Welker]] as Angel the Hawk (voice)\n* Arsenio 'Sonny' Trinidad as Abbot Monk\n\n\n==Reception {{anchor|Critics}}==\n''The Next Karate Kid'' has been critically panned.<ref>{{cite news|title= 'Last': A Clear Remembrance of 'Karate Kid' Past  |publisher= Los Angeles Times|date=1994-09-12|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1994-09-12/entertainment/ca-47633_1_karate-kid|accessdate=2010-08-25}}</ref> However, many critics praised Swank, and it is still considered to be her break-out performance.
