St. David CSS is located in [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]], [[Ontario]] and is a member of the [[Waterloo Catholic District School Board]]. Its building is the oldest secondary school building in the board.  Historically it was a junior high school, instructing students from grades 7 to 10. St. David received full funding from the Ontario [[Ministry of Education (Ontario)|Ministry of Education]] in 1985, when the school changed its educational focus to students in grades 9 to [[Ontario Academic Credit|OAC]]. Since the OAC year of secondary school was phased out of Ontario schools in the 2002-2003 school year, St. David CSS now teaches grades 9 through to 12. At present (2011) St. David educates 1045 students. St. David is named after [[St David]], a 6th-century saint.\n\n== Staff and administration ==\nAs of March 2016, St. David's principal is John Dietrich, with Daniel Hutter and Jacqueline Wettlaufer as [[Vice principal|vice-principals]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.wcdsb.ca/schools/schools_sda.html |title=Our Schools - St. David Catholic Secondary |work=wcdsb.ca|author= Waterloo Catholic District School Board|year=2011 |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe school also has approximately 95 full-time teaching staff.\n\n== Uniform policy (2001 - 2002) ==\nAs with the other secondary schools in the Waterloo Catholic District School Board, St. David requires all students to wear a [[uniform]] every day, except for the occasional dress-down day (known to staff and students as \"Civies Day\"). During the 2001 - 2002 school year, this policy required all students to have [[Tennis shirt|golf]] and [[dress shirt]]s tucked into their pants at all times, on the basis that untucked shirts did not convey the proper sense of respect for the school.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC005.pdf</ref>\n\nDuring the last two weeks of June 2002, the administration of St. David made a public announcement that any student in violation of the uniform rules would be [[Suspension (school punishment)|suspended]] for one day. In Ontario, any disciplinary action of this type is listed on an [[student record|Ontario student record]], which may adversely affect a student's chances of acceptance to [[post-secondary education]]. Ontario student records also are investigated by teachers when reviewing students enrolled for classes, and by staff at other schools in the event a student applies for a transfer.\n\nNo prior violations of the rules were taken into account with this policy. Suspension, as a punishment, is typically given for much more serious academic and criminal offences. However, the provincial [[Safe Schools Act]] allows discretionary one-day suspensions for minor infractions of school policies and procedures. These suspensions cannot be formally challenged, as the Safe Schools Act does not allow for appeals of one day suspensions.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/ap_memos/PDF/APC012.pdf</ref> Nevertheless, the consequence would add to a student's record, causing any subsequent offenses within five years to be judged more harshly.<ref>http://www.wcdsb.edu.on.ca/info/safe/disciplinary_actions.html</ref>\n\nThe \"tucked-in shirt\" rule, though, was short-lived as at the beginning of the 2002 - 2003 school year, the policy was revised to eliminate the requirement of golf shirts being tucked in.\n\n[[File:St David HS Waterloo.jpg|thumb|right]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Luca Congi]], kicker/punter for the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]].

Beijing's strongest supporters were in Asia, in [[Malaysia]] (81%) and [[Pakistan]] (81%); African nations of [[Kenya]] (78%), [[Senegal]] (77%) and [[Nigeria]] (76%); as well as Latin America, particularly in countries heavily engaging with the Chinese market, such as [[Venezuela]] (71%), [[Brazil]] (65%) and [[Chile]] (62%).<ref name=pewglobal>[http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/07/18/chapter-3-attitudes-toward-china/ Chapter 3.

But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes.

About half or more of those in the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed also thought China acted unilaterally. This includes 79% of Israelis, 71% of Jordanians and 68% of Turks.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes. This concern about Beijing's failure to consider other countries' interests when making foreign policy decisions was particularly strong in the Asia-Pacific \u2013 in Japan (89%), South Korea (79%) and Australia (79%) \u2013 and in Europe \u2013 in Spain (85%), Italy (83%), France (83%) and Britain (82%). About half or more of those in the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed also thought China acted unilaterally. This includes 79% of Israelis, 71% of Jordanians and 68% of Turks.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

Starting in 1858, Chinese \"[[coolies]]\" were brought to Canada to work in the mines and on the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, \"[[tax per head|head taxes]]\" were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under \"special circumstances\". The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967, when all racial restrictions on [[immigration to Canada]] were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points based immigration system. On June 22, 2006, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] offered an apology and compensation only for the head tax once paid by Chinese immigrants.<ref>{{cite web| last=Canada| authorlink=Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)| year=2006| url=http://www.pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=2&id=1220/| title=Address by the Prime Minister on the Chinese Head Tax Redress| publisher=Government of Canada| accessdate=2006-08-08| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/673FgoIBG| archivedate=2012-04-19}}</ref> Survivors or their spouses were paid approximately CAD$20,000 in compensation.<ref>[http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060621/head_tax_060622 Sympatico / MSN : News : CTV.ca: PM apologizes in House of Commons for head tax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220085617/http://sympaticomsn.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060621/head_tax_060622 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>\n\nSinophobia in Canada has been fueled by allegations of extreme real estate price distortion resulting from Chinese demand, purportedly forcing locals out of the market.<ref>[http://www.richmond-news.com/news/anti-chinese-sentiment-partly-governments-fault-steves-1.3144628 Anti-Chinese sentiment partly governments' fault: Steves].

The term has variations, which may be more offensive in tone such as ''intsik beho'' and may used in a deregatory phrase, ''intsik beho tulo laway'' (\"old Chinaman with drooling saliva\").<ref name=\"bayanihannews.com.au\">{{cite web|url=http://bayanihannews.com.au/2013/09/13/pinoy-or-tsinoy-what-is-the-problem/|title=Pinoy or Tsinoy, What is the Problem?|publisher=|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=2013-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110128-317065/Intsik|title=Intsik \u2013 INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos|accessdate=9 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219182955/http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110128-317065/Intsik|archivedate=19 February 2014}}</ref>\n* '''''Tsekwa''''' (sometimes spelled ''chekwa'') \u2013 is a slang term used by the [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] to refer [[Chinese people]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pinoyslang.com/define/tsekwa/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202205202/http://pinoyslang.com/define/tsekwa/ |archivedate=2008-12-02 }}</ref>\n\n=== In French ===\n* '''''[[wikt:chinetoque|Chinetoque]]''''' (m/f) \u2013 derogatory term referring to Asian people.\n\n=== In Indonesian ===\n* '''''Cokin''''', derogatory term to Asian people<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kamusslang.com/m?do=Search&submit=Cari&what=cokin |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031341/http://kamusslang.com/m?do=Search&submit=Cari&what=cokin |archivedate=2017-02-02 }}</ref>\n* '''''Panlok''''' (Panda lokal/local panda): derogatory term referring to Chinese female or female who look like Chinese, particularly [[prostitute]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kamusslang.com/m?do=Search&submit=Cari&what=panlok |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202031529/http://kamusslang.com/m?do=Search&submit=Cari&what=panlok |title=Kamus Slang Mobile |publisher=kamusslang.com |archive-date=2017-02-02}}</ref>\n\n=== In Japanese ===\n* {{nihongo|'''''Dojin'''''|\u571f\u4eba|dojin}} \u2013 literally \"earth people\", referring either neutrally to local folk or derogatorily to indigenous peoples and savages, used towards the end of the 19th century and early 20th century by Japanese colonials, being a sarcastic remark regarding backwardsness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n* {{nihongo|'''''Tokuajin'''''|\u7279\u4e9c\u4eba|tokuajin}} \u2013 literally \"particular Asian people\", derogatory term used against [[Koreans]] and Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n* {{Nihongo|'''''[[Shina (word)|Shina]]'''''|\u652f\u90a3 (\u30b7\u30ca)|shina}} \u2013 Japanese reading of the Chinese character compound \"{{lang|zh|\u652f\u90a3}}\" (''Zhina'' in Mandarin Chinese), originally a Chinese transcription of an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] name for China that entered East Asia with the spread of [[Buddhism]].

If it's not political, it's not black art\".<ref name=\":1\" /> While she fought for equality, she was not optimistic about attitudes changing soon, and self categorized her look at art into two categories. \"When I am political, I am painting as a black or as a woman or both. Otherwise, I am just a member of the human race.\" She taught the History of Black Art at [[Rutgers University]], and served as chair of the department from 1975 to 1978. \n\nBrowne contributed to, and served as an advisor to, ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|HERESIES: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]]'', including serving on the editorial collective for issue #15, Racism is the Issue. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/heresies_20/heresies_20_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"Heresies Magazine Issue #20: Heresies (Volume 5, Number 4)\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Major Achievements==\nIn addition to serving as a professor and department chair at [[Rutgers]], Browne was honored most notably for her political works showcasing her life as a black woman.

She received her [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1950 from [[Hunter College]], New York, NY and a [[Master of Fine Arts]] from [[Hunter College]] in 1959.

If it's not political, it's not black art\".<ref name=\":1\" /> While she fought for equality, she was not optimistic about attitudes changing soon, and self categorized her look at art into two categories. \"When I am political, I am painting as a black or as a woman or both. Otherwise, I am just a member of the human race.\" She taught the History of Black Art at [[Rutgers University]], and served as chair of the department from 1975-1978. \n\nBrowne contributed to, and served as an advisor to, ''[[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|HERESIES: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]]'', including serving on the editorial collective for issue #15, Racism is the Issue. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/heresies_20/heresies_20_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"Heresies Magazine Issue #20: Heresies (Volume 5, Number 4)\"|website=archive.org|access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==Major Achievements==\nIn addition to serving as a professor and department chair at [[Rutgers]], Browne was honored most notably for her political works showcasing her life as a black woman.
