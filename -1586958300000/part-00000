This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. One is a special form of [[Punjabi tandoor|tandoori]] cooking that is now famous in other parts of India, UK, Canada, Hong Kong and in many parts of the world.\n\nThe local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the [[agriculture]] and [[farming]] lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan Civilization]]. Locally grown [[staple food]]s form the major part of the local cuisine. Distinctively Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich, buttery flavours along with the extensive vegetarian and meat dishes. Main dishes include ''sarhon d\u0101 s\u00e2g'' (a stew whose main ingredient is mustard greens) and ''makki di roti'' (flatbreads made with cornmeal).\n\nKarrhi is a spicy, yellow-colored gravy with cakes made of chickpea flour (besan), containing lemon juice, red pepper and turmeric. It is commonly served with rice or naan bread.\n\n[[Basmati]] rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianfoodforever.com/punjabi/jeera-rice.html |title=Jeera Rice Recipe |website=Indianfoodforever |publisher=Indian food forever}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.indianfoodforever.com/punjabi/kadhi-chawal.html|title = KADHI CHAWAL RECIPE|date = |accessdate = |website = Indianfoodforever|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.khanapakana.com/cooking-video/b3d080b5-19b6-4e02-9335-848541c061bb/punjabi-pulao-biryani#|title = Punjabi Pulao Biryani|date = |accessdate = |website = Khanapakana|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tandoorimumbai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Chicken tikka]] is a popular dish in Punjabi cuisine]]\n\n[[File:Mintparatha.jpg|200px|thumb|Mint paratha from [[Punjab, India]]]]\n\n[[File:Plainlassi.jpg|200px|thumb|Lassi from [[Punjab]]]]\n\n==Style of cooking==\nThere are many styles of cooking in Punjab.

This cuisine has a rich tradition of many distinct and local ways of cooking. One is a special form of [[Punjabi tandoor|tandoori]] cooking that is now famous in other parts of India, UK, Canada, Hong Kong and in many parts of the world.\n\nThe local cuisine of Punjab is heavily influenced by the [[agriculture]] and [[farming]] lifestyle prevalent from the times of the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan Civilization]]. Locally grown [[staple food]]s form the major part of the local cuisine. Distinctively Punjabi cuisine is known for its rich, buttery flavours along with the extensive vegetarian and meat dishes. Main dishes include ''sarhon d\u0101 s\u00e2g'' (a stew whose main ingredient is mustard greens) and ''makki di roti'' (flatbreads made with cornmeal).\n\nKarrhi is a spicy, yellow-colored gravy with cakes made of chickpea flour (besan), containing lemon juice, red pepper and turmeric. It is commonly served with rice or naan bread.\n\n[[Basmati]] rice is the indigenous variety of Punjab, and various meat- and vegetable-based rice dishes have been developed using it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indianfoodforever.com/punjabi/jeera-rice.html |title=Jeera Rice Recipe |website=Indianfoodforever |publisher=Indian food forever}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.indianfoodforever.com/punjabi/kadhi-chawal.html|title = KADHI CHAWAL RECIPE|date = |accessdate = |website = Indianfoodforever|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.khanapakana.com/cooking-video/b3d080b5-19b6-4e02-9335-848541c061bb/punjabi-pulao-biryani#|title = Punjabi Pulao Biryani|date = |accessdate = |website = Khanapakana|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tandoorimumbai.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Chicken tikka]] is a popular dish in Punjabi cuisine]]\n\n[[File:Mintparatha.jpg|200px|thumb|Mint paratha from [[Punjab, India]]]]\n\n[[File:Plainlassi.jpg|200px|thumb|Lassi from [[Punjab]]]]\n\n==Style of cooking==\nThere are many styles of cooking in Punjab.

Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ... Some stories make you wonder where they come from, how they arrived in the author\u2019s imagination, but they \u2018re so good you\u2019d be pleased they did. Paul Brooks - Midweek\n\n\u201cMoisa doesn\u2019t disappoint. His stories are wide-ranging, both in subject matter and character portrayal, and his wit and his perception of human frailty reflect a life lived in several manifestations. This collection covers stories from New Zealand scenes as well as echoing the six years spent as a child in Cyprus in the late 1950s and as a young man in 1973 and 1974. ... Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ... Blood and Koka Kola ... is a very interesting, insightful and appealing collection of short stories...\u201d Michael O'Leary- Landfall\n\n==Novel==\n* The Hour of the Grey Wolf, Christodoulos Moisa 2016, {{ISBN|978-1519445988}} \nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"The writing style can best be described as erudite with allusions to historical and Biblical events. In a less fluent writer, these descriptions would slow the story down but this is not the case ... The book remains fast-moving while giving the reader the satisfaction of having read a novel of substance and at the same time enjoying trying to second guess the mystery murder element. I recommend it.\" <ref>Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016.</ref>\nThe Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways, it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page-turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too. The overall effect of The Hour of the Grey Wolf cannot be denied: the setting and characters are still resonating with me ...\" <ref>Antony Millen \u2013 Crime Watch - Investigating crime fiction from a Kiwi perspective April 2016</ref>\n\n* Overcast Sunday, Christodoulos Moisa 2016,{{ISBN|9781523354214}}\nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"While the main story is sufficient to hold your interest, it is embellished with a cultural richness that sets it apart from just another \u201cWho-dunnit\u201c ... The cleverly devised plot will keep you intrigued right through to the end ... For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s\u2019 \u201cOvercast Sunday\u201d will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland. The book gives examples of the hardships, hopes and dashed dreams which marked their lives and the reasons for moving to New Zealand. Like all immigrants they found it to be no promised land and this informs and colours the book as various incidents are woven into the plot ...\" Marion Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 17 November 2016.\n\n\"This is not your average crime novel, in fact, although the story features a crime- a murder \u2013 it is a story of a place, a time, and the characters who converge on both. It is about people and the stories they bring to the Greek community in Wellington 1950. The story opens with ... Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centered, and the forces that bring everything together at that point.\nThe reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book\u2019s unusual configuration. \nThe author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention.\nThe story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells.  This latest book is a valuable addition to the repertoire of a superb writer.\n<ref name=\"Paul Brooks\">{{cite news|last1=Moisa|first1=Christodooulos|title=Crime Story brings 1950s NZ to life.|agency=Midweek|publisher=NZ Herald|date=17 May 2017}}</ref> Paul Brooks\nMidweek - Herald - 17 May 2017\n\n*Wolves in Dogs Clothing, Christodoulos Moisa 2017,{{ISBN|978-1548977368}}\nCRITICS COMMENTS: \"The novel is set in Cyprus during the coup and the Turkish invasion in 1974 and the major plot based on a series of brutal murders is supported by a number of equally intriguing subplots .... the writing style is a combination thriller and interesting snippets about history, politics, society and mythology.

Some are told in the traditional manner; with a beginning, middle and end; others are short staccato bursts of poetic energy, gorgeous in their use of language and satisfying as a good story should be... None is disappointing. Each story is a good read, and the variety of construction adds to the interest and encourages further exploration ... For your average Kiwi, it adds an exotic touch and extra interest ... Some stories make you wonder where they come from, how they arrived in the author\u2019s imagination, but they \u2018re so good you\u2019d be pleased they did. Paul Brooks - Midweek\n\n\u201cMoisa doesn\u2019t disappoint. His stories are wide-ranging, both in subject matter and character portrayal, and his wit and his perception of human frailty reflect a life lived in several manifestations. This collection covers stories from New Zealand scenes as well as echoing the six years spent as a child in Cyprus in the late 1950s and as a young man in 1973 and 1974. ... Several of Moisa\u2019s stories have the surprise ending which is imperative for a good story, and this is one of the strengths and delights of his book ... Blood and Koka Kola ... is a very interesting, insightful and appealing collection of short stories...\u201d Michael O'Leary- Landfall\n\n==Novel==\n* The Hour of the Grey Wolf, Christodoulos Moisa 2016, {{ISBN|978-1519445988}} \nCRITICS COMMENTS:\"The writing style can best be described as erudite with allusions to historical and Biblical events. In a less fluent writer, these descriptions would slow the story down but this is not the case ...

I recommend it.\" <ref>Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016.</ref>\nThe Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways, it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page-turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too.

The cleverly devised plot will keep you intrigued right through to the end ... For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s\u2019 \u201cOvercast Sunday\u201d will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland. The book gives examples of the hardships, hopes and dashed dreams which marked their lives and the reasons for moving to New Zealand. Like all immigrants they found it to be no promised land and this informs and colours the book as various incidents are woven into the plot ...\" Marion Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 17 November 2016.\n\n\"This is not your average crime novel, in fact, although the story features a crime- a murder \u2013 it is a story of a place, a time, and the characters who converge on both.

A railway station near [[Boraki Railway Station|Boraki]] and an international airport were included later in the plan intending to develop Greater Noida as an independent city.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the Noida extension (now a part of [[Gautam Buddh Nagar]]) became what is today known as Greater Noida. The Greater NOIDA Authority manages the development of the city. Greater Noida is connected to [[Agra]] by the six-lane [[Yamuna Expressway]]. The annual [[Indian Grand Prix]] is held at the [[Buddh International Circuit]]. Roads are wide with service lanes for every major road. The sectors are named by letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma&nbsp; II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]] lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the [[Mainpuri]] conspiracy. A park has been named \"Amar Shaheed Pt. Ram Prasad Bismil Udyan\" by the Uttar Pradesh Government.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news |title=\u0935\u0924\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0916\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0939\u093f\u0936\u094b\u0902 \u092a\u0947 \u091c\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0917\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u0915\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0928(en:Sacrifice of life for homeland) |newspaper= Dainik Jagran ([[Hindi]] Jagran City-Greater Noida) [[New Delhi]]|page=24 |date=12 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th [[Auto Expo]]s (The Motor Show) were held at India Expo Mart, Greater Noida, in February 2014, 2016 and 2018, 2020 respectively.\nIn 2018, Gamma 2 was officially declared as the capital of Greater Noida.\n\n=== Greater Noida (West) ===\nGreater Noida West, previously known as Noida extension, is a part of Greater Noida and consists of 16 villages: Khairpur Gurjar, Shahberi, [[Devla]], [[Patwari]], Ghanghola, [[Bisrakh]], Roza-Yakubpur, [[Haibatpur]], Itaida, Patwari, Aminabad, Asadallapur, [[Maincha]] and [[Chipyana Buzurg]].<ref>[http://www.thetalkingbrick.com/blog/2013/03/the-number-game-at-noida-extension-property/ The number game at Noida Extension property] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306022650/http://thetalkingbrick.com/blog/2013/03/the-number-game-at-noida-extension-property |date=6 March 2016 }}.

All cabling and utilities have been built underground. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma are the oldest sectors. The other emerging sectors include Xu, Delta, Mu, Omicron and Tau. The present GNIDA office is in Gamma&nbsp; II sector just opposite the historical village Rampur Jagir/Jahangir where the revolutionary [[Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil]] lived in 1919 when he was hidden underground after the [[Mainpuri]] conspiracy.
