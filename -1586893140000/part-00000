Federal mine inspectors employed by the Department's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) enforce these regulations by issuing citations and orders to mine operators. The Commission is concerned solely with the adjudication of disputes under the Mine Act, including the determination of appropriate penalties. It does not regulate mining or enforce the Mine Act. The Commission was established as an independent agency to ensure its impartiality.\n\nMost cases deal with civil penalties assessed against mine operators and address whether the alleged safety and health violations occurred as well as the appropriateness of proposed penalties. Other types of cases include orders to close a mine, miners' charges of safety related discrimination and miners\u2019 requests for compensation after the mine is idled by a closure order.\n\nThe Commission's [[administrative law judge]]s (ALJs) decide cases at the trial level. The five-member Commission provides appellate review. Commissioners are appointed by the [[U.S. President|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Review of an ALJ decision by the Commission is not guaranteed but requires the affirmative vote of two Commissioners. Most of the cases accepted for review are generated from petitions filed by parties adversely affected by an ALJ decision. However, cases can also be accepted based on the Commission's own direction for review. An ALJ decision that is not accepted for review becomes a final, non-precedential order of the Commission. Appeals from the Commission's decisions are to the U.S. courts of appeals.\n\nProcedures for appealing cases to the Commission are contained in its Rules of Procedure published in [https://web.archive.org/web/20050408201822/http://www.fmshrc.gov/rules/prorules11-99.html 29 CFR Part 2700]. The Commission also publishes these rules in a separate pamphlet. A brochure, entitled \"[http://www.fmshrc.gov/guides/howacase.html How a Case Proceeds Before the Commission]\" is also available. The Commission's headquarters and Office of Administrative Law Judges are co-located in [[Washington, D.C.]], with an additional OALJ's offices in [[Denver, Colorado]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Currently, the Commission has a budget of more than [[United States Dollar|US$]]7 million and a staff of 50 employees.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fmshrc.gov/ Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission]\n* [https://catalog.archives.gov/id/18538642 Records of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission in the National Archives (Record Group 470)]\n\n[[Category:Independent agencies of the United States government]]\n[[Category:Mining law and governance]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1977]]\n[[Category:Mine safety]]\n\n\n{{US-gov-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=July 2009}}\n{{Infobox government agency\n| agency_name = Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission\n| seal = Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission seal.png\n| seal_width = 180px\n| seal_caption = Seal of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission\n| formed = {{start date and age|1977|11|10}}<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/30/823 30 U.S. Code \u00a7 823 - Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission - cornell.edu]</ref>\n| date1 =\n| date1_name =\n| date2 =\n| date2_name =\n| preceding1 =\n| preceding2 =\n| dissolved =\n| superseding =\n| jurisdiction =\n| coordinates = \n| headquarters = [[Washington, D.C.]]\n| employees = \n| budget = \n| chief1_name = \n| chief1_position = \n| chief2_name = \n| chief2_position = \n| parent_agency =\n| child1_agency =\n| child2_agency =\n| website = [http://www.fmshrc.gov/ fmshrc.gov]\n| footnotes =\n}}\nThe '''Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission''' is an independent adjudicative agency of the [[United States government]] that provides [[administrative law|administrative trial]] and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act]], or Mine Act, of 1977.\n\nUnder the Mine Act, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] issues regulations covering health and safety in the nation's [[mining|mines]]. Federal mine inspectors employed by the Department's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) enforce these regulations by issuing citations and orders to mine operators. The Commission is concerned solely with the adjudication of disputes under the Mine Act, including the determination of appropriate penalties. It does not regulate mining or enforce the Mine Act. The Commission was established as an independent agency to ensure its impartiality.\n\nMost cases deal with civil penalties assessed against mine operators and address whether the alleged safety and health violations occurred as well as the appropriateness of proposed penalties. Other types of cases include orders to close a mine, miners' charges of safety related discrimination and miners\u2019 requests for compensation after the mine is idled by a closure order.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s [[administrative law judge]]s (ALJs) decide cases at the trial level. The five-member Commission provides appellate review. Commissioners are appointed by the [[U.S. President|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Review of an ALJ decision by the Commission is not guaranteed but requires the affirmative vote of two Commissioners. Most of the cases accepted for review are generated from petitions filed by parties adversely affected by an ALJ decision. However, cases can also be accepted based on the Commission's own direction for review. An ALJ decision that is not accepted for review becomes a final, non-precedential order of the Commission.
