In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] with the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] began to form their kingdom in [[Pannonia]]. [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] played these Pannonian Goths off against the [[Thracian Goths]], but instead the two groups united after the death of their leader [[Theoderic Strabo]]. Instead Zeno backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]], who he had supported as its king. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\n==Goths==\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe Ostrogoths were one of several peoples referred to more generally as Goths. The Goths appear in Roman records starting in the third century, in the regions north of the [[Lower Danube]] and [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=109\u2013110}} They competed for influence with peoples who had lived longer in the area, such as the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and various [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=116,127\u2013128}} Based on their Germanic language and material culture it is believed that the Gothic culture derived from cultures originally from the direction of the [[Vistula]] river, in the north, and now in [[Poland]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=115\u2013117}} By the third century, the Goths were already in sub-groups with their own names, because the [[Tervingi]], who bordered on the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Carpathian mountains]], were mentioned separately on at least one occasion.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths, not mentioned until later, are associated with the Greuthungi who lived further east. The dividing line between the Tervingi and the Greuthungi, was reported by Ammianus to be the [[Dniester River]], and to the east of the Greuthungi were [[Alans]] living near the River Don.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Gothic Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nThe Ostrogoths in Italy used the Gothic language, which is best attested today in the surviving translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]]. While none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining. These comprise the earliest remnants of a [[Germanic language]].{{efn|A language related to [[Gothic language|Gothic]] was still spoken sporadically in [[Crimea]] as late as the 16th and 17th centuries ([[Crimean Gothic language]]).{{sfn|Dalby|1999|p=229}} Much of the disappearance of the Gothic language is attributable to the Goths' cultural and linguistic absorption by other European peoples during the Middle Ages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=572}} }}\n\n===Etymology===\n{{see|Greuthungi#Etymology|Goths#Name}}\n[[File:GNM - Gotische Fibeln.jpg|thumb|right|Ostrogothic bow-fibulae (c. 500) from [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Italy]]]]\n\nThe first part of the word \"Ostrogoth\" comes from a root \"*auster-\" meaning eastern. According to the proposal of Wolfram, this was originally a boastful tribal name meaning \"Goths of the rising sun\", or \"Goths glorified by the rising sun\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=25, 387 fn49, 388 fn58}}{{Efn|Wolfram cites Moritz Sch\u00f6nfeld's (1911) work, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und V\u00f6lkernamen'' as his principle naming source.

Among other Gothic group names however, they are associated with the Greuthungi. Scholarly opinions are various. Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] sees these as two names for one people as will be discussed below. [[Peter Heather]], in contrast, has written that: \n<blockquote>Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=404}}</blockquote>\n\nA dubious early mention of the Ostrogoths is sometimes mentioned in the ''Historia Augusta'' article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268\u2013270), where the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi ''austorgoti'' uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, ''Austrogoti'', Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\" (emphasis added). However this work is now known to have been made centuries later than the events it reports, and is not considered reliable.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first record of a Gothic sub-group acting in its own name, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first definitely mentioned more than one hundred years later than the Tervingi in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways. The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5].

Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{harvtxt|Long|1996|loc=ch.5}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under [[Alatheus and Saphrax]].{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}} In contrast, the [[Amal dynasty]], around whom the later and better-known Othogothic kingdom formed, were in neither of these groups who entered the Roman Empire in the 4th century, because into the 5th century they were Gothic leaders within [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be preferred\". Christensen especially cites {{harvtxt|Heather|1989}}.}}\n\nAccording to Jordanes' ''Getica'' (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such as Herwig Wolfram believe that Jordanes was right to see continuity between the nobility of the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nWolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by outsiders to describe these tribes before they crossed the Danube, and that this terminology dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400. In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves, and thus remained in use. In support of this, Wolfram argues that it is significant that Roman writers either used terminology contrasting Tervingi and Greuthungi, or Vesi/Visigoths and Ostrogoths, and never mixed these pairs \u2014 for example they never contrasted Tervingi and Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} For example, there are two examples of Roman texts which mix Wolfram's proposed geographical and boastful terminologies, but neither contrasts (supposedly) geographical and boastful terms. First, as mentioned above, Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were mentioned together by the poet Claudian, and secondly, all four names were used together in the unreliable ''[[Augustan History]]'' for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202\u2013203}} As a second argument for this geographical versus boastful contrast, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to the group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians, arguing that these \"can only\" be Thervingi, and that this shows how the name \"Greuthungi\" was only used by outsiders.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} However, as mentioned above, these Greuthungi mentioned by Zosimus are those who Heather and other historians equate to the rebellious Greuthungi mentioned later by Claudian in Phrygia in 399\u2013400, who were, according to Claudian, mixed with Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn any case, the older terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\" was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (''tou Oualemeriakou'') by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions and the Amals===\n{{Main|History of the Huns}}\nIn the late 4th century, the rise of the [[Huns]] forced many of the Goths and Alans to join them, while other moved westwards and eventually moved into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]]. Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, perhaps the same people, are believed to have been among the first Goths who were subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}}\n\nWhile many Greuthungi entered the Roman Empire in the 370s, apart from the Ostrogoths who were settled with Greuthungi in Phrygia in the 380s by the Romans, historical records only begin to mention the name of the Ostrogoths as the Gothic political entity which formed among some of the Goths who fought under [[Attila]] in the 5th century. This Ostrogothic kingdom began to coalesce around the leadership of the [[Amal dynasty]]. The Ostrogoths thus fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} Like several other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, where the Huns were defeated by the Roman general Aetius, accompanied by a contingent of Alans, and Visigoths.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=75, 77}}{{efn|Jordanes' account of this battle certainly cannot be trusted as he wrongly attributes a good portion of the victory to the Goths, when it was the Alans who formed the \"backbone of Roman defences.\"{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=77}} }}\n\nJordanes, in his ''Getica'', which is about the history of the Amals, claimed that the Amals were already preeminent under Attila, and among the Goths before the Huns. Modern historians such as [[Peter Heather]] believe this is an exaggeration, and point out that there were at least three factions of Goths in Attila's forces.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=222}}{{sfn|Heather|2007|pp=46\u201347, 72\u201373}}\n\nThe recorded history of the Ostrogoths as a political entity begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. The Ostrogoths under the Amal [[Valamir]] were among the peoples who were living in the [[Middle Danube]] region by this time, and whose freedom from domination by Attila's sons was confirmed by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, which was led by the [[Gepids]]. It is unclear what role the Goths played in this battle, and after the battle many Goths entered Roman military service, while only some began to coalesce under the leadership of Valamir and his two brothers, Vidimir and [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], the father of [[Theodoric the Great]].{{sfn|Burns|1984|pp=52\u201353}} \n\nThese Amal-led Goths entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths followed a similar path in the Balkans to the Alaric-led Visigoths played the century before. They gained momentum by merging two large blocks of militarized Balkan peoples including many who had fought for the Roman Empire, the Pannonian and Thracian Goths; they had a difficult relationship with the Eastern Roman power; they were reinforced by smaller groups such as the [[Rugii]]; and then just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib.

His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].

It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition. Theodoric was able to temporarily salvage some of his realm with the assistance of the Thuringians.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|pp=218\u2013221}} Realizing that the Franks were the most significant threat to the Visigothic empire as well, Alaric II, (who was the son-in-law of Theodoric) enlisted the aid of the Burgundians and fought against the Franks at the urging of the magnates of his tribe, but this choice proved an error and he allegedly met his end at the hand of the Frankish king, Clovis.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=155}}\n\nA time of confusion followed the death of [[Alaric II]] who was slain during the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]].

Atop this infighting, the Ostrogoths faced the doctrinal challenges incurred from their Arian Christianity, which both the aristocracy of Byzantium and the Papacy strongly opposed\u2014so much that it brought them together.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}}\n\nThe weakness of the Ostrogothic position in Italy now showed itself, particularly when Eastern Roman Emperor [[Justinian I]] enacted a law excluding pagans\u2014among them Arian Christians and Jews\u2014from public employment.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} The Ostrogothic King Theodoric reacted by persecuting Catholics.{{sfn|Wallace-Hadrill|2004|p=36}} Nonetheless, Justinian always strove to restore as much of the Western Roman Empire as he could and certainly would not pass up the opportunity. Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire. Fearful that Belisarius might set himself up a permanent kingship should he consolidate his conquests, Justinian recalled him to Constantinople with Witiges in tow.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=208}}\n\nAs soon as Belisarius was gone, the remaining Ostrogoths elected a new king named [[Totila]]. Under the brilliant command of Totila, the Goths were able to reassert themselves to a degree. For a period of nearly ten years, control for Italy became a seesaw battle between Byzantine and Ostrogothic forces.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=210}} Totila eventually recaptured all of northern Italy and even drove the Byzantines out of Rome, thereby affording him the opportunity to take political control of the city, partly by executing the Roman senatorial order. Many of them fled eastwards for Constantinople.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}}\n\nBy 550 Justinian was able to put together an enormous force, an assembly designed to recover his losses and subdue any Gothic resistance. In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated. On surrendering, they informed Narses that evidently \"the hand of God was against them\" and so they left Italy for the northern lands of their fathers.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=95\u201396}} After that final defeat, the Ostrogothic name wholly died. The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|''De Bello Gothico'' IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245; this reference stems from the pen of the Byzantine historian, Procopius, who accompanied Justinian's leading general, Belisarius, on his exploits between 527 and 540. This included the campaigns against the Ostrogoths, which is the subject of ''De Bello Gothico''.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==6th century Scandinavian Ostrogoths (Jordanes)==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|right|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\nJordanes named a people called the Ostrogoths (''Ostrogothae'') in a list of many peoples living on the large island of \"Scandza\", north of the mouth of the [[Vistula]], which most modern scholars understand to refer to the Scandinavian peninsula. The implication was that these Ostrogoths were living there in the 6th century, during the same period when there was a powerful Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. On the other hand, scholars have come to no consensus about when the list was made, and by whom, nor how to interpret most of the names in the list.

In the 5th century, they followed the [[Visigoths]] in creating one of the two great [[Goths|Gothic]] kingdoms within the [[Roman Empire]], based upon the large Gothic populations who had settled in the [[Balkans]] in the 4th century, having crossed the [[Lower Danube]]. While the Visigoths had formed under the leadership of [[Alaric I]], the new Ostrogothic political entity which came to rule Italy, was formed in the Balkans under the influence of the [[Amal Dynasty]]\n\nAfter the death of [[Attila]] and collapse of the [[Hunnic empire]] with the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 453, the [[Amal Dynasty]], the family of   [[Theodoric the Great]] began to form their kingdom in [[Pannonia]]. [[Zeno (emperor)|Emperor Zeno]] played these Pannonian Goths off against the [[Thracian Goths]], but instead the two groups united after the death of their leader [[Theoderic Strabo]]. Instead Zeno backed Theoderic to invade Italy and replace [[Odoacer]], who he had supported as its king. In 493 he established the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] of [[Italy]], when Theodoric defeated Odoacer's forces and killed his rival Germanic chieftain at a banquet. \n\nA period of instability then ensued, eventually tempting the [[Byzantine|Eastern Roman]] Emperor [[Justinian]] to declare war on the Ostrogoths in 535 in an effort to restore the former western provinces of the [[Roman Empire]]. Initially, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] were successful, but under the leadership of [[Totila]], the [[Goths]] reconquered most of the lost territory until Totila's death at the [[Battle of Taginae]]. [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|The war]] lasted for almost 21 years and caused enormous damage across Italy, reducing the population of the peninsula. Any remaining Ostrogoths in Italy were absorbed into the [[Lombards]], who established a [[Lombard Kingdom|kingdom]] in Italy in 568.\n\nAs with other Gothic groups, the history of the peoples who made them up before they reached the Roman Balkans is difficult to reconstruct in detail. However, the Ostrogoths are associated with the earlier [[Greuthungi]]. The Ostrogoths themselves were more commonly referred to simply as Goths even in the 5th century, but before then they were referred to once, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which associates them with a group of Greuthungi. Furthermore, the 6th century historian of the Goths Jordanes also equated the Ostrogoths of his time to the Goths ruled by King [[Ermanaric]] in the 4th century, who the Roman writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] had called Greuthungi, and described as living between the [[Dniester]] and [[Don river|Don]] rivers. He also mentioned that Ermanaric committed suicide when the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]] attacked his people from the east. After this, the Gothic peoples moved massively into the Roman empire, or became subservient to the Huns.\n\n==Goths==\n{{Main article|Goths|Chernyakhov culture|Oium|Gothic runic inscriptions}}\n[[File:Chernyakhov.PNG|thumb|{{legend|#0f0|Traditional [[G\u00f6taland]]}}\n{{legend|#f08|Island of [[Gotland]]}}\n{{legend|#f00|[[Wielbark Culture]], early 3rd century}}\n{{legend|#f80|[[Chernyakhov culture]], early 4th century}}\n{{legend|#80f|[[Roman Empire]]}}]]\nThe Ostrogoths were one of several peoples referred to more generally as Goths. The Goths appear in Roman records starting in the third century, in the regions north of the [[Lower Danube]] and [[Black Sea]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=109\u2013110}} They competed for influence with peoples who had lived longer in the area, such as the [[Carpi (people)|Carpi]], and various [[Sarmatians]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=116,127\u2013128}} Based on their Germanic language and material culture it is believed that the Gothic culture derived from cultures originally from the direction of the [[Vistula]] river, in the north, and now in [[Poland]].{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=115\u2013117}} By the third century, the Goths were already in sub-groups with their own names, because the [[Tervingi]], who bordered on the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Carpathian mountains]], were mentioned separately on at least one occasion.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths, not mentioned until later, are associated with the Greuthungi who lived further east. The dividing line between the Tervingi and the Greuthungi, was reported by Ammianus to be the [[Dniester River]], and to the east of the Greuthungi were [[Alans]] living near the River Don.{{sfn|Heather|2009|pp=151\u2013153}}\n\n===Gothic Language===\n{{Main|Gothic language}}\nThe Ostrogoths in Italy used the Gothic language, which is best attested today in the surviving translation of the Bible by the Visigothic bishop [[Ulfilas]]. While none of the eastern Germanic languages are still spoken, Gothic is the only one with \"continuous texts\" remaining.

Among other Gothic group names however, they are associated with the Greuthungi. Scholarly opinions are various. Historian [[Herwig Wolfram]] sees these as two names for one people as will be discussed below. [[Peter Heather]], in contrast, has written that: \n<blockquote>Ostrogoths in the sense of the group led by Theoderic to Italy stand at the end of complex processes of fragmentation and unification involving a variety of groups - mostly but not solely Gothic it seems - and the better, more contemporary, evidence argues against the implication derived from Jordanes that Ostrogoths are Greuthungi by another name.{{sfn|Heather|2007|p=404}}</blockquote>\n\nA dubious early mention of the Ostrogoths is sometimes mentioned in the ''Historia Augusta'' article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268\u2013270), where the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi ''austorgoti'' uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, ''Austrogoti'', Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\" (emphasis added). However this work is now known to have been made centuries later than the events it reports, and is not considered reliable.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first record of a Gothic sub-group acting in its own name, specifically the [[Tervingi]], was dated from 291.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24, fn52}}<ref>''[[Panegyrici Latini]]'' XI 17.1 (dated 291)</ref> The [[Greuthungi]], [[Vesi]], and Ostrogothi are all attested no earlier than 388.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=24}} The Ostrogoths were first definitely mentioned more than one hundred years later than the Tervingi in 399, in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting the land of [[Phrygia]] together, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways. The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian only uses the term Ostrogoth once, but in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch consul Eutropius. [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.{{efn|Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]; Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5].

Note Wolfram describes this as a poem to 392, though as Christensen and Cameron et al. note, it was written after the death of [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{harvtxt|Long|1996|loc=ch.5}}.}} It is generally believed by historians that this Phrygian settlement of Greuthingi, referred to as including Ostrogoths, were part of the Greuthungi-led force led by [[Odotheus]] in 386, and not the Greuthungi who had entered the empire earlier, in 376 under [[Alatheus and Saphrax]].{{sfn|Heather|1988|p=156}} In contrast, the [[Amal dynasty]], around whom the later and better-known Othogothic kingdom formed, were in neither of these groups who entered the Roman Empire in the 4th century, because into the 5th century they were Gothic leaders within [[Attila]]'s [[Hunnic Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nBased upon the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], whose ''[[Getica]]'' is a history of the Ostrogothic Amal dynasty, there is a tradition of simply equating the [[Greuthungi]] with the Ostrogothi.{{sfn|Heather|1996|pp=52\u201357, 300\u2013301}} Jordanes does not mention the Greuthungi, but he identified the Ostrogothic kings, the [[Amal dynasty]], including [[Theodoric the Great]], as the heirs and descendants of king [[Ermanaric]]. Ermanaric was described by the more reliable contemporary writer [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] as a king of the Greuthungi, however the family succession described by the two classical authors is completely in conflict, and Ammianus is considered to be the more reliable source.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pp=141\u2013157}} summarizes the field's position: \"There has never been any doubt that of these two conflicting accounts, the one by Ammianus Marcellinus was to be preferred\". Christensen especially cites {{harvtxt|Heather|1989}}.}}\n\nAccording to Jordanes' ''Getica'' (XVI), around 250 (the time of Emperor [[Philip the Arab]] who reigned 244\u2013249) the Ostrogoths were ruled by a king called [[Ostrogotha]] and they either derived their name from this \"father of the Ostrogoths\", or else the Ostrogoths and Visigoths got these names because they meant eastern and western Goths. Modern historians agree that Jordanes is unreliable, but some historians such as Herwig Wolfram believe that Jordanes was right to see continuity between the nobility of the Greuthungi and the later Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nWolfram argues that the terms Tervingi and Greuthungi were older geographical identifiers used by outsiders to describe these tribes before they crossed the Danube, and that this terminology dropped out of use after the Goths moved into the Roman empire, after about 400. In contrast, according to him, the terms \"Vesi\" and \"Ostrogothi\" were used by the peoples themselves to boastfully describe themselves, and thus remained in use. In support of this, Wolfram argues that it is significant that Roman writers either used terminology contrasting Tervingi and Greuthungi, or Vesi/Visigoths and Ostrogoths, and never mixed these pairs \u2014 for example they never contrasted Tervingi and Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}} For example, there are two examples of Roman texts which mix Wolfram's proposed geographical and boastful terminologies, but neither contrasts (supposedly) geographical and boastful terms. First, as mentioned above, Ostrogoths and Greuthungi were mentioned together by the poet Claudian, and secondly, all four names were used together in the unreliable ''[[Augustan History]]'' for the Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] which has \"''Gruthungi, Ostrogothi, Tervingi, Vesi''\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=202\u2013203}} As a second argument for this geographical versus boastful contrast, Wolfram cites [[Zosimus]] as referring to the group of \"Scythians\" north of the [[Danube]] after 376 who were called \"Greuthungi\" by the barbarians, arguing that these \"can only\" be Thervingi, and that this shows how the name \"Greuthungi\" was only used by outsiders.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=387, fn57}} However, as mentioned above, these Greuthungi mentioned by Zosimus are those who Heather and other historians equate to the rebellious Greuthungi mentioned later by Claudian in Phrygia in 399\u2013400, who were, according to Claudian, mixed with Ostrogoths.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn any case, the older terminology of a divided Gothic people disappeared gradually after they entered the Roman Empire. The term \"Visigoth\" was an invention of the sixth century. [[Cassiodorus]], a Roman in the service of Theodoric the Great, invented the term ''Visigothi'' to match ''Ostrogothi'', which terms he thought of as \"western Goths\" and \"eastern Goths\" respectively.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=25}} The western-eastern division was a simplification and a literary device of sixth-century historians where political realities were more complex.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} Furthermore, Cassiodorus used the term \"Goths\" to refer only to the Ostrogoths, whom he served, and reserved the geographical term \"Visigoths\" for the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gallo-Hispanic Goths]]. This usage, however, was adopted by the Visigoths themselves in their communications with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and was in use in the seventh century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}}\n\nOther names for the Goths abounded. A \"Germanic\" Byzantine or Italian author referred to one of the two peoples as the ''Valagothi'', meaning \"Roman [''[[walha]]''] Goths\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} In 484 the Ostrogoths had been called the ''Valameriaci'' (men of Valamir) because they followed Theodoric, a descendant of Valamir.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=26}} This terminology survived in the Byzantine East as late as the reign of [[Athalaric]], who was called ''\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039f\u03c5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5'' (''tou Oualemeriakou'') by [[John Malalas]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=389, fn67}}\n\n===Hunnic invasions and the Amals===\n{{Main|History of the Huns}}\nIn the late 4th century, the rise of the [[Huns]] forced many of the Goths and Alans to join them, while other moved westwards and eventually moved into Roman territory in the [[Balkans]]. Ostrogoths and Greuthungi, perhaps the same people, are believed to have been among the first Goths who were subdued by the Huns.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=55}}\n\nWhile many Greuthungi entered the Roman Empire in the 370s, apart from the Ostrogoths who were settled with Greuthungi in Phrygia in the 380s by the Romans, historical records only begin to mention the name of the Ostrogoths as the Gothic political entity which formed among some of the Goths who fought under [[Attila]] in the 5th century. This Ostrogothic kingdom began to coalesce around the leadership of the [[Amal dynasty]]. The Ostrogoths thus fought alongside both Alans and Huns.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=177}} Like several other tribal peoples, they became one of the many Hunnic vassals fighting in Europe, as in the [[Battle of Chalons]] in 451, where the Huns were defeated by the Roman general Aetius, accompanied by a contingent of Alans, and Visigoths.{{sfn|Kim|2013|pp=75, 77}}{{efn|Jordanes' account of this battle certainly cannot be trusted as he wrongly attributes a good portion of the victory to the Goths, when it was the Alans who formed the \"backbone of Roman defences.\"{{sfn|Kim|2013|p=77}} }}\n\nJordanes, in his ''Getica'', which is about the history of the Amals, claimed that the Amals were already preeminent under Attila, and among the Goths before the Huns. Modern historians such as [[Peter Heather]] believe this is an exaggeration, and point out that there were at least three factions of Goths in Attila's forces.{{sfn|Heather|2009|p=222}}{{sfn|Heather|2007|pp=46\u201347, 72\u201373}}\n\nThe recorded history of the Ostrogoths as a political entity begins with their independence from the remains of the Hunnic Empire following the death of [[Attila the Hun]] in 453. The Ostrogoths under the Amal [[Valamir]] were among the peoples who were living in the [[Middle Danube]] region by this time, and whose freedom from domination by Attila's sons was confirmed by the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 454, which was led by the [[Gepids]]. It is unclear what role the Goths played in this battle, and after the battle many Goths entered Roman military service, while only some began to coalesce under the leadership of Valamir and his two brothers, Vidimir and [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], the father of [[Theodoric the Great]].{{sfn|Burns|1984|pp=52\u201353}} \n\nThese Amal-led Goths entered into relations with the Empire, and were settled on lands in [[Pannonia]], becoming ''foederati'' (federates) to the Byzantines.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} Their rule was marked by turmoil with hostile neighbors all around and the land they acquired between Vindobona (Vienna) and Sirmium ([[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was not well managed, a fact which rendered the Ostrogoths dependent upon Constantinople for subsidies.{{sfn|Todd|1999|p=178}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths followed a similar path in the Balkans to the Alaric-led Visigoths played the century before. They gained momentum by merging two large blocks of militarized Balkan peoples including many who had fought for the Roman Empire, the Pannonian and Thracian Goths; they had a difficult relationship with the Eastern Roman power; they were reinforced by smaller groups such as the [[Rugii]]; and then just as the West Goths had done before them, they passed from the East to the West.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Kingdom in Italy===\n{{History of Italy}}\n{{Main article|Ostrogothic Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Ostrogothic Kingdom.png|right|300px|thumb|Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy]]\n\nThe greatest of all Ostrogothic rulers, the future [[Theodoric the Great]] (whose Gothic name meant \"leader of the people\") of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (''Regnum Italiae'', \"Kingdom of Italy\"){{efn|See: http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cassiodorus/varia2.shtml Flavius Magnus Aurelius Cassiodorus Senator, ''Variae'', Lib.

His childhood was spent at [[Constantinople]] as a diplomatic [[hostage]], where he was carefully educated.{{sfn|Backman|2008|p=68}}  The early part of his life was taken up with various disputes, intrigues and wars within the [[Byzantine empire]], in which he had as his rival [[Theodoric Strabo]] of the [[Thracian Goths]], a distant relative of Theodoric the Great and son of [[Triarius]]. This older but lesser Theodoric seems to have been the chief, not the king, of that branch of the Ostrogoths that had settled within the Empire earlier.  Theodoric the Great, as he is sometimes distinguished, was sometimes the friend, sometimes the enemy, of the Empire.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=575}} In the former case he was clothed with various Roman titles and offices, as [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] and [[consul]]; but in all cases alike he remained the national Ostrogothic king.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Theodoric is also known for his attainment of support from the [[Catholic Church]] and on one occasion, he even helped resolve a disputed papal election.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|p=338}} During his reign, Theodoric, who was an [[Arianism|Arian]], allowed freedom of religion, which had not been done before. However, he did try to appease the [[Pope]] and tried to keep his alliance with the church strong. He saw the Pope as an authority not only in the church but also over Rome itself. His ability to work well with Italy's nobles, members of the Roman Senate, and the Catholic Church all helped facilitate his acceptance as the ruler of Italy.{{sfn|Frassetto|2003|pp=338\u2013339}}\n\nTheodoric sought to revive Roman culture and government and in doing so, profited the Italian people.{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=109}} It was in both characters together that he set out in 488, by commission from the [[Byzantine]] emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], to recover [[Italy]] from [[Odoacer]].

It was also at this time that Odoacer was killed by Theodoric's own hand.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|pp=575\u2013576}} Ostrogothic power was fully established over Italy, [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and the lands to the north of Italy. Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Bury|2000|p=178}} In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and [[Visigoths]] began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}} The two branches of the nation were soon brought closer together; after he was forced to become regent of the Visigothic kingdom of [[Toulouse]], the power of Theodoric was practically extended over a large part of [[Gaul]] and over nearly the whole of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Theodoric forged alliances with the Visigoths, Alamanni, Franks and Burgundians, some of which were accomplished through diplomatic marriages.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic dominion was once again as far-reaching and splendid as it was in the time of [[Ermanaric|Hermanaric]]; however it was now of a wholly different character. The dominion of Theodoric was not a [[barbarian]] but a [[civilization|civilized]] power. His twofold position ran through everything. He was at once king of the Goths and successor, though without any imperial titles, of the Western [[Roman emperor]]s.  The two nations, differing in manners, language and religion, lived side by side on the soil of Italy; each was ruled according to its own law, by the prince who was, in his two separate characters, the common sovereign of both.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}} Due to his ability to foster and leverage relations among the various Germanic kingdoms, the Byzantines began to fear Theodoric's power, which led to an alliance between the Byzantine emperor and the Frankish king, [[Clovis I]], a pact designed to counteract and ultimately overthrow the Ostrogoths. In some ways Theodoric may have been overly accommodating to both the Romans and other Gothic people as he placated Catholics and Arian Christians alike. Historian Herwig Wolfram suggests that Theodoric's efforts in trying to appease Latin and barbarian cultures in kind brought about the collapse of Ostrogothic predominance and also resulted in the \"end of Italy as the heartland of late antiquity.\"{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=332}} All the years of creating a protective perimeter around Italy were broken down by the Franco-Byzantine coalition.

The Ostrogothic king Theodoric stepped in as the guardian of his grandson [[Amalaric]],{{sfn|Larned|1895|p=134}} and preserved for him all his Iberian and a fragment of his Gallic dominion. Toulouse passed to the [[Franks]] but the Goths kept [[Narbonne]] and its district and [[Septimania]], which was the last part of Gaul held by the Goths, keeping the name of Gothia for many years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} While Theodoric lived, the Visigothic kingdom was practically united to his own dominion. He seems also to have claimed a kind of protectorate over the [[Germany|Germanic]] powers generally, and indeed to have practically exercised it, except in the case of the [[Franks]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} From 508\u2013511 under Theodoric's command, the Ostrogoths marched on Gaul as the Vandal king of Carthage and Clovis made concerted efforts to weaken his hold on the Visigoths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=220}} On the death of Theodoric in 526, the eastern and western Goths were once again divided.{{sfn|De Puy|1899|p=2865}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1997|p=225}} By the late 6th century, the Ostrogoths lost their political identity and assimilated into other Germanic tribes.{{sfn|Waldman|Mason|2006|p=576}}\n\n[[File:Theodoric's Palace - Sant'Apollinare Nuovo - Ravenna 2016 (crop).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Mosaic depicting the palace of Theodoric the Great in his palace chapel of [[San Apollinare Nuovo]]]]\n\nThe picture of Theodoric's rule is drawn for us in the state papers drawn up, in his name and in the names of his successors, by his Roman minister [[Cassiodorus]].

The few instances where they acted together after this time are as scattered and incidental as they were before. Amalaric succeeded to the Visigothic kingdom in Iberia and Septimania.

Launched on both land and sea, Justinian began his war of reconquest.{{sfn|Wolfram|1988|p=339}} In 535, he commissioned [[Belisarius]] to attack the Ostrogoths following the success he had in North Africa against the Vandals.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=500\u2013501}} It was Justinian's intention to recover Italy and Rome from the Goths.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=501}}  Belisarius quickly captured Sicily and then crossed into Italy, where he captured Naples and Rome in December of 536. Sometime during the spring of 537, the Goths marched on Rome with upwards of 100,000 men under the leadership of [[Witiges]] and laid siege to the city, albeit unsuccessfully. Despite outnumbering the Romans by a five-to-one margin, the Goths could not loose Belisarius from the former western capital of the Empire.{{sfn|Oman|1902|pp=89\u201390}} After recuperating from siege warfare, Belisarius marched north, taking Mediolanum ([[Milan]]) and the Ostrogoth capital of Ravenna in 540.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=502\u2013503}}\n\nWith the attack on Ravenna, Witiges and his men were trapped in the Ostrogothic capital. Belisarius proved more capable at [[siege warfare]] than his rival Witiges had been at Rome and the Ostrogoth ruler, who was also dealing with Frankish enemies, was forced to surrender, but not without terms. Belisarius refused to grant any concessions save unconditional surrender in view of the fact that Justinian wanted to make Witiges a vassal king in Trans-Padane Italy.{{sfn|Oman|1902|p=91}} This condition made for something of an impasse.\n\n[[File:Totila fa dstruggere la citt\u00e0 di Firenze.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Totila razes the walls of [[Florence]]: illumination from the Chigi manuscript of [[Giovanni Villani|Villani's ''Cronica'']]]]\n\nA faction of the Gothic nobility pointed out that their own king [[Witiges]], who had just lost, was something of a weakling and they would need a new one. [[Eraric]], the leader of the group, endorsed Belisarius and the rest of the kingdom agreed, so they offered him their crown.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=503}}  Belisarius was a soldier, not a statesman, and still loyal to Justinian. He made as if to accept the offer, rode to Ravenna to be crowned, and promptly arrested the leaders of the Goths and reclaimed their entire kingdom\u2014no halfway settlements\u2014for the Empire.

In 551, the Roman navy destroyed Totila's fleet and in 552 an overwhelming Byzantine force under [[Narses]] entered Italy from the north. Attempting to surprise the invading Byzantines, Totila gambled with his forces at [[Battle of Taginae|Taginaei]], where he was slain.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=504}} Broken but not yet defeated, the Ostrogoths made one final stand at Campania under a chief named Teia, but when he was also killed in battle at [[Nuceria]] they finally capitulated.

The nation had practically evaporated with Theodoric's death. The leadership of western Europe therefore passed by default to the Franks.  Consequently, Ostrogothic failure and Frankish success  were crucial for the development of [[early medieval Europe]], for Theodoric had made it \"his intention to restore the vigor of Roman government and Roman culture\".{{sfn|Cantor|1994|p=105\u2013107}} The chance of forming a national state in Italy by the union of Roman and Germanic elements, such as those that arose in Gaul, in Iberia, and in parts of Italy under Lombard rule, was thus lost. The failures of the barbarian kingdoms to maintain control of the regions they conquered were partly the result of leadership vacuums like those which resulted from the death of Theodoric (also the lack of male succession) and Totila but additionally as a consequence of political fragmentation amid the Germanic tribes as their loyalties wavered between their kin and their erstwhile enemies. Frankish entry onto the geopolitical map of Europe also bears into play:  had the Ostrogoths attained more military success against the Byzantines on the battlefield by combining the strength of other Germanic tribes, this could have changed the direction of Frankish loyalty.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|pp=505\u2013512}} Military success or defeat and political legitimacy were interrelated in barbarian society.{{sfn|Halsall|2007|p=512}}\n\nNevertheless, according to Roman historian [[Procopius of Caesarea]], the Ostrogothic population was allowed to live peacefully in Italy with their Rugian allies under Roman sovereignty. They later joined the Lombards during their conquest of Italy.{{efn|''De Bello Gothico'' IV 32, pp.&nbsp;241\u2013245; this reference stems from the pen of the Byzantine historian, Procopius, who accompanied Justinian's leading general, Belisarius, on his exploits between 527 and 540. This included the campaigns against the Ostrogoths, which is the subject of ''De Bello Gothico''.}}\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Orecchini ostrogoti.jpg|thumb|250px|Ostrogoth ear jewels, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\n\nSurviving Gothic writings in the [[Gothic language]] include the Bible of [[Ulfilas]] and other religious writings and fragments. In terms of Gothic legislation in [[Latin]], we have the [[edict of Theodoric]] from around the year 500, and the ''Variae'' of Cassiodorus, which may also pass as a collection of the state papers of Theodoric and his immediate successors. Among the Visigoths, written laws had already been put forth by [[Euric]]. Alaric II put forth a Breviarium of [[Roman law]] for his Roman subjects; but the great collection of Visigothic laws dates from the later days of the monarchy, being put forth by King [[Reccaswinth]] about 654. This code gave occasion to some well-known comments by Montesquieu and [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], and has been discussed by Savigny (''Geschichte des r\u00f6mischen Rechts'', ii. 65) and various other writers. They are printed in the ''Monumenta Germaniae, leges'', tome i. (1902).{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n \nAmid Gothic histories that remain, besides that of the frequently quoted Jordanes, there is the Gothic history of [[Isidore]], archbishop of [[Seville]], a special source of the history of the Visigothic kings down to [[Suinthila]] (621-631). But all the Latin and [[Greek language|Greek]] writers contemporary with the days of Gothic predominance also made their contributions. Not for special facts, but for a general estimate, no writer is more instructive than [[Salvian of Marseilles]] in the 5th century, whose work, ''De Gubernatione Dei'', is full of passages contrasting the vices of the Romans with the virtues of the \"barbarians\", especially of the Goths. In all such pictures one must allow a good deal for exaggeration both ways, but there must be a groundwork of truth. The chief virtues that the [[Roman Catholic]] [[presbyter]] praises in the Arian Goths are their chastity, their piety according to their own creed, their tolerance towards the Catholics under their rule, and their general good treatment of their Roman subjects. He even ventures to hope that such good people may be saved, notwithstanding their [[Christian heresy|heresy]]. This image must have had some basis in truth, but it is not very surprising that the later Visigoths of Iberia had fallen away from Salvian's somewhat idealistic picture.{{sfn|Chisholm|1910|p=275}}\n\n==6th century Scandinavian Ostrogoths (Jordanes)==\n[[File:Scandza.PNG|thumb|right|Possible map of [[Scandza]] based on [[Jordanes]]' work]]\nJordanes named a people called the Ostrogoths (''Ostrogothae'') in a list of many peoples living on the large island of \"Scandza\", north of the mouth of the [[Vistula]], which most modern scholars understand to refer to the Scandinavian peninsula. The implication was that these Ostrogoths were living there in the 6th century, during the same period when there was a powerful Ostrogothic kingdom in Italy. On the other hand, scholars have come to no consensus about when the list was made, and by whom, nor how to interpret most of the names in the list. Arne S\u00f8by Christensen, in his detailed analysis lists three possibilities:{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pp=250\u2013299}}\n*that Jordanes believed some Ostrogoths had emigrated north, or...\n*that a similar name \"Eastern Goths\" had been coined in Scandinavia, where there were a people with the related name, the [[Gauts]], or...\n*that a source of Jordanes, for example Cassiodorus, had created this form of the name, perhaps having heard of the Gauts.\n\nThere is some degree of surety among scholars that Jordanes penned the Sandza origin story based on oral tales, and so his efforts were undertaken to provide legitimacy to the stories, since Jordanes likely valued written over oral sources.{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|pp=52\u201353}}{{efn|Like the Scandza origins' tale, oral stories provided the framework for the genealogy of the Amal kings that Jordanes recorded.{{sfn|Ghosh|2015|p=53\u201354}} }}\n\n==Ostrogothic rulers==\n===Amal dynasty===\n* [[Valamir]]  r. 447 &ndash; c. 465 succeeded by his brother...\n* [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]] r. c. 465 &ndash; 475 succeeded by his son...\n* [[Theodoric the Great]]  r. 475\u2013526 succeeded by his grandson...\n* [[Athalaric]] r. 526\u2013534 succeeded by his mother...\n* [[Amalasuntha]], r. 534-535 the daughter of Theoderic, succeeded by her first cousin...\n* [[Theodahad]] r. 535\u2013536 the son of Theoderic's sister.\n\n===Later kings===\n* [[Witiges]] r. 536\u2013540\n* [[Ildibad]] r. 540\u2013541\n* [[Eraric]] r. 541\n* [[Totila]] (also ''Baduila'') r. 541\u2013552  \n* [[Teia|Theia]] (also ''Teia(s)'', ''Teja'')  r. 552\u2013553\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Germanic culture}}\n* [[List of Germanic tribes]]\n* [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]\n* [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)]]\n* [[Chernyakhov culture]]\n* [[Oium]]\n* [[Wielbark culture]]\n\n== References ==\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* [[Patrick Amory|Amory, Patrick]].

During his tenure, on November 26, 1837, the church building was completely destroyed by fire. The congregation took temporary quarters until May 2, 1839, when their new church, which they called '''Church of the Messiah''', opened for worship at 728\u201330 [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], opposite [[Waverly Place]].{{r|Dewey|Greenleaf|Perris}}\n\nIn January 1865 that church was sold to department store magnate [[A. T. Stewart]] and converted into a theater, which subsequently operated under a series of names, including '''Globe Theatre''', and ending with [[New Theatre Comique]]. It burned down in 1884.{{r|Brown|Greenleaf|Dunlap|p3=48}}\n\n==34th Street==\nThe congregation's third church, on 34th Street at the northwest corner of [[Park Avenue|Fourth (Park) Avenue]], was inaugurated in 1867. It was designed in [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Victorian Romanesque]] style by [[Carl Pfeiffer (architect)|Carl Pfeiffer]].{{r|Dunlap|p=48}}\n\nOn May 25, 1919, Rev. [[John Haynes Holmes]], minister from 1907 to 1949,{{r|CCNY}} announced the church's change of name to Community Church of New York. He explained:\n\n<blockquote>I have left Unitarianism, cut myself off from all denominational connections of every kind, that I may preach a universal, humanistic religion which knows no bounds of any kind, not even Christianity. We have \u2026 placed the support of the church on the \u2026 basis of free voluntary subscriptions. We have rewritten our covenant, eliminating every last vestige of theology, thus relegating all matters of belief to private individual opinion. \u2026 [Any person] is welcome to our church, whether he be rich or poor, black or white, Christian, Jew, Hindu, or Parsee.{{r|NYT-1}}</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[New Theatre Comique]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n*<ref name=Brown>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/ldpd_6864656_002/page/n391/mode/2up |title=A History of the New York Stage: From the First Performance in 1732 to 1901 |volume=II |last=Brown |first=Thomas Allston |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company |place=New York |year=1903 |pages=376\u201398}}</ref>\n*<ref name=CCNY>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ccny.org/earlyyears |website=The Community Church of New York |title=The Early Years |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130731134307/http://www.ccny.org/earlyyears |archive-date=July 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n*<ref name=Dewey>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924029480203/page/n11/mode/2up |title=Autobiography and Letters of Orville Dewey, D.

He can also be heard as the Speaker in [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'', in a 1979 live performance with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n==Career==\nKlemperer's first major film role was as a psychiatrist in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956). He played a German government officer in the 1959 episode, \"The Haunted U-Boat\", of the series ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]].''

The film presents a fictionalized account of the post-World War II [[Nuremberg trials]], with Klemperer portraying Emil Hahn, a Nazi prosecutor and one of the defendants at the trial. Prior to this, he had a small role in the 1957 [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[Istanbul (film)|Istanbul]]'' and a pivotal part in the \"Comstock Conspiracy\" episode of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' that same year.

Klemperer, conscious that he would be playing the role of a German officer during the Nazi regime, accepted  the part only on the condition that Klink would be portrayed as a fool who never succeeded. According to co-star [[Richard Dawson]], Klemperer supplied his own uniforms. When Klemperer's father, the famous conductor [[Otto Klemperer]], saw his first episode of ''Hogan's Heroes'', he said to his son, \"Your work is good, but who is the author of this material?\" In addition to the character's bumblings, Klink was also remembered for his excruciatingly bad  violin playing. For his performance as Klink, Klemperer received six [[Emmy Award]] nominations for best supporting actor, winning successive awards in 1968 and 1969.\n\nKlemperer made a [[cameo appearance]] in character as Klink in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episode \"[[List of Batman television episodes#Season 2: 1966\u201367|It's How You Play the Game]]\" and as Officer Bolix in the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode \"[[List of Lost in Space episodes|All That Glitters]]\" in 1966. He played a bumbling East German official in the 1968 American comedy film ''[[The Wicked Dreams of Paula Schultz]]'', directed by George Marshall and starring [[Elke Sommer]] and several of his costars from ''Hogan's Heroes'', including [[Bob Crane]] and [[John Banner]]. Klemperer later starred in ''[[Wake Me When the War Is Over]]'' in 1969, playing the role of a German major, Erich Mueller, alongside [[Eva Gabor]]. He also played a villain in an episode of ''[[Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (TV series)|Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea]]'' titled \"The Blizzard Makers\".\n\nAfter ''Hogan's Heroes'' ended in 1971, Klemperer continued his career in stage and film roles and guest-starring roles on television. In 1987, he portrayed Herr Schultz in the Broadway revival of ''[[Cabaret (musical)#1987 Broadway revival|Cabaret]]''. The role earned Klemperer a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical|Best Featured Actor]] [[Tony Award]] nomination.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter his father's death in 1973, Klemperer expanded his acting career with musical roles in [[opera]] and Broadway [[musical theatre|musicals]]. He earned a [[Tony Award]] nomination for his performance in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' in its 1987 Broadway revival. A member of the board of directors of the [[New York Chamber Symphony]], Klemperer served as a narrator with many other American symphony orchestras including the Cincinnati Chamber Orchestra. He also made occasional guest appearances on television dramas, and took part in a few studio recordings, notably a version of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' with the [[Boston Symphony]] and [[Seiji Ozawa]], in 1979. From 1979 to 1982, he appeared as Bassa Selim in 18 performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Singspiel]]'' ''[[Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York.<ref>[http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/scripts/cgiip.exe/WService=BibSpeed/bowse3a.w?term=Die%20Entf%FChrung%20aus%20dem%20Serail%3A%20Selim%20%5BKlemperer,%20Werner%5D&typ=Subject&x=0&xHomePath=http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/&xHome=http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/bibpro.htm \"Werner Klemperer\"], Metropolitan Opera Archives</ref> In 1981, he appeared, to critical and audience raves, as Prince Orlofsky in Seattle Opera's production of ''[[Die Fledermaus]]''. In 1990, he narrated the children's story \"Gerald McBoing Boing\" (music by Gail Kubik) for a CD of classical music for children.

Werner Klemperer began acting in high school and enrolled in acting courses at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]<ref name=nyt /> before joining the [[United States Army]] to serve in [[World War II]]. While stationed in Hawaii, he joined the Army's [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] unit, spending the next years touring the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] entertaining the troops. At the war's end, he performed on Broadway before moving into television acting.\n\nHe broadened his acting career by performing as an operatic [[baritone]] and a singer in Broadway musicals.  He can also be heard as the Speaker in [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'', in a 1979 live performance with the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]].\n\n==Career==\nKlemperer's first major film role was as a psychiatrist in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Wrong Man]]'' (1956). He played a German government officer in the 1959 episode, \"The Haunted U-Boat\", of the series ''[[Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond|One Step Beyond]].'' Also in 1959, he appeared as a Frenchman in the episode \"Fragile\" of the Western TV series ''[[Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|tt0597519|Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel|(S03E07)}}</ref> He received significant notice for his role in the award-winning 1961 film ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''. The film presents a fictionalized account of the post-World War II [[Nuremberg trials]], with Klemperer portraying Emil Hahn, a Nazi prosecutor and one of the defendants at the trial. Prior to this, he had a small role in the 1957 [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[Istanbul (film)|Istanbul]]'' and a pivotal part in the \"Comstock Conspiracy\" episode of ''[[Maverick (TV series)|Maverick]]'' that same year. He played the title role in the 1961 film ''[[Operation Eichmann (1961 film)|Operation Eichmann]]''. He guest-starred in the first [[Brian Keith]] television series, ''[[Crusader (TV series)|Crusader]]'', a [[Cold War]] drama that aired on CBS.  During this time, he made three guest appearances on ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'':  he played East German murder victim Stefan Riker in the 1958 episode \"The Case of the Desperate Daughter\"; the East European character Ulrik Zenas in the 1963 episode \"The Case of the Two-Faced Turn-a-bout\"; and German Swiss Police Inspector Hurt in 1964 in \"The Case of a Place Called Midnight\".  In 1963, Klemperer also portrayed a professor of psychology in \"The Dream Book\", an episode on the [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[My Three Sons]]''.<ref>[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/my-three-sons/episode-20-season-3/the-dream-book/100316/ \"The Dream Book\"], S03E20, ''My Three Sons'', originally broadcast January 31, 1963.

Klemperer, conscious that he would be playing the role of a German officer during the Nazi regime, accepted  the part only on the condition that Klink would be portrayed as a fool who never succeeded. According to co-star [[Richard Dawson]], Klemperer supplied his own uniforms. When Klemperer's father, the famous conductor [[Otto Klemperer]], saw his first episode of ''Hogan's Heroes'', he said to his son, \"Your work is good, but who is the author of this material?\" In addition to the character's bumblings, Klink was also remembered for his excruciatingly bad  violin playing. For his performance as Klink, Klemperer received six [[Emmy Award]] nominations for best supporting actor, winning successive awards in 1968 and 1969.\n\nKlemperer made a [[cameo appearance]] in character as Klink in the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' episode \"[[List of Batman television episodes#Season 2: 1966\u201367|It's How You Play the Game]]\" and as Officer Bolix in the ''[[Lost in Space]]'' episode \"[[List of Lost in Space episodes|All That Glitters]]\" in 1966.

This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of [[Argininosuccinic acid|argininosuccinate]] that is synthesized, one molecule of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) is hydrolyzed to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.\n\nCitrulline can be derived from multiple sources:\n* from arginine itself via [[nitric oxide synthase]], as a byproduct of the production of nitric oxide for [[Second messenger system|signaling]] purposes\n* from [[ornithine]] through the breakdown of [[proline]] or [[glutamine]]/[[glutamate]]\n* from [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]] via DDAH\n\nThe pathways linking arginine, [[glutamine]], and [[proline]] are bidirectional. Thus, the net use or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage.\n\nOn a whole-body basis, synthesis of arginine occurs principally via the intestinal\u2013renal axis: the [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[small intestine]] produce citrulline, primarily from [[glutamine]] and [[glutamate]], which is carried in the bloodstream to the [[proximal tubule cell]]s of the [[kidney]], which extract citrulline from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the circulation. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis, increasing the dietary requirement.\n\nSynthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible NOS]]. This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, NO synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in NO-producing cells along with [[nitrate]] and [[nitrite]], the stable end-products of NO breakdown.<ref name=\"pmid15465778\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morris SM | title = Enzymes of arginine metabolism | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 10 Suppl | pages = 2743S\u20132747S; discussion 2765S\u20132767S | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15465778 | doi = 10.1093/jn/134.10.2743S | department = (review) | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n== Function ==\nArginine plays an important role in [[cell division]], [[wound healing]], removing ammonia from the body, [[immune function]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3rCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|title=The Metabolic Challenges of Immune Cells in Health and Disease|last=Mauro|first=Claudio|last2=Frezza|first2=Christian| name-list-format = vanc |date=2015-07-13|publisher=Frontiers Media SA|isbn=9782889196227|location=|pages=17|language=en}}</ref> and the release of hormones.<ref name=\"tapiero\"/><ref name=\"stechmiller\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stechmiller JK, Childress B, Cowan L | title = Arginine supplementation and wound healing | journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201361 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 16207646 | doi = 10.1177/011542650502000152 | department = (review) }}</ref><ref name=\"witte\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Witte MB, Barbul A | title = Arginine physiology and its implication for wound healing | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 419\u201323 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14617280 | doi = 10.1046/j.1524-475X.2003.11605.x | department = (review) }}</ref> It is a precursor for the synthesis of [[nitric oxide]] (NO),<ref name=\"pmid10690324\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrew PJ, Mayer B | title = Enzymatic function of nitric oxide synthases | journal = Cardiovascular Research | volume = 43 | issue = 3 | pages = 521\u201331 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10690324 | doi = 10.1016/S0008-6363(99)00115-7 | department = (review) | doi-access = free }}</ref> making it important in the regulation of [[blood pressure]].<ref name=\"pmid15465790\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gokce N | title = L-arginine and hypertension | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 10 Suppl | pages = 2807S\u20132811S; discussion 2818S\u20132819S | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15465790 | doi = 10.1093/jn/134.10.2807S | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid18981330\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rajapakse NW, De Miguel C, Das S, Mattson DL | title = Exogenous L-arginine ameliorates angiotensin II-induced hypertension and renal damage in rats | journal = Hypertension | volume = 52 | issue = 6 | pages = 1084\u201390 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18981330 | pmc = 2680209 | doi = 10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.114298 | department = (primary) }}</ref><ref name=\"Dong_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dong JY, Qin LQ, Zhang Z, Zhao Y, Wang J, Arigoni F, Zhang W | title = Effect of oral L-arginine supplementation on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials | journal = American Heart Journal | volume = 162 | issue = 6 | pages = 959\u201365 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22137067 | doi = 10.1016/j.ahj.2011.09.012 | department = review }}</ref>\n\n===Proteins===\nArginine's side chain is [[Amphiphile|amphipathic]], because at physiological pH it contains a positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, at the end of a hydrophobic [[Aliphatic compound|aliphatic]] hydrocarbon chain.

This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of [[Argininosuccinic acid|argininosuccinate]] that is synthesized, one molecule of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) is hydrolyzed to [[adenosine monophosphate]] (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents.\n\nCitrulline can be derived from multiple sources:\n* from arginine itself via [[nitric oxide synthase]], as a byproduct of the production of nitric oxide for [[Second messenger system|signaling]] purposes\n* from [[ornithine]] through the breakdown of [[proline]] or [[glutamine]]/[[glutamate]]\n* from [[asymmetric dimethylarginine]] via DDAH\n\nThe pathways linking arginine, [[glutamine]], and [[proline]] are bidirectional. Thus, the net use or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage.\n\nOn a whole-body basis, synthesis of arginine occurs principally via the intestinal\u2013renal axis: the [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[small intestine]] produce citrulline, primarily from [[glutamine]] and [[glutamate]], which is carried in the bloodstream to the [[proximal tubule cell]]s of the [[kidney]], which extract citrulline from the circulation and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the circulation. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis, increasing the dietary requirement.\n\nSynthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible NOS]]. This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline-NO or arginine-citrulline pathway.

Despite this, the biological basis of schizophrenia is still poorly understood, a number of factors, such as dopamine hyperfunction, glutamatergic hypofunction, GABAergic deficits, cholinergic system dysfunction, stress vulnerability and neurodevelopmental disruption, have been linked to the aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the disease.<ref>Altered brain arginine metabolism in schizophrenia.
