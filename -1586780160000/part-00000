A descendant of [[Danish people|Danes]], he was taken sailing by his grandfather at the age of five years on the [[sailboat]] ''Aileen'', of the 6 meter class, which was the boat used by the silver medal winning [[1912 Summer Olympics]] Danish sailing team. Once he moved to [[Niter\u00f3i]], he started sailing with his brother, [[Lars Grael]], also an Olympic medal winner, on the [[Bay of Guanabara]]. He is father of olympic champion [[Martine Grael]].\n\n==Record==\nNicknamed [[Turbine]] for his fame in conducting sailboats, he collected five Olympic medals, four of them in the Star class.\n\nHe is the Brazilian with the highest number of Olympic medals, and holds the highest number of Olympic medals in sailing together with [[Ben Ainslie]] and [[Robert Scheidt]] with five, followed by [[Paul Bert Elvstr\u00f8m|Paul Elvstr\u00f8m]] with four. He also placed first place in many World, South American and Brazilian championships in several categories. His first-mate is usually [[Marcelo Ferreira]].\n\nGrael has also sailed in other international competitions including the [[2005\u201306 Volvo Ocean Race]] as skipper of the ''Brasil 1'' team, the first 100% Brazilian outfit to enter the competition, which finished third overall. He would win the next [[2008\u201309 Volvo Ocean Race|Ocean Race]], but this time as the skipper of the Swedish team ''Ericsson 4'' (he won the race with two legs to spare). In October 2008 the yacht Ericsson 4 officially travelled 596.6 nautical miles in 24 hours, establishing a 24-hour monohull record. Skipper Torben Grael and his crew made the record on the first leg of the 2008\u20132009 Volvo Ocean Race. They sailed Ericsson 4 hard as a strong cold front hit the fleet, bringing winds approaching 40 knots, and propelling the yacht at an average speed of 24.8 knots.\n\nHe has sailed in several [[America's Cup]] races, including the winning campaign in Louis Vuitton Cup in 2000 and the 2007 event as tactician aboard [[Luna Rossa Challenge]]<ref>http://torben-grael.com/results.php</ref>\n\n==Results \u2013 Dinghy Sailing ==\n\n===International===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.<ref name=\"Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age\" />\n\nAlthough nearly all users understand that the Slender Man is not real, they suspend that disbelief in order to become more engrossed when telling or listening to stories.<ref name=\"\u201cThe sort of story that has you covering your mirrors\u201d:The Case of Slender Man\"/> This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend [[dialectic]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Ellis |first=Bill |date=2001 |title=Aliens, Ghosts, and Cults: Legends We Live |location=Jackson |publisher=University Press of Mississippi}}</ref> This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose.

Shira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the fact that the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form.<ref name=taylor/> Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).<ref name=shirachess2/>\n\nAndrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite the lack of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.<ref name=\"Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age\">{{cite journal |last = Peck|first = Andrew |date = 2015 |title = Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age | journal=Journal of American Folklore | volume=128 | issue=509 |pages=333\u2013348|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.128.509.0333}}</ref>\n\nJeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it represents a process he calls \u201creverse ostension.\u201d [[Ostension]] in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of \u201ctraditional\u201d narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).<ref name=\"\u201cThe sort of story that has you covering your mirrors\u201d:The Case of Slender Man\">{{cite journal |last = Tolbert |first = Jeffrey A. |date = 2013 |title = The sort of story that has you covering your mirrors\":The Case of Slender Man |url = http://www.semioticreview.com/pdf/monsters/tolbert_slenderman.pdf |journal = Semiotic Review |issue = 2 |access-date = 13 July 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074358/http://www.semioticreview.com/pdf/monsters/tolbert_slenderman.pdf |archivedate = 10 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nProfessor Thomas Pettitt of the [[University of Southern Denmark]] has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age's closing of the \"[[Secondary orality|Gutenberg Parenthesis]]\"; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of storytelling, exemplified by [[oral tradition]] and [[campfire]] tales, in which the same story can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, allowing the lore to expand and evolve with time.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n==Copyright==\nDespite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the [[public domain]]. Several for-profit ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television.

Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community.

Shira Chess argues that the Slender Man exemplifies the similarities between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, the fact that the Slender Man's mythos can be tracked and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form.<ref name=taylor/> Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).<ref name=shirachess2/>\n\nAndrew Peck also considers the Slender Man to be an authentic form of folklore and notes its similarity to emergent forms of offline legend performance. Peck suggests that digital folklore performance extends the dynamics of face-to-face performance in several notable ways, such as by occurring asynchronously, encouraging imitation and personalization while also allowing perfect replication, combining elements of oral, written, and visual communication, and generating shared expectations for performance that enact group identity despite the lack of a physically present group. He concludes that the Slender Man represents a digital legend cycle that combines the generic conventions and emergent qualities of oral and visual performance with the collaborative potential of networked communication.<ref name=\"Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age\">{{cite journal |last = Peck|first = Andrew |date = 2015 |title = Tall, Dark, and Loathsome: The Emergence of a Legend Cycle in the Digital Age | journal=Journal of American Folklore | volume=128 | issue=509 |pages=333\u2013348|doi=10.5406/jamerfolk.128.509.0333}}</ref>\n\nJeff Tolbert also accepts the Slender Man as folkloric and suggests it represents a process he calls \u201creverse ostension.\u201d [[Ostension]] in folkloristics is the process of acting out a folk narrative. According to Tolbert, the Slender Man does the opposite by creating a set of folklore-like narratives where none existed before. It is an iconic figure produced through a collective effort and deliberately modeled after an existing and familiar folklore genre. According to Tolbert, this represents two processes in one: it involves the creation of new objects and new disconnected examples of experience, and it involves the combination of these elements into a body of \u201ctraditional\u201d narratives, modeled on existing folklore (but not wholly indebted to any specific tradition).<ref name=\"\u201cThe sort of story that has you covering your mirrors\u201d:The Case of Slender Man\">{{cite journal |last = Tolbert |first = Jeffrey A. |date = 2013 |title = The sort of story that has you covering your mirrors\":The Case of Slender Man |url = http://www.semioticreview.com/pdf/monsters/tolbert_slenderman.pdf |journal = Semiotic Review |issue = 2 |access-date = 13 July 2015 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151010074358/http://www.semioticreview.com/pdf/monsters/tolbert_slenderman.pdf |archivedate = 10 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\nProfessor Thomas Pettitt of the [[University of Southern Denmark]] has described the Slender Man as being an exemplar of the modern age's closing of the \"[[Secondary orality|Gutenberg Parenthesis]]\"; the time period from the invention of the printing press to the spread of the web in which stories and information were codified in discrete media, to a return to the older, more primal forms of storytelling, exemplified by [[oral tradition]] and [[campfire]] tales, in which the same story can be retold, reinterpreted and recast by different tellers, allowing the lore to expand and evolve with time.<ref name=bbc/>\n\n==Copyright==\nDespite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man is not in the [[public domain]]. Several for-profit ventures involving the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television.
