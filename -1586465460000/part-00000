It is a part of the [[East End of London|East End]] of London, {{convert|3.4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]]. It was part of the ancient parish of [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], Middlesex. It was split off as a separate parish in the 14th century. It became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Greater London]] in 1965. Because the area is close to the [[London Docklands]] and east of the [[City of London]], it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class.\n\nThe area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century, and the location of the infamous 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were attributed to the mysterious [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, Whitechapel became a significant settlement for the [[British Bangladeshi]] community, and has the [[Royal London Hospital]] and [[East London Mosque]].\n\n==History==\n===Before the 19th century===\n[[File:Whitechapel High Street 1905.JPG|thumb|Whitechapel High Street in 1905]]\n[[File:Stepney Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Whitechapel wards of Stepney Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nWhitechapel's heart is [[Whitechapel High Street]], extending further east as [[Whitechapel Road]], named after a small [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St Mary]]. The church's earliest known rector was Hugh de Fulbourne in 1329. Around 1338, it became the parish church of Whitechapel, called, for unknown reasons, [[St Mary Matfelon]]. The church was severely damaged during the Blitz and demolished in 1952, and its location and graveyard is now a [[Altab Ali Park|public garden]] on the south side of the road.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\">Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (eds) (1983) \"Whitechapel\" in ''The London Encyclopaedia'': 955-6</ref><ref>Andrew Davies (1990)''The East End Nobody Knows'': 15\u201316</ref>\n\nWhitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are now part of the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11 road]], anciently the initial part of the [[Roman road]] between the [[City of London]] and [[Colchester]], exiting the city at [[Aldgate]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22732 'Stepney: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 7\u201313] accessed: 9 March 2007</ref> In later times, travellers to and from London on this route were accommodated at the many [[coaching inns]] which lined Whitechapel High Street.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\"/>\n\nBy the late 16th century, the suburb of Whitechapel and the surrounding area had started becoming 'the other half' of London. Located east of [[Aldgate]], outside the [[London Wall|City Walls]] and beyond official controls, it attracted the less fragrant activities of the city, particularly tanneries, breweries, foundries (including the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], which later cast [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Liberty Bell]] and London's [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]) and [[slaughterhouse]]s.\n\nIn 1680, the Rector of Whitechapel, [[Ralph Davenant]], of the parish of St Mary Matfelon, bequeathed a legacy for the education of forty boys and thirty girls of the parish; the [[Davenant Centre]] is still in existence although the [[Davenant Foundation School]] moved from Whitechapel to [[Loughton]] in 1966.\n\nPopulation shifts from rural areas to London from the 17th century to the mid-19th century resulted in great numbers of more or less destitute people taking up residence amidst the industries and mercantile interests that had attracted them.\n\nIn 1797, the body of the sailor [[Richard Parker (sailor)|Richard Parker]], hanged for his leading role in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Nore mutiny]], was given a Christian burial at Whitechapel after his wife [[exhume]]d it from the unconsecrated burial ground to which it was originally consigned. Crowds gathered to see the body before it was buried.\n\n===19th century===\nBy the 1840s, Whitechapel, along with the enclaves of [[Wapping]], [[Aldgate]], [[Bethnal Green]], [[Mile End]], [[Limehouse]], [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Bromley-by-Bow]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Shadwell]] and [[Stepney]] (collectively known today as \"the [[East End of London|East End]]\"), had evolved into classic ''\"[[Dickensian]]\"'' London, with problems of poverty and overcrowding. Whitechapel Road itself was not particularly squalid through most of this period; it was the warrens of small dark streets branching from it that contained the greatest suffering, filth and danger, such as [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] (now a private alley but once described as \"the worst street in London\"<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/victorian_london/the-worst-street-in-london.html ''Ripper Casebook: 1901 The Worst Street in London''] accessed 5 May 2007</ref>), Thrawl Street, Berners Street (renamed [[Henriques Street]]), Wentworth Street, and others.\n\n[[William Booth]] began his ''Christian Revival Society'', preaching the gospel in a tent, erected in the ''Friends Burial Ground'', Thomas Street, Whitechapel, in 1865. Others joined his ''Christian Mission'', and on 7 August 1878 the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army 1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army] accessed 15 February 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525050352/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london/attractions/whitechapel-road/a/poi-sig/1278840/358914</ref>\n\n[[File:Commercial Road booth map.jpg|thumb|left|Part of [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s [[poverty map]] showing Commercial Road in Whitechapel 1889.

Writing of the period 1883\u20131884, [[Yiddish theatre]] actor [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] wrote, \"The further we penetrated into this Whitechapel, the more our hearts sank. Was this London? Never in Russia, never later in the worst slums of New York, were we to see such poverty as in the London of the 1880s.\"<ref>Jacob Adler, ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0679413510}}. p. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nThis endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888 the [[Metropolitan Police]] estimated that there were 1,200 prostitutes \"of very low class\" resident in Whitechapel and about 62 brothels.<ref>Donald Rumbelow (2004) ''The Complete Jack the Ripper'': 12. Penguin</ref> Reference is specifically made to them in [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s ''[[Life and Labour of the People in London]]'', specially to dwellings called [[Blackwall Buildings]] belonging to Blackwall Railway. Such prostitutes were numbered amongst the 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were committed by the legendary serial killer known as '[[Jack the Ripper]]'.

Then Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] took over the operation where his presence caused a political row over the level of his involvement during the time. His biographers disagreed and said he gave no operational commands to the police,{{sfn|Addison|2014}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2012|p=195}} but a Metropolitan Police account states that the events of Sidney Street were \"a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions\".{{efn|Subsequent stories that a bullet passed through Churchill's top hat are apocryphal, and no reference to such an occurrence appears in either the official records, or Churchill's accounts of the siege.{{sfn|Waldren|2013|p=11}}}}\n\nThe [[Freedom Press]], a socialist publishing house, thought it worthwhile to explore conditions in the leading city of the nation that had invented modern capitalism. He concluded that English poverty was far rougher than the American variety. The juxtaposition of the poverty, homelessness, exploitive work conditions, prostitution, and infant mortality of Whitechapel and other East End locales with some of the greatest personal wealth the world has ever seen made it a focal point for leftist reformers and revolutionaries of all kinds, from [[George Bernard Shaw]], whose [[Fabian Society]] met regularly in Whitechapel, to [[Vladimir Lenin]], led rallies in Whitechapel during his exile from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/first-thursdays/galleries/first-thursday-gallery-46/|title=First Thursday GALLERY 46|website=Whitechapelgallery.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> The area is still home to Freedom Press, the anarchist publishing house founded by [[Charlotte Wilson]].\n\nIn Sunday 4 October 1936, the [[British Union of Fascists]] led by [[Oswald Mosley]] clashed in the East End including a part of southern Whitechapel on [[Cable Street]] with various [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] demonstrators, including local [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Communism|communist]] groups during the [[Battle of Cable Street]] where Mosley planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in uniforms styled on those of [[Blackshirts]] through the East End, which then had a large [[Jews|Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15171772|title=Cable Street: 'Solidarity stopped Mosley's fascists'|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhitechapel remained poor (and colourful) through the first half of the 20th century, though somewhat less desperately so. It suffered great damage in [[the Blitz]] and from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[V-weapons|V-weapon]] attacks of [[World War II]]. Since then, Whitechapel has lost most of its notoriety.\n\n[[Altab Ali]] was murdered by three teenagers on 4 May 1978 in a racist attack as he walked home after work. His murder took place at St Mary's Gardens by St Mary's Churchyard, the reaction provoked the mass mobilisation of the Bengali community locally and came to represent the self-organisation of the community.

[[Charles Dickens, Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: \"A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons.

Probably the area's most prominent art venue is the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]], founded in 1901 and long an outpost of high culture in a poor neighbourhood. As the neighbourhood has gentrified, it has gained citywide, and even international, visibility and support. From 2005 the gallery underwent a major expansion, with the support of \u00a33.26&nbsp;million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The expanded facility opened in 2009.\n\nWhitechapel in the early 21st century has figured prominently in London's punk rock/skuzz rock scene, with the main focal point for this scene being Whitechapel Factory and Rhythm Factory bar/restaurant/nightclub. This scene includes the likes of The Libertines, Zap!, [[Nova (Italian band)|Nova]], [[The Others (band)|The Others]], Razorlight, and The Rakes, all of whom have had some commercial success in the music charts.\n\nHome to centres such as London Action Resource Centre and rampART, Whitechapel is seen by many as a cultural hub for community based political activism particularly of an anti-[[authoritarian]], [[anti-war]] trend. The anarchist publishing house Freedom Press is nearby in Aldgate and one of the London chapters of Food Not Bombs serves regular meals in [[Altab Ali Park]] on Whitechapel High Street. Whitechapel Anarchist Group has also recently been formed and circulates a local freesheet called W.A.G. (Whitechapel Anarchist Group)\n\nIn the past Whitechapel has been home to such individuals as [[Rudolf Rocker]] (1873\u20131958), anarcho-syndicalist writer, historian and prominent activist who active in the area from 1895 to 1918. [[Charles Lahr]] (1885\u20131971), anarchist bookseller/publisher and secretary of Whitechapel branch of the Industrial Union of Direct Actionists (IUDA), was also a prominent figure resident in the area. Such individuals in history have helped form the culture of enthusiasm in political alternatives that is enjoyed in the community today.\n\n[[File:Whitechapel market.JPG|thumb|left|Whitechapel Street Market at night]]\n\n===Demographics===\nThe [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] are the most visible migrant group today, who make up 40% of the Whitechapel ward total population.<ref name=BanPop>{{NOMIS2011|id=1237320252|title=Whitechapel 2011 Census Ward|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> The [[East London Mosque]] at the end of Whitechapel Road is a major symbol of the resident Islamic community. The mosque group was established as early as 1910, and the demand for a mosque grew as the [[Sylhet]]i community grew rapidly over the years.\n\nIn 1985 this large, purpose built mosque with a dome and minaret was built in the heart of Whitechapel, attracting thousands of worshippers every week, and it was further expanded with the [[London Muslim Centre]] in 2004.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonmosque.org.uk/?page=history History of East London Mosque] East London Mosque & London Muslim Centre.

Several chapters of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s classic [[Yiddish]] novel ''[[Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son]]'' take place in early 20th-century Whitechapel, depicted from the point of view of an impoverished East European Jewish family fleeing the pogroms. The novel ''[[Journey Through a Small Planet]]'' by [[Emanuel Litvinoff]] vividly describes Whitechapel and its Jewish inhabitants in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe prostitute and daughter of a [[Luddite]] leader Sybil Gerard, main character of [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s novel [[The Difference Engine]] comes from Whitechapel. The novel's plot begins there.\n\n''Brick Lane'', the 2003 novel by [[Monica Ali]] is based in Whitechapel and documents the life of a young Bangladeshi woman's experience of living in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nWhitechapel is used as a location in most [[Jack the Ripper fiction]].

It is a part of the [[East End of London|East End]] of London, {{convert|3.4|mi|km|1}} east of [[Charing Cross]]. It was part of the ancient parish of [[Stepney (parish)|Stepney]], Middlesex. It was split off as a separate parish in the 14th century. It became part of the [[County of London]] in 1889 and [[Greater London]] in 1965. Because the area is close to the [[London Docklands]] and east of the [[City of London]], it has been a popular place for immigrants and the working class.\n\nThe area was the centre of the London Jewish community in the 19th and early 20th century, and the location of the infamous 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were attributed to the mysterious [[serial killer]] known as [[Jack the Ripper]]. In the latter half of the 20th century, Whitechapel became a significant settlement for the [[British Bangladeshi]] community, and has the [[Royal London Hospital]] and [[East London Mosque]].\n\n==History==\n===Before the 19th century===\n[[File:Whitechapel High Street 1905.JPG|thumb|Whitechapel High Street in 1905]]\n[[File:Stepney Met. B Ward Map 1916.svg|thumb|A map showing the Whitechapel wards of Stepney Metropolitan Borough as they appeared in 1916.]]\nWhitechapel's heart is [[Whitechapel High Street]], extending further east as [[Whitechapel Road]], named after a small [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[St Mary]]. The church's earliest known rector was Hugh de Fulbourne in 1329. Around 1338, it became the parish church of Whitechapel, called, for unknown reasons, [[St Mary Matfelon]]. The church was severely damaged during the Blitz and demolished in 1952, and its location and graveyard is now a [[Altab Ali Park|public garden]] on the south side of the road.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\">Ben Weinreb and Christopher Hibbert (eds) (1983) \"Whitechapel\" in ''The London Encyclopaedia'': 955-6</ref><ref>Andrew Davies (1990)''The East End Nobody Knows'': 15\u201316</ref>\n\nWhitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are now part of the [[A11 road (Great Britain)|A11 road]], anciently the initial part of the [[Roman road]] between the [[City of London]] and [[Colchester]], exiting the city at [[Aldgate]].<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22732 'Stepney: Communications', A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11: Stepney, Bethnal Green (1998), pp. 7\u201313] accessed: 9 March 2007</ref> In later times, travellers to and from London on this route were accommodated at the many [[coaching inns]] which lined Whitechapel High Street.<ref name=\"Christopher Hibbert 1983\"/>\n\nBy the late 16th century, the suburb of Whitechapel and the surrounding area had started becoming 'the other half' of London. Located east of [[Aldgate]], outside the [[London Wall|City Walls]] and beyond official controls, it attracted the less fragrant activities of the city, particularly tanneries, breweries, foundries (including the [[Whitechapel Bell Foundry]], which later cast [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Liberty Bell]] and London's [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]]) and [[slaughterhouse]]s.\n\nIn 1680, the Rector of Whitechapel, [[Ralph Davenant]], of the parish of St Mary Matfelon, bequeathed a legacy for the education of forty boys and thirty girls of the parish; the [[Davenant Centre]] is still in existence although the [[Davenant Foundation School]] moved from Whitechapel to [[Loughton]] in 1966.\n\nPopulation shifts from rural areas to London from the 17th century to the mid-19th century resulted in great numbers of more or less destitute people taking up residence amidst the industries and mercantile interests that had attracted them.\n\nIn 1797, the body of the sailor [[Richard Parker (sailor)|Richard Parker]], hanged for his leading role in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Nore mutiny]], was given a Christian burial at Whitechapel after his wife [[exhume]]d it from the unconsecrated burial ground to which it was originally consigned. Crowds gathered to see the body before it was buried.\n\n===19th century===\nBy the 1840s, Whitechapel, along with the enclaves of [[Wapping]], [[Aldgate]], [[Bethnal Green]], [[Mile End]], [[Limehouse]], [[Bow, London|Bow]], [[Bromley-by-Bow]], [[Poplar, London|Poplar]], [[Shadwell]] and [[Stepney]] (collectively known today as \"the [[East End of London|East End]]\"), had evolved into classic ''\"[[Dickensian]]\"'' London, with problems of poverty and overcrowding. Whitechapel Road itself was not particularly squalid through most of this period; it was the warrens of small dark streets branching from it that contained the greatest suffering, filth and danger, such as [[Dorset Street, London|Dorset Street]] (now a private alley but once described as \"the worst street in London\"<ref>[http://www.casebook.org/victorian_london/the-worst-street-in-london.html ''Ripper Casebook: 1901 The Worst Street in London''] accessed 5 May 2007</ref>), Thrawl Street, Berners Street (renamed [[Henriques Street]]), Wentworth Street, and others.\n\n[[William Booth]] began his ''Christian Revival Society'', preaching the gospel in a tent, erected in the ''Friends Burial Ground'', Thomas Street, Whitechapel, in 1865. Others joined his ''Christian Mission'', and on 7 August 1878 the [[Salvation Army]] was formed at a meeting held at 272 Whitechapel Road.<ref>[http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army 1878 Foundation Deed Of The Salvation Army] accessed 15 February 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525050352/http://www1.salvationarmy.org/heritage.nsf/titles/1878_Foundation_Deed_Of_The_Salvation_Army |date=25 May 2012 }}</ref> A statue commemorates both his mission and his work in helping the poor.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/england/london/attractions/whitechapel-road/a/poi-sig/1278840/358914</ref>\n\n[[File:Commercial Road booth map.jpg|thumb|left|Part of [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s [[poverty map]] showing Commercial Road in Whitechapel 1889.

Writing of the period 1883\u20131884, [[Yiddish theatre]] actor [[Jacob Pavlovich Adler|Jacob Adler]] wrote, \"The further we penetrated into this Whitechapel, the more our hearts sank. Was this London? Never in Russia, never later in the worst slums of New York, were we to see such poverty as in the London of the 1880s.\"<ref>Jacob Adler, ''A Life on the Stage: A Memoir'', translated and with commentary by Lulla Rosenfeld, Knopf, New York, 1999, {{ISBN|0679413510}}. p. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nThis endemic poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888 the [[Metropolitan Police]] estimated that there were 1,200 prostitutes \"of very low class\" resident in Whitechapel and about 62 brothels.<ref>Donald Rumbelow (2004) ''The Complete Jack the Ripper'': 12. Penguin</ref> Reference is specifically made to them in [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]]'s ''[[Life and Labour of the People in London]]'', specially to dwellings called [[Blackwall Buildings]] belonging to Blackwall Railway. Such prostitutes were numbered amongst the 11 [[Whitechapel murders]] (1888\u201391), some of which were committed by the legendary serial killer known as '[[Jack the Ripper]]'. These attacks caused widespread terror in the district and throughout the country and drew the attention of social reformers to the squalor and vice of the area, even though these crimes remain unsolved today.<ref>Nicholas Connell (2005) ''Walter Dew: The Man Who Caught Crippen'': 7\u201355</ref>\n\nThe \"Elephant Man\" [[Joseph Merrick]] (1862\u20131890) became well known in Whitechapel \u2014 he was exhibited in a shop on the Whitechapel Road before being helped by [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]] (1853\u20131923) at the [[Royal London Hospital]], opposite the actual shop. There is a museum in the hospital about his life.<ref>https://www.timeout.com/london/blog/seven-places-in-london-connected-with-the-elephant-man-020117</ref>\n\n===20th century===\nIn 1902, American author [[Jack London]], looking to write a counterpart to [[Jacob Riis]]'s seminal book ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'', donned ragged clothes and boarded in Whitechapel, detailing his experiences in ''[[The People of the Abyss]]''. Riis had recently documented the astoundingly bad conditions in large swaths of the leading city of the United States.\n\n[[File:Winston Churchill at the Siege of Sidney Street, 3 January 1911.jpeg|thumb|Home Secretary Churchill observing the events at Sidney Street, Whitechapel and Stepney]]\n\nThe [[Siege of Sidney Street]] in January 1911 was a gunfight between police and military forces and Latvian revolutionaries. Then Home Secretary [[Winston Churchill]] took over the operation where his presence caused a political row over the level of his involvement during the time. His biographers disagreed and said he gave no operational commands to the police,{{sfn|Addison|2014}}{{sfn|Jenkins|2012|p=195}} but a Metropolitan Police account states that the events of Sidney Street were \"a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions\".{{efn|Subsequent stories that a bullet passed through Churchill's top hat are apocryphal, and no reference to such an occurrence appears in either the official records, or Churchill's accounts of the siege.{{sfn|Waldren|2013|p=11}}}}\n\nThe [[Freedom Press]], a socialist publishing house, thought it worthwhile to explore conditions in the leading city of the nation that had invented modern capitalism. He concluded that English poverty was far rougher than the American variety. The juxtaposition of the poverty, homelessness, exploitive work conditions, prostitution, and infant mortality of Whitechapel and other East End locales with some of the greatest personal wealth the world has ever seen made it a focal point for leftist reformers and revolutionaries of all kinds, from [[George Bernard Shaw]], whose [[Fabian Society]] met regularly in Whitechapel, to [[Vladimir Lenin]], led rallies in Whitechapel during his exile from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitechapelgallery.org/first-thursdays/galleries/first-thursday-gallery-46/|title=First Thursday GALLERY 46|website=Whitechapelgallery.org|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> The area is still home to Freedom Press, the anarchist publishing house founded by [[Charlotte Wilson]].\n\nIn Sunday 4 October 1936, the [[British Union of Fascists]] led by [[Oswald Mosley]] clashed in the East End including a part of southern Whitechapel on [[Cable Street]] with various [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] demonstrators, including local [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Socialism|socialist]], [[Anarchism|anarchist]] and [[Communism|communist]] groups during the [[Battle of Cable Street]] where Mosley planned to send thousands of marchers dressed in uniforms styled on those of [[Blackshirts]] through the East End, which then had a large [[Jews|Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15171772|title=Cable Street: 'Solidarity stopped Mosley's fascists'|work=BBC News|accessdate=13 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhitechapel remained poor (and colourful) through the first half of the 20th century, though somewhat less desperately so. It suffered great damage in [[the Blitz]] and from the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[V-weapons|V-weapon]] attacks of [[World War II]]. Since then, Whitechapel has lost most of its notoriety.\n\n[[Altab Ali]] was murdered by three teenagers on 4 May 1978 in a racist attack as he walked home after work. His murder took place at St Mary's Gardens by St Mary's Churchyard, the reaction provoked the mass mobilisation of the Bengali community locally and came to represent the self-organisation of the community. The churchyard he was murdered in was later renamed [[Altab Ali Park]] in his memory.\n\n===21st century===\nThe [[Metropolitan line]] between Hammersmith and Whitechapel was withdrawn in 1990 and shown separately as a new line called the [[Hammersmith & City line]].{{sfn|Rose|2007}}<ref name=\"T90\">{{cite web|title=London Underground map 1990|url=http://www.clarksbury.com/cdl/maps/tube90.jpg|work=The London Tube map archive|accessdate=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Crossrail]] will call at Whitechapel Station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrail.co.uk/route/stations/whitechapel/|title=Whitechapel station|website=Crossrail.co.uk|accessdate=6 January 2018}}</ref> on the Elizabeth Line.

[[Charles Dickens, Jr.]] (eldest child of [[Charles Dickens]]), in his 1879 book ''[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]'', described the Pavilion this way: \"A large East-end theatre capable of holding considerably over 3,000 persons.

Probably the area's most prominent art venue is the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]], founded in 1901 and long an outpost of high culture in a poor neighbourhood. As the neighbourhood has gentrified, it has gained citywide, and even international, visibility and support. From 2005 the gallery underwent a major expansion, with the support of \u00a33.26&nbsp;million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The expanded facility opened in 2009.\n\nWhitechapel in the early 21st century has figured prominently in London's punk rock/skuzz rock scene, with the main focal point for this scene being Whitechapel Factory and Rhythm Factory bar/restaurant/nightclub. This scene includes the likes of The Libertines, Zap!, [[Nova (Italian band)|Nova]], [[The Others (band)|The Others]], Razorlight, and The Rakes, all of whom have had some commercial success in the music charts.\n\nHome to centres such as London Action Resource Centre and rampART, Whitechapel is seen by many as a cultural hub for community based political activism particularly of an anti-[[authoritarian]], [[anti-war]] trend. The anarchist publishing house Freedom Press is nearby in Aldgate and one of the London chapters of Food Not Bombs serves regular meals in [[Altab Ali Park]] on Whitechapel High Street. Whitechapel Anarchist Group has also recently been formed and circulates a local freesheet called W.A.G. (Whitechapel Anarchist Group)\n\nIn the past Whitechapel has been home to such individuals as [[Rudolf Rocker]] (1873\u20131958), anarcho-syndicalist writer, historian and prominent activist who active in the area from 1895 to 1918. [[Charles Lahr]] (1885\u20131971), anarchist bookseller/publisher and secretary of Whitechapel branch of the Industrial Union of Direct Actionists (IUDA), was also a prominent figure resident in the area. Such individuals in history have helped form the culture of enthusiasm in political alternatives that is enjoyed in the community today.\n\n[[File:Whitechapel market.JPG|thumb|left|Whitechapel Street Market at night]]\n\n===Demographics===\nThe [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] are the most visible migrant group today, who make up 40% of the Whitechapel ward total population.<ref name=BanPop>{{NOMIS2011|id=1237320252|title=Whitechapel 2011 Census Ward|accessdate=9 February 2018}}</ref> The [[East London Mosque]] at the end of Whitechapel Road is a major symbol of the resident Islamic community.

Several chapters of [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s classic [[Yiddish]] novel ''[[Adventures of Mottel the Cantor's Son]]'' take place in early 20th-century Whitechapel, depicted from the point of view of an impoverished East European Jewish family fleeing the pogroms. The novel ''[[Journey Through a Small Planet]]'' by [[Emanuel Litvinoff]] vividly describes Whitechapel and its Jewish inhabitants in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe prostitute and daughter of a [[Luddite]] leader Sybil Gerard, main character of [[William Gibson]] and [[Bruce Sterling]]'s novel [[The Difference Engine]] comes from Whitechapel. The novel's plot begins there.\n\n''Brick Lane'', the 2003 novel by [[Monica Ali]] is based in Whitechapel and documents the life of a young Bangladeshi woman's experience of living in [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]] in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nWhitechapel is used as a location in most [[Jack the Ripper fiction]].

On 20 April 1912, the school was renamed as the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' (Istanbul House of Multiple Sciences) while the number of courses were increased and the curricula were modernized with the establishment of the Schools of Medicine, Law, Applied Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics), Literature and Theology.\n\nOn 21 April 1924, the [[Republic of Turkey]] recognized the ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' as a state school, and on 7 October 1925, the administrative autonomy of ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was recognized while the ''Schools'' (within the old Medrese system) became modern ''Faculties''.\n\nOn 1 August 1933, ''\u0130stanbul Dar\u00fclf\u00fcn\u00fbnu'' was reorganized as ''\u0130stanbul \u00dcniversitesi'' (Istanbul University) following the [[Atat\u00fcrk's Reforms|educational reforms]] of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]]. Classes officially began on 1 November 1933.\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Istanbul University campus ruins March 2008d.JPG|thumb|Late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] remains at the Istanbul University campus next to [[Beyaz\u0131t Tower]].]]\n[[File:University Istanbul main building interior March 2008pano.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of the main building]]The university has seventeen faculties on five campuses; the main campus being on [[Beyaz\u0131t Square]], which was originally built by [[Constantine the Great]] as the ''Forum Tauri'' and was later enlarged by [[Theodosius I|Theodosius the Great]] as the ''[[Forum of Theodosius]]'' during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] period.\n\nThe main campus building with its landmark gate was previously used as the headquarters of the ''Harbiye Nezareti'' (Ministry of War) by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government.

The name derives from the Old English {{wikt-lang|ang|Nor\u00feanhymbre|Nor\u00fean-hymbre}} meaning  \"the people or province north of the Humber\",<ref>{{harvnb|Bosworth|1898|p=725}}</ref> which reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. Northumbria started to consolidate into one kingdom in the early seventh century, when the two earlier core territories of [[Deira]] and [[Bernicia]] entered into a dynastic union. At its height, the kingdom extended from the [[Humber]], [[Peak District]] and the [[River Mersey]] on the south to the [[Firth of Forth]] (now in Scotland) on the north. Northumbria ceased to be an independent kingdom in the mid-tenth century, though a rump [[Earl of Northumbria|Earldom of Bamburgh]] survived around Bernicia in the north, later to be absorbed into the medieval kingdoms of Scotland and England.\n\nToday, Northumbria usually refers to a smaller region corresponding to the counties of [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]] and [[Tyne and Wear]] in North East England.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/northumbria}}</ref> The term is used in the names of some [[North East England|North East]] regional institutions, particularly the [[Northumbria Police]] (which covers Northumberland and Tyne and Wear), [[Northumbria University]] (based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]), the Northumbria Army Cadet Force, and the regionalist Northumbrian Association.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northumbrianassociation.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Northumbrian Association }}</ref> The local [[Environment Agency]] office, located in Newcastle Business Park, also uses the term Northumbria to describe its area. However, the term is not the official name for the [[North East England|UK and EU region of North East England]].\n\n==Kingdom (654\u2013954)==\n===Communities and Divisions===\n====Possible British Origins====\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of Northumbria was originally two kingdoms divided approximately around the [[River Tees]]: [[Bernicia]] was to the north of the river and [[Deira]] to the south.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=44}}</ref> It is possible that both regions originated as native [[Celtic Britons|British]] Kingdoms which the Germanic settlers later conquered, although there is very little information about the infrastructure and culture of the British kingdoms themselves.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p81\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=81}}</ref> Much of the evidence for them comes from regional names that are British rather than Anglo-Saxon in origin. The names Deira and Bernicia are likely British in origin, for example, indicating that some British place names retained currency after the Anglo-Saxon migrations to Northumbria.{{efn|In addition to [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]], some other British place names are recorded for important Northumbrian locations. Northumbrian scholar [[Bede]] (c. 731) and Welsh chronicler [[Nennius]] (ninth-century) both provide British place names for centres of power. Nennius, for example, refers to the royal city of [[Bamburgh]] as Din Guaire.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|1969}} Book IV Chapter 19</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Nennius|2005}} para 62</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Higham|1993|p=81}}</ref><ref name=\"Rollason2003p81\"/>}} There is also some archeological evidence to support British origins for the polities of Bernicia and Deira. In what would have been southern Bernicia, in the [[Cheviot Hills]], a hill fort at [[Yeavering]] called Yeavering Bell contains evidence that it was an important centre for first the British and later the Anglo-Saxons. The fort is originally pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]], dating back to the [[Iron Age]] at around the first century. In addition to signs of Roman occupation, the site contains evidence of timber buildings that pre-date Germanic settlement in the area that are probably signs of British settlement.

Political power in Deira was concentrated in the East Riding of [[Yorkshire]], which included [[York]], the North York Moors, and the Vale of York.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=45\u201348}}</ref> The political heartlands of Bernicia were the areas around [[Bamburgh]] and [[Lindisfarne]], [[Monkwearmouth]] and [[Jarrow]], and in [[Cumbria]], west of the [[Pennines]] in the area around [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=48\u201352}}</ref> The name that these two countries eventually united under, Northumbria, may have been coined by [[Bede]] and made popular through his [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]].<ref>{{harvnb|Yorke|1990|p=74}}</ref>\n\nInformation on the early royal genealogies for Bernicia and Deira comes from Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'' and Welsh chronicler [[Nennius]]\u2019 [[Historia Brittonum]]. According to Nennius, the Bernician royal line begins with [[Ida of Bernicia|Ida]], son of [[Eoppa of Bernicia|Eoppa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nennius|2005}} para 57, 59</ref> Ida reigned for twelve years (beginning in 547) and was able to annex [[Bamburgh]] to Bernicia.<ref>{{harvnb|Nennius|2005}} para 59</ref> In Nennius\u2019 genealogy of Deira, a king named Soemil was the first to separate Bernicia and Deira, which could mean that he wrested the kingdom of Deira from the native British.<ref name=\"Yorke1990p79\">{{harvnb|Yorke|1990|p=79}}</ref> The date of this supposed separation is unknown. The first Deiran king to make an appearance in Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum'' is [[\u00c6lla of Deira|\u00c6lle]], the father of the first Roman Catholic Northumbrian king [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book II, Chapter 1</ref>\n\nA king of Bernicia, Ida's grandson [[\u00c6thelfrith]], was the first ruler to unite the two polities under his rule. He exiled the Deiran Edwin to the court of King [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia|R\u00e6dwald]] of the East Angles in order to claim both kingdoms, but Edwin returned in approximately 616 to conquer Northumbria with R\u00e6dwald's aid.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book II, Chapter 12</ref><ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=7}}</ref> Edwin, who ruled from approximately 616 to 633, was one of the last kings of the Deiran line to reign over all of Northumbria; it was [[Oswald of Bernicia]] (c. 634-42) who finally succeeded in making the merger more permanent.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book III, Chapter 6</ref> Oswald's brother [[Oswiu]] eventually succeeded him to the Northumbrian throne despite initial attempts on Deira's part to pull away again.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/> Although the Bernician line ultimately became the royal line of Northumbria, a series of Derian sub-kings continued after Oswald, including Oswine (a relation of Edwin murdered by Oswiu in 651), [[\u0152thelwald of Deira|\u0152thelwald]] (killed in battle 655), and [[Aldfrith of Northumbria|Aldfrith]] (son of Oswiu, who disappeared after 664).<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/> Although both \u0152thelwald and Aldfrith were Oswiu's relations who may have received their sub-king status from him, both used Deira separatist sentiments to try to snatch independent rule of Deira.<ref name=\"Yorke1990p79\"/> Ultimately, neither were successful and Oswiu's son [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]] succeeded him to maintain the integrated Northumbrian line.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/>\n\nWhile violent conflicts between Bernicia and Deira played a significant part in determining which line ultimately gained supremacy in Northumbria, marriage alliances also helped bind these two territories together. [[\u00c6thelfrith]] married Edwin's sister [[Acha of Deira|Acha]], although this marriage did little to prevent future squabbles between the brothers-in-law and their descendants. The second intermarriage was more successful, with [[Oswiu]] marrying [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]]\u2019s daughter and his own cousin [[Eanfl\u00e6d]] to produce [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]], the beginning of the Northumbrian line. However, Oswiu had another relationship with an Irish woman named Fina which produced the problematic Aldfrith.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/> In his ''Life and Miracles of St. [[Cuthbert]],'' Bede declares that Aldfrith, known as Fland among the Irish, was illegitimate and therefore unfit to rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|1983}} The Life and Miracles of St. Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne, cap. 24</ref>\n\n====Northumbria and Norse Settlement====\nThe [[Vikings|Viking]] invasions of the ninth century and the establishment of the [[Danelaw]] once again divided Northumbria. Although primarily recorded in the southern provinces of [[England]], the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s (particularly the D and E recensions) provide some information on Northumbria's conflicts with Vikings in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. According to these chronicles, Viking raids began to affect Northumbria when a band attacked Lindisfarne in 793.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanton|1996}} 793</ref> After this initial catastrophic blow, Viking raids in Northumbria were either sporadic for much of the early ninth century or evidence of them was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=211}}</ref> However, in 865 the so-called [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[East Anglia]] and began a sustained campaign of conquest.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p212\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=212}}</ref><ref name=\"asc865\">{{harvnb|Swanton|1996}} 865</ref> The Great Army fought in Northumbria in 866\u2013867, striking [[York]] twice in less than one year.

The E recension of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests that Northumbria was particularly vulnerable at this time because the Northumbrians were once again fighting among themselves, deposing Osberht in favor of \u00c6lle.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanton|1996}} 866\u2013867</ref> In the second raid the Vikings killed the Northumbrian kings \u00c6lle and Osberht while recapturing the city.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p212\"/>\n\nAfter King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] reestablished his control of southern England the Norse invaders settled into what came to be known as the Danelaw in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]], [[East Anglia]], and the southern part of Northumbria.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p212\"/> In Northumbria, the Norse established the [[Kingdom of York]] whose boundaries were roughly the [[River Tees]] and the Humber, giving it approximately the same dimensions as Deira.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=212\u2013213}}</ref> Although this kingdom fell to Hiberno-Norse colonizers in the 920s and was in constant conflict with the West-Saxon expansionists from the south, it survived until 954 when the last Scandinavian king Eric, who is usually identified as [[Eric Bloodaxe]], was driven out and eventually killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=270}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=213}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Downham|2004}} reconsiders the Northumbrian Viking king known as Eric and his perhaps tenuous relationship to the Eric Bloodaxe of the sagas.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the Great Army was not as successful in conquering territory north of the River Tees.

Of the twenty-five kings before the Danish rule of Northumbria, only four died of natural causes. Of those that did not abdicate for a holy life, the rest were either deposed, exiled, or murdered.

Within the Kingdom of York, once the raids and war were over, there is no evidence that the presence of Scandinavian settlers interrupted Catholic practice.

According to Bede, he \"was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of [[Bible|scripture]], he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in [[Old English|English]], which was his native language.

For example, only a few Scandinavian words, mostly military and technical, became part of [[Old English]]. By the early 900s, however, Scandinavian-style names for both people and places became increasingly popular, as did Scandinavian ornamentation on works of art, featuring aspects of Norse mythology, and figures of animals and warriors. Nevertheless, sporadic references to \"Danes\" in charters, chronicles, and laws indicate that during the lifetime of the Kingdom of Northumbria, most inhabitants of northeast England did not consider themselves Danish, and were not perceived as such by other Anglo-Saxons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hadley|2002}}</ref>\n\nThe synthesis of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian and Catholic and Pagan [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] within the Danelaw can be illustrated by an examination of stone sculpture. However, the tradition of mixing pagan and Catholic motifs is not unique to the Danelaw, and examples of such synthesis can be seen in previous examples, such as the Franks Casket. The [[Franks Casket]], believed to have been produced in Northumbria, includes depictions of Germanic legends and stories of the founding Roman and the Roman Church and is dated to the early eighth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Karkov|2011|pp=149\u2013152}}</ref> The Gosforth Cross, dated to the early tenth century, stands at 4.4 meters and is richly decorated with carvings of mythical beasts, Norse gods, and Catholic symbolism.<ref>{{harvnb|Berg|1958|pp=27\u201330}}</ref> Stone sculpture was not a practice of native Scandinavian culture, and the proliferation of stone monuments within the Danelaw shows the influence that the English had on Viking settlers. On one side of the Gosforth Cross is a depiction of the Crucifixion; whilst on the other are scenes from Ragnarok. The melding of these distinctive religious cultures can further be seen in the depiction of Mary Magdalene as a valkyrie, with a trailing dress and long pigtail.<ref>{{harvnb|Richards|1991|pp=121}}</ref> Although one can read the iconography as the triumph of Catholicism over paganism, it is possible that in the process of the Catholicizing (as distinct from conversion) the Vikings might have initially accepted the Catholic god as an addition to the broad pantheon of Pagan gods.<ref>{{harvnb|Richards|1991|pp=123}}</ref> The inclusion of pagan traditions in visual culture reflects the creation of a distinctive [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] culture.

34</ref> was a medieval [[Angles|Anglian]] kingdom in what is now [[Northern England]] and [[Lothian|south-east Scotland]]. The name derives from the Old English {{wikt-lang|ang|Nor\u00feanhymbre|Nor\u00fean-hymbre}} meaning  \"the people or province north of the Humber\",<ref>{{harvnb|Bosworth|1898|p=725}}</ref> which reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the [[Humber|Humber Estuary]]. Northumbria started to consolidate into one kingdom in the early seventh century, when the two earlier core territories of [[Deira]] and [[Bernicia]] entered into a dynastic union. At its height, the kingdom extended from the [[Humber]], [[Peak District]] and the [[River Mersey]] on the south to the [[Firth of Forth]] (now in Scotland) on the north. Northumbria ceased to be an independent kingdom in the mid-tenth century, though a rump [[Earl of Northumbria|Earldom of Bamburgh]] survived around Bernicia in the north, later to be absorbed into the medieval kingdoms of Scotland and England.\n\nToday, Northumbria usually refers to a smaller region corresponding to the counties of [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]] and [[Tyne and Wear]] in North East England.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/northumbria}}</ref> The term is used in the names of some [[North East England|North East]] regional institutions, particularly the [[Northumbria Police]] (which covers Northumberland and Tyne and Wear), [[Northumbria University]] (based in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]), the Northumbria Army Cadet Force, and the regionalist Northumbrian Association.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northumbrianassociation.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Northumbrian Association }}</ref> The local [[Environment Agency]] office, located in Newcastle Business Park, also uses the term Northumbria to describe its area. However, the term is not the official name for the [[North East England|UK and EU region of North East England]].\n\n==Kingdom (654\u2013954)==\n===Communities and Divisions===\n====Possible British Origins====\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of Northumbria was originally two kingdoms divided approximately around the [[River Tees]]: [[Bernicia]] was to the north of the river and [[Deira]] to the south.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=44}}</ref> It is possible that both regions originated as native [[Celtic Britons|British]] Kingdoms which the Germanic settlers later conquered, although there is very little information about the infrastructure and culture of the British kingdoms themselves.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p81\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=81}}</ref> Much of the evidence for them comes from regional names that are British rather than Anglo-Saxon in origin. The names Deira and Bernicia are likely British in origin, for example, indicating that some British place names retained currency after the Anglo-Saxon migrations to Northumbria.{{efn|In addition to [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]], some other British place names are recorded for important Northumbrian locations. Northumbrian scholar [[Bede]] (c. 731) and Welsh chronicler [[Nennius]] (ninth-century) both provide British place names for centres of power. Nennius, for example, refers to the royal city of [[Bamburgh]] as Din Guaire.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|1969}} Book IV Chapter 19</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Nennius|2005}} para 62</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Higham|1993|p=81}}</ref><ref name=\"Rollason2003p81\"/>}} There is also some archeological evidence to support British origins for the polities of Bernicia and Deira. In what would have been southern Bernicia, in the [[Cheviot Hills]], a hill fort at [[Yeavering]] called Yeavering Bell contains evidence that it was an important centre for first the British and later the Anglo-Saxons. The fort is originally pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]], dating back to the [[Iron Age]] at around the first century. In addition to signs of Roman occupation, the site contains evidence of timber buildings that pre-date Germanic settlement in the area that are probably signs of British settlement. Moreover, Brian Hope-Taylor has traced the origins of the name Yeavering, which looks deceptively English, back to the British gafr from Bede's mention of a township called Gefrin in the same area.<ref>{{harvnb|Hope-Taylor|1983|pp=15\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=83\u201384}}</ref> Yeavering continued to be an important political centre after the Anglo-Saxons began settling in the north, as King [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]] had a royal palace at Yeavering.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book II, Chapter 14</ref>\n\nOverall, English place-names dominate the Northumbrian landscape, suggesting the prevalence of an Anglo-Saxon elite culture by the time that [[Bede]]\u2014one of Anglo-Saxon England's most prominent historians\u2014was writing in the eighth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008|p=93}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=57\u201364}}</ref> According to Bede, the [[Angles]] predominated the Germanic immigrants that settled north of the Humber and gained political prominence during this time period.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book I, Chapter 15</ref> While the British natives may have partially assimilated into the Northumbrian political structure, relatively contemporary textual sources such as Bede's [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]] depict relations between Northumbrians and the [[Celtic Britons|British]] as fraught.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=100}}</ref>\n\n====Unification of Bernicia and Deira====\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] countries of [[Bernicia]] and [[Deira]] were often in conflict before their eventual semi-permanent unification in 654. Political power in Deira was concentrated in the East Riding of [[Yorkshire]], which included [[York]], the North York Moors, and the Vale of York.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=45\u201348}}</ref> The political heartlands of Bernicia were the areas around [[Bamburgh]] and [[Lindisfarne]], [[Monkwearmouth]] and [[Jarrow]], and in [[Cumbria]], west of the [[Pennines]] in the area around [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=48\u201352}}</ref> The name that these two countries eventually united under, Northumbria, may have been coined by [[Bede]] and made popular through his [[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]].<ref>{{harvnb|Yorke|1990|p=74}}</ref>\n\nInformation on the early royal genealogies for Bernicia and Deira comes from Bede's ''Ecclesiastical History of the English People'' and Welsh chronicler [[Nennius]]\u2019 [[Historia Brittonum]]. According to Nennius, the Bernician royal line begins with [[Ida of Bernicia|Ida]], son of [[Eoppa of Bernicia|Eoppa]].<ref>{{harvnb|Nennius|2005}} para 57, 59</ref> Ida reigned for twelve years (beginning in 547) and was able to annex [[Bamburgh]] to Bernicia.<ref>{{harvnb|Nennius|2005}} para 59</ref> In Nennius\u2019 genealogy of Deira, a king named Soemil was the first to separate Bernicia and Deira, which could mean that he wrested the kingdom of Deira from the native British.<ref name=\"Yorke1990p79\">{{harvnb|Yorke|1990|p=79}}</ref> The date of this supposed separation is unknown. The first Deiran king to make an appearance in Bede's ''Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum'' is [[\u00c6lla of Deira|\u00c6lle]], the father of the first Roman Catholic Northumbrian king [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book II, Chapter 1</ref>\n\nA king of Bernicia, Ida's grandson [[\u00c6thelfrith]], was the first ruler to unite the two polities under his rule. He exiled the Deiran Edwin to the court of King [[R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia|R\u00e6dwald]] of the East Angles in order to claim both kingdoms, but Edwin returned in approximately 616 to conquer Northumbria with R\u00e6dwald's aid.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book II, Chapter 12</ref><ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=7}}</ref> Edwin, who ruled from approximately 616 to 633, was one of the last kings of the Deiran line to reign over all of Northumbria; it was [[Oswald of Bernicia]] (c. 634-42) who finally succeeded in making the merger more permanent.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book III, Chapter 6</ref> Oswald's brother [[Oswiu]] eventually succeeded him to the Northumbrian throne despite initial attempts on Deira's part to pull away again.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/> Although the Bernician line ultimately became the royal line of Northumbria, a series of Derian sub-kings continued after Oswald, including Oswine (a relation of Edwin murdered by Oswiu in 651), [[\u0152thelwald of Deira|\u0152thelwald]] (killed in battle 655), and [[Aldfrith of Northumbria|Aldfrith]] (son of Oswiu, who disappeared after 664).<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/> Although both \u0152thelwald and Aldfrith were Oswiu's relations who may have received their sub-king status from him, both used Deira separatist sentiments to try to snatch independent rule of Deira.<ref name=\"Yorke1990p79\"/> Ultimately, neither were successful and Oswiu's son [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]] succeeded him to maintain the integrated Northumbrian line.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/>\n\nWhile violent conflicts between Bernicia and Deira played a significant part in determining which line ultimately gained supremacy in Northumbria, marriage alliances also helped bind these two territories together. [[\u00c6thelfrith]] married Edwin's sister [[Acha of Deira|Acha]], although this marriage did little to prevent future squabbles between the brothers-in-law and their descendants. The second intermarriage was more successful, with [[Oswiu]] marrying [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]]\u2019s daughter and his own cousin [[Eanfl\u00e6d]] to produce [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria|Ecgfrith]], the beginning of the Northumbrian line. However, Oswiu had another relationship with an Irish woman named Fina which produced the problematic Aldfrith.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p7\"/> In his ''Life and Miracles of St. [[Cuthbert]],'' Bede declares that Aldfrith, known as Fland among the Irish, was illegitimate and therefore unfit to rule.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|1983}} The Life and Miracles of St. Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne, cap. 24</ref>\n\n====Northumbria and Norse Settlement====\nThe [[Vikings|Viking]] invasions of the ninth century and the establishment of the [[Danelaw]] once again divided Northumbria. Although primarily recorded in the southern provinces of [[England]], the [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]s (particularly the D and E recensions) provide some information on Northumbria's conflicts with Vikings in the late eighth and early ninth centuries. According to these chronicles, Viking raids began to affect Northumbria when a band attacked Lindisfarne in 793.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanton|1996}} 793</ref> After this initial catastrophic blow, Viking raids in Northumbria were either sporadic for much of the early ninth century or evidence of them was lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=211}}</ref> However, in 865 the so-called [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[East Anglia]] and began a sustained campaign of conquest.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p212\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=212}}</ref><ref name=\"asc865\">{{harvnb|Swanton|1996}} 865</ref> The Great Army fought in Northumbria in 866\u2013867, striking [[York]] twice in less than one year. After the initial attack the Norse left to go north, leaving Kings \u00c6lle and Osberht to recapture the city. The E recension of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests that Northumbria was particularly vulnerable at this time because the Northumbrians were once again fighting among themselves, deposing Osberht in favor of \u00c6lle.<ref>{{harvnb|Swanton|1996}} 866\u2013867</ref> In the second raid the Vikings killed the Northumbrian kings \u00c6lle and Osberht while recapturing the city.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p212\"/>\n\nAfter King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] reestablished his control of southern England the Norse invaders settled into what came to be known as the Danelaw in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]], [[East Anglia]], and the southern part of Northumbria.<ref name=\"Rollason2003p212\"/> In Northumbria, the Norse established the [[Kingdom of York]] whose boundaries were roughly the [[River Tees]] and the Humber, giving it approximately the same dimensions as Deira.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=212\u2013213}}</ref> Although this kingdom fell to Hiberno-Norse colonizers in the 920s and was in constant conflict with the West-Saxon expansionists from the south, it survived until 954 when the last Scandinavian king Eric, who is usually identified as [[Eric Bloodaxe]], was driven out and eventually killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=270}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=213}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Downham|2004}} reconsiders the Northumbrian Viking king known as Eric and his perhaps tenuous relationship to the Eric Bloodaxe of the sagas.</ref>\n\nIn contrast, the Great Army was not as successful in conquering territory north of the River Tees. There were raids that extended into that area, but no sources mention lasting Norse occupation and there are very few [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian]] place names to indicate significant Norse settlement in northern regions of Northumbria.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=213,244}}</ref> The political landscape of the area north of the Tees during the Viking conquest of Northumbria consisted of the Community of St. Cuthbert and the remnants of the English Northumbrian elites.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=244}}</ref> While the religious Community of St. Cuthbert \"wandered\" for a hundred years after [[Halfdan Ragnarsson]] attacked their original home Lindisfarne in 875, The [[Historia de Sancto Cuthberto|History of St. Cuthbert]] indicates that they settled temporarily at [[Chester-le-Street]] between the years 875\u2013883 on land granted to them by the Viking King of York, [[Guthred]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=246\u2013257}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=319}}</ref> According to the twelfth-century account ''Historia Regum'', Guthred granted them this land in exchange for their raising him up as king. The land extended from the Tees to the Tyne and anyone who fled there from either the north or the south would receive sanctuary for thirty-seven days, indicating that the Community of St. Cuthbert had some juridical autonomy. Based on their positioning and this right of sanctuary, this community may have acted as a buffer between the Norse in southern Northumbria and the Anglo-Saxons who continued to hold the north.<ref>{{harvnb|Arnold|1885}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Higham|1993|p=183}}</ref>\n\nNorth of the [[River Tyne|Tyne]], Northumbrians maintained partial political control in [[Bamburgh]]. The rule of kings continued in that area with [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht I]] acting as regent around 867 and the kings [[Ricsige of Northumbria|Ricsige]] and [[Ecgberht II of Northumbria|Ecgberht II]] immediately following him.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=249}}</ref> According to twelfth-century historian [[Symeon of Durham]], Ecgberht I was a client-king for the Norse.

Of the twenty-five kings before the Danish rule of Northumbria, only four died of natural causes. Of those that did not abdicate for a holy life, the rest were either deposed, exiled, or murdered. Kings during the Danish rule of Northumbria (see [[Danelaw]]) were often either kings of a larger North Sea or Danish empire, or were installed rulers.<ref>{{harvnb|Downham|2007|pp=40}}</ref>\n\nSuccession in Northumbria was hereditary,<ref>{{harvnb|Petts|2011|p=27}}</ref> which left princes whose fathers died before they could come of age particularly susceptible to assassination and usurpation.

He survived one assassination attempt early in his rule, but fell victim to another assassin at the age of nineteen. During his reign he was adopted by Wilfrid, a powerful bishop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Higham|1993|pp=81\u201390}}</ref> Ecclesiastical influence in the royal court was not an unusual phenomenon in Northumbria, and usually was most visible during the rule of a young or inexperienced king. Similarly, ealdorman, or royal advisors, had periods of increased or decreased power in Northumbria, depending on who was ruling at the time.<ref>{{harvnb|Fairless|1994|pp= 10\u201316}}</ref>\n\nWarfare in Northumbria before the Danish period largely consisted of rivalries with the [[Picts]] to the north. The Northumbrians were successful against the Picts until the [[Battle of Dun Nechtain]] in 685, which halted their expansion north and established a border between the two kingdoms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parsons|first=Julie|date=2002-05-04|title=The First Battle for Scottish Independence: The Battle of Dunnichen, A.D. 685.|url=https://dc.etsu.edu/etd/657|journal=Electronic Theses and Dissertations}}</ref> Warfare during the Danish period was dominated by warfare between the Northumbrians and other English Kingdoms.\n\n==Ealdormen and Earldoms of Northumbria==\n{{main article|Earl of Northumbria}}\n{{see also|Ealdorman}}\nAfter the English of Wessex absorbed the Danish-ruled territories in the southern part of the former kingdom, Scots invasions reduced the rump Northumbria to an earldom stretching from the Tees to the Tweed. The surviving Earldom of Northumbria was then disputed between the emerging kingdoms of [[England]] and [[Scotland]], to be split roughly in half along the [[River Tweed]].\n\n==Religion==\n===Roman and Post-Roman Britain===\nUnder [[Roman Britain|Roman]] rule, some [[Celtic Britons|Britons]] north of the [[Humber]] practiced [[Roman Catholicism]]. In fact, York had a [[Archbishop of York|bishop]] as early as the fourth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Clutton-Brock|1899|p=6}}</ref> After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Romans left Britain]] in the early fifth century, Catholicism did not disappear,<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p=65}}</ref> but it existed alongside Celtic paganism,<ref>{{harvnb|MacLean|1997|pp=88\u201389}}</ref> and possibly many other cults.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|pp=132\u2013133}}</ref> Anglo-Saxons brought their own Germanic pagan beliefs and practices when they settled there. At [[Yeavering]], in [[Bernicia]], excavations have uncovered evidence of a pagan shrine, animal sacrifice, and ritual burials.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=102}}</ref>\n\n===Conversion of the Anglo-Saxons to Roman Catholicism===\nThe first King of Northumbria to convert to [[Roman Catholicism]] was [[Edwin of Northumbria|King Edwin]]. He was baptized by [[Paulinus of York|Paulinus]] in 627.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008|p=96}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, many of his people followed his conversion to the new religion, only to return to paganism when Edwin was killed in 633. Paulinus was [[Archbishop of York|Bishop of York]], but only for a year.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|p=207}}</ref>\n\nThe lasting conversion of Northumbria took place under the guidance of the Irish cleric Aidan. He converted [[Oswald of Northumbria|King Oswald]] of Northumbria in 635, and then worked to convert the people of Northumbria.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008}}III. 5</ref> King Oswald moved the bishopric from York to [[Lindisfarne]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n===Monasteries and Figures of Note===\nThe monastery at [[Lindisfarne]] was founded by Aidan in 635, and based on the practices of the Columban monastery in Iona, Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=156}}</ref> The location of the bishopric shifted to Lindisfarne, and it became the centre for religion in Northumbria. The bishopric would not leave Lindisfarne and shift back to its original location at York until 664.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Throughout the eighth century, Lindisfarne was associated with important figures. Aidan, the founder, [[Wilfrid]], a student, and [[Cuthbert]], a member of the order and a hermit, all became bishops and later Saints. Aidan assisted Heiu to found her double monastery at [[Hartlepool]].<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=171}}</ref> She too came to be venerated as a saint.<ref>{{harvnb|Butler|1866}}Volume IX September 6</ref>\n\nThe Catholic culture of Northumbria was influenced by the continent as well as [[Ireland]]. In particular, Wilfrid travelled to [[Rome]] and abandoned the traditions of the [[Celtic church]] in favor of Roman practices. When he returned to [[England]], he became abbot of a new monastery at [[Ripon]] in 660. Wilfrid advocated for Roman Catholicism at the [[Synod of Whitby]]. The two-halves of the double monastery [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow]] were founded by the nobleman [[Benedict Biscop]] in 673 and 681. Biscop became the first abbot of the monastery, and travelled to Rome six times to buy books for the library.<ref name=\"Lapidge2006p35\">{{harvnb|Lapidge|2006|p=35}}</ref> His successor, Abbot [[Ceolfrith]], continued to add to the library until by one estimate the library at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow had over two hundred volumes.<ref name=\"Lapidge2006p35\"/> One who benefited from this library was Bede.<ref>{{harvnb|Bede|2008|pp=viii\u2013ix}}</ref>\n\nIn the early seventh century in York, [[Paulinus of York|Paulinus]] founded a school and a minster, but not a monastery. The School at York Minster is one of the oldest in England.<ref>{{harvnb|Leach|1915|pp=41}}</ref> By the late eighth century, the school had a noteworthy library, estimated at about one hundred volumes.<ref>{{harvnb|Lapidge|2006|p=41}}</ref> [[Alcuin]] was a student and teacher at York before he left for the court of [[Charlemagne]] in 782.<ref>{{harvnb|Lapidge|2006|p=40}}</ref>\n\n===Synod of Whitby===\n{{main article|Synod of Whitby}}\nIn 664, King [[Oswiu]] called the Synod of Whitby to determine whether to follow Roman or Irish customs. Since Northumbria was converted to [[Roman Catholicism]] by the Celtic clergy, the Celtic tradition for determining the date of [[Easter]] and Irish tonsure were supported by many, particularly by the Abbey of [[Lindisfarne]]. Roman Catholicism was also represented in Northumbria, by [[Wilfrid]], Abbot of [[Ripon]].  By the year 620, both sides were associating the other's Easter observance with the Pelagian Heresy.<ref>{{harvnb|Corning|2006|p=114}}</ref> The King decided at Whitby that Roman practice would be adopted throughout Northumbria, thereby bringing Northumbria in line with Southern England and Western Europe.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Bede|2008}} Book III chapter 25\u201326</ref> Members of the clergy who refused to conform, including the Celtic Bishop Colman of Lindisfarne, returned to Iona.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> The episcopal seat of Northumbria transferred from Lindisfarne to York, which later became an [[Archbishop of York|archbishopric]] in 735.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=239}}</ref>\n\n===Impact of Scandinavian Raiding, Settlement and Culture ===\nThe [[Lindisfarne#Vikings|Viking attack on Lindisfarne]] in 793 was the first of many raids on monasteries of Northumbria. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] survived, but monastic culture in Northumbria went into a period of decline in the early ninth century. Repeated Viking assaults on religious centres were one reason for the decrease in production of manuscripts and communal monastic culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Fleming|2010|p=318}}</ref>\n\nAfter 867, Northumbria came under control of the Scandinavian forces, and there was an influx of Scandinavian immigrants.<ref>{{harvnb|Higham|1993|p=178}}</ref> Their religion was pagan and had a rich mythology.  Within the Kingdom of York, once the raids and war were over, there is no evidence that the presence of Scandinavian settlers interrupted Catholic practice. It appears that they gradually adopted Roman Catholicism and blended their Scandinavian culture with their new religion. This can be seen in carved stone monuments and ring-headed crosses, such as the Gosforth Cross.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=237\u2013239}}</ref> During the ninth and tenth centuries, there was an increase in the number of [[parish church]]es, often including stone sculptures incorporating Scandinavian designs.<ref name=\"auto3\"/>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|left|thumb|220px|upright|Page from the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], {{circa|700}}, featuring zoomorphic knot-work.]]\n[[Image:DurhamAII10ColophMattFol03v.jpg|thumb|250px|The colophon to the [[Gospel of Matthew]] from the Durham Gospel Fragment, featuring non-zoomorphic interlace patterns.]]\n[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|thumb|The Book of Kells, (folio 292r), {{circa|800}}, showing the lavishly decorated text that opens the [[Gospel of John]]]]\n===Golden Age of Northumbria===\n{{main article|Northumbria's Golden Age}}\nThe Catholic culture of Northumbria, fuelled by influences from the continent and Ireland, promoted a broad range of literary and artistic works.\n\n===Insular Art===\nThe Irish monks who converted Northumbria to Roman Catholicism, and established monasteries such as [[Lindisfarne]], brought a style of artistic and literary production.<ref>{{harvnb|Neuman de Vegvar|1990|}}</ref> [[Eadfrith of Lindisfarne]] produced the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] in an Insular style.<ref>{{harvnb|Rollason|2003|pp=140}}</ref>\n\nThe Irish monks brought with them an ancient Celtic decorative tradition of curvilinear forms of spirals, scrolls, and doubles curves.

It can be seen in and sculpture, such as the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Bewcastle Cross]].

[[C\u00e6dmon]] lived at the [[double monastery]] of Streon\u00e6shalch ([[Whitby Abbey]]) during the abbacy (657\u2013680) of [[Hilda of Whitby|St. Hilda]] (614\u2013680). According to Bede, he \"was wont to make religious verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out of [[Bible|scripture]], he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in [[Old English|English]], which was his native language.

For example, only a few Scandinavian words, mostly military and technical, became part of [[Old English]]. By the early 900s, however, Scandinavian-style names for both people and places became increasingly popular, as did Scandinavian ornamentation on works of art, featuring aspects of Norse mythology, and figures of animals and warriors. Nevertheless, sporadic references to \"Danes\" in charters, chronicles, and laws indicate that during the lifetime of the Kingdom of Northumbria, most inhabitants of northeast England did not consider themselves Danish, and were not perceived as such by other Anglo-Saxons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hadley|2002}}</ref>\n\nThe synthesis of Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian and Catholic and Pagan [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motifs]] within the Danelaw can be illustrated by an examination of stone sculpture. However, the tradition of mixing pagan and Catholic motifs is not unique to the Danelaw, and examples of such synthesis can be seen in previous examples, such as the Franks Casket. The [[Franks Casket]], believed to have been produced in Northumbria, includes depictions of Germanic legends and stories of the founding Roman and the Roman Church and is dated to the early eighth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Karkov|2011|pp=149\u2013152}}</ref> The Gosforth Cross, dated to the early tenth century, stands at 4.4 meters and is richly decorated with carvings of mythical beasts, Norse gods, and Catholic symbolism.<ref>{{harvnb|Berg|1958|pp=27\u201330}}</ref> Stone sculpture was not a practice of native Scandinavian culture, and the proliferation of stone monuments within the Danelaw shows the influence that the English had on Viking settlers. On one side of the Gosforth Cross is a depiction of the Crucifixion; whilst on the other are scenes from Ragnarok. The melding of these distinctive religious cultures can further be seen in the depiction of Mary Magdalene as a valkyrie, with a trailing dress and long pigtail.<ref>{{harvnb|Richards|1991|pp=121}}</ref> Although one can read the iconography as the triumph of Catholicism over paganism, it is possible that in the process of the Catholicizing (as distinct from conversion) the Vikings might have initially accepted the Catholic god as an addition to the broad pantheon of Pagan gods.<ref>{{harvnb|Richards|1991|pp=123}}</ref> The inclusion of pagan traditions in visual culture reflects the creation of a distinctive [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] culture.

Then in 1896, under the provisions of the [[Local Government Act 1894]], they became separate civil parishes, Limbury and Biscot becoming the parish of Limbury-cum-Biscot.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, Limbury was a small hamlet approximately two miles from Luton, near [[Leagrave]] village, at that time it consisted of just a few cottages and just two farms.\n\nMoated houses still existed in around Limbury at the beginning of the 20th century, the Moat House (which was originally just outside Limbury, and is now part of the neighbouring suburb of [[Saints]]) is the only one remaining (now a pub/restaurant<ref>[http://www.beerintheevening.com/pubs/s/21/21867/Old_Moat_House/Limbury Moat House, Limbury]</ref>), the building is reputed to be the oldest secular building in South Bedfordshire.\nDuring 2007 the Moat House had the roof rethatched.<ref>23 August edition of the Herald & Post Newspaper (Luton)</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Luton was rapidly changing from a hat manufacturing town to one relying mainly on engineering. New factories were being built in the town as well as the existing ones expanding, mainly in the motor industry (Vauxhall moved to Luton in 1905). This meant more workers were needed, many of whom were housed in Limbury. Hedges and the rural landscape fast disappeared in Limbury as new housing developments replaced them.\n\nWith the increased number of workers a new [[Baptist]] Church was built in 1906. The church was built by Mr Arthur Cole who had signed a contract the previous August 1905 with the church that included the line, 'I...... agree to build a chapel (at Limbury)......and (it) shall be finished in every particular so that the opening services may be held on Good Friday, 1906.'<ref>[http://www.limburybaptist.org.uk/HISTORY/index.html Baptist Church history]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the civil parish was abolished, with the urbanised area being annexed to [[Luton]], and the remaining part being split three-ways between [[Stopsley]], [[Streatley, Bedfordshire|Streatley]] and [[Sundon]] parishes.\n\nFurther expansion of Limbury came in the 1950s when it expanded north of the [[River Lea]], building on fields known as \u201cLimbury Mead\u201d, a term which is still used locally to refer to north Limbury.\n\n==Local Area==\n\nAt the centre of the original village of Limbury is Limbury Baptist Church, and a small parade of shops on Neville Road, and The Black Swan pub on Black Swan Lane. On Gardenia Avenue is St. Joseph\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, built in the 20th century to serve Limbury\u2019s growing Irish Catholic population, as well as the neighbouring St. Joseph\u2019s R.C. Primary School (until 2014 two separate schools, an infants and a juniors school). There are two other schools in the area, Norton Road Primary School and The Meads Primary School.\n\nThe main shopping area is now centred on Limbury Mead Square at the junction of Watermead Road and Calverton Road.\n\nThere are large open spaces in Limbury following the path of the River Lea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.luton.gov.uk/Leisure_and_culture/Lists/LutonDocuments/Word/Parks%20and%20Open%20Spaces%20in%20Luton.doc|title=List of Luton Parks}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nLimbury is in the north of [[Luton]], roughly 3 miles from the town centre. Neighbouring areas are [[Marsh Farm]] and [[Bramingham]] to the north, [[Saints, Luton|Saints]] to the south, [[Leagrave]] to the west, and [[Runfold, Luton|Runfold]] to the east.\n\nThe [[River Lea]] runs west to east through the middle of the area. Limbury is fairly flat apart from a small gradient from the river up to the central Limbury.\n\n==Politics==\nLimbury is part of the larger Limbury ward, which also includes part of [[Runfold, Luton|Runfold]], as well as the south eastern tip over spilling into the [[Saints, Luton|Saints]] ward. The ward is represented by Cllr Stephen Lewis ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]) and Cllr Jennifer Rowlands (Labour).\n\nThe ward forms part of the [[parliamentary constituency]] of [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]], and the MP is [[Kelvin Hopkins]] (Labour). Leagrave is within the [[East of England (European Parliament constituency)|East of England]].\n\n[[Image:Lutonwardmap.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Map of [[Luton]] showing Limbury]]\n{{-}}\n\n==Local Attractions==\n<div style=\"float:right;\">\n{{EngPlacesKey}}\n</div>\n\n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* [[Image:NTE icon.png]] [[Dunstable Downs]]\n* [[Image:UKAL icon.png]] [[Chiltern Hills]]\n* [[Image:UKAL icon.png]] [[Leagrave Park]]\n* [[Image:HR icon.svg]] [[Leighton Buzzard Light Railway]]\n* [[Image:Museum icon.png]] [[Luton Museum & Art Gallery]]\n* [[the hat Factory]]\n* [[Image:HH icon.png]] [[Luton Hoo]]\n* [[Image:Museum icon.png]] [[Mossman Collection]]\n* [[Someries castle]]\n* [[Image:Museum icon.png]] [[Stockwood Craft Museum]]\n* [[Image:UKAL icon.png]] [[Stockwood Park]]\n* [[Image:UKAL icon.png]] [[Wardown Park]]\n* [[Image:UKAL icon.png]] Waulud's Bank\n* [[Image:NTE icon.png]] [[Whipsnade Tree Cathedral]]\n* [[Image:Museum icon (red).png]] [[Whipsnade Wildlife Park]]\n* [[Woodside Farm and Wildfowl Park]]\n* [[Image:EH icon.svg]] [[Wrest Park Gardens]]\n|}\n\n==Local Newspapers==\nTwo weekly newspapers are delivered free to all the houses in Limbury.

The church was built by Mr Arthur Cole who had signed a contract the previous August 1905 with the church that included the line, 'I\u2026\u2026 agree to build a chapel (at Limbury)\u2026\u2026and (it) shall be finished in every particular so that the opening services may be held on Good Friday, 1906.'<ref>[http://www.limburybaptist.org.uk/HISTORY/index.html Baptist Church history]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the civil parish was abolished, with the urbanised area being annexed to [[Luton]], and the remaining part being split three-ways between [[Stopsley]], [[Streatley, Bedfordshire|Streatley]] and [[Sundon]] parishes.\n\nFurther expansion of Limbury came in the 1950s when it expanded north of the [[River Lea]], building on fields known as \u201cLimbury Mead\u201d, a term which is still used locally to refer to north Limbury.\n\n==Local Area==\n\nAt the centre of the original village of Limbury is Limbury Baptist Church, and a small parade of shops on Neville Road, and The Black Swan pub on Black Swan Lane. On Gardenia Avenue is St. Joseph\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, built in the 20th century to serve Limbury\u2019s growing Irish Catholic population, as well as the neighbouring St. Joseph\u2019s R.C. Primary School (until 2014 two separate schools, an infants and a juniors school). There are two other schools in the area, Norton Road Primary School and The Meads Primary School. \n\nThe main shopping area is now centred on Limbury Mead Square at the junction of Watermead Road and Calverton Road.\n\nThere are large open spaces in Limbury following the path of the River Lea.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.luton.gov.uk/Leisure_and_culture/Lists/LutonDocuments/Word/Parks%20and%20Open%20Spaces%20in%20Luton.doc|title=List of Luton Parks}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nLimbury is in the north of [[Luton]], roughly 3 miles from the town centre. Neighbouring areas are [[Marsh Farm]] and [[Bramingham]] to the north, [[Saints, Luton|Saints]] to the south, [[Leagrave]] to the west, and [[Runfold, Luton|Runfold]] to the east.\n\nThe [[River Lea]] runs west to east through the middle of the area. Limbury is fairly flat apart from a small gradient from the river up to the central Limbury.\n\n==Politics==\nLimbury is part of the larger Limbury ward, which also includes part of [[Runfold, Luton|Runfold]], as well as the south eastern tip over spilling into the [[Saints, Luton|Saints]] ward. The ward is represented by Cllr Stephen Lewis ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]) and Cllr Jennifer Rowlands (Labour).\n\nThe ward forms part of the [[parliamentary constituency]] of [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]], and the MP is [[Kelvin Hopkins]] (Labour).

Directed by [[Guy Ritchie]], who co-wrote the screenplay with [[John August]], it is a [[live-action]] adaptation of Disney's [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|1992 animated film of the same name]], which itself is based on the [[Aladdin|eponymous tale]] from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>{{efn|name=Origins}} The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Mena Massoud]], [[Naomi Scott]], [[Marwan Kenzari]], [[Navid Negahban]], [[Nasim Pedrad]], [[Billy Magnussen]], and [[Numan Acar]], as well as the voices of [[Alan Tudyk]] and [[Frank Welker]]. The plot follows [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], a street urchin, as he falls in love with [[Princess Jasmine]], befriends a wish-granting [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], and battles the wicked [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]].\n\nIn October 2016, Disney announced Ritchie would direct a live-action ''Aladdin'' remake. Smith was the first member of the cast to join, signing on to portray Genie in July 2017, and Massoud and Scott were confirmed for the two lead roles later that month. [[Principal photography]] began that September at [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England, also filming in the [[Wadi Rum|Wadi Rum Desert]] in Jordan, and lasted until January 2018. Additional filming and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] took place in August 2018.\n\n''Aladdin'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 24, 2019. It grossed $1 billion worldwide, becoming the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->34th<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!--> highest-grossing film of all-time]] during its theatrical run. The film received mixed reviews from critics; while the musical score, costumes and performances of Smith, Massoud and Scott were praised, criticisms were aimed at Ritchie's direction, the CGI effects, the deviations from the original film and Kenzari's performance as Jafar.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thewrap.com/aladdin-remake-rubs-critics-differently-from-rip-roaring-spectacle-to-cinematic-karaoke/| title=\u2018Aladdin\u2019 Remake Rubs Critics Differently, From \u2018Rip-Roaring Spectacle\u2019 to \u2018Cinematic Karaoke\u2019| author=Brian Welk| website=[[TheWrap]]| date=May 22, 2019| accessdate=May 22, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522183634/https://www.thewrap.com/aladdin-remake-rubs-critics-differently-from-rip-roaring-spectacle-to-cinematic-karaoke/| archive-date=May 22, 2019| url-status=live}}</ref> A sequel is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nAladdin, a kind-hearted [[street urchin]], living in the Arabian city of Agrabah along with his pet [[monkey]] Abu, rescues and befriends Princess Jasmine, who has snuck out of the palace to explore, tired of her sheltered life. Meanwhile, the [[grand vizier]], Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan with the support of Iago, his sardonic pet parrot. He seeks a [[magic lamp]] hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only \"the diamond in the rough\" is allowed to enter the cave.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine (while also meeting Jasmine's [[handmaiden]] Dalia, and pet tiger Rajah), he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp: since only Aladdin can enter the cave alive, he will retrieve the lamp for Jafar and Jafar will make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a falling ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but he double-crosses Aladdin and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, though Abu steals the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death.\n\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin gets the Genie to free them from the cave without using a wish on a technicality: Aladdin didn't rub the lamp as he stated the wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human. Abu is temporarily transformed into an elephant in the process.\n\nAladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see while the Genie goes out with Dalia. Jasmine realizes who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity; however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin's identity and, to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp, and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu, now a monkey again, and the carpet arrive with the lamp, but Aladdin loses consciousness before he can rub it. The Genie, impressed by Aladdin's good character, assumes he can Genie rules allow him to save Aladdin, but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin and the Genie with lies, but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin decides to reserve the Genie for then and refuses to free him. The Genie tells Aladdin that he was the first master he ever considered a friend and that he's now breaking his heart.\n\nIago snatches one of the guards' keys, and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes the Genie's new master, to his horror. As Aladdin realizes he has betrayed his friend the Genie and decides to free him, he notices the lamp is gone.\n\nJafar uses his first wish to become Sultan. When the loyal guards refuse to acknowledge the change, per Jasmine's request, he makes a second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer and imprisons the guards and Rajah. He then exposes Aladdin's identity to Jasmine and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland on the other side of the Earth. He threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding ceremony, Aladdin and Abu return, having been rescued by the magic carpet, and Jasmine steals back the lamp. Furious, Jafar transforms Iago into a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] to give chase. Jafar, angered by the Sultan's attempt to stop him, overpowers them and severely damaging the magic carpet in the process. Iago steals the lamp back.\n\nAladdin stalls by taunting Jafar for being second and powerless to the Genie, thereby tricking him into using his last wish to become the most powerful being in the universe. Due to the vagueness of the wish, the Genie is able to use it to turn Jafar into a genie; chained to the lamp without a master, Jafar is trapped inside, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie banishes them and throws Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders and repairs the magic carpet. Aladdin keeps his promise, using his last wish to free the Genie and allow him to live as a human. The Sultan declares that Jasmine will be the next ruler and tells her that Aladdin is a good person, outlines how worthy he is, and tells her as [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], she can overturn the law that requires her to marry a prince.\n\nThe Genie marries Dalia and leaves to explore the world and start a family with her. Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Mena Massoud]] as [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]]: <br />An impoverished but kind-hearted Agrabah thief and street urchin who is in love with Princess Jasmine.

Meanwhile, the [[grand vizier]], Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan with the support of Iago, his sardonic pet parrot. He seeks a [[magic lamp]] hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only \"the diamond in the rough\" is allowed to enter the cave.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine (while also meeting Jasmine's [[handmaiden]] Dalia, and pet tiger Rajah), he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp: since only Aladdin can enter the cave alive, he will retrieve the lamp for Jafar and Jafar will make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a falling ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but he double-crosses Aladdin and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, though Abu steals the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death.\n\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin gets the Genie to free them from the cave without using a wish on a technicality: Aladdin didn't rub the lamp as he stated the wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human. Abu is temporarily transformed into an elephant in the process.\n\nAladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see while the Genie goes out with Dalia. Jasmine realizes who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity; however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin's identity and, to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp, and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu, now a monkey again, and the carpet arrive with the lamp, but Aladdin loses consciousness before he can rub it. The Genie, impressed by Aladdin's good character, assumes he can Genie rules allow him to save Aladdin, but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin and the Genie with lies, but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin decides to reserve the Genie for then and refuses to free him. The Genie tells Aladdin that he was the first master he ever considered a friend and that he's now breaking his heart.\n\nIago snatches one of the guards' keys, and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes the Genie's new master, to his horror. As Aladdin realizes he has betrayed his friend the Genie and decides to free him, he notices the lamp is gone.\n\nJafar uses his first wish to become Sultan. When the loyal guards refuse to acknowledge the change, per Jasmine's request, he makes a second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer and imprisons the guards and Rajah. He then exposes Aladdin's identity to Jasmine and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland on the other side of the Earth. He threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding ceremony, Aladdin and Abu return, having been rescued by the magic carpet, and Jasmine steals back the lamp. Furious, Jafar transforms Iago into a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] to give chase. Jafar, angered by the Sultan's attempt to stop him, overpowers them and severely damaging the magic carpet in the process. Iago steals the lamp back.\n\nAladdin stalls by taunting Jafar for being second and powerless to the Genie, thereby tricking him into using his last wish to become the most powerful being in the universe. Due to the vagueness of the wish, the Genie is able to use it to turn Jafar into a genie; chained to the lamp without a master, Jafar is trapped inside, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie banishes them and throws Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders and repairs the magic carpet. Aladdin keeps his promise, using his last wish to free the Genie and allow him to live as a human. The Sultan declares that Jasmine will be the next ruler and tells her that Aladdin is a good person, outlines how worthy he is, and tells her as [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], she can overturn the law that requires her to marry a prince.\n\nThe Genie marries Dalia and leaves to explore the world and start a family with her. Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie / Mariner]]: <br />A comedically eccentric and kindly [[jinn]] who has the power to grant three wishes to whoever possesses his magic lamp.

Over 2,000 actors and actresses had auditioned for the roles of Aladdin and Jasmine, but finding a male lead of Middle Eastern or Indian descent in his 20s, who could act and sing, had proven difficult for the producers. [[Naomi Scott]] and [[Tara Sutaria]] were the final two actresses in the running for the role of Jasmine, but neither could be cast until a chemistry test was done with whomever would be cast as Aladdin.

[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFCoSSKTffcC&pg=PA382#v=onepage (Google Books)]</ref>\n\nThe most basic explanation for the hypostatic union is Jesus Christ being both God and man. He is both perfectly divine and perfectly human.\n\nThe [[Athanasian Creed]] recognized this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that \"He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is human from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely human, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although he is God and human, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by his divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of his essence, but by the unity of his person. For just as one human is both rational soul and flesh, so too the one Christ is both God and human.\"\n\n==''Hypostasis''==\n{{Main|Hypostasis (philosophy)}}\n\nThe Greek term ''hypostasis'' had come into use as a technical term prior to the Christological debates of the late fourth and fifth centuries.  In pre-Christian times, [[Greek philosophy]] (primarily [[Stoicism]]) used the word.<ref>R. Norris, \"Hypostasis,\" in The Encyclopedia of Early Christianity, ed. E. Ferguson.

He is both perfectly divine and perfectly human.\n\nThe [[Athanasian Creed]] recognized this doctrine and affirmed its importance, stating that \"He is God from the essence of the Father, begotten before time; and he is human from the essence of his mother, born in time; completely God, completely human, with a rational soul and human flesh; equal to the Father as regards divinity, less than the Father as regards humanity. Although he is God and human, yet Christ is not two, but one. He is one, however, not by his divinity being turned into flesh, but by God's taking humanity to himself. He is one, certainly not by the blending of his essence, but by the unity of his person.

{"title_page": "Port, Templeport", "text_new": "[[File:Port, Templeport.jpg|thumb|Road beside Templeport Lough, County Cavan, Ireland, heading west.]]\n\n'''Port''' ({{Irish derived place name|Port meaning 'A Landing-Place'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state-\n\n''The soil is light yellow clay intermixed with sand stone...The townland is bounded on the W. side by a large lake, on the E. bank of which is situated the parish church. It is a handsome modern building to which is attached a graveyard in which nearly all the Protestant inhabitants are buried. There is an island belonging to this townland near the centre of the lake.''\n\nPort is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes.\n\nThe townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas. He doubts whether the said collation and provision of the said vicarage which, as the pope has learned, is still void as above, holds good. Dignum [arbitramur]''.<ref>Calendar of Papal Registers Relating To Great Britain and Ireland, Volume 6, 1404-1415, ed. W H Bliss and J A Twemlow (London, 1904), p. 476.</ref> In the 16th century these ecclesiastical lands in Templeport were seized in the course of the [[Reformation in Ireland]] and kept first by the English monarch and then eventually granted to the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]].\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 20 June 1588 valued the total vicarage of Templeport at \u00a310.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 19 September 1590 found ''the termon or hospital lands of Templeport to consist of four polls of land at a yearly value of 4 shillings''.

This grant covered the two extra polls of ecclesiastical land in the parish which had been overlooked in the previous inquisitions and grants.\n\nA survey held by Sir [[John Davies (poet)]] at [[Cavan]] Town on 6 September 1608 stated that- ''the ecclesiastical lands of Templeporte were containing 6 pulls lying near the parish church and that the rectory was appropriated to the [[Abbey of Kells]], [[County Meath]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=popOAAAAIAAJ&dq=killfeart+templeporte+killadough&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=templeporte]</ref> Port was one of these six pulls.\n\nAn Inquisition held in [[Cavan]] Town on 25 September 1609 found ''the termon land of Templeport to consist of six polls of land, out of which the [[Bishop of Kilmore]] was entitled to a rent of 10 shillings and 2/3rd of a beef per annum''. Port was one of these six polls. The Inquisition then granted the lands to the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore.\n\nBy a deed dated 6 April 1612, Robert Draper, the Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh]] granted a joint ''lease of 60 years over the termons or herenachs of, inter alia, 6 polls in Templepurt'' to [[Oliver Lambart, 1st Lord Lambart, Baron of Cavan]], of [[Kilbeggan]], [[County Westmeath]] and Sir [[Garret Moore, 1st Viscount Moore]], of [[Mellifont Abbey]], [[County Louth]].

The church was in a ruinous condition and the parsonage was a timber house.\n\nOn 9 March 1669 King [[Charles II of England]] granted ''to Josias Hallington, incumbent of Templeport, Co.

In his book ''Memoirs of Major M\u2019Gauran'', Volume I, Page 127 (London 1786), he states (about the year 1765)- ''Upon my return from Luxemburg, the General wrote to Mr. John M'Gauran, of '''Port''', in the County of Cavan, married to Ann O'Donnel, the General's cousin-german, telling him that a cousin of his, grand-son of Colonel Bryan M'Gauran, and son of Mary O'Donnel, was serving then in Loudon's regiment, quartered where he resided. Mr. M'Gauran, jealous of my prosperity, having many young sons of his own, whom he thought better entitled to the General's protection; but, notwithstanding, though he knew me to be his own near relation, wrote to the General, to inform him that I was not the son of Mary O'Donnel, but an impostor.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nPort is bounded on the north by [[Muinaghan]] townland, on the west by [[Kildoagh]] and [[Corboy Glebe]] townlands, on the south by [[Ray, Templeport]] and [[Cloneary]] townlands and on the east by [[Cor, Templeport]] and [[Kilsallagh]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Templeport Lough, Inch Island, woods, streams and spring wells. The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state-\n\n''The soil is light yellow clay intermixed with sand stone...The townland is bounded on the W. side by a large lake, on the E. bank of which is situated the parish church. It is a handsome modern building to which is attached a graveyard in which nearly all the Protestant inhabitants are buried. There is an island belonging to this townland near the centre of the lake.''\n\nPort is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes.\n\nThe townland covers 335 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe old name of the townland was Templeport (now shortened to Port) which is the anglicisation of the Gaelic ''Teampall An Phoirt'' (\"The Church of the Port or Bank or Landing-Place\"). The church referred to is the old church on St. Mogue's Island in the middle of Port Lake. This church fell into disuse in medieval times and a new church was built on the opposite shore of the lake. It was forfeited to Queen Elizabeth in 1590 and started use as a Protestant church in about 1610. It is very unlikely that the island church ever served as the parish church because there was only one boat available and it would have been extremely inconvenient if not logistically impossible for hundreds of worshipers to go to and from the church in time for mass, especially in rough winter weather. It was built firstly for the convenience of any pilgrim wishing to go to St. Mogue's birthplace and secondly as an interment or mortuary chapel for the few family members attending burials on the island.\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Aghavanme''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland ''Aghowanny''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Port''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nAn 1809 map of ecclesiastical lands in Templeport depicts the townland as ''Templeport'' with a subdivision in the northeast part named ''Portlargy'' ({{Irish derived place name|Port L\u00e1irge meaning 'The Hillside of the Landing-Place'}})[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1809-tp-map.html]\n\nSaint [[M\u00e1ed\u00f3c of Ferns]], also known as St. Mogue, was born in the island of Breaghwee (Originally Inis Brechmaighe meaning the 'Island of  the \nWolf Plain', now called Inch Island which is an abbreviation and duplication of the Irish Inis) in Templeport Lake about 558 A.D.[http://www.bawnboy.com/History-Heritage-Folklore/pages/st-mogue-of-tp.html]\n\nThe earliest mention of the name in the annals of Ireland is in the Annals of the Four Masters for 1496 A.D.- ''M1496.17- Magauran, i.e. Donnell Bearnagh, Chief of Teallach-Eachdhach, was treacherously slain before the altar of the church of Teampall-an-phuirt, by Teige, the son of Hugh, son of Owen Magauran; and the marks of the blows aimed at him are still visible in the corners of the altar.''\n\nThe church had two different rights, one was ownership of the church lands (both termon lands and the site of the church and graveyard) and the other was ownership of the church tithes (also called the rectorial tithes or the rectory) which were a tenth of all the produce of the lands within the parish which were not owned by the church. These rights were often owned by different people and so had a different history, as set out below.\n\n'''Church Lands'''\n\nPort formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish. It would have belonged to the parish priest and the erenach family rather than the McGovern chief. The earliest mention of the name in the Vatican archives is for  2 September 1414- ''To the archdeacon of Kilmore. Mandate to collate and assign to Magonius Macamragan, priest, of the diocese of Kilmore, if found fit, the perpetual vicarage, value not exceeding 6 marks, of Insula Brechungy alias Tempullapuret in the said diocese, collation and provision of which, on its voidance by the death of Andrew Macgamragan, was made to him by bishop Nicholas.
