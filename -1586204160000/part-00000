Chaired by barrister [[Shami Chakrabarti]], the inquiry was launched following comments made by two high-profile Labour figures, [[Naz Shah]] and [[Ken Livingstone]], that some asserted were antisemitic in nature; Shah, a [[Member of Parliament]] and Livingstone, the former [[Mayor of London]], were subsequently suspended from the party pending an investigation. The inquiry presented its findings on 30 June 2016, stating that although antisemitism and other types of racism were not endemic within Labour, there was an \"occasionally toxic atmosphere\".\n\n==Background==\nThe inquiry was established by Labour Party leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] on 29 April 2016, following the suspension of Naz Shah, the Labour MP for [[Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford West]], and Ken Livingstone, the former Mayor of London, after media reports had emerged that Shah had reposted a graphic on [[Twitter]] during 2014 suggesting that Israel should be relocated to the United States, after which Livingstone defended her during a radio interview, adding that \"When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that [[Jews]] should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.\" Both were subsequently suspended from the party pending an investigation into their conduct.<ref name=Guardian-2016-04-29>{{cite news |first=Heather |last=Stewart |first2=Anushka |last2=Asthana |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims |title=Jeremy Corbyn sets up inquiry into Labour antisemitism claims |publisher=Guardian Media Group |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 April 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706220534/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims |archivedate=6 July 2016}}</ref><ref name=BBC-2016-06-30>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672022 |title=Chakrabarti inquiry: Labour not overrun by anti-Semitism |publisher=BBC News |date=30 June 2016 |accessdate=30 June 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630121456/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36672022 |archivedate=30 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAnnouncing the inquiry, Corbyn told ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper that he was determined to expunge racism from the party: \"Labour is an anti-racist party to its core and has a long and proud history of standing against racism, including antisemitism.\" He appointed Shami Chakrabarti, the former head of the human rights advocacy group [[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]], to chair the investigation. The inquiry's remit would be to recommend how Labour could best tackle instances of racism, including cases of antisemitism and [[Islamophobia]], with Chakrabarti speaking to various groups affected by such issues, such as the Jewish community.

Among the most important drivers are the acknowledgment of the energy system\u2019s impact on climate change, as well as the diminishing resources that threaten energy security.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nClimate change can be attributed to the use of fossil fuel energy and the contribution of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This increased level of greenhouse gas emissions creates adverse effects on a changing climate such as increased intensity and frequency of natural disasters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trenberth|first=Kevin|date=2015|title=Attribution of climate extreme events|url=http://www.theurbanclimatologist.com/uploads/4/4/2/5/44250401/attributionextremeevents.pdf|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=5|issue=8|pages=725\u2013730|via=|doi=10.1038/nclimate2657|bibcode=2015NatCC...5..725T}}</ref> The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] has said with high certainty that society has 12 years to complete an entire transition to avoid catastrophic climate change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf|title=Summary for Policy Makers|last=|first=|date=2019|website=IPCC|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This reality has motivated the conversation of a renewable energy transition as a mitigation tactic.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry faces risk completely separate from the impacts of climate change. Fossil fuels are a limited resource and are at risk of reaching a peak in which diminishing returns will become prevalent.<ref name=\"Mishra 337\u2013350\"/> Uncertainty with the supply of this resource questions the security of the industry and the investments in fossil fuel companies. Companies such as Blackrock are evaluating these risks and determining their desire level of involvement with the industry as a result.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter|title=Larry Fink's Letter to CEOs|website=BlackRock|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> These driving conversations are motivating organizations to reconsider the future of the energy sector.\n\n== Technologies ==\n\n=== Wind energy ===\n[[Wind power|Wind energy]] is a viable form of renewable energy, as wind is abundant and inexhaustible. Its use produces no toxic pollution nor greenhouse gas emissions. However, conflicts can arise concerning land use, as the wind turbines use between 30 and 141 acres per megawatt of power output capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denholm|first=P.|date=2009|title=Land-use requirements of modern wind power plants in the United States|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45834.pdf|journal=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Some opponents of wind energy argue that the land could be better used, although the land can still be used for grazing livestock, agriculture, and highways.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Another issue regarding wind energy concerns the disturbance to wildlife.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Many studies have been done to assess the impact of wind turbines on bird and bat populations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The disturbance of [[wind turbine]]s has been found to be relatively low and does not pose a threat to species population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/pdfs/birds_and_bats_fact_sheet.pdf|title=Wind turbine interactions with birds, bats, and their habitats: A summary of research results and priority questions|last=|first=|date=2010|website=National Wind Coordinating Committee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar energy ===\n[[File:Solar panels in the desert.jpg|thumb|Photovoltaic array at the Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center in Montezuma County, Colorado. This site uses 95% renewable energy and is an example of the renewable energy transition occurring.]]\n\nSolar energy is another commonly used renewable energy source, but still comes with a few drawbacks. Similarly to wind energy, land use is a concern. However, solar panels can be placed on rooftops and in this case they do not take up space that could have been used for something more productive. Panels can also be placed at low quality locations such as brownfields, abandoned mining land, or existing transportation and transmission corridors. The manufacturing of solar panels also has some negative impacts. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}They require a significant amount of water to be produced, but dry-cooling technology can reduce water use at manufacturing plants by approximately 90 percent.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hand|first=M.M.|date=2012|title=Renewable Electricity Futures Study|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/52409-4.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=4|id=NREL/TP-6A20-52409|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Geothermal energy ===\nGeothermal energy is another type of viable and increasingly common renewable energy source. Water is also used in obtaining this type of energy. Depending on the cooling technology used, geothermal plants can require between 1,700 and 4,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of energy produced. However, most geothermal plants can use either geothermal fluid or freshwater for cooling, and using the prior has a significantly lesser environmental impact. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} There are both open-looped and close-looped geothermal systems, and open-loop systems emit small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and boron.<ref>{{Cite document|url=|title=A Guide to Geothermal Energy and the Environment|last=Kagel|first=A.|date=2007|website=Geothermal Energy Association|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Hydroelectric energy ===\nHydroelectric power includes both massive hydroelectric dams and small run-of-the-river plants. Land use is a topic of concern regarding this energy source, as the size of the reservoir created by a hydroelectric project can vary widely. Flooding land for a hydroelectric reservoir has a significant environmental impact, as it destroys forest, wildlife habitat, agricultural land, and scenic lands{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. There is also a significant impact on wildlife. Fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Aside from direct contact, there are also wildlife impacts within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoirs will have above average amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and lead to [[eutrophication]]. In addition, reservoirs are required to release a certain amount of water every year to prevent rivers downstream from drying up, which would be detrimental to those ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Biofuel energy ===\nBiofuel can come from [[cyanobacteria]], or blue-green algae. They contain properties that allow them to use [[photosynthesis]] to reproduce at 15-30x the rate of other biofuel sources, such as corn<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/sites/agscid7/files/bioenergy/education/algae_final_interactive.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Blue-green algae maintain oil that can be extracted from it and processed into a viable fuel solution that doesn't inhibit fossil fuels.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n=== Biomass energy ===\nBiomass is an organic compound found in plants and animals. This biomass is then burned and a chemical energy is released as heat which then can be generate electricity. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Biomass energy is cleaner than coal and other fossil fuels, but burning biomass can greatly impact biodiversity and can contribute to green house gas emissions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} With this being said, biomass energy is not a renewable energy source that can be used on a global scale to mitigate climate change, but it can be beneficial in some areas. \n\n== Legislation ==\n\n=== Current Legislation ===\n\n==== Federal Legislation ====\n\n===== 1.

Businesses that have joined the renewable energy cause do so by relying on business models. The need for business models, when dealing with the economics of the renewable energy transition, are crucial due to the lack of concrete research done in this area. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These models show projections of marginal costs, efficiency, and demand in different periods of time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Scott T.|last2=Straker|first2=Karla|last3=Wrigley|first3=Cara|date=2019-07-01|title=The discourses of power \u2013 governmental approaches to business models in the renewable energy transition|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=130|pages=41\u201359|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.050|issn=0301-4215}}</ref> Business models are financial assistants that help guide businesses, companies, and individuals looking to get involved.\n\n=== Global rivalries ===\nGlobal rivalries have a contribution to the driving forces of the economics behind the renewable energy transition. Competition to reach ultimate efficiency with renewable energy is driving countries to compete with one another. Technological innovations developed within a country has the potential to become an economic force.<ref>Scholten, D., Criekemans, D., & de Graaf, T. V. (2020).

Its use produces no toxic pollution nor greenhouse gas emissions. However, conflicts can arise concerning land use, as the wind turbines use between 30 and 141 acres per megawatt of power output capacity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Denholm|first=P.|date=2009|title=Land-use requirements of modern wind power plants in the United States|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45834.pdf|journal=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Some opponents of wind energy argue that the land could be better used, although the land can still be used for grazing livestock, agriculture, and highways.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Another issue regarding wind energy concerns the disturbance to wildlife.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Many studies have been done to assess the impact of wind turbines on bird and bat populations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The disturbance of [[wind turbine]]s has been found to be relatively low and does not pose a threat to species population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www1.eere.energy.gov/wind/pdfs/birds_and_bats_fact_sheet.pdf|title=Wind turbine interactions with birds, bats, and their habitats: A summary of research results and priority questions|last=|first=|date=2010|website=National Wind Coordinating Committee|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Solar energy ===\n[[File:Solar panels in the desert.jpg|thumb|Photovoltaic array at the Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center in Montezuma County, Colorado.

Similarly to wind energy, land use is a concern. However, solar panels can be placed on rooftops and in this case they do not take up space that could have been used for something more productive. Panels can also be placed at low quality locations such as brownfields, abandoned mining land, or existing transportation and transmission corridors.

Water is also used in obtaining this type of energy. Depending on the cooling technology used, geothermal plants can require between 1,700 and 4,000 gallons of water per megawatt-hour of energy produced. However, most geothermal plants can use either geothermal fluid or freshwater for cooling, and using the prior has a significantly lesser environmental impact. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} There are both open-looped and close-looped geothermal systems, and open-loop systems emit small amounts of hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and boron.<ref>{{Cite document|url=|title=A Guide to Geothermal Energy and the Environment|last=Kagel|first=A.|date=2007|website=Geothermal Energy Association|url-status=live|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Hydroelectric energy ===\nHydroelectric power includes both massive hydroelectric dams and small run-of-the-river plants. Land use is a topic of concern regarding this energy source, as the size of the reservoir created by a hydroelectric project can vary widely. Flooding land for a hydroelectric reservoir has a significant environmental impact, as it destroys forest, wildlife habitat, agricultural land, and scenic lands{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. There is also a significant impact on wildlife. Fish and other organisms can be injured and killed by turbine blades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Aside from direct contact, there are also wildlife impacts within the dammed reservoirs and downstream from the facility. Reservoirs will have above average amounts of sediments and nutrients, which can cultivate an excess of algae and lead to [[eutrophication]]. In addition, reservoirs are required to release a certain amount of water every year to prevent rivers downstream from drying up, which would be detrimental to those ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Biofuel energy ===\nBiofuel can come from [[cyanobacteria]], or blue-green algae. They contain properties that allow them to use [[photosynthesis]] to reproduce at 15-30x the rate of other biofuel sources, such as corn<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/sites/agscid7/files/bioenergy/education/algae_final_interactive.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. Blue-green algae maintain oil that can be extracted from it and processed into a viable fuel solution that doesn't inhibit fossil fuels.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n=== Biomass energy ===\nBiomass is an organic compound found in plants and animals. This biomass is then burned and a chemical energy is released as heat which then can be generate electricity. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Biomass energy is cleaner than coal and other fossil fuels, but burning biomass can greatly impact biodiversity and can contribute to green house gas emissions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} With this being said, biomass energy is not a renewable energy source that can be used on a global scale to mitigate climate change, but it can be beneficial in some areas. \n\n== Legislation ==\n\n=== Current Legislation ===\n\n==== Federal Legislation ====\n\n===== 1.

Presidential Memorandum: Federal Leadership on Energy Management =====\nThis Presidential Memorandum was issued by President Barack Obama on December 5, 2013. This directive established new goals for renewable energy as well as new energy management practices. The Memorandum set a new renewable energy use target, with the goal of 20% of electric energy consumed by Federal agencies to be derived from renewable sources. It also addresses building performance and energy management, and touches on a few other topics related to renewable energy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2013/12/05/presidential-memorandum-federal-leadership-energy-management|title=Presidential Memorandum -- Federal Leadership on Energy Management|date=2013-12-05|website=whitehouse.gov|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>. \n\n===== 6. The President's Climate Action Plan of 2013 =====\nThis plan was first created in 2007 by President Barack Obama and was updated every two years afterwards until 2013. This plan began with an outline on \"Cutting Carbon Pollution in America.\" This section describes plans to cut emissions from power plants and how to promote leadership in renewable energy, along with several other topics related to decreasing carbon dioxide emissions across several sectors. There are two other sections (Prepare the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, Lead International Efforts to Address Global Climate Change) that, while integral to the conversation regarding climate change, do not directly address renewable energy<ref>President Barack Obama (2013). \"The President's Climate Action Plan.\" ''Executive Office of the President.'' https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf</ref>.\n\n== Economic Aspects ==\n=== Business models ===\nEconomic driving forces in the renewable energy transition take multiple approaches. Businesses that have joined the renewable energy cause do so by relying on business models. The need for business models, when dealing with the economics of the renewable energy transition, are crucial due to the lack of concrete research done in this area. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These models show projections of marginal costs, efficiency, and demand in different periods of time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Scott T.|last2=Straker|first2=Karla|last3=Wrigley|first3=Cara|date=2019-07-01|title=The discourses of power \u2013 governmental approaches to business models in the renewable energy transition|journal=Energy Policy|language=en|volume=130|pages=41\u201359|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2019.03.050|issn=0301-4215}}</ref> Business models are financial assistants that help guide businesses, companies, and individuals looking to get involved.\n\n=== Global rivalries ===\nGlobal rivalries have a contribution to the driving forces of the economics behind the renewable energy transition. Competition to reach ultimate efficiency with renewable energy is driving countries to compete with one another. Technological innovations developed within a country has the potential to become an economic force.<ref>Scholten, D., Criekemans, D., & de Graaf, T. V. (2020). An Energy Transition Amidst Great Power Rivalry.

In the past, inconsistencies in the renewable energy field had caused skepticism. The increase in returns in the market has changed that perception. Recently, the costs for these energies have been reduced dramatically. For solar and wind power, the costs have dropped up to 60 to 80 percent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Stephen|date=2020-01-02|title=The Renewable Energy Transition Energy Path Divergence, Increasing Returns and Mutually Reinforcing Leads in the State-Market Symbiosis|journal=New Political Economy|volume=25|issue=1|pages=57\u201371|doi=10.1080/13563467.2018.1562430|issn=1356-3467}}</ref>\n\n=== Economic players ===\n\n==== Heating industry ====\nIn the renewable energy transition, the heating industry becomes an economic player. The heating industry is an interesting player as it entails many components. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} When dealing with heat and the transition to renewable resources, the entire area being heated comes into play.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} When assessing the economic benefits of this transition, the costs are atop of the list of information needed. In order to make this transition in the heating industry costs such as if the costs to install these systems would produce a positive turnout. A system of such was implemented in Denmark that focused on wind power to help contribute to heating.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The results of this showed a decrease in heating costs from 132 kWH to roughly 60 to 80 kWH. The results draw economic improvements in this transition by showing more efficiency in the heating industry and an increased value in wind power.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.enpol.2019.110944|title = Policy paradigms for optimal residential heat savings in a transition to 100% renewable energy systems|year = 2019|last1 = Hvelplund|first1 = Frede|last2 = Krog|first2 = Louise|last3 = Nielsen|first3 = Steffen|last4 = Terkelsen|first4 = Elsebeth|last5 = Madsen|first5 = Kristian Brun|journal = Energy Policy|volume = 134|pages = 110944}}</ref>\n\n==== Power systems ====\nPower systems are economic players that take many contributors into account. When looking for economic benefits behind power systems, savings and costs are crucial topics being addressed. A determinant in addressing the costs and savings of power systems is the alternative routes to [[Greenhouse gas|GHG emissions.]] Egypt introduced a plan to do so by stopping conventional power plants and converting them over to hybrid and wind farm plants.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The results of this were seen to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and save the state up to $14 million dollars.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.egyr.2019.08.006|title = Economic and environmental benefits of increasing the renewable energy sources in the power system|year = 2019|last1 = Nassar|first1 = Ibrahim A.|last2 = Hossam|first2 = Kholoud|last3 = Abdella|first3 = Mahmoud Mohamed|journal = Energy Reports|volume = 5|pages = 1082\u20131088}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n== Social Aspects ==\n\n=== Influences ===\nTo gather a realistic understanding of the renewable energy transition, influences should be analyzed to understand the scope of the environment and conversation surrounding the transition. One of these influences is that of the oil industry. The oil industry controls the large majority of the world's energy supply and needs as it is the most accessible and available resource we have today.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} With a history of continued success and sustained demand, the oil industry has become a stable aspect of society, the economy and the energy sector.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To transition to renewable energy technologies, our government and economy must address the oil industry and its control of the energy sector.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lenferna|first=Alex|date=2018-11-22|title=Divest\u2013Invest: A Moral Case for Fossil Fuel Divestment|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780198813248.003.0008}}</ref>\n\nOne way that oil companies are able to continue their work despite growing environmental, social and economic concerns is through lobbying efforts within local and national government systems. Lobbying is defined as to conduct activities aimed at influencing public officials and especially members of a legislative body on legislation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lobby|title=Definition of LOBBY|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, the climate lobby has been highly successful in limiting regulations on the oil industry and enabling business as usual techniques. From 1988 to 2005, [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]], one of the largest oil companies in the world, spent nearly $16 million in anti-climate change lobbying and providing misleading information about climate change to the general public.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frumhoff|first=Peter C.|last2=Heede|first2=Richard|last3=Oreskes|first3=Naomi|date=2015-07-23|title=The climate responsibilities of industrial carbon producers|journal=Climatic Change|volume=132|issue=2|pages=157\u2013171|doi=10.1007/s10584-015-1472-5|bibcode=2015ClCh..132..157F|issn=0165-0009}}</ref> It is examples such as these, that show the significance of the oil industry as stakeholders within the government. In order for the renewable energy transition to succeed, the oil lobbying should be addressed and met with a strong economic, social and environmental case. The oil industry acquires lots of support through our banking and investment structure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The stabile nature of oil stock throughout history makes it a great option for investors. By investing in the fossil fuel industry, we provide them with financial support to continue with their business ventures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rimmer|first=Matthew|date=2018|title=Divest New York: The City of New York, C40, Fossil Fuel Divestment, and Climate Litigation|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3379421|issn=1556-5068}}</ref> The concept that we should no longer support the industry financially has led to the social movement known as divestment.

One of the positive social impacts that is predicted is the use of local energy sources to provide stability and economic stimulation to local communities.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Not only does this benefit local utilities through portfolio diversification, but it also creates opportunities for energy trade between communities, states and regions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Neves|first=Ana Rita|last2=Leal|first2=V\u00edtor|date=December 2010|title=Energy sustainability indicators for local energy planning: Review of current practices and derivation of a new framework|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|volume=14|issue=9|pages=2723\u20132735|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2010.07.067|issn=1364-0321}}</ref> Additionally, energy security has been a struggle worldwide that has led to many issues in the OPEC countries and beyond. Energy security is evaluated by analyzing the accessibility, availability, sustainability, regulatory and technological opportunity of our energy portfolio. Renewable Energy presents an opportunity to increase our energy security by becoming energy independent and have localized grids that decrease energy risks geopolitically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3769&context=soss_research|title=Conceptualizing and measuring energy security: A synthesized approach|last=SOVACOOL|first=Benjamin|date=2011|website=ink.library.smu.edu.sg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> In this sense, the benefits and positive outcomes of the renewable energy transition are profound.\n\nThere are also risks and negative impacts on society because of the renewable energy transition that need to be mitigated. The coal mining industry plays a large part in the existing energy portfolio and is one of the biggest targets for climate change activists due to the intense pollution and habitat disruption that it creates. The transition to renewable is expected to have decrease the need and viability of coal mining in the future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strangleman|first=Tim|date=June 2001|title=Networks, Place and Identities in Post\u2010industrial Mining Communities|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=25|issue=2|pages=253\u2013267|doi=10.1111/1468-2427.00310|issn=0309-1317}}</ref> This is a positive for climate change action, but can have severe impacts on the communities that rely on this business. Coal mining communities are considered vulnerable to the renewable energy transition.

Her audition involved a training camp of three days and two nights, in which participants were expected to learn a new song, a dance routine, and a script. Out of 25,000 applicants, nine were selected for the camp in which Takahashi passed.<ref name=\"JPTimes\" /> Her debut with the group was on their single \"[[Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band]]\", and her first appearance on a Morning Musume full-length release was their fourth studio album, ''[[4th Ikimasshoi!]]''. Her first appearance within a [[Hello! Project shuffle unit]] release was on the 2002 single \"Shiawase Beam! Suki Suki Beam!\" under the group name [[Hello! Project shuffle units#Happy 7|Happy 7]].\n\nIn 2003, Takahashi replaced [[Mari Yaguchi]] in the Morning Musume spinoff group [[Mini Moni]], first appearing in the group's movie ''[[Mini Moni ja Movie: Okashi na Daib\u014dken!]]'' and its accompanying soundtrack. Later in 2003, she was part of the Morning Musume splinter group [[Morning Musume Sakuragumi]], which performed mainly slower numbers on the group's two [[extended play|EPs]], \"[[Hare Ame Nochi Suki]]\" and \"[[Sakura Mankai]]\", and the shuffle group [[7Air]], an R&B-inspired septet.\n\nTakahashi's vocals became more prominent on the second and final Mini Moni album, ''[[Mini Moni Songs 2]]'' (2004), as well as on Morning Musume's singles from their Spring 2004 release \"[[Roman: My Dear Boy]]\" onward. She also had a duet with [[Tsunku]] on the cover version of Tsunku and [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]'s duet \"[[Love: Destiny (song)|Love: Since 1999]]\" on his solo album ''[[Take1]]''.\n\nIn 2005, Morning Musume's first single release of the year, \"[[The Manpower!!!]]\", featured Takahashi in a prominent co-lead-vocal role, a role she has retained on subsequent singles since. In the summer of that year, she became part of the 2005 shuffle Group [[Elegies (J-pop)|Elegies]].\n\nIn 2006, Takahashi played the lead role, Sapphire, in ''[[Princess Knight|Ribon no Kishi]] The Musical,'' which was a collaboration work by Hello! Project and the Japanese all-female theatrical company [[Takarazuka Revue]]. The musical was based on [[Tezuka Osamu]]'s manga and also starred [[v-u-den]], [[Nozomi Tsuji]], [[Aya Matsuura]], and [[Natsumi Abe]], as well as Marcia and Kaoru Ebira of the [[Takarazuka Revue]]. On July 2, Takahashi released her first and only solo single to date, \"Yume Kara Samete\".\n\nFollowing then-leader [[Hitomi Yoshizawa]]'s graduation from Morning Musume on May 6, 2007, the current sub-leader, [[Miki Fujimoto]] ascended to the leader position, with Takahashi becoming the new sub-leader of the group.

Project]] and best known as leader of [[Morning Musume]] and [[Hello!Project]] until 2011, and former member of its popular subgroup [[Mini Moni]].<ref name=\"EC graduates\">{{cite web|url= http://www.hello-online.org/index.php?act=helloonline&CODE=article&topic=719|title= The end of an era: Elder Club graduates|date= February 1, 2009|publisher= Hello!Online}}</ref>\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Morning Musume Career (2001\u20132011) ===\nAi Takahashi joined Japanese idol group Morning Musume in 2001 as part of the group's fifth generation, along with [[Makoto Ogawa]], [[Asami Konno]], and [[Risa Niigaki]]. Her audition involved a training camp of three days and two nights, in which participants were expected to learn a new song, a dance routine and a script. Out of 25,000 applicants, nine were selected for the camp in which Takahashi passed.<ref name=\"JPTimes\" /> Her debut with the group was on their single \"[[Mr. Moonlight: Ai no Big Band]]\", and her first appearance on a Morning Musume full-length release was their fourth studio album, ''[[4th Ikimasshoi!]]''. Her first appearance within a [[Hello! Project shuffle unit]] release was on the 2002 single \"Shiawase Beam! Suki Suki Beam!\" under the group name [[Hello! Project shuffle units#Happy 7|Happy 7]].\n\nIn 2003, Takahashi replaced [[Mari Yaguchi]] in the Morning Musume spinoff group [[Mini Moni]], first appearing in the group's movie ''[[Mini Moni ja Movie: Okashi na Daib\u014dken!]]'' and its accompanying soundtrack. Later in 2003, she was part of the Morning Musume splinter group [[Morning Musume Sakuragumi]], which performed mainly slower numbers on the group's two [[extended play|EPs]], \"[[Hare Ame Nochi Suki]]\" and \"[[Sakura Mankai]]\", and the shuffle group [[7Air]], an R&B-inspired septet.\n\nTakahashi's vocals became more prominent on the second and final Mini Moni album, ''[[Mini Moni Songs 2]]'' (2004), as well as on Morning Musume's singles from their Spring 2004 release \"[[Roman: My Dear Boy]]\" onward. She also had a duet with [[Tsunku]] on the cover version of Tsunku and [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]'s duet \"[[Love: Destiny (song)|Love: Since 1999]]\" on his solo album ''[[Take1]]''.\n\nIn 2005, Morning Musume's first single release of the year, \"[[The Manpower!!!]]\", featured Takahashi in a prominent co-lead-vocal role, a role she has retained on subsequent singles since. In the summer of that year, she became part of the 2005 shuffle Group [[Elegies (J-pop)|Elegies]].\n\nIn 2006, Takahashi played the lead role, Sapphire, in ''[[Princess Knight|Ribon no Kishi]] The Musical,'' which was a collaboration work by Hello! Project and the Japanese all-female theatrical company [[Takarazuka Revue]]. The musical was based on [[Tezuka Osamu]]'s manga and also starred [[v-u-den]], [[Nozomi Tsuji]], [[Aya Matsuura]], and [[Natsumi Abe]], as well as Marcia and Kaoru Ebira of the [[Takarazuka Revue]]. On July 2, Takahashi released her first and only solo single to date, \"Yume Kara Samete\".\n\nFollowing then-leader [[Hitomi Yoshizawa]]'s graduation from Morning Musume on May 6, 2007, the current sub-leader, [[Miki Fujimoto]] ascended to the leader position, with Takahashi becoming the new sub-leader of the group. However, on June 1, 2007, after Fujimoto's resignation,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/f-et-tp0-20070601-207238.html#spot|title= Nikkan Sports News|date= 2007-06-01|publisher= Nikkan Sports News|language= Japanese|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070603153923/http://www.nikkansports.com/entertainment/f-et-tp0-20070601-207238.html|archivedate= 2007-06-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20070601-00000166-sph-ent |title=Yahoo!

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by continuing to re-arm and re-train the military, enacted extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchased new weapons, and recalled the [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. Fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League's negotiators declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|yards|sigfig=1}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the villages of Metaxas and Rachovo. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguinary clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night.

It was the first major battle fought between [[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[First Balkan War]], and revolved around the Sarandaporo pass, which connected [[Thessaly]] with central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].\n\nDespite being perceived as impregnable by its defenders, the main body of the Greek forces managed to advance deep inside the pass, while auxiliary units broke through the Ottoman flanks. The Ottomans abandoned their defensive line during the night, fearing encirclement. The Greek victory at Sarandaporo opened the way for the capture of [[Servia, Greece|Servia]] and [[Kozani]].\n\n==Background==\nThe disastrous Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War]] of 1897 exposed major flaws in the [[Greek Army]]'s organization, training and logistics. Upon his appointment in December 1905, [[Georgios Theotokis]] became the first post-war Greek prime minister to focus his attention on strengthening the army. He established the National Defense Fund which financed the purchase of large quantities of ammunition. In addition a new [[table of organization]] was introduced for the country's [[Greek Navy|navy]] and army, the latter being augmented by numerous artillery batteries. Theotokis' resignation in January 1909 and the perceived neglect of the armed forces by his successor resulted in the [[Goudi coup]] seven months later. Rather than taking power for themselves, the putschists invited Cretan politician [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] to rule the country.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=19\u201321}} Venizelos followed in Theotokis' footsteps by continuing to re-arm and re-train the military, enacted extensive fortification and infrastructure works, purchased new weapons, and recalled the [[Military reserve force|reserve classes]] for training. The climax of this effort was the invitation in 1911 of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British naval mission]] and a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]].{{sfn|Katsikostas|2014|pp=5\u20136}} \n\nAfter being informed of a Serbo-Bulgarian alliance, Venizelos ordered his ambassador in [[Sofia]] to prepare a Greco-Bulgarian defense agreement by 14 April 1912. Fearing that should Greece fail to participate in a future war against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], it would be unable to capture the Greek majority areas of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. The treaty was signed on 15 July 1912, with the two countries agreeing to assist each other in case of a defensive war and to safeguard the rights of Christian populations in Ottoman held Macedonia, thus joining the loose [[Balkan League]] alliance with [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Bulgaria]]. Fearing a new war in the Balkans, the Ottomans mobilized their armed forces on 14 September and began transferring units to [[Thrace]]; the Balkan League responded in kind.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=26\u201329}} On 30 September, the League presented the Ottomans with a list of demands regarding the rights of its Christian population. The Ottoman Empire rebuffed the demands, recalled its ambassadors in Sofia, Belgrade and Athens and expelled the League's negotiators on 4 October. The League's negotiators declared [[First Balkan War|war]] against the Ottomans, while Montenegro had already began military operations on 25 September.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n==Prelude==\nGreece dispatched the [[Army of Epirus]] and the [[Army of Thessaly]] to its frontiers in [[Epirus]] and [[Thessaly]] respectively. The latter numbered 100,000 men, and was divided into seven divisions: namely the [[1st Infantry Division (Greece)|1st Infantry Division]], the [[2nd Infantry Division (Greece)|2nd Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Infantry Division (Greece)|3rd Infantry Division]], the [[4th Infantry Division (Greece)|4th Infantry Division]], the [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]], the [[6th Infantry Division (Greece)|6th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Mechanized Infantry Brigade (Greece)|7th Infantry Division]], as well as a cavalry brigade and four independent [[Evzones]] battalions. The Army of Thessaly was commanded by Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]].{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|pp=289\u2013290}} Facing the Greeks in Thessaly was the Ottoman [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Corps]] under General [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] which included three divisions: the regular (''nizamiye'') [[22nd Infantry Division (Ottoman Empire)|22nd Division]] and the reserve (''redif'') Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Divisions{{sfn|Erickson|2003|p=170}} which, combined with the Ottoman garrisons in western Macedonia, totaled 35,000-40,000 men.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nThe Army of Thessaly crossed into Ottoman territory in the early morning hours of 5 October, finding most border posts to be abandoned, with the garrisons at Melouna Pass, Profitis Ilias and Tsouka resisting for several hours before retreating. The first major clashes took place the following day when the 1st and 2nd Greek Divisions attacked hastily organized defenses north of [[Elassona]]. Elassona was defended by three infantry battalions, two artillery batteries and half a squadron of cavalry.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}} The battle for Elassona lasted for three hours, with the Ottomans retreating to avoid encirclement, thus giving the troops manning the main defensive line at Sarandaporo additional time to reinforce their positions.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=44\u201345}} The Greeks went on to advance {{convert|20|km|miles}} into the Elassona plateau without encountering any resistance.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=47}} Between 7 and 8 October, Greek troops regrouped in front of Sarandaporo and dispatched cavalry reconnaissance patrols towards the Ottoman positions, locating the headquarters of the Ottoman VIII Provisional Corps at Hania Viglas and those of a reserve division at Glikovo.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=290}}\n\nSituated between the Vigla and Amorves mountains, Sarandaporo was a narrow mountain pass, the only one connecting Thessaly with central Macedonia; it spanned some {{convert|7-8|km|miles|sigfig=1}}. Having ceded Thessaly to Greece in the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)]], the Ottomans began methodically reinforcing their positions around Sarandaporo in anticipation of a future war.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=48}} The Ottomans had organized their defenses under the guidance of German military advisors, placing their artillery batteries and infantry in sheltered, camouflaged trenches on the ravine's steep slopes, allowing them to accurately fire along its entire length. Considered to be nearly impenetrable it was dubbed \"the graveyard of the Greek Army\" by  the Prussian Field Marshal [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz]].{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=42}}\n\n==Battle==\nAt 7 a.m. on 9 October, the Greek infantry began its assault on Sarandaporo. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Divisions attacked the Ottoman main line frontally, their advance hampered by accurate Ottoman rifle and artillery fire and the ruggedness of the terrain. In the meantime, the 4th Division conducted a flanking maneuver from the west with the intention of occupying the Porta Pass, and striking the rear of the Ottoman positions.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The 5th Division advanced further to the west towards the village of Zampourda which was situated on the other bank of the [[Haliacmon]], with the intention of protecting the left flank of the Greek forces emerging from the Sarandaporo pass. The cavalry brigade moved on the extreme west along the road towards [[Servia, Greece|Servia]], planning to block the bridge across the Haliacmon.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=51}} Attacking from the east of the pass the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment overcame stiff resistance at Vlacholeivado and captured the village, but failing to advance further due to heavy fog.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=207\u2013209}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} At 2 p.m., the main bulk of the Greek artillery was brought to the main line, joining the engagement. Despite suffering heavy casualties, the three divisions had halted some {{convert|500-700|m|miles}} from the Ottoman trenches intending to launch a final assault the following morning.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}}\n\nThe 4th Division fought its way through the Metaxas and Rachovo villages. Upon reaching the Porta Pass it engaged in a sanguine clash with the defenders, securing its objective at 5 p.m.{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|p=53}} The 5th Division and the Gennadis Evzone detachment were confronted by four Ottoman reserve battalions at Lazarades which held their ground until sunset.{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=291}} The commander of the cavalry brigade ordered his unit to encamp at Loudani, refusing to advance further because of the resistance offered by the Ottomans at Lazarades. Fearing that they would be encircled by the Konstantinopoulos Evzone detachment, the Ottomans began to withdraw at 7 p.m., towards their second defensive line at Hani 739, under the cover of the night. Before retreating they fired a 20-minute artillery barrage on Greek positions along the entire frontline. Unaware of the Ottoman retreat the Greeks failed to use the opportunity and cut their access to the bridge across the Haliacmon. Upon reaching their second defensive line, the Ottomans became aware of the 4th Divisions' seizure of Porta Pass, panic spread in their ranks and many soldiers began fleeing and abandoning their equipment.{{sfn|Apostolidis|1913|pp=203\u2013205}} On the morning of 10 October, the 4th Division charged down the northern slope of the Rahovo Mountain, surprising the Ottoman infantry and artillerymen who abandoned over twenty [[Krupp gun]]s and engaged in a disorganized retreat.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Erickson|2003|pp=218\u2013219}} The Greek cavalry's indecision once again enabled the fleeing Ottomans to safely reach Servia and [[Kozani]].{{sfn|Kargakos|2012|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt 4 p.m. on 10 October, the 4th Division entered Servia, witnessing 75 to 90 severed human heads lined up on either side of one of its streets.{{sfn|Dimitracopoulos|1992|p=44}}{{sfn|Christopoulos|Bastias|1977|p=292}} Following the declaration of war local authorities had detained all the Christian dignitaries from Servia and the surrounding villages with the intention of massacring them, a plan that was thwarted by Ottoman officer Omer Bey.

It is a two-player, split-screen game, based on ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's long-running cartoon strip ''[[Spy vs. Spy]]'', about the slapstick antics of two spies trying to kill each other with improbably elaborate traps and weapons.\n\nIt was ported to the [[Apple II]], [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Acorn Electron]], [[Atari ST]], [[BBC Micro]], [[Commodore 16]], [[MSX]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Amiga]], [[Master System]], [[Game Boy family|Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], and [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], which was emulated on the [[Game Boy Advance]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Spy vs Spy A800 ingame.png|left|thumb|White Spy has just found the briefcase (Atari 8-bit)]]\nThe object of the game is to collect various secret items in a briefcase and exit the building through a door to the airport, either before the opposing player exits or before the timer runs out.  While searching for the items, traps can be laid to take out the opponent (or the player himself, if careless). Each spy has a personal countdown timer which depletes by 30 seconds upon each death.\n\nThe arena is an [[embassy]], constructed from a series of interconnected rooms laid out on a grid pattern. Higher levels have more rooms and therefore a larger play area. The spies can engage in hand-to-hand combat (achieved by wiggling the [[joystick]] or [[directional pad]] left and right or up and down when the spies are in proximity to each other) as well as place traps on the furniture and doors which occupy the playing area. These traps are triggered when a spy searches a piece of furniture or opens a booby trapped door, resulting in a cartoon-style animation showing the subject being shot, blown up, etc., and floating up to heaven as an angel.\n\nStrategy is introduced by limiting the numbers of each trap a spy can use and by allowing the traps to be triggered by either spy.
