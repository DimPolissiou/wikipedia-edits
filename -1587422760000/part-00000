Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: \"'''Meditation'''&nbsp;\u2013 general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bh\u0101van\u0101]]'',{{refn|group=note|The [[P\u0101li]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bh\u0101van\u0101'' literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nassati\u1e43, r\u0101hula, bh\u0101vana\u1e43 bh\u0101vehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bh\u0101vana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&-out breathing]].\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)}} ''jh\u0101na''/''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'',{{refn|group=note|See, for example, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from [[Sanskrit]] \"dhy\u0101na\". [[P\u0101li Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] ''dhy\u0101na'' / [Pali:] ''jh\u0101na'') or \"concentrations\" (''[[sam\u0101dhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}} and ''[[vipassana]]''.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&nbsp;\u2013 across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Therav\u0101da]] tradition, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.{{refn|group=note|Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&nbsp;\u2013 and by whatever name&nbsp;\u2013 are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s\" (p. 227).}} Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.{{refn|group=note|Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, [[Nyanaponika]] (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).}}\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial traditions, and the Tibetan tradition,<ref name=\"Ray2004\">Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']</ref> the Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).<ref>These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269\u201370, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].</ref>\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]]) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.<ref name=\"Ray2004\"/> In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.<ref>See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267\u201368, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].

Traditional Daoist meditative practices were influenced by [[Chinese Buddhism]] from around the 5th century, and influenced [[Traditional Chinese medicine]] and the [[Chinese martial arts]].\n\nLivia Kohn distinguishes three basic types of Taoist meditation: \"concentrative\", \"insight\", and \"visualization\".<ref>Kohn, Livia (2008), \"Meditation and visualization,\" in ''The Encyclopedia of Taoism'', ed. by Fabrizio Pregadio, p. 118.</ref> ''Ding'' [[wikt:\u5b9a|\u5b9a]] (literally means \"decide; settle; stabilize\") refers to \"deep concentration\", \"intent contemplation\", or \"perfect absorption\". ''Guan'' [[wikt:\u89c0|\u89c0]] (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) Taoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:\u5b58|\u5b58]] (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s.

Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Modern spirituality===\n[[File:Jawlensky Meditation 1290065.jpg|thumb|upright|''Meditation''.

Core meditation techniques have been preserved in ancient [[Buddhist texts]] and have proliferated and diversified through teacher-student transmissions. [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] pursue meditation as part of the path toward [[Bodhi|awakening]] and [[nirvana]].{{refn|group=note|For instance, Kamalashila (2003), p. 4, states that Buddhist meditation \"includes any method of meditation that has [[Bodhi|Enlightenment]] as its ''ultimate'' aim.\" Likewise, Bodhi (1999) writes: \"To arrive at the experiential realization of the truths it is necessary to take up the practice of meditation.... At the climax of such contemplation the mental eye ... shifts its focus to the unconditioned state, [[Nirvana|Nibbana]]....\" A similar although in some ways slightly broader definition is provided by Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 142: \"'''Meditation'''&nbsp;\u2013 general term for a multitude of religious practices, often quite different in method, but all having the same goal: to bring the consciousness of the practitioner to a state in which he can come to an experience of 'awakening,' 'liberation,' 'enlightenment.'\" Kamalashila (2003) further allows that some Buddhist meditations are \"of a more preparatory nature\" (p. 4).}} The closest words for meditation in the classical languages of Buddhism are ''[[Bhavana|bh\u0101van\u0101]]'',{{refn|group=note|The [[P\u0101li]] and [[Sanskrit]] word ''bh\u0101van\u0101'' literally means \"development\" as in \"mental development.\" For the association of this term with \"meditation,\" see Epstein (1995), p. 105; and, Fischer-Schreiber ''et al.'' (1991), p. 20. As an example from a well-known discourse of the [[Pali Canon]], in \"The Greater Exhortation to Rahula\" (''Maha-Rahulovada Sutta'', [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 62), Ven. [[Sariputta]] tells Ven. [[Rahula]] (in Pali, based on [http://www.tipitaka.org/romn/cscd/s0202m.mul1.xml VRI, n.d.)]: ''{{IAST|\u0101n\u0101p\u0101nassati\u1e43, r\u0101hula, bh\u0101vana\u1e43 bh\u0101vehi.}}'' [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html Thanissaro (2006)] translates this as: \"Rahula, develop the meditation [''{{IAST|bh\u0101vana}}''] of [[anapanasati|mindfulness of in-&-out breathing]].\" (Square-bracketed Pali word included based on Thanissaro, 2006, end note.)}} ''jh\u0101na''/''[[Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism|dhy\u0101na]]'',{{refn|group=note|See, for example, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/onetool.html Thanissaro (1997)]; as well as, Kapleau (1989), p.&nbsp;385, for the derivation of the word \"zen\" from [[Sanskrit]] \"dhy\u0101na\". [[P\u0101li Text Society]] Secretary Rupert Gethin, in describing the activities of [[Sramana|wandering ascetics]] contemporaneous with the Buddha, wrote:\n: [T]here is the cultivation of meditative and contemplative techniques aimed at producing what might, for the lack of a suitable technical term in English, be referred to as \"altered states of consciousness\". In the technical vocabulary of Indian religious texts such states come to be termed \"meditations\" ([Skt.:] ''dhy\u0101na'' / [Pali:] ''jh\u0101na'') or \"concentrations\" (''[[sam\u0101dhi]]''); the attainment of such states of consciousness was generally regarded as bringing the practitioner to deeper knowledge and experience of the nature of the world. (Gethin, 1998, p. 10.)}} and ''[[vipassana]]''.\n\nBuddhist meditation techniques have become popular in the wider world, with many non-Buddhists taking them up. There is considerable homogeneity across meditative practices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Anapanasati|breath meditation]] and various recollections (''[[anussati]]'')&nbsp;\u2013 across [[schools of Buddhism|Buddhist schools]], as well as significant diversity. In the [[Therav\u0101da]] tradition, there are over fifty methods for developing mindfulness and forty for developing concentration, while in the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] tradition there are thousands of visualization meditations.{{refn|group=note|Goldstein (2003) writes that, in regard to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], \"there are more than fifty different practices outlined in this Sutta. The meditations that derive from these foundations of mindfulness are called ''vipassana''..., and in one form or another&nbsp;\u2013 and by whatever name&nbsp;\u2013 are found in all the major Buddhist traditions\" (p. 92). The forty concentrative meditation subjects refer to [[Visuddhimagga]]'s oft-referenced enumeration. Regarding Tibetan visualizations, Kamalashila (2003), writes: \"The Tara meditation ... is one example out of thousands of subjects for visualization meditation, each one arising out of some meditator's visionary experience of enlightened qualities, seen in the form of [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] and [[Bodhisattva]]s\" (p. 227).}} Most classical and contemporary Buddhist meditation guides are school-specific.{{refn|group=note|Examples of contemporary school-specific \"classics\" include, from the Theravada tradition, [[Nyanaponika]] (1996) and, from the Zen tradition, Kapleau (1989).}}\n\nAccording to the Theravada and Sarvastivada commentatorial traditions, and the Tibetan tradition,<ref name=\"Ray2004\">Reginald Ray (2004), [https://www.lionsroar.com/dharma-dictionary-vipashyana/ ''What is Vipashyana?'']</ref> the Buddha identified two paramount mental qualities that arise from wholesome meditative practice:\n\n* \"serenity\" or \"tranquility\" (Pali: ''[[samatha]]'') which steadies, composes, unifies and concentrates the mind;\n* \"insight\" (Pali: ''[[vipassana]]'') which enables one to see, explore and discern \"formations\" (conditioned phenomena based on the five [[Skandha|aggregates]]).<ref>These definitions of ''samatha'' and ''vipassana'' are based on the \"Four Kinds of Persons Sutta\" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.94). This article's text is primarily based on Bodhi (2005), pp. 269\u201370, 440 ''n''. 13. See also [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.094.than.html Thanissaro (1998d)].</ref>\n\nThrough the meditative development of serenity, one is able to weaken the obscuring [[Five Hindrances|hindrances]] and bring the mind to a collected, pliant and still state ([[samadhi]]). This quality of mind then supports the development of insight and wisdom ([[praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|Praj\u00f1\u0101]]) which is the quality of mind that can \"clearly see\" (''vi-passana'') the nature of phenomena. What exactly is to be seen varies within the Buddhist traditions.<ref name=\"Ray2004\"/> In Theravada, all phenomena are to be seen as [[anicca|impermanent]], [[dukkha|suffering]], [[anatta|not-self]] and [[shunyata|empty]]. When this happens, one develops dispassion (''viraga'') for all phenomena, including all negative qualities and hindrances and lets them go. It is through the release of the hindrances and ending of craving through the meditative development of insight that one gains liberation.<ref>See, for instance, AN 2.30 in Bodhi (2005), pp. 267\u201368, and [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an02/an02.030.than.html Thanissaro (1998e)].</ref>\n\nIn the [[modern era]], Buddhist meditation saw increasing popularity due to the influence of [[Buddhist modernism]] on Asian Buddhism, and western lay interest in [[Zen]] and the [[Vipassana movement]]. The spread of Buddhist meditation to the [[Western world]] paralleled the spread of [[Buddhism in the West]].

''Guan'' [[wikt:\u89c0|\u89c0]] (lit. \"watch; observe; view\") meditation seeks to merge and attain unity with the Dao. It was developed by [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) Taoist masters based upon the ''[[Tiantai]]'' Buddhist practice of ''[[Vipassan\u0101]]'' \"insight\" or \"wisdom\" meditation. ''Cun'' [[wikt:\u5b58|\u5b58]] (lit. \"exist; be present; survive\") has a sense of \"to cause to exist; to make present\" in the meditation techniques popularized by the Taoist [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School]]s. A meditator visualizes or actualizes solar and lunar essences, lights, and deities within their body, which supposedly results in health and longevity, even ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' \u4ed9/\u4eda/\u50ca, \"immortality\".\n\nThe (late 4th century BCE) ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' essay ''[[Neiye]]'' \"Inward training\" is the oldest received writing on the subject of ''[[qi]]'' cultivation and breath-control meditation techniques.<ref name='Cambridge'>{{Cite book| last1=Harper | first1=Donald | first2=Michael | last2=Loewe | first3=Edward L. | last3=Shaughnessy| title=The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 BC | publisher=Cambridge University Press | date=2007 | origyear=First published in 1999 | location=Cambridge | page=880 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=cHA7Ey0-pbEC&dq=cambridge++history+of+ancient+china&printsec=frontcover&q=| isbn=978-0-521-47030-8}}</ref> For instance, \"When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, when you relax your vital breath and expand it, when your body is calm and unmoving: And you can maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. ...

Some well-known examples are ''[[Tao Yin|daoyin]]'' \"guiding and pulling\", ''[[qigong]]'' \"life-energy exercises\", ''[[neigong]]'' \"internal exercises\", ''[[neidan]]'' \"internal alchemy\", and ''[[taijiquan]]'' \"great ultimate boxing\", which is thought of as moving meditation.

In modern Jewish practice, one of the best known meditative practices is called ''\"[[hitbodedut]]\"'' (''\u05d4\u05ea\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea'', alternatively transliterated as \"hisbodedus\"), and is explained in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]], [[Hasidic]], and [[Mussar Movement|Mussar]] writings, especially the Hasidic method of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslav]]. The word derives from the Hebrew word \"boded\" (\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3), meaning the state of being alone.<ref>Kaplan, A. (1978) op cit p. 2</ref> Another Hasidic system is the [[Habad]] method of \"hisbonenus\", related to the [[Sephirah]] of \"Binah\", Hebrew for understanding.<ref>Kaplan, (1982) op cit, p. 13</ref> This practice is the analytical reflective process of making oneself understand a mystical concept well, that follows and internalises its study in Hasidic writings.

Meditation practice in these religions usually revolves around visualization, absorbing energy from the universe or higher self, directing one's internal energy, and inducing various [[trance]] states. Meditation and magic practice often overlap in these religions as meditation is often seen as merely a stepping stone to supernatural power, and the meditation sessions may be peppered with various chants and spells.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Modern spirituality===\n[[File:Jawlensky Meditation 1290065.jpg|thumb|upright|''Meditation''.

Also, a professional [[association football|football]] club in [[Preston, Lancashire]], whose team currently plays in the [[EFL Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]]. Originally a [[cricket]] club, Preston have been based at [[Deepdale]] since 1875. The club first took up football in 1878 as a winter fitness activity and decided to focus on it in May 1880, when the football club was officially founded. Deepdale is now football's oldest ground in terms of continuous use by a major league club.\n\nPreston North End was a founder member of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1888. In the [[1888\u201389 in English football|1888\u201389 season]], the team won both the [[List of English football champions|inaugural league championship]] and the [[1889 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], the latter without conceding a goal. They were the first team to achieve the \"[[Double (association football)|Double]]\" in English football and, as they were unbeaten in all matches, are remembered as \"[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]\". Preston won the league championship again in 1889\u201390 but their only major success since then has been their [[1938 FA Cup Final]] victory over [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. The club's most famous players have been [[Tom Finney]] and [[Bill Shankly]], who are both commemorated at Deepdale by stands named after them. Other notable players include [[Tommy Docherty]], [[Alan Kelly Sr.]] and [[Graham Alexander]].\n\nUntil 1961, Preston were usually members of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] but, having been relegated after the [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361 season]], they have not yet returned to the top flight. They were first relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] after the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370 season]] and have spent 28 of the 49 seasons since 1970 in the bottom two divisions, including a span of 19 seasons from 1981-1982 to 1999\u20132000. Preston have faced serious financial issues and were twice in danger of closure. The club is now owned by businessman [[Trevor Hemmings]] and has been established in the EFL Championship since gaining promotion in 2015.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Preston North End F.C.}}\n[[File:Preston North End FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|Chart showing the progress of Preston North End F.C. through the [[English football league system]].]]\nPreston North End was founded in 1863, originally as a [[cricket]] club, and played their first matches at the Marsh near the [[River Ribble]] in the [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] suburb of [[Ashton-on-Ribble|Ashton]]. Later that year, they switched to [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]] in the north of the town, calling themselves \"North End\" in recognition of the new location. On 21 January 1875, the club leased a field opposite Moor Park on the site of the current [[Deepdale]] stadium, which has been its home ever since.<ref name=hist>{{cite web | url=http://www.pnefc.net/club/history/ | title=Preston North End FC History | publisher=Preston North End | date=2018 | accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe club formed a [[rugby union]] team in 1877 as a winter fitness activity but this was not a success and, a year later, they played their first game under the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules of association football]].

Originally a [[cricket]] club, Preston have been based at [[Deepdale]] since 1875. The club first took up football in 1878 as a winter fitness activity and decided to focus on it in May 1880, when the football club was officially founded. Deepdale is now football's oldest ground in terms of continuous use by a major league club.\n\nPreston North End was a founder member of the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1888. In the [[1888\u201389 in English football|1888\u201389 season]], the team won both the [[List of English football champions|inaugural league championship]] and the [[1889 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], the latter without conceding a goal. They were the first team to achieve the \"[[Double (association football)|Double]]\" in English football and, as they were unbeaten in all matches, are remembered as \"[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]\". Preston won the league championship again in 1889\u201390 but their only major success since then has been their [[1938 FA Cup Final]] victory over [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. The club's most famous players have been [[Tom Finney]] and [[Bill Shankly]], who are both commemorated at Deepdale by stands named after them. Other notable players include [[Tommy Docherty]], [[Alan Kelly Sr.]] and [[Graham Alexander]].\n\nUntil 1961, Preston were usually members of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] but, having been relegated after the [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361 season]], they have not yet returned to the top flight. They were first relegated to the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] after the [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370 season]] and have spent 28 of the 49 seasons since 1970 in the bottom two divisions, including a span of 19 seasons from 1981-1982 to 1999\u20132000. Preston have faced serious financial issues and were twice in danger of closure. The club is now owned by businessman [[Trevor Hemmings]] and has been established in the EFL Championship since gaining promotion in 2015.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Preston North End F.C.}}\n[[File:Preston North End FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|Chart showing the progress of Preston North End F.C. through the [[English football league system]].]]\nPreston North End was founded in 1863, originally as a [[cricket]] club, and played their first matches at the Marsh near the [[River Ribble]] in the [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] suburb of [[Ashton-on-Ribble|Ashton]]. Later that year, they switched to [[Moor Park, Preston|Moor Park]] in the north of the town, calling themselves \"North End\" in recognition of the new location. On 21 January 1875, the club leased a field opposite Moor Park on the site of the current [[Deepdale]] stadium, which has been its home ever since.<ref name=hist>{{cite web | url=http://www.pnefc.net/club/history/ | title=Preston North End FC History | publisher=Preston North End | date=2018 | accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe club formed a [[rugby union]] team in 1877 as a winter fitness activity but this was not a success and, a year later, they played their first game under the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|rules of association football]].

In [[1887\u201388 FA Cup|1887]], they beat [[Hyde F.C.|Hyde]] 26\u20130 in the first round of the FA Cup, still a record winning margin in English first-class football.

The club experienced a near-terminal decline in the 1980s which brought about the very real threat of closure, the nadir being the [[1985\u201386 Football League|1985\u201386 season]] when they finished 23rd in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] and had to seek re-election to the league. \n\n[[File:David Moyes (201551591).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Under [[David Moyes]], Preston were [[Football League Second Division|Division Two]] champions in 2000, and narrowly missed out on promotion to the Premier League the following season.]]\nUnder manager [[John McGrath (footballer born 1938)|John McGrath]], the team recovered and won promotion back to the Third Division only a year later but it was a false dawn as the team spent another three years in the bottom division from 1993 to 1996.

The old ground was demolished and rebuilt in four stages and the last of the new stands was opened in 2008. Part of the redevelopment was the original [[National Football Museum]] which opened at Deepdale in 2001, but it was relocated to Manchester in 2012 after being closed for two years.

Insignia''' is a rotating trophy awarded to cities hosting the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The symbol is a large key ring to which the Eurovision Song Contest Host Cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city. The Host City Insignia Exchange usually takes place in conjunction with the Semi-Final Allocation Draw. The insignia is traditionally put on display in a public place, such as the City Hall or another venue of local significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/host-city-insignia-exchange/|title=Host City Insignia Exchange|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref> Additionally, there is a fob with a picture of the [[Helsinki Senate Square]] attached to the key ring.\n\nThe idea of the rotating trophy was proposed jointly by the City of [[Helsinki]], the Finnish Broadcasting Company [[YLE]] and [[EBU]] in connection with the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: \"Eurovision Song Contest Host City\", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers. The concept and fob were designed by the ANTEEKSI Team and the ring by jewellery designer Taru Tonder.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Badzic|first1=Milenko|title=Host City Insignia Exchange & Semi-Final Allocation Draw|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&type=Press|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327081350/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&type=Press|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212182218/http://www.hel.fi/wps/portal/Hallintokeskus_en/Artikkeli?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2FHalke%2Fen%2FNews%20and%20Press%20releases%2FUutiset|title=Open Doors Weekend fills Helsinki with design|website=City of Helsinki news|date=31 January 2012|language=Finnish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611105333/http://www.hel.fi/wps/portal/Hallintokeskus/Artikkeli?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2FHalke%2Ffi%2Fuutiset%2Bja%2Btiedotteet%2Fhallintokeskuksen%2Btiedotteet%2Fhelsinki%2Baloittaa%2Buuden%2Beurovision%2Blaulukilpailun%2Bperinteen|trans-title=Helsinki begins the tradition of the new Eurovision Song Contest|title=Helsinki aloittaa uuden Eurovision laulukilpailun perinteen|language=Finnish|date=15 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Semi-final allotment drawing venue==\nSince the introduction in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] of the two semi-finals system, a drawing has been held to determine in which semi-final a country would participate, as well as in which semi-final a country would vote in. Each year, either five or six countries are exempt from the drawing for competing in the semi-finals: the big-five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK), and the host country, if the host is not one of the big five. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] the number of countries exempt was seven, as Australia joined the other six countries exempt because the country was considered a special guest contestant.\n\nRegardless if a country is exempt from competing in the semi-finals, all participating countries are allotted a semi-final in which to vote. \n \n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|- \n!

Insignia''' is a rotating trophy awarded to cities hosting the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The symbol is a large key ring to which the Eurovision Song Contest Host Cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city. The Host City Insignia Exchange usually takes place in conjunction with the Semi-Final Allocation Draw. The insignia is traditionally put on display in a public place, such as the City Hall or another venue of local significance.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/about/in-depth/host-city-insignia-exchange/|title=Host City Insignia Exchange|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=19 March 2020}}</ref> Additionally, there is a fob with a picture of the [[Helsinki Senate Square]] attached to the key ring.\n\nThe idea of the rotating trophy was proposed jointly by the City of [[Helsinki]], the Finnish Broadcasting Company [[YLE]] and [[EBU]] in connection with the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: \"Eurovision Song Contest Host City\", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers. The concept and fob were designed by the ANTEEKSI Team and the ring by jewellery designer Taru Tonder.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Badzic|first1=Milenko|title=Host City Insignia Exchange & Semi-Final Allocation Draw|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&type=Press|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327081350/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&type=Press|archivedate=27 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212182218/http://www.hel.fi/wps/portal/Hallintokeskus_en/Artikkeli?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2FHalke%2Fen%2FNews%20and%20Press%20releases%2FUutiset|title=Open Doors Weekend fills Helsinki with design|website=City of Helsinki news|date=31 January 2012|language=Finnish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611105333/http://www.hel.fi/wps/portal/Hallintokeskus/Artikkeli?WCM_GLOBAL_CONTEXT=%2FHalke%2Ffi%2Fuutiset%2Bja%2Btiedotteet%2Fhallintokeskuksen%2Btiedotteet%2Fhelsinki%2Baloittaa%2Buuden%2Beurovision%2Blaulukilpailun%2Bperinteen|trans-title=Helsinki begins the tradition of the new Eurovision Song Contest|title=Helsinki aloittaa uuden Eurovision laulukilpailun perinteen|language=Finnish|date=15 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Semi-final allotment drawing venue==\nSince the introduction in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]] of the two semi-finals system, a drawing has been held to determine in which semi-final a country would participate, as well as in which semi-final a country would vote in. Each year, either five or six countries are exempt from the drawing for competing in the semi-finals: the big-five (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK), and the host country, if the host is not one of the big five. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015|2015]] the number of countries exempt was seven, as Australia joined the other six countries exempt because the country was considered a special guest contestant.\n\nRegardless if a country is exempt from competing in the semi-finals, all participating countries are allotted a semi-final in which to vote. \n \n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|- \n!

From 1881 to 1903, Palestine Jewry is estimated to have increased from about 22,000 or 24,000 to about 47,000 or 50,000, mainly because of immigration in 1881-84 and 1890-91.

On the other hand, Jerusalem, the stronghold of the established institutions of the Old Yishuv, increased from 14,000 to 28,000, by far the greater part of whom were undoubtedly absorbed into the traditionalist community. Thus, considered in the light of demographic statistics, Jewish immigration to Palestine from 1881 to 1914 was largely a continuation of its pre-Zionist past.

He played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. His biography on the official NBA website states: \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"<ref name=\"nbah\" /> He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Markovits and Rensman, p. 89.</ref>\n\nJordan played three seasons for coach [[Dean Smith]] with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]].

His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames \"'''Air Jordan'''\" and \"'''His Airness'''\". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ref name=\"defensive players\" /> In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"[[three-peat]]\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the [[1993\u201394 NBA season]] and started a new career in [[Minor League Baseball]], he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season. He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] selections, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]' list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] (\"The Dream Team\"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\nJordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan]] sneakers which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.<ref name=\"remain popular\" /> Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net worth of $2.1&nbsp;billion, he is the fourth-richest African-American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F.

His biography on the official NBA website states: \"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.\"<ref name=\"nbah\" /> He was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>Markovits and Rensman, p. 89.</ref>\n\nJordan played three seasons for coach [[Dean Smith]] with the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]].

His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames \"'''Air Jordan'''\" and \"'''His Airness'''\". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ref name=\"defensive players\" /> In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a \"[[three-peat]]\". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the [[1993\u201394 NBA season]] and started a new career in [[Minor League Baseball]], he returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995\u201396 NBA season. He retired for a second time in January 1999 but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].\n\nJordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards]], ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|MVP Awards]], ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] selections, three [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star Game MVP Awards]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]' list of athletes of the century. Jordan is a two-time inductee into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the [[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team]] (\"The Dream Team\"). He became a member of the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] in 2015.\n\nJordan is also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]]'s [[Air Jordan]] sneakers which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today.<ref name=\"remain popular\" /> Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ''[[Space Jam]]''. In 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets) and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net worth of $2.1&nbsp;billion, he is the fourth-richest African-American, behind [[Robert F. Smith (investor)|Robert F.

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success, setting records for an October release. It has grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]]. Phoenix and Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir also won at the [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] and [[BAFTA Award]] ceremonies.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should generally be no more than 700 words. The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to applause, but starts telling morbid jokes, confesses to the train murders, and rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]]. When Murray criticizes him, Arthur begins acting more erratically. To everyone's shock Arthur murders him and is arrested as riots break out across Gotham. <!--DO NOT LINK TO JOE CHILL, HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVIE-->One rioter<!--DO NOT LINK TO JOE CHILL, HE IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVIE--> corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, [[Martha Wayne|Martha]], sparing Bruce.{{efn|Identified off-screen as the [[origin of Batman]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Russel |first1=Bradley |title=Joker ending explained: your biggest questions answered |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-ending-explained/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=October 5, 2019 |date=October 4, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191004233012/https://www.gamesradar.com/joker-ending-explained/ |archive-date=October 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>}} Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he dances to the cheers of the crowd.\n\nAt Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand it.

The film, based on [[DC Comics]] characters, stars [[Joaquin Phoenix]] as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and provides a possible [[origin story]] for the character. Set in 1981, it follows Arthur Fleck, a failed stand-up comedian whose descent into insanity and nihilism inspires a violent counter-cultural revolution against the wealthy in a decaying [[Gotham City]]. [[Robert De Niro]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Frances Conroy]], [[Brett Cullen]], [[Glenn Fleshler]], [[Bill Camp]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Marc Maron]] appear in supporting roles. ''Joker'' was produced by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], [[DC Films]], and Joint Effort, in association with [[Bron Studios|Bron Creative]] and [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], and distributed by Warner Bros.\n\nPhillips conceived ''Joker'' in 2016 and wrote the script with Silver throughout 2017. The two were inspired by 1970s character studies and the films of [[Martin Scorsese]] (particularly ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]''), who was initially attached to the project as a producer. The graphic novel ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' (1988) was the basis for the film's premise, but Phillips and Silver otherwise did not look to specific comics for inspiration. Phoenix became attached in February 2018 and was cast that July, while the majority of the cast signed on by August. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[New York City]], [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], from September to December 2018. ''Joker'' is the first live-action [[Batman in film|theatrical ''Batman'' film]] to receive an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film ratings|R-rating]] from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], due to its violent and disturbing content.\n\n''Joker'' premiered at the [[76th Venice International Film Festival]] on August 31, 2019, where it won the [[Golden Lion]], and was released in the United States on October 4, 2019. The film polarized critics; while it was highly praised for Phoenix's performance, the musical score, cinematography and production values, it was met with mixed reception concerning Phillips' screenplay and direction. The film's dark tone, portrayal of mental illness, and handling of violence divided opinion and also generated concerns of inspiring real-world violence; the movie theater where the [[2012 Aurora, Colorado shooting|2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting]] occurred during a screening of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' refused to show it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|title=Why 'Joker' became one of the most divisive movies of the year|last=Cavna|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=October 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003213559/https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/10/03/why-joker-became-one-most-divisive-movies-year/|archive-date=October 3, 2019}}</ref> Despite this, ''Joker'' became a major box office success, setting records for an October release. It has grossed over $1 billion, making it the first [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films|R-rated film]] to do so, the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films|31st-highest-grossing film]] of all time.\n\n''Joker'' received [[List of accolades received by Joker (2019 film)|numerous accolades]]. At the [[92nd Academy Awards]], the film earned a leading 11 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], winning [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Phoenix and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for [[Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir]].

The current summary is 624 words.-->\nIn 1981, [[Clown|party clown]] and aspiring [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in [[Gotham City]]. Frequently teased and made fun of, Arthur is despondent of Gotham's ambiance, which is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swathes of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from <!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM -->a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at uncomfortable and inappropriate times;<!-- DO NOT LINK TO PSUEDOBULBAR AFFECT, IT IS NOT IDENTIFIED IN THE FILM --> he depends on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker, Randall, gives him a gun for protection. Arthur meets his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\n\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Despite his claim that the gun is a prop for his shows, Randall states it's real and lies to management that Arthur bought the gun himself and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken [[Wayne Enterprises]] businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and executes the third. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate [[Thomas Wayne]], who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns.\" Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication. All this results in Arthur having a mental breakdown, leading him to knock on Sophie's door and passionately kiss her, leading to a budding relationship.\n\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Popular talk show host Murray Franklin mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to [[Wayne Manor]], where he meets Thomas's young son [[Batman|Bruce]], but flees after a scuffle with the family butler [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. Following a visit from two [[Gotham City Police Department]] detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\n\nAt a public event, Arthur confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits [[Arkham Asylum|Arkham State Hospital]] and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny says that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave and their previous encounters are revealed to be Arthur's delusions. The following day, Arthur smothers Penny with a pillow at the hospital.\n\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by Randall and fellow ex-colleague Gary. Arthur brutally murders Randall but leaves Gary unharmed as he treated him well in the past. En{{nbsp}}route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with some of the clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape.\n\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as [[Joker (character)|Joker]], a reference to Murray's previous mockery.

The types of aircraft used include [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopters]]. Smokejumpers and rappellers are also classified as aerial firefighters, delivered to the fire by parachute from a variety of fixed-wing [[aircraft]], or rappelling from [[helicopter]]s.

Within the industry, though, \"air attack\" may also refer to the supervisor in the air (usually in a fixed-wing aircraft) who supervises the process of attacking the wildfire from the air, including fixed-wing airtankers, helicopters, and any other aviation resources assigned to the fire. The Air Tactical Group Supervisor (ATGS), often called \"air attack,\" is usually flying at an altitude above other resources assigned to the fire, often in a fixed-wing plane but occasionally (depending on assigned resources or the availability of qualified personnel) in a helicopter.\n\nDepending on the size, location, and assessed potential of the wildfire, the \"air attack\" or ATGS person may be charged with initial attack (the first response of firefighting assets on fire suppression), or with extended attack, the ongoing response to and management of a major wildfire requiring additional resources including engines, ground crews, and other aviation personnel and aircraft needed to control the fire and establish control lines or [[Firebreak|firelines]] ahead of the wildfire.<ref name=redbook17/>\n\n== Equipment ==\nA wide variety of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are used for aerial firefighting.

Some helitankers, such as the Erickson AirCrane, are also outfitted with a front-mounted foam cannon. Buckets are usually filled by submerging or dipping them in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. The most popular of the buckets is the flexible [[Bambi bucket|Bambi Bucket]]. Tanks can be filled on the ground (by water tenders or truck-mounted systems) or water can be siphoned from lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or a portable tank through a hanging snorkel. Popular firefighting helicopters include variants of the [[UH-1 Iroquois|Bell 204]], [[Bell 205]], [[Bell 212]], [[Boeing Vertol 107]], [[Boeing Vertol 234]] and the [[S-64 Skycrane|Sikorsky S-64 Aircrane]] helitanker, which features a snorkel for filling from a natural or man-made water source while in hover.

The smallest are the Single Engine Air Tankers (SEATs). These are agricultural sprayers that generally drop about {{convert|800|gal|l|-2}} of water or retardant. Examples include the [[Air Tractor AT-802]], which can deliver around {{convert|800|gal|l|-2}} of water or fire retardant solution in each drop, and the Soviet [[Antonov An-2]] biplane.

The leadplane is typically referred to as a \"Bird Dog\" in Canada or \"Supervision\" aircraft in Australia. The [[O-2 Skymaster]], Cessna 310 and [[OV-10 Bronco]] have been used as spotter and lead plane platforms. The [[Ontario]] Ministry of Natural Resources has also used the [[Cessna 337]]. The [[Beechcraft Baron]] was long used as a leadplane or air attack ship, but most were retired in 2003; more common now is the [[Beechcraft King Air]] and the [[Aero Commander 500 family|Twin Commander 690]]. A Cessna Citation 500 jet owned by Air Spray (1967) LTd. was used by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests beginning in 1995 and used for two fire seasons to lead the very fast Electra L188 air tanker to the fires. This was the first time a jet aircraft was used as a lead plane or \"bird dog\". The Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia operates a fleet of nine [[American Champion Scout]]s 8GCBC during the summer months as spotter aircraft and Air Attack platforms. The Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the Yukon Territories contract to supply Twin Commander 690 as bird dog aircraft for their air tanker fleets. Air Spray owns 9 Twin Commander 690 for use as bird dog aircraft.\n\n===Fleet grounding===\nIn the United States, most of these aircraft are privately owned and contracted to government agencies, and the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[U.S. Marines]] also maintain fleets of firefighting aircraft. On May 10, 2004, The [[U.S. Forest Service]] (USFS) and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) announced that they were cancelling contracts with operators of 33 heavy airtankers. They cited liability concerns and an inability to safely manage the fleet after the wing failure and resulting [[2002 airtanker crashes|crash]] of a [[C-130]]A Hercules in [[California]] and a [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2]] in [[Colorado]] during the summer of 2002. Both aged aircraft broke up in flight due to catastrophic [[metal fatigue|fatigue]] cracks at the wing roots. After subsequent third-party examination and extensive testing of all USFS contracted heavy airtankers, three companies were awarded contracts and now maintain a combined fleet of 23 aircraft.\n\n==Fire retardant==\n[[File:Hercules C130 bombardier d eau Californie.jpg|thumb|A [[Modular Airborne FireFighting System|MAFFS]]-equipped [[Air National Guard]] [[C-130 Hercules]] drops [[fire retardant]] on wildfires in southern California]]\n{{See also|Fire retardant}}\n[[Borate]] salts used in the past to fight wildfires have been found to sterilize the soil and be [[toxin|toxic]] to animals so are now prohibited.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/documents/304c.pdf\n  | title = UDSA Forest Service Specification 5100-304c Long-Term Retardant, Wildland Firefighting\n  | date = June 1, 2007\n  | page = 2\n  | accessdate = 2008-11-24\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108110004/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/documents/304c.pdf| archivedate= 8 November 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Newer retardants use [[ammonium sulfate]] or [[ammonium polyphosphate]] with [[attapulgite]] [[clay]] thickener or [[diammonium phosphate]] with a [[guar gum]] derivative thickener. These are not only less toxic but act as [[fertilizer]]s to help the regrowth of plants after the fire. Fire retardants often contain [[surfactant|wetting agents]], [[preservative]]s and [[rust inhibitor]]s and are colored red with [[ferric oxide]] or [[Fugitive pigment|fugitive color]] to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include [[Fire-Trol]] and [[Phos-Chek]].\n\nSome water-dropping aircraft carry tanks of a guar gum derivative to thicken the water and reduce runoff.\n\n==Tactics and capabilities==\n[[File:Sikorsky S-70A-27 Picking Up Water.jpg|thumb|A helicopter dips its [[Bambi bucket|bucket]] into a river to drop water on a wildfire in California]]\nHelicopters can hover over the fire and drop water or retardant. The S-64 Helitanker has [[microprocessor]]-controlled doors on its tank. The doors are controlled based on the area to be covered and wind conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass and drop water or retardant like a bomber. Spotter (Air Tactical Group Supervisor) aircraft often orbit the fire at a higher altitude to coordinate the efforts of the smoke jumper, helicopter, media, and retardant-dropping aircraft; while lead planes fly low-level ahead of the airtankers to mark the [[trajectory]] for the drop, and ensure overall safety for both ground-based and aerial firefighters.\n[[File:California Air National Guard waterbombers DOD 100489779-720x406-1500k.theora.ogv|thumbnail|left|Film showing Waterbombers from the California Air National Guard dropping substances used to fight fires.]]\nWater is usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short-lived. Fire retardants are typically dropped ahead of the moving fire or along its edge and may remain effective for two or more days. This can create artificial [[firebreak]]s where the terrain is too rugged or remote for ground crews to cut fireline.\n\nAerial firefighting is most effectively used in conjunction with ground-based efforts, as aircraft are only one weapon in the firefighting arsenal. However, there have been cases of aircraft extinguishing fires long before ground crews were able to reach them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Christopher|first1=Ben|title=Does Using Airplanes to Put out Forest Fires Actually Work?|url=http://priceonomics.com/does-using-airplanes-to-put-out-forest-fires/|website=Priceonomics|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome firefighting aircraft can refill their tanks in mid-flight, by flying down to skim the surface of large bodies of water. One example is the [[Bombardier CL-415]]. This is particularly useful in rural areas where flying back to an airbase for refills may take too much time.  In 2002 an Ontario CL-415 crew was able to refill 100 times within a 4-hour mission, delivering {{convert|162000|gal|l|-1}} or {{convert|1350000|lb|MT|0}} of water on a fire near [[Dryden, Ontario]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} { June 1, 2002 Dryden fire # 10 Tanker #271 civil ident C-GOGE }\n\n== Incidents ==\n*July 22, 1960: a [[North American B-25 Mitchell]], N3446G SN 44-31466, operating as Tanker 66, impacted the earth during a water bombing run in Mill Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains on the Magic Mountain Fire.

The types of aircraft used include [[fixed-wing aircraft]] and [[helicopters]]. Smokejumpers and rappellers are also classified as aerial firefighters, delivered to the fire by parachute from a variety of fixed-wing [[aircraft]], or rappelling from [[helicopter]]s.

Within the industry, though, \"air attack\" may also refer to the supervisor in the air (usually in a fixed-wing aircraft) who supervises the process of attacking the wildfire from the air, including fixed-wing airtankers, helicopters, and any other aviation resources assigned to the fire. The Air Tactical Group Supervisor (ATGS), often called \"air attack,\" is usually flying at an altitude above other resources assigned to the fire, often in a fixed-wing plane but occasionally (depending on assigned resources or the availability of qualified personnel) in a helicopter.\n\nDepending on the size, location, and assessed potential of the wildfire, the \"air attack\" or ATGS person may be charged with initial attack (the first response of firefighting assets on fire suppression), or with extended attack, the ongoing response to and management of a major wildfire requiring additional resources including engines, ground crews, and other aviation personnel and aircraft needed to control the fire and establish control lines or [[Firebreak|firelines]] ahead of the wildfire.<ref name=redbook17/>\n\n== Equipment ==\nA wide variety of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft are used for aerial firefighting.

Some helitankers, such as the Erickson AirCrane, are also outfitted with a front-mounted foam cannon. Buckets are usually filled by submerging or dipping them in lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or portable tanks. The most popular of the buckets is the flexible [[Bambi bucket|Bambi Bucket]]. Tanks can be filled on the ground (by water tenders or truck-mounted systems) or water can be siphoned from lakes, rivers, reservoirs, or a portable tank through a hanging snorkel. Popular firefighting helicopters include variants of the [[UH-1 Iroquois|Bell 204]], [[Bell 205]], [[Bell 212]], [[Boeing Vertol 107]], [[Boeing Vertol 234]] and the [[S-64 Skycrane|Sikorsky S-64 Aircrane]] helitanker, which features a snorkel for filling from a natural or man-made water source while in hover.

In 1947, the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States Forest Service]] experimented with military aircraft dropping water-filled bombs. The bombs were unsuccessful, and the use of internal water tanks was adopted instead.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Water Bombs for Forest Fires|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0N4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA126|date=October 1947|publisher=Hearst Magazines|page=126}}</ref> Though World War II- and Korean War-era bombers were for a long time the mainstay of the aerial firefighting fleet,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://my.att.net/s/editorial.dll?eeid=6788631&eetype=article&render=y&ck=&ch=ne&ch=ne|title=AT&T - Page Not Available|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2016}}</ref> newer purpose-built tankers have since come online. The smallest are the Single Engine Air Tankers (SEATs). These are agricultural sprayers that generally drop about {{convert|800|gal|l|-2}} of water or retardant. Examples include the [[Air Tractor AT-802]], which can deliver around {{convert|800|gal|l|-2}} of water or fire retardant solution in each drop, and the Soviet [[Antonov An-2]] biplane. Both of these aircraft can be fitted with floats that scoop water from the surface of a body of water. Similar in configuration to the World War II\u2013era [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]], the [[Canadair CL-215]] and its derivative the [[Canadair CL-415|CL-415]] are designed and built specifically for firefighting. The [[Croatian Air Force]] uses six CL-415s as well as six AT 802s for firefighting purposes.\n\nMedium-sized modified aircraft include the [[Grumman S-2 Tracker]] ([[retrofit]]ted with turboprop engines as the S-2T) as used by the [[California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection]], as well as the [[Conair Firecat]] version developed and used by [[Conair Group Inc.]] of Canada, while the [[Douglas DC-4]], the [[Douglas DC-7]], the [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules]], the [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune]], and the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion]] &ndash; and its commercial equivalent, the [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|L-188 Electra]] &ndash; have been used as air tankers.

The leadplane is typically referred to as a \"Bird Dog\" in Canada or \"Supervision\" aircraft in Australia. The [[O-2 Skymaster]], Cessna 310 and [[OV-10 Bronco]] have been used as spotter and lead plane platforms. The [[Ontario]] Ministry of Natural Resources has also used the [[Cessna 337]]. The [[Beechcraft Baron]] was long used as a leadplane or air attack ship, but most were retired in 2003; more common now is the [[Beechcraft King Air]] and the [[Aero Commander 500 family|Twin Commander 690]]. A Cessna Citation 500 jet owned by Air Spray (1967) LTd. was used by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests beginning in 1995 and used for two fire seasons to lead the very fast Electra L188 air tanker to the fires. This was the first time a jet aircraft was used as a lead plane or \"bird dog\". The Department of Parks and Wildlife in Western Australia operates a fleet of nine [[American Champion Scout]]s 8GCBC during the summer months as spotter aircraft and Air Attack platforms. The Provinces of Alberta and British Columbia and the Yukon Territories contract to supply Twin Commander 690 as bird dog aircraft for their air tanker fleets. Air Spray owns 9 Twin Commander 690 for use as bird dog aircraft.\n\n===Fleet grounding===\nIn the United States, most of these aircraft are privately owned and contracted to government agencies, and the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and the [[U.S. Marines]] also maintain fleets of firefighting aircraft. On May 10, 2004, The [[U.S. Forest Service]] (USFS) and the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) announced that they were cancelling contracts with operators of 33 heavy airtankers. They cited liability concerns and an inability to safely manage the fleet after the wing failure and resulting [[2002 airtanker crashes|crash]] of a [[C-130]]A Hercules in [[California]] and a [[PB4Y-2 Privateer|PB4Y-2]] in [[Colorado]] during the summer of 2002. Both aged aircraft broke up in flight due to catastrophic [[metal fatigue|fatigue]] cracks at the wing roots. After subsequent third-party examination and extensive testing of all USFS contracted heavy airtankers, three companies were awarded contracts and now maintain a combined fleet of 23 aircraft.\n\n==Fire retardant==\n[[File:Hercules C130 bombardier d eau Californie.jpg|thumb|A [[Modular Airborne FireFighting System|MAFFS]]-equipped [[Air National Guard]] [[C-130 Hercules]] drops [[fire retardant]] on wildfires in southern California]]\n{{See also|Fire retardant}}\n[[Borate]] salts used in the past to fight wildfires have been found to sterilize the soil and be [[toxin|toxic]] to animals so are now prohibited.<ref>\n{{cite web\n  | url = http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/documents/304c.pdf\n  | title = UDSA Forest Service Specification 5100-304c Long-Term Retardant, Wildland Firefighting\n  | date = June 1, 2007\n  | page = 2\n  | accessdate = 2008-11-24\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081108110004/http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/fire/wfcs/documents/304c.pdf| archivedate= 8 November 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Newer retardants use [[ammonium sulfate]] or [[ammonium polyphosphate]] with [[attapulgite]] [[clay]] thickener or [[diammonium phosphate]] with a [[guar gum]] derivative thickener. These are not only less toxic but act as [[fertilizer]]s to help the regrowth of plants after the fire. Fire retardants often contain [[surfactant|wetting agents]], [[preservative]]s and [[rust inhibitor]]s and are colored red with [[ferric oxide]] or [[Fugitive pigment|fugitive color]] to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include [[Fire-Trol]] and [[Phos-Chek]].\n\nSome water-dropping aircraft carry tanks of a guar gum derivative to thicken the water and reduce runoff.\n\n==Tactics and capabilities==\n[[File:Sikorsky S-70A-27 Picking Up Water.jpg|thumb|A helicopter dips its [[Bambi bucket|bucket]] into a river to drop water on a wildfire in California]]\nHelicopters can hover over the fire and drop water or retardant. The S-64 Helitanker has [[microprocessor]]-controlled doors on its tank. The doors are controlled based on the area to be covered and wind conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass and drop water or retardant like a bomber. Spotter (Air Tactical Group Supervisor) aircraft often orbit the fire at a higher altitude to coordinate the efforts of the smoke jumper, helicopter, media, and retardant-dropping aircraft; while lead planes fly low-level ahead of the airtankers to mark the [[trajectory]] for the drop, and ensure overall safety for both ground-based and aerial firefighters.\n[[File:California Air National Guard waterbombers DOD 100489779-720x406-1500k.theora.ogv|thumbnail|left|Film showing Waterbombers from the California Air National Guard dropping substances used to fight fires.]]\nWater is usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short-lived. Fire retardants are typically dropped ahead of the moving fire or along its edge and may remain effective for two or more days. This can create artificial [[firebreak]]s where the terrain is too rugged or remote for ground crews to cut fireline.\n\nAerial firefighting is most effectively used in conjunction with ground-based efforts, as aircraft are only one weapon in the firefighting arsenal. However, there have been cases of aircraft extinguishing fires long before ground crews were able to reach them.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Christopher|first1=Ben|title=Does Using Airplanes to Put out Forest Fires Actually Work?|url=http://priceonomics.com/does-using-airplanes-to-put-out-forest-fires/|website=Priceonomics|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome firefighting aircraft can refill their tanks in mid-flight, by flying down to skim the surface of large bodies of water. One example is the [[Bombardier CL-415]]. This is particularly useful in rural areas where flying back to an airbase for refills may take too much time.  In 2002 an Ontario CL-415 crew was able to refill 100 times within a 4-hour mission, delivering {{convert|162000|gal|l|-1}} or {{convert|1350000|lb|MT|0}} of water on a fire near [[Dryden, Ontario]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} { June 1, 2002 Dryden fire # 10 Tanker #271 civil ident C-GOGE }\n\n== Incidents ==\n*July 22, 1960: a [[North American B-25 Mitchell]], N3446G SN 44-31466, operating as Tanker 66, impacted the earth during a water bombing run in Mill Canyon in the San Gabriel Mountains on the Magic Mountain Fire.
