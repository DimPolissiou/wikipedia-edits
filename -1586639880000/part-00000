It has traditionally been associated with tenants, environmentalists, and the labour movement. COPE is generally guided by [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] principles and has a long history of advocating for issues such as improving public transit and investing in affordable housing. It last held a majority government on City Council from 2002 to 2005. COPE describes itself as being committed to environmental sustainability and generally supports measures and legislation to reduce municipal greenhouse emissions and to enact other environmental reforms. COPE cites climate change as a threat to the planet and to future generations, and much of its platform is based upon opposition to development that could contribute to climate change or endanger the city from an environmental perspective.\n\nIn 2014, the party adopted policies advocating for aboriginal representation at the municipal level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hui|first1=Stephen|title=COPE backs First Nations votes on Vancouver city council|url=https://www.straight.com/news/681526/cope-backs-first-nations-votes-vancouver-city-council|publisher=The Georgia Straight}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nAccording to its constitution, COPE has three purposes:\n\n# to unite individuals and groups behind a program of progressive civic reform;\n# to involve Vancouver residents and community organizations in public action in furtherance of their interests and the collective interests of  Vancouver; and\n# to nominate and endorse candidates for election to civic office in order to promote these purposes, and to provide direction and guidance to such candidates, both before and after they have been elected.\n\nAnybody who lives, works, or studies in Vancouver can become a member of COPE.\n\nCOPE members meet four times every year at General Meetings to discuss business relating to the party, with one of these meetings being an [[Annual General Meeting]]. In an election year, one meeting will be a Policy Conference, where the COPE membership decides on its election platform, and a Nominations Conference, where the COPE membership decides on its candidates for [[Vancouver City Council]], [[Vancouver School Board]], and [[Vancouver Park Board]].\n\nIn between General Meetings, decisions are made by COPE's Executive Committee, which is elected each year at the party's Annual General Meeting.\n\n== History ==\nCOPE was formed in 1968, originally as the \"Committee of Progressive Electors\", when a number of [[left-wing]] community groups and social justice organizations joined with the city's Labour Council to organize more effectively against the [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA)\u2014a centre-right political party which had dominated civic politics in Vancouver. Frank Kennedy of the Vancouver & District Labour Council and [[Harry Rankin]], an outspoken lawyer and city councillor, were key figures in shaping the coalition, along with activists from the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] and the [[Communist Party of British Columbia]].\n\n=== Beginnings: 1970s and 1980s ===\nFor most of its history, COPE existed in an uneasy relationship with centre-left parties at the municipal level. From 1972 to 1986 COPE competed with [[The Electors' Action Movement]], which governed the city under prominent federal Liberal Mayor [[Art Phillips]] in the mid-1970s. By the late 1970s, a breakaway faction of TEAM, comprising provincial [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] supporters and led by future premier [[Michael Harcourt]] formed an electoral alliance with COPE, from which both parties benefited. Led by Harcourt, the coalition governed from the centre and, although it ran a unified slate with COPE with the cooperation and support of the VDLC, Harcourt's small party of [[Civic Independents]] would sometimes vote with the councillors associated with the NDP and the remaining TEAM councilors against COPE's more socialist policies.\n\nWhen Harcourt stepped down to become a provincial candidate and a renewed NPA led by future premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] absorbed TEAM's two remaining councilors, COPE became the senior partner in its coalition with the Civic Independents. Nominating Rankin as its mayoral candidate, COPE fielded a virtually full slate of candidates (leaving three open spaces for the incumbent Civic Independents) but was badly beaten, the returning to power for the first time in 14 years, and deprived for the next two years of Rankin's leadership in the council chamber.\n\n=== COPE and independents: 1980s\u20131990s ===\nIn 1988, COPE entered the election an equal partner with the newly formed Civic New Democrats, a party directly affiliated with the BC NDP. Led by anti-poverty activist [[Jean Swanson]], the coalition made few gains but under the leadership of [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]] in 1990, the party came close to winning the election. But while all COPE council candidates were elected, no Civic NDP candidates were (since a 1983 by-election, COPE had consistently out-performed all other leftist candidates on the concurrently elected School and Parks Boards). At this point, Vancouver's civic left conceded that the COPE brand was now more popular than any more centrist group. Thus, following the 1990 election, COPE merged with the Civic NDP, changing its name from the Committee of Progressive Electors to the Coalition of Progressive Electors. At this time, COPE made an official overture to the [[Green Party of Vancouver]], the local affiliate of the [[Green Party of British Columbia]], offering the group some minor policy concessions, joint billing in the party's ballot name (\"COPE-Green '93\") and assurances that important party members would ensure some Greens were nominated. The Greens turned the deal down.\n\nSince 1993, COPE has nominated candidates for all civic offices (Mayor, City Councillor, School Board Trustee, and Parks Commissioner) but its closer affiliation with an incumbent provincial NDP government and inability to negotiate a deal with the Greens, who began siphoning votes in increasing numbers, resulted in flagging performance. Rankin's retirement from council also damaged the party. In 1993, COPE's representation fell to only one councilor, future MLA [[Jenny Kwan]]. COPE did not win any seats in 1996, thanks to a strong showing for the Greens and a left-right coalition called VOICE, led by Rankin's wife [[Connie Fogal]] and 1984 mayoral candidate Jonathan Baker. With this fragmentation of the civic left, the NPA won all 27 contested seats in that election with only 43% of the vote.\n\nIn 1999, COPE regained its footholds on School Board and City Council and the Greens gained a seat on Parks Board under the leadership of mayoral candidate [[David Cadman]]. The two independent candidates who had also joined the coalition were defeated, although former NPA councilor [[Nancy Chiavario]] came close to keeping her council seat after being pushed out by supporters of [[Jennifer Clarke]] at the NPA nominating meeting.\n\n=== COPE's first government: 2002 ===\nIn 2002, the NPA was divided between a right-wing faction led by Jennifer Clarke and a moderate faction led by then NPA Mayor [[Philip Owen]], creating the possibility of a COPE majority.\n\nFormer Chief Coroner and RCMP officer [[Larry Campbell]], fictionalized on the CBC show ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]'' whom COPE nominated as its mayoral candidate. Although Campbell attempted to keep the Greens in the fold, a new provincial leadership had taken control and pulled the party out of its municipal coalitions.\n\nBut Clarke's takeover of the NPA and purge of its centrists was highly unpopular with Vancouver voters, especially her movement's deposition of the incumbent mayor, an ally of Campbell. Now led by a centrist for the first time, COPE defeated the NPA in every seat it contested.\n\nIn the [[2002 Vancouver municipal election|2002 municipal election]], an unprecedented surge in voter turnout elected the first COPE mayor and board majorities in Vancouver's history. Every candidate running under COPE's banner was elected.\n\nAfter the election, the party created a new Climate Task Force, implemented ethical purchasing policy, built bike routes, and legalized secondary suites, among other initiatives.\n\n=== Vision Vancouver splits: 2005 ===\nBy late 2004, there were growing signs of disunity between the COPE mayor and some COPE councillors. Campbell formed an independent caucus along with three of his COPE colleagues (although they all remained as members of the party). The other COPE councillors remained in the original COPE caucus.\n\nThe maverick COPE councillors (dubbed \"COPE Lite\" or \"Diet COPE\" by the media) eventually separated and formed a new party, [[Vision Vancouver]], to run in the 2005 municipal election. COPE did not run a mayoral candidate to challenge Vision nominee, former COPE councillor [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]] .\n\nIn the election for Vancouver City Council held in November 2005, only one COPE councillor (David Cadman) was elected. The party was reduced to three seats on the city school board and two on the parks board, newcomer [[Spencer Chandra Herbert|Spencer Herbert]], and [[Loretta Woodcock]].\n\n=== More alliances: 2007\u20132008 ===\nIn May 2007, a slate was elected to the COPE Executive, called \"the group of seven\" or \"the facebook group\" by some media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceyeonline.com/archives/002411.html|title=At least they're not the Gang of Four|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113202838/http://www.publiceyeonline.com/archives/002411.html|archivedate=November 13, 2012|publisher=Public Eye Online|accessdate=July 24, 2014}}</ref> All seven members of the slate were elected with a mandate to seek an electoral coalition with Vision Vancouver. From 2007 to 2008, 50% of COPE's Executive was under the age of 30, unprecedented for a major civic municipal party in Canada. From May 2007 to spring 2008, COPE made overtures to Vision Vancouver to enter into a coalition for the 2008 election \"to defeat the NPA\" with little success. It was not until Gregor Robertson was nominated as Vision Vancouver's mayoral candidate that formal negotiations between the two organizations began in early summer of 2008.\n\nCOPE and Vision Vancouver reached a tentative agreement in late summer 2008, which was later ratified by the Vision Vancouver Executive and COPE membership. COPE agreed not to run a mayoral candidate to avoid splitting the progressive vote.\n\n=== Decline: 2008\u20132011 ===\nIn the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election]] voters replaced the NPA-dominated council with a near sweep of COPE, Green and Vision Vancouver candidates. COPE elected six of nine candidates, running a new media and youth-oriented campaign.\n\nIn the leadup to the 2011 election, several party activists launched a campaign to separate from Vision Vancouver, arguing that in coalition with Vision, that COPE \"[hadn't] been able to do anything.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Yolande|url=https://www.straight.com/news/campaign-launched-against-cope-election-agreement-vision-vancouver|title=Campaign launched against COPE election agreement with Vision Vancouver|publisher=The Georgia Straight|date=June 21, 2011}}</ref> The activists were defeated by the majority of COPE members.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charlie|title=COPE members ratify electoral deal with Vision Vancouver|url=https://www.straight.com/news/cope-members-ratify-electoral-deal-vision-vancouver|publisher=The Georgia Straight}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2011 Vancouver municipal election|November 19, 2011 election]], a single COPE candidate was elected.  The elected candidate was [[incumbent]] Allan Wong, as one of nine school trustees.

It has traditionally been associated with tenants, environmentalists, and the labour movement. COPE is generally guided by [[Social democracy|social-democratic]] principles and has a long history of advocating for issues such as improving public transit and investing in affordable housing. It last held a majority government on City Council from 2002 to 2005. COPE describes itself as being committed to environmental sustainability and generally supports measures and legislation to reduce municipal greenhouse emissions and to enact other environmental reforms. COPE cites climate change as a threat to the planet and to future generations, and much of its platform is based upon opposition to development that could contribute to climate change or endanger the city from an environmental perspective.\n\nIn 2014, the party adopted policies advocating for aboriginal representation at the municipal level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hui|first1=Stephen|title=COPE backs First Nations votes on Vancouver city council|url=https://www.straight.com/news/681526/cope-backs-first-nations-votes-vancouver-city-council|publisher=The Georgia Straight}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nAccording to its constitution, COPE has three purposes:\n\n# to unite individuals and groups behind a program of progressive civic reform;\n# to involve Vancouver residents and community organizations in public action in furtherance of their interests and the collective interests of  Vancouver; and\n# to nominate and endorse candidates for election to civic office in order to promote these purposes, and to provide direction and guidance to such candidates, both before and after they have been elected.\n\nAnybody who lives, works, or studies in Vancouver can become a member of COPE.\n\nCOPE members meet four times every year at General Meetings to discuss business relating to the party, with one of these meetings being an [[Annual General Meeting]]. In an election year, one meeting will be a Policy Conference, where the COPE membership decides on its election platform, and a Nominations Conference, where the COPE membership decides on its candidates for [[Vancouver City Council]], [[Vancouver School Board]], and [[Vancouver Park Board]].\n\nIn between General Meetings, decisions are made by COPE's Executive Committee, which is elected each year at the party's Annual General Meeting.\n\n== History ==\nCOPE was formed in 1968, originally as the \"Committee of Progressive Electors\", when a number of [[left-wing]] community groups and social justice organizations joined with the city's Labour Council to organize more effectively against the [[Non-Partisan Association]] (NPA)\u2014a centre-right political party which had dominated civic politics in Vancouver. Frank Kennedy of the Vancouver & District Labour Council and [[Harry Rankin]], an outspoken lawyer and city councillor, were key figures in shaping the coalition, along with activists from the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]] and the [[Communist Party of British Columbia]].\n\n=== Beginnings: 1970s and 1980s ===\nFor most of its history, COPE existed in an uneasy relationship with centre-left parties at the municipal level. From 1972 to 1986 COPE competed with [[The Electors' Action Movement]], which governed the city under prominent federal Liberal Mayor [[Art Phillips]] in the mid-1970s. By the late 1970s, a breakaway faction of TEAM, comprising provincial [[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] supporters and led by future premier [[Michael Harcourt]] formed an electoral alliance with COPE, from which both parties benefited. Led by Harcourt, the coalition governed from the centre and, although it ran a unified slate with COPE with the cooperation and support of the VDLC, Harcourt's small party of [[Civic Independents]] would sometimes vote with the councillors associated with the NDP and the remaining TEAM councilors against COPE's more socialist policies.\n\nWhen Harcourt stepped down to become a provincial candidate and a renewed NPA led by future premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] absorbed TEAM's two remaining councilors, COPE became the senior partner in its coalition with the Civic Independents. Nominating Rankin as its mayoral candidate, COPE fielded a virtually full slate of candidates (leaving three open spaces for the incumbent Civic Independents) but was badly beaten, the returning to power for the first time in 14 years, and deprived for the next two years of Rankin's leadership in the council chamber.\n\n=== COPE and independents: 1980s\u20131990s ===\nIn 1988, COPE entered the election an equal partner with the newly formed Civic New Democrats, a party directly affiliated with the BC NDP. Led by anti-poverty activist [[Jean Swanson]], the coalition made few gains but under the leadership of [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]] in 1990, the party came close to winning the election. But while all COPE council candidates were elected, no Civic NDP candidates were (since a 1983 by-election, COPE had consistently out-performed all other leftist candidates on the concurrently elected School and Parks Boards). At this point, Vancouver's civic left conceded that the COPE brand was now more popular than any more centrist group. Thus, following the 1990 election, COPE merged with the Civic NDP, changing its name from the Committee of Progressive Electors to the Coalition of Progressive Electors. At this time, COPE made an official overture to the [[Green Party of Vancouver]], the local affiliate of the [[Green Party of British Columbia]], offering the group some minor policy concessions, joint billing in the party's ballot name (\"COPE-Green '93\") and assurances that important party members would ensure some Greens were nominated. The Greens turned the deal down.\n\nSince 1993, COPE has nominated candidates for all civic offices (Mayor, City Councillor, School Board Trustee, and Parks Commissioner) but its closer affiliation with an incumbent provincial NDP government and inability to negotiate a deal with the Greens, who began siphoning votes in increasing numbers, resulted in flagging performance. Rankin's retirement from council also damaged the party. In 1993, COPE's representation fell to only one councilor, future MLA [[Jenny Kwan]]. COPE did not win any seats in 1996, thanks to a strong showing for the Greens and a left-right coalition called VOICE, led by Rankin's wife [[Connie Fogal]] and 1984 mayoral candidate Jonathan Baker. With this fragmentation of the civic left, the NPA won all 27 contested seats in that election with only 43% of the vote.\n\nIn 1999, COPE regained its footholds on School Board and City Council and the Greens gained a seat on Parks Board under the leadership of mayoral candidate [[David Cadman]]. The two independent candidates who had also joined the coalition were defeated, although former NPA councilor [[Nancy Chiavario]] came close to keeping her council seat after being pushed out by supporters of [[Jennifer Clarke]] at the NPA nominating meeting.\n\n=== COPE's first government: 2002 ===\nIn 2002, the NPA was divided between a right-wing faction led by Jennifer Clarke and a moderate faction led by then NPA Mayor [[Philip Owen]], creating the possibility of a COPE majority.\n\nFormer Chief Coroner and RCMP officer [[Larry Campbell]], fictionalized on the CBC show ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]'' whom COPE nominated as its mayoral candidate. Although Campbell attempted to keep the Greens in the fold, a new provincial leadership had taken control and pulled the party out of its municipal coalitions.\n\nBut Clarke's takeover of the NPA and purge of its centrists was highly unpopular with Vancouver voters, especially her movement's deposition of the incumbent mayor, an ally of Campbell. Now led by a centrist for the first time, COPE defeated the NPA in every seat it contested.\n\nIn the [[2002 Vancouver municipal election|2002 municipal election]], an unprecedented surge in voter turnout elected the first COPE mayor and board majorities in Vancouver's history. Every candidate running under COPE's banner was elected.\n\nAfter the election, the party created a new Climate Task Force, implemented ethical purchasing policy, built bike routes, and legalized secondary suites, among other initiatives.\n\n=== Vision Vancouver splits: 2005 ===\nBy late 2004, there were growing signs of disunity between the COPE mayor and some COPE councillors. Campbell formed an independent caucus along with three of his COPE colleagues (although they all remained as members of the party). The other COPE councillors remained in the original COPE caucus.\n\nThe maverick COPE councillors (dubbed \"COPE Lite\" or \"Diet COPE\" by the media) eventually separated and formed a new party, [[Vision Vancouver]], to run in the 2005 municipal election. COPE did not run a mayoral candidate to challenge Vision nominee, former COPE councillor [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]] .\n\nIn the election for Vancouver City Council held in November 2005, only one COPE councillor (David Cadman) was elected. The party was reduced to three seats on the city school board and two on the parks board, newcomer [[Spencer Chandra Herbert|Spencer Herbert]], and [[Loretta Woodcock]].\n\n=== More alliances: 2007\u20132008 ===\nIn May 2007, a slate was elected to the COPE Executive, called \"the group of seven\" or \"the facebook group\" by some media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publiceyeonline.com/archives/002411.html|title=At least they're not the Gang of Four|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113202838/http://www.publiceyeonline.com/archives/002411.html|archivedate=13 November 2012|publisher=Public Eye Online|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> All seven members of the slate were elected with a mandate to seek an electoral coalition with Vision Vancouver. From 2007 to 2008, 50% of COPE's Executive was under the age of 30, unprecedented for a major civic municipal party in Canada. From May 2007 to spring 2008, COPE made overtures to Vision Vancouver to enter into a coalition for the 2008 election \"to defeat the NPA\" with little success. It was not until Gregor Robertson was nominated as Vision Vancouver's mayoral candidate that formal negotiations between the two organizations began in early summer of 2008.\n\nCOPE and Vision Vancouver reached a tentative agreement in late summer 2008, which was later ratified by the Vision Vancouver Executive and COPE membership. COPE agreed not to run a mayoral candidate to avoid splitting the progressive vote.\n\n=== Decline: 2008\u20132011 ===\nIn the [[2008 Vancouver municipal election]] voters replaced the NPA-dominated council with a near sweep of COPE, Green and Vision Vancouver candidates. COPE elected six of nine candidates, running a new media and youth-oriented campaign.\n\nIn the leadup to the 2011 election, several party activists launched a campaign to separate from Vision Vancouver, arguing that in coalition with Vision, that COPE \"[hadn't] been able to do anything.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Yolande|url=https://www.straight.com/news/campaign-launched-against-cope-election-agreement-vision-vancouver|title=Campaign launched against COPE election agreement with Vision Vancouver|publisher=The Georgia Straight|date=June 21, 2011}}</ref> The activists were defeated by the majority of COPE members.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charlie|title=COPE members ratify electoral deal with Vision Vancouver|url=https://www.straight.com/news/cope-members-ratify-electoral-deal-vision-vancouver|publisher=The Georgia Straight}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2011 Vancouver municipal election|November 19, 2011 election]], a single COPE candidate was elected.  The elected candidate was [[incumbent]] Allan Wong, as one of nine school trustees.  COPE ran a total of nine candidates in the election.\n\nOn December 8, 2013, Allan Wong, COPE's sole elected politician, resigned from the party to join Vision Vancouver.\n\n=== 2011\u20132014 ===\nAfter the election loss in 2011, a group called \"Independent COPE\" was elected to COPE's Executive Board.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hui|first1=Stephen|title=Coalition of Progressive Electors chooses new executive|url=https://www.straight.com/news/coalition-progressive-electors-chooses-new-executive|publisher=The Georgia Straight}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, a number of high-profile COPE members and former candidates left the party, including former [[Vancouver School Board]] trustee Jane Bouey, former [[BC NDP]] MLA [[David Chudnovsky (politician)|David Chudnovsky]], former candidates RJ Aquino and Gwen Giesbrecht, and [[Stuart Parker (politician)|Stuart Parker]].<ref>Lindsay, Bethany.

The Japanese garrison in Penang surrendered on 2 September and a party of [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] commandos landed on Penang Island the following day, thus returning Penang to British rule.\n\nConsequently, Penang became the first state in Malaya to be liberated by the British; Singapore would only be formally surrendered to the British on 12 September, while the rest of Malaya was subsequently liberated in the following weeks.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the final phases of [[World War II]], the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union launched an invasion of Manchuria]], while the [[Operation Downfall|Americans were also planning a massive invasion of Japan]] itself. Concurrently, the British-led [[South East Asia Command|Southeast Asia Command]], fresh from their success in [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|reconquering Burma from Japanese hands]], drew up plans to recapture [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese-held Malaya]], codenamed [[Operation Zipper]].\n\nThe original plans had called for an amphibious assault on the western coast of Malaya by over 100,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] infantry, equivalent to two [[Division (military)|divisions]] and a [[brigade]], to capture [[Port Klang|Port Swettenham]] in Selangor and [[Port Dickson District|Port Dickson]] in [[Negeri Sembilan]]. Once the beachhead was secured and reinforced, two separate thrusts were to be accomplished\u2014[[Operation Mailfist]] southwards to [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Singapore]] and Operation Broadsword north towards [[Penang]].<ref>Chant (2013)</ref> The British had expected to commence Operation Zipper on 9 September 1945 and Operation Mailfist in December 1945, concluding in the liberation of [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] by March 1946.<ref>Warren, p. 297</ref>\n\nThe Americans opposed the British plans of reconquering Malaya on the grounds that such a campaign would divert a considerable amount of shipping and other resources from their planned invasion of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], Operation Downfall. However, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] believed that it was necessary to liberate Singapore as soon as possible on both military and political grounds.\n\nHowever, the sudden [[surrender of Japan]] in the face of Soviet conquests in Manchuria and Sakhalin Islands, and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], forestalled all the plans.\n\nOperation Zipper, therefore, had to be reduced in scale; while the bulk of the Allied forces would be allocated for the liberation of Singapore under [[Operation Tiderace]], a detachment of the [[Royal Navy]] fleet and the accompanying [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] commandos were tasked with the liberation of Penang instead, codenamed Operation Jurist. The liberation of Penang, which was to be carried out prior to Operation Tiderace, was intended to test Japanese intentions; up to that point, it was still unclear whether the [[Japanese Seventh Area Army|Japanese forces in Malaya]] would surrender or continue resisting the Allies.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia|last=Bayly; Christopher Alan|first=Harper, Timothy Norman|publisher=Harvard University|year=2007|isbn=9780674021532|location=United States|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenwarsfre00bayl}}</ref>\n[[File:HMS Nelson off Spithead for the Fleet Review.jpg|left|thumb|{{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s Task Force 11.]]\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== British ===\n[[File:HMS Petard 1943 IWM A 21715.jpg|left|thumb|Royal Navy [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Petard|G56|6}}]]\nThe Royal Navy's Task Force 11 allocated to Operation Jurist consisted of the following ships.\n{| class=\"sortable\"\n| [[Battleship]]\n| {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}}\n|-\n| [[Escort carrier]]s\n|\n* {{HMS|Attacker|D02|6}}\n* {{HMS|Hunter|D80|6}}\n|-\n| [[Light cruiser]]\n| {{HMS|Ceylon|30|6}}\n|-\n| [[Destroyer]]s\n|\n* {{HMS|Paladin|G69|6}}\n* {{HMS|Petard|G56|6}}\n* {{HMS|Volage|R41|6}}\n|-\n| Other vessels:\n| 3 [[Landing ship, infantry|infantry landing ships]]\n|}\n[[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] [[Harold Walker (Royal Navy officer)|Harold Walker]], with his [[flagship]] HMS ''Nelson'', was appointed the commander of the detachment.\n\nIn addition, Royal Marine commandos of the [[3 Commando Brigade|3rd Brigade]] formed the ground forces for Operation Jurist.\n\n=== Japanese ===\nAir strength in both Malaya and [[Sumatra]] was estimated to be a little more than 170 aircraft.<ref>Park, p. 2156, para 371.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese Seventh Area Army, which was responsible for the defence of Malaya (including Singapore) and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], included about 26,000 soldiers stationed in Malaya.

The Japanese garrison in Penang surrendered on 2 September and a party of [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] commandos landed on Penang Island the following day, thus returning Penang to British rule.\n\nConsequently, Penang became the first state in Malaya to be liberated by the British; Singapore would only be formally surrendered to the British on 12 September, while the rest of Malaya was subsequently liberated in the following weeks.\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the final phases of [[World War II]], the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|Soviet Union launched an invasion of Manchuria]], while the [[Operation Downfall|Americans were also planning a massive invasion of Japan]] itself. Concurrently, the British-led [[South East Asia Command|Southeast Asia Command]], fresh from their success in [[Burma Campaign 1944\u201345|reconquering Burma from Japanese hands]], drew up plans to recapture [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese-held Malaya]], codenamed [[Operation Zipper]].\n\nThe original plans had called for an amphibious assault on the western coast of Malaya by over 100,000 [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] infantry, equivalent to two [[Division (military)|divisions]] and a [[brigade]], to capture [[Port Klang|Port Swettenham]] in Selangor and [[Port Dickson District|Port Dickson]] in [[Negeri Sembilan]]. Once the beachhead was secured and reinforced, two separate thrusts were to be accomplished\u2014[[Operation Mailfist]] southwards to [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Singapore]] and Operation Broadsword north towards [[Penang]].<ref>Chant (2013)</ref> The British had expected to commence Operation Zipper on 9 September 1945 and Operation Mailfist in December 1945, concluding in the liberation of [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]] by March 1946.<ref>Warren, p. 297</ref>\n\nThe Americans opposed the British plans of reconquering Malaya on the grounds that such a campaign would divert a considerable amount of shipping and other resources from their planned invasion of [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], Operation Downfall. However, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]] believed that it was necessary to liberate Singapore as soon as possible on both military and political grounds.\n\nHowever, the sudden [[surrender of Japan]] in the face of Soviet conquests in Manchuria and Sakhalin Islands, and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], forestalled all the plans.\n\nOperation Zipper, therefore, had to be reduced in scale; while the bulk of the Allied forces would be allocated for the liberation of Singapore under [[Operation Tiderace]], a detachment of the [[Royal Navy]] fleet and the accompanying [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] commandos were tasked with the liberation of Penang instead, codenamed Operation Jurist. The liberation of Penang, which was to be carried out prior to Operation Tiderace, was intended to test Japanese intentions; up to that point, it was still unclear whether the [[Japanese Seventh Area Army|Japanese forces in Malaya]] would surrender or continue resisting the Allies.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Forgotten Wars: Freedom and Revolution in Southeast Asia|last=Bayly; Christopher Alan|first=Harper, Timothy Norman|publisher=Harvard University|year=2007|isbn=9780674021532|location=United States|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forgottenwarsfre00bayl}}</ref>\n[[File:HMS Nelson off Spithead for the Fleet Review.jpg|left|thumb|{{HMS|Nelson|28|6}} served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s Task Force 11.]]\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== British ===\n[[File:HMS Petard 1943 IWM A 21715.jpg|left|thumb|Royal Navy [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Petard|G56|6}}]]\nThe Royal Navy's Task Force 11 allocated to Operation Jurist consisted of the following ships.\n{| class=\"sortable\"\n| [[Battleship]]\n| {{HMS|Nelson|28|6}}\n|-\n| [[Escort carrier]]s\n|\n* {{HMS|Attacker|D02|6}}\n* {{HMS|Hunter|D80|6}}\n|-\n| [[Light cruiser]]\n| {{HMS|Ceylon|30|6}}\n|-\n| [[Destroyer]]s\n|\n* {{HMS|Paladin|G69|6}}\n* {{HMS|Petard|G56|6}}\n* {{HMS|Volage|R41|6}}\n|-\n| Other vessels:\n| 3 [[Landing ship, infantry|infantry landing ships]]\n|}\n[[Vice admiral (Royal Navy)|Vice Admiral]] [[Harold Walker (Royal Navy officer)|Harold Walker]], with his [[flagship]] HMS ''Nelson'', was appointed the commander of the detachment.\n\nIn addition, Royal Marine commandos of the [[3 Commando Brigade|3rd Brigade]] formed the ground forces for Operation Jurist.\n\n=== Japanese ===\nAir strength in both Malaya and [[Sumatra]] was estimated to be a little more than 170 aircraft.<ref>Park, p. 2156, para 371.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese Seventh Area Army, which was responsible for the defence of Malaya (including Singapore) and [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Borneo]], included about 26,000 soldiers stationed in Malaya.
