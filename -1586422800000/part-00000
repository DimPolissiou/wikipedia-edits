The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, although has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within [[political science]] and other [[social science]]s, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.\n\nA common framework for interpreting populism is known as the [[Ideation (creative process)|ideational]] approach: this defines ''populism'' as an [[ideology]] which presents \"the people\" as a morally good force and contrasts them against \"the elite\", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how \"the people\" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present \"the elite\" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups\u2014such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants\u2014above the interests of \"the people\". Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the \"voice of the people\". According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], or [[socialism]]. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]], and there exist both [[left-wing populism]] and [[right-wing populism]].\n\nOther scholars of the social sciences have defined the term ''populism'' differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, ''populism'' refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the political scientist [[Ernesto Laclau]] presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant [[Power (social and political)|power structures]]. Some [[economics|economists]] have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in [[hyperinflation]] and emergency measures. In popular discourse\u2014where the term has often been used pejoratively\u2014it has sometimes been used synonymously with [[demagogue|demagogy]], to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with [[political opportunism|opportunism]], to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.\n\nThe term ''populism'' came into use in the late 19th century alongside the promotion of [[democracy]]. In the United States, it was closely associated with the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], while in the [[Russian Empire]] it was linked to the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement. In the 1960s the term became increasingly popular among [[social science|social scientists]] in Western countries, and later in the 20th century it was applied to various political parties active in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. In the 21st century, the term became increasingly common in political discourse, particularly in the Americas and Europe, to describe a range of left-wing, right-wing, and centrist groups that challenged the established parties. When in office in liberal democracies, populists have often been responsible for [[democratic backsliding]] \u2013 also called \"democratic erosion\" or \"de-democratisation\" \u2013 as they undermine independent institutions like the media or judiciary which they consider hostile to the \"will of the people\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201393; 95\u201396}}<ref>{{Cite

Canovan on how the term ''populism'' was used, 1981{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=3}} }}\n\nThe word ''populism'' is a vague and contested term that has been used in reference to a diverse variety of phenomena.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=3|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2p=544|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2|5a1=Anselmi|5y=2018|5p=5|6a1=Hawkins|6a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|6y=2019|6p=3}} The political scientist Will Brett characterised it as \"a classic example of a stretched concept, pulled out of shape by overuse and misuse\",{{sfn|Brett|2013|p=410}} while the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is \"one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time\".{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=162}}\n\nThe term originated as a form of self-designation, being used by members of the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] active in the United States during the late 19th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=5|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148}} In the [[Russian Empire]] during the same period, a group referred to itself as the ''[[narodniki]]'', which has often been translated into English as ''populists''.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2pp=5\u20136}} The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=14}} In the 1920s, the term entered the [[French language]], where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} Following 2016, the year which saw the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president of the United States and [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union]]\u2014both events linked to populism\u2014the word ''populism'' became one of the most widely

|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as \"populists\".{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} As noted by the political scientist [[Margaret Canovan]], \"there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings.\"{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} In this it differs from other political terms, like \"[[socialism]]\" or \"[[conservatism]]\", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the word.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Tormey|3y=2018|3p=260}} Instead it shares similarities with terms such as \"[[Far-left politics|far left]]\", \"[[Far-right politics|far right]]\", or \"[[Extremism|extremist]]\", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}}\n \nIn popular discourse, the term \"populism\" has often been conflated with other concepts like [[demagoguery]],{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=101|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=1}} and generally presented as something to be \"feared and discredited\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to [[democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2p=260}} The political scientists Yves M\u00e9ny and Yves Surel noted that \"populism\" had become \"a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy.\"{{sfn|M\u00e9ny|Surel|2002|p=3}} Typically, the term is usually used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=243|2a1=Stanley|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=Albertazzi|3a2=McDonnell|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2}} Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as \"populists\" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} The French far-right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that \"Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}}  Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Lithuanian Labour Party]] declared: \"we are and will be called populists.\"{{sfn|March|2007|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n===Use in academia===\n\nUntil the 1950s, use of the term ''populism'' remained restricted largely to historians studying the People's Party, but in 1954 the U.S. sociologist [[Edward Shils]] published an article proposing ''populism'' as a term to describe anti-elite trends in U.S. society more broadly.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|pp=372\u2013373}} Following on from Shils' article, during the 1960s the term \"populism\" became increasingly popular among [[sociology|sociologists]] and other academics in the [[social sciences]].{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the [[London School of Economics]], the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|p=378}} As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as \"populism studies\" emerged.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in \"bursts\" of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=63}}\n\n[[File:Cas Mudde in 2018 05.jpg|thumb|left|The Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde has been among those arguing that political scientists should use the term ''populism'' despite its problems]]\n\nCanovan noted that \"if the notion of ''populism'' did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=301}} From examining how the term \"populism\" had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of \"agrarian populism\"; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of \"political populism\", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=13|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2pp=550\u2013551}} She noted that these were \"analytical constructs\" and that \"real-life examples may well overlap several categories\",{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=289}} In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=6}}\n\nThe confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=5}} In contrast to this view, the political scientists [[Cas Mudde]] and Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that \"while the frustration is understandable, the term ''populism'' is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away

pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that \"if carefully defined, the term 'populism' can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that \"although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an

idea that it should reference some form of relationship between \"the people\" and \"the elite\",{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira

display.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=150|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In this definition, the term ''populism'' is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to \"the people\" and then contrast this group against \"the elite\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=6|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=487}} \n\nAdopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that \"pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as \"a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}}\n\nIn this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of \"an antagonistic relationship\" between \"the people\" and \"the elite\", and is \"latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a \"homogenous community-people\" which \"perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty\" and \"expresses an anti-establishment attitude.\"{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=8}} This understanding conceives of populism as a [[discourse]], [[ideology]], or [[worldview]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}}\n\nAccording to this approach, populism is viewed as a \"thin ideology\" or \"thin-centred ideology\" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the \"thick-centred\" or \"full\" ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[liberalism]], and socialism, which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=64|3a1=Stanley|3y=2008|3pp=95, 99\u2013100, 106|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=6|5a1=Hawkins|5a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|5y=2019|5pp=4\u20135}} Thus, populism can be found merged with forms of [[nationalism]], liberalism, socialism, [[federalism]], or conservatism.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} According to Stanley, \"the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}\n\nPopulism is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}}\nMudde noted that populism is \"moralistic rather than programmatic\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into \"friends and foes\", with the latter being regarded not just as people who have \"different priorities and values\" but as being fundamentally \"evil\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} In emphasising one's purity against the corruption and immorality of \"the elite\", from which \"the people\" must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}}\n\n===Right and left-wing===\n\nAs a result of the various different ideologies which populism can be paired with, the forms that populism can take vary widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=6|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=4}} Populism itself cannot be positioned on the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]],{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=294|2a1=Brett|2y=2013|2p=410|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=8}} and both right and left-wing populisms exist.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=65|2a1=Abi-Hassan|2y=2017|2p=428|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Populist movements can also confound obvious divisions between left and right, for instance by combining xenophobic attitudes commonly associated with the right with redistributive economic policies closer to those of the left.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=vi}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=[Populism's] core consists of four distinct but interrelated concepts:\n* The existence of two homogeneous units of analysis: 'the people' and 'the elite'.\n* The antagonistic relationship between the people and the elite.\n* The idea of popular sovereignty.\n* The positive valorisation of 'the people' and denigration of 'the elite'.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Ben Stanley{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} }}\n\nThe ideologies which populism can be paired with can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru's [[Alberto Fujimori]] who promoted [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with those like Venezuela's [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] who promoted socialist programmes.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=8\u20139}} As well as populists of the left and right, populist figures like Italy's [[Beppe Grillo]] have been characterised as [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]],{{sfn|Brett|2013|pp=410\u2013411}} while groups like Turkey's [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] have been described as combining populism with [[Islamism]],{{sfn|Park|2018|p=170}} and India's [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been seen as mixing populism with [[Hindu nationalism]].{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=495}} Although populists of different ideological traditions can oppose each other, they can also form coalitions, as was seen in the Greek coalition government which brought together the left-wing populist [[Syriza]] and the right-wing populist [[Independent Greeks]] in 2015.{{sfn|Aslanidis|Rovira Kaltwasser|2016|p=1078}}\n\nAdherents of the ideational definition have also drawn a distinction between left and right-wing populists.

Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} Populists often favour the use of [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] measures such as [[referenda]] and [[plebiscites]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=104|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=17}} For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} although Stanley cautioned that \"support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}\nPopulist notions of the \"general will\" and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of \"[[common sense]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Akkerman|1y=2003|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=18}}\n\n===Versus elitism and pluralism===\n\n[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters from the [[Tea Party movement]], a right-wing populist formation in the [[United States]]]]\n\nStanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to \"the people\" had become \"an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice\", with elections and referenda predicated on the notion that \"the people\" decide the outcome.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements. Responding to this critique, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that the ideational definition did allow for a \"non-populism\" in the form of both [[elitism]] and [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=543|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7}}\n\nElitists share the populist binary division but reverse the associations. Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view \"the people\" as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and \"the elites\" as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=543\u201344|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some\u2014such as Spain's [[Francisco Franco]] and Chile's [[Augusto Pinochet]]\u2014reject democracy altogether, while others\u2014like Spain's [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] and Austria's [[Joseph Schumpeter]]\u2014support a limited model of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=7}}\n\nPluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7|3a1=Hawkins|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2019|3p=4}} Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group\u2014whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership\u2014and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=7\u20138}} Unlike populists, pluralists do not believe that such a thing as a \"general will\" exists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=152}} Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}}\n\n==Other definitions==\n\nThe popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilisation of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}}\n\n[[File:Presentaci\u00f3n del Documental CATASTROIKA y Presentaci\u00f3n de la Revista Debates y Combates (7215329954).jpg|thumb|left|The Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]] developed his own definition of populism.

in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] while in Europe, many [[Member state of the European Union|countries in the European Union]] were pushed to implement unpopular economic [[austerity]] measures by the union's authorities.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===Leaders===\nPopulism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders,{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=268}} and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"the quintessential form of populist mobilisation\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with \"the people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=44}} and in many cases they claim to be a personification of \"the people\" themselves,{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=43|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=197}} presenting themselves as the ''vox populi'' or \"voice of the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=62|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=204}} Chavez for instance stated: \"I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=202}} Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded \"enemies of the people\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=7}}\n\nThe overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} although there have been various females occupying this role.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=69}} Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] was the wife of [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[Marine Le Pen]] the daughter of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], [[Keiko Fujimori]] the daughter of [[Alberto Fujimori]], and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] the sister of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n====Rhetorical styles====\n\n{{Multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Sarah Palin by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Silvio Berlusconi (2010) cropped.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Populist leaders often play on gendered stereotypes.

the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in [[Carinthia]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} Similarly, the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]] party has its stronghold in [[Antwerp]], while the [[Swiss People's Party]] has its stronghold in [[Zurich]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}}\n\n[[Tabloid journalism|Tabloid]]s are often stereotyped as presenting a platform for populist politics due to their tendency toward melodrama, infotainment, and conflict, and thus provide support for populist parties.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Examples of this have been the support given by ''Kronen Zeitung'' to the Austrian Freedom Party and the Berlusconi-owned presses' support for Italy's [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] in the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Based on his analysis of Dutch and British media, Tjitske Akkerman however argued that tabloids were no more prone to populism than the [[quality press]].{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=942}} In the 21st century, populist parties have increasingly used [[social media]] to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences.{{sfn|Stier|Posch|Bleier|Strohmaier|2017|p=1365}}\n\n===Social movements===\n\n[[File:Madrid - Acampada Sol 2011 43.JPG|\"Hear the wrath of the people,\" a member of the Indignados, a Spanish left-wing populist movement, in [[Puerta del Sol]]|thumb|right|170px]]\n\nAn additional form is that of the populist social movement.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=10}} Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most [[social movement]]s focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with \"the people\" more broadly.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the [[Occupy movement]], which originated in the US and used the slogan \"We are the 99%\", and the Spanish [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Indignados movement]], which employed the motto: \"real democracy now \u2013 we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=48}}\n\nFew populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} An example of this can be seen with the [[India Against Corruption]] social movement, from which emerged [[Arvind Kejriwal]], who founded the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] (\"Common Man Party\").{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] party led by [[Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=56\u201357|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2pp=266\u201367}} These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the U.S. during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and [[Bernie Sanders]] as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=11}}\n\nSome populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}} These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}}\n\n==Other themes==\n\n===Democracy===\n\nThere have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}} Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only \"true\" form of democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=79}} Populists often present themselves as \"true democrats\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were \"inextricably linked\",{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=10}} the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being \"deeply connected with democracy\",{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=2}} and March suggested that populism represented a \"critique of democracy, not an alternative to it\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that \"In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}}\n\nPopulism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=72|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=83, 84}} It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable.{{sfn|March|2007|pp=72\u201373}} When some populists have taken power\u2014most notable Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela\u2014they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referenda.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=93\u201394}} For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: [[Ren\u00e9 Cuperus]] of the [[Dutch Labour Party]] for instance called for [[social democracy]] to become \"more 'populist' in a leftist way\" in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\n[[File:Referendum 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been cited as a populist leader who has undermined liberal democracy on taking power{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}}]]\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that \"populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with ''liberal'' democracy,\" since populism is based on putting into effect \"the will of the people\". It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201381}} Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the \"general will\" of \"the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=73|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=81|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=493}} In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] described as the \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\nPopulists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating,{{sfn|Akkerman|2003|p=56}} and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=82}} Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=84}} In several instances\u2014such as Orban in Hungary\u2014the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}} A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause democratic backsliding and attack individual rights than non-populists.<ref>Jordan Kyle, Yascha Mounk, [https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/populist-harm-democracy \"The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment], Institute for Global Change, 26 December 2018, accessed 29 March 2019</ref>\n\nEven when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=98}}\n\n===Mainstream responses===\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=110}} They also argued that stronger [[rule of law]] and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=111}} They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who \"claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented \"them\" as \"evil\" or \"foolish\", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}} In their view, \"the best way to deal with populism is to engage\u2014as difficult as it is\u2014in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters\" in order to \"better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=In trying to win over populist supporters, and perhaps even some elites, liberal democrats should avoid both simplistic solutions that pander to \"the people\" and elitist discourses that dismiss the moral and intellectual competence of ordinary citizens \u2013 both will only strengthen the populists.

source of societal morality.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} According to Eatwell, the narodniks \"are often seen as the first populist movement\".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}}\n\n[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|left|thumb|[[Ilya Repin]]'s painting, ''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik.]]\n\nIn German-speaking Europe, the [[v\u00f6lkisch movement]] has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} In France, the [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|Boulangist movement]] also utilised populist rhetoric and themes.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|pp=366\u2013367}} In the early 20th century, adherents of both [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]] flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Among Marxists, the emphasis on [[class struggle]] and the idea that the working classes are affected by [[false consciousness]] are also antithetical to populist ideas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}\n\nIn the years following the [[Second World War]], populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=33\u201334}} However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} These included [[Guglielmo Giannini]]'s [[Common Man's Front]] in 1940s Italy, [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans]] in late 1950s France, [[Hendrik Koekoek]]'s [[Farmers' Party (Netherlands)|Farmers' Party]] of the 1960s Netherlands, and [[Mogens Glistrup]]'s [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]] of 1970s Denmark.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's [[New Left]], including from the [[new social movements]] and from the early [[Green politics|Green parties]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=548|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=66}} However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became \"a relevant political force in Europe\", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=35}} In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of \"the people\" against the \"elite\", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} The Czech [[Civic Forum]] party for instance campaigned on the slogan \"Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} Many populists in this region claimed that a \"real\" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} The collapse of Marxism-Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the [[Dutch Socialist Party]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and German's [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party.{{sfn|March|2007|p=67}} Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ruiz Mateos]], [[Jes\u00fas Gil]] and [[Mario Conde]], businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the ballots at the national level.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ultrapatriotas.

For example, in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the 2001 electoral campaign]], the Conservative Party leader [[William Hague]] accused [[Tony Blair]]'s governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of representing \"the condescending liberal elite\". Hague repeatedly referring to it as \"metropolitan\", implying that it was out of touch with \"the people\", who in Conservative discourse are represented by \"Middle England\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail [[fox hunting]] on [[animal welfare]] grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.{{sfn|Bang|Marsh|2018|p=354}}\n\nBy the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The term came to be used in reference both to [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] groups like J\u00f6rg Haider's FP\u00d6 in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] or [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s LPF in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the [[Syriza]] party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}}\n\n=== North America ===\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|header=|header_align=left/right/center|header_background=|footer=The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties, respectively|footer_align=left/right/center|footer_background=|width=|image1=Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|width1=250|caption1=|image2=Bernie Sanders by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=250|caption2=}}\n\nIn North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=22}} During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States. In this instance, populism was combined with [[agrarianism]] and often known as \"prairie populism\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} For these groups, \"the people\" were yeomen\u2014small, independent farmers \u2014while the \"elite\" were the bankers and politicians of the northeast.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} In some cases, populist activists called for alliances with labor (the first national platform of the National People's Party in 1892 calling for protecting the rights of \"urban workmen\".{{sfn|Tindall|1966|p=90}} In the state of Georgia in the early 1890s, Tom Watson (later the Populist candidate for Vice-President) led a major effort to unite white and African-American farmers.{{sfn|Tindall|1966|p=118}}{{sfn|Woodward|1938}}\n\nThe [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] of the late 19th century United States is considered to be \"one of the defining populist movements\";{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} its members were often referred to as the Populists at the time.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=23}} Its radical platform included calling for the nationalisation of railways, the banning of strikebreakers, and the introduction of referenda.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=17}} The party gained representation in several state legislatures during the 1890s, but was not powerful enough to mount a successful presidential challenge.

===\n{{Main|Populism in Latin America}}\n[[File:2019 Encontro Bilateral com o Presidente dos EUA.jpg|thumb|Brazilian President [[Jair Bolsonaro]], sometimes called a \"Tropical Trump\", with U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]]]\nPopulism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s,{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}} being far more prevalent here than in Europe.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world's \"most enduring and prevalent populist tradition\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=27}} They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=27\u201328}} March instead thought that it was the important role of \"catch-all parties and prominent personalities\" in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}}\n\nThe first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=28}} In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising \"the people\": these included [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] in Argentina, and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] in Ecuador.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=de la

powers.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} The second wave took place in the early 1990s;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} de la Torre called it \"neoliberal populism\".{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=198}} In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Examples include [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in Brazil, and [[Alberto Fujimori]] in Peru.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the [[International

century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} It overlapped in part with the [[pink tide]] of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Prominent examples included Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=71|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=31|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199}} These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty \"back to the people\", in particular through the formation of [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]] that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=32|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=200}} In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=201}}\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\nDuring the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=38}}\n\nIn New Zealand, [[Robert Muldoon]], the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|31st Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Feisty, Protectionist Populism?

These have included Kenya's [[Raila Odinga]], Senegal's [[Abdoulaye Wade]], South Africa's [[Julius Malema]], and Zambia's [[Michael Sata]].{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=106}} These populists have arisen in democratic rather than authoritarian states, and have arisen amid dissatisfaction with democratisation, socio-economic grievances, and frustration at the inability of opposition groups to oust incumbent parties.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n===Asia and the Arab world===\n\n[[File:President Rodrigo Roa Duterte poses for a photo with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prior to the start of the bilateral meeting at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] of [[Philippines]] and [[Narendra Modi]] of [[India]], they are both considered populist leaders]]\n\nIn North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region's politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel's [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and Turkey's [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=39\u201340}} Although the [[Arab Spring]] was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=40}}\n\nIn southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of [[Joseph Estrada]] in the Philippines, [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in South Korea, [[Chen Shui-bian]] in Taiwan, and [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=38\u201339}}\nIn India, the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=484}} Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=485}}\n\n===Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth===\nIn the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the \"New Populism\".{{sfn|Canovan|2004|p=242}} The UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on European Union membership]] and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public.{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=260}} By 2016, \"populism\" was regularly used by political commentators.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=1}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The rise of populism in Western Europe is, in large part, a reaction to the failure of traditional parties to respond adequately in the eyes of the electorate to a series of phenomena such as [[economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalisation]], the speed and direction of [[European integration]], immigration, the decline of ideologies and class politics, exposure of elite corruption, etc. It is also the product of a much-cited, but rarely defined, \"political malaise\", manifested in steadily falling [[voter turnout]] across Western Europe, declining [[political party]] membership, and ever-greater numbers of citizens in surveys citing a lack of interest and distrust in politics and politicians.|source=Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2008{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=1}} }}\n\nMudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} Since the late 1960s, the emergence of [[television]] had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=553|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=103\u2013104}} At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the \"[[high culture]]\" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in [[reality television]] shows such as ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}}\n\nMudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=554}} In Mudde's words, \"More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better.\"{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nAnother factor is that in the post-[[Cold War]] period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=555}} There is also the impact of [[globalisation]], which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=555\u201356}} Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for [[charismatic authority|charismatic leadership]] to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nPeter Wilkins argued that \"The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements.\"<ref>Wilkins, Peter (2018) [http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/855 \"Rip It Up and Start Again: The Challenge of Populism in the 21st Century\"] in ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]''. v.24, no.22, p.317</ref> In [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2818659 Trump, Brexit and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash] Pippa Norris and Ronald F. Inglehart examine two theories on the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in [[post-industrial economy|post-industrial economies]]. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China's membership of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking stronger authoritarian populist leaders such as [[Donald Trump]] and [[Nigel Farage]].  The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.{{sfn|Inglehart|Norris|2016|p=1-2|pp=29-30|loc=Bibliography}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Black populism]]\n* [[Communitarianism]]\n* [[List of populists]]\n* [[Ochlocracy]] (mob rule)\n* [[Paternalism]]\n* [[Penal populism]]\n* [[Politainment]]\n* [[Poporanism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n: {{cite chapter|last=Abi-Hassan|first=Sahar|chapter=Populism and Gender|year=2017|title=The Oxford Handbook of Populism|editors=Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser, Paul Taggart, Paulina Ochoa Espejo, and Pierre Ostiguy|location=Oxford and New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=426\u2013445|isbn=9780198803560|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Populism and Democracy: Challenge or Pathology?|url=|journal=Acta Politica|year=2003|volume=38|issue=2|pages=147\u2013159|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500021|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Friend or Foe?

The term developed in the 19th century and has been applied to various politicians, parties, and movements since that time, although has rarely been chosen as a self-description. Within [[political science]] and other [[social science]]s, several different definitions of populism have been employed, with some scholars proposing that the term be rejected altogether.\n\nA common framework for interpreting populism is known as the [[Ideation (creative process)|ideational]] approach: this defines ''populism'' as an [[ideology]] which presents \"the people\" as a morally good force and contrasts them against \"the elite\", who are portrayed as corrupt and self-serving. Populists differ in how \"the people\" are defined, but it can be based along class, ethnic, or national lines. Populists typically present \"the elite\" as comprising the political, economic, cultural, and media establishment, depicted as a homogeneous entity and accused of placing their own interests, and often the interests of other groups\u2014such as large corporations, foreign countries, or immigrants\u2014above the interests of \"the people\". Populist parties and social movements are often led by charismatic or dominant figures who present themselves as the \"voice of the people\". According to the ideational approach, populism is often combined with other ideologies, such as [[nationalism]], [[liberalism]], or [[socialism]]. Thus, populists can be found at different locations along the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]], and there exist both [[left-wing populism]] and [[right-wing populism]].\n\nOther scholars of the social sciences have defined the term ''populism'' differently. According to the popular agency definition used by some historians of United States history, ''populism'' refers to popular engagement of the population in political decision making. An approach associated with the political scientist [[Ernesto Laclau]] presents populism as an emancipatory social force through which marginalised groups challenge dominant [[Power (social and political)|power structures]]. Some [[economics|economists]] have used the term in reference to governments which engage in substantial public spending financed by foreign loans, resulting in [[hyperinflation]] and emergency measures. In popular discourse\u2014where the term has often been used pejoratively\u2014it has sometimes been used synonymously with [[demagogue|demagogy]], to describe politicians who present overly simplistic answers to complex questions in a highly emotional manner, or with [[political opportunism|opportunism]], to characterise politicians who seek to please voters without rational consideration as to the best course of action.\n\nThe term ''populism'' came into use in the late 19th century alongside the promotion of [[democracy]]. In the United States, it was closely associated with the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]], while in the [[Russian Empire]] it was linked to the [[agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Narodniks|Narodnik]] movement. In the 1960s the term became increasingly popular among [[social science|social scientists]] in Western countries, and later in the 20th century it was applied to various political parties active in [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]]. In the 21st century, the term became increasingly common in political discourse, particularly in the Americas and Europe, to describe a range of left-wing, right-wing, and centrist groups that challenged the established parties. When in office in liberal democracies, populists have often been responsible for [[democratic backsliding]] \u2013 also called \"democratic erosion\" or \"de-democratisation\" \u2013 as they undermine independent institutions like the media or judiciary which they consider hostile to the \"will of the people\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201393; 95\u201396}}<ref>{{Cite

the political scientist Paul Taggart has said of populism that it is \"one of the most widely used but poorly understood political concepts of our time\".{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=162}}\n\nThe term originated as a form of self-designation, being used by members of the [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]] active in the United States during the late 19th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=5|3a1=Akkerman|3y=2003|3p=148}} In the [[Russian Empire]] during the same period, a group referred to itself as the ''[[narodniki]]'', which has often been translated into English as ''populists''.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2pp=5\u20136}} The Russian and American movements differed in various respects, and the fact that they shared a name was coincidental.{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=372|2a1=Canovan|2y=1981|2p=14}} In the 1920s, the term entered the [[French language]], where it was used to describe a group of writers expressing sympathy for ordinary people.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} Following 2016, the year which saw the election of [[Donald Trump]] as president of the United States and [[2016

|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=30 November 2017 |accessdate=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the term began as a self-designation, part of the confusion surrounding it stems from the fact that it has rarely been used in this way, with few political figures openly describing themselves as \"populists\".{{sfnm|1a1=Albertazzi|1a2=McDonnell|1y=2008|1p=3|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=2}} As noted by the political scientist [[Margaret Canovan]], \"there has been no self-conscious international populist movement which might have attempted to control or limit the term's reference, and as a result those who have used it have been able to attach it a wide variety of meanings.\"{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} In this it differs from other political terms, like \"[[socialism]]\" or \"[[conservatism]]\", which have been widely used as self-designations by individuals who have then presented their own, internal definitions of the

\"[[Far-right politics|far right]]\", or \"[[Extremism|extremist]]\", which are often used in political discourse but rarely as self-designations.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}}\n \nIn popular discourse, the term \"populism\" has often been conflated with other concepts like [[demagoguery]],{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=101|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=1}} and generally presented as something to be \"feared and discredited\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} It has often been applied to movements that are considered to be outside the political mainstream or a threat to [[democracy]].{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2p=260}} The political scientists Yves M\u00e9ny and Yves Surel noted that \"populism\" had become \"a catchword, particularly in the media, to designate the newborn political or social movements which challenge the entrenched values, rules and institutions of democratic orthodoxy.\"{{sfn|M\u00e9ny|Surel|2002|p=3}} Typically, the term is usually used against others, often in a pejorative sense to discredit opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=243|2a1=Stanley|2y=2008|2p=101|3a1=Albertazzi|3a2=McDonnell|3y=2008|3p=2|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=2}} Some of those who have repeatedly been referred to as \"populists\" in a pejorative sense have subsequently embraced the term while seeking to shed it of negative connotations.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}} The French far-right politician [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] for instance was often accused of populism and eventually responded by stating that \"Populism precisely is taking into account the people's opinion. Have people the right, in a democracy, to hold an opinion? If that is the case, then yes, I am a populist.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=101}}  Similarly, on being founded in 2003, the centre-left [[Labour Party (Lithuania)|Lithuanian Labour Party]] declared: \"we are and will be called populists.\"{{sfn|March|2007|pp=68\u201369}}\n\n===Use in academia===\n\nUntil the 1950s, use of the term ''populism'' remained restricted largely to historians studying the People's Party, but in 1954 the U.S. sociologist [[Edward Shils]] published an article proposing ''populism'' as a term to describe anti-elite trends in U.S. society more broadly.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|pp=372\u2013373}} Following on from Shils' article, during the 1960s the term \"populism\" became increasingly popular among [[sociology|sociologists]] and other academics in the [[social sciences]].{{sfnm|1a1=Allcock|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In 1967 a Conference on Populism was held at the [[London School of Economics]], the participants of which failed to agree on a clear, single definition.{{sfn|Allcock|1971|p=378}} As a result of this scholarly interest, an academic field known as \"populism studies\" emerged.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Interest in the subject grew rapidly: between 1950 and 1960 about 160 publications on populism appeared, while between 1990 and 2000 that number was over 1500.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=3}} Taggart argued that this academic interest was not consistent but appeared in \"bursts\" of research that reflected the political conditions of the time.{{sfn|Taggart|2002|p=63}}\n\n[[File:Cas Mudde in 2018 05.jpg|thumb|left|The Dutch political scientist Cas Mudde has been among those arguing that political scientists should use the term ''populism'' despite its problems]]\n\nCanovan noted that \"if the notion of ''populism'' did not exist, no social scientist would deliberately invent it; the term is far too ambiguous for that\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=301}} From examining how the term \"populism\" had been used, she proposed that seven different types of populism could be discerned. Three of these were forms of \"agrarian populism\"; these included farmers' radicalism, peasant movements, and intellectual agrarian socialism. The other four were forms of \"political populism\", representing populist dictatorship, populist democracy, reactionary populism, and politicians' populism.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=13|2a1=Canovan|2y=1982|2pp=550\u2013551}} She noted that these were \"analytical constructs\" and that \"real-life examples may well overlap several categories\",{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=13}} adding that no single political movement fitted into all seven categories.{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=289}} In this way, Canovan conceived of populism as a family of related concepts rather than as a single concept in itself.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=6}}\n\nThe confusion surrounding the term has led some scholars to suggest that it should be abandoned by scholarship.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=5|2a1=Albertazzi|2a2=McDonnell|2y=2008|2p=3|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=5}} In contrast to this view, the political scientists [[Cas Mudde]] and Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser stated that \"while the frustration is understandable, the term ''populism'' is too central to debates about politics from Europe to the Americas to simply do away with.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} Similarly, Canovan noted that the term \"does have comparatively clear and definite meanings in a number of specialist areas\" and that it \"provides a pointer, however shaky, to an interesting and largely unexplored area of political and social experience\".{{sfn|Canovan|1981|p=6}} The political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell thought that \"if carefully defined, the term 'populism' can be used profitably to help us understand and explain a wide array of political actors\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} The political scientist Ben Stanley noted that \"although the meaning of the term has proven controversial in the literature, the persistence with which it has recurred suggests the existence at least of an ineliminable core: that is, that it refers to a distinct pattern of ideas.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=100}}\n\nAlthough academic definitions of ''populism'' have differed, most of them have focused on the idea that it should reference some form of relationship between \"the people\" and \"the elite\",{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=543}} and that it entailed taking an anti-establishment stance.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=2}} Beyond that, different scholars have emphasised different features that they wish to use to define populism.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=3}} These differences have occurred both within specific scholarly disciplines and among different disciplines,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=149}} varying for instance among scholars focusing on different regions and

populism should be defined according to specific ideas which underlie it, as opposed to certain economic policies or leadership styles which populist politicians may display.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=150|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=2}} In this definition, the term ''populism'' is applied to political groups and individuals who make appeals to \"the people\" and then contrast this group against \"the elite\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=6|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=487}} \n\nAdopting this approach, Albertazzi and McDonnell define populism as an ideology that \"pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous 'others' who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=3}} Similarly, the political scientist Carlos de la Torre defined populism as \"a Manichean discourse that divides politics and society as the struggle between two irreconcilable and antagonistic camps: the people and the oligarchy or the power block.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}}\n\nIn this understanding, note Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"populism always involves a critique of the establishment and an adulation of the common people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} and according to Ben Stanley, populism itself is a product of \"an antagonistic relationship\" between \"the people\" and \"the elite\", and is \"latent wherever the possibility occurs for the emergence of such a dichotomy\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=96}} The political scientist Manuel Anselmi proposed that populism be defined as featuring a \"homogenous community-people\" which \"perceives itself as the absolute holder of popular sovereignty\" and \"expresses an anti-establishment attitude.\"{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=8}} This understanding conceives of populism as a [[discourse]], [[ideology]], or [[worldview]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}} These definitions were initially employed largely in Western Europe, although later became increasingly popular in Eastern Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=5}}\n\nAccording to this approach, populism is viewed as a \"thin ideology\" or \"thin-centred ideology\" which on its own is seen as too insubstantial to provide a blueprint for societal change. It thus differs from the \"thick-centred\" or \"full\" ideologies such as [[fascism]], [[liberalism]], and socialism, which provide more far-reaching ideas about social transformation. As a thin-centred ideology, populism is therefore attached to a thick-ideology by populist politicians.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=64|3a1=Stanley|3y=2008|3pp=95, 99\u2013100, 106|4a1=Mudde|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2017|4p=6|5a1=Hawkins|5a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|5y=2019|5pp=4\u20135}} Thus, populism can be found merged with forms of [[nationalism]], liberalism, socialism, [[federalism]], or conservatism.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} According to Stanley, \"the thinness of populism ensures that in practice it is a complementary ideology: it does not so much overlap with as diffuse itself throughout full ideologies.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}\n\nPopulism is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"a kind of mental map through which individuals analyse and comprehend political reality\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}}\nMudde noted that populism is \"moralistic rather than programmatic\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} It encourages a binary world-view in which everyone is divided into \"friends and foes\", with the latter being regarded not just as people who have \"different priorities and values\" but as being fundamentally \"evil\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}} In emphasising one's purity against the corruption and immorality of \"the elite\", from which \"the people\" must remain pure and untouched, populism prevents compromise between different groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=544}}\n\n===Right and left-wing===\n\nAs a result of the various different ideologies which populism can be paired with, the forms that populism can take vary widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=6|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=4}} Populism itself cannot be positioned on the [[left\u2013right political spectrum]],{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=1981|1p=294|2a1=Brett|2y=2013|2p=410|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=8}} and both right and left-wing populisms exist.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=65|2a1=Abi-Hassan|2y=2017|2p=428|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Populist movements can also confound obvious divisions between left and right, for instance by combining xenophobic attitudes commonly associated with the right with redistributive economic policies closer to those of the left.{{sfnm|1a1=Gagnon|1a2=Beausoleil|1a3=Son|1a4=Arguelles|1y=2018|1p=vi}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=[Populism's] core consists of four distinct but interrelated concepts:\n* The existence of two homogeneous units of analysis: 'the people' and 'the elite'.\n* The antagonistic relationship between the people and the elite.\n* The idea of popular sovereignty.\n* The positive valorisation of 'the people' and denigration of 'the elite'.|source=The ideational definition of populism used by Ben Stanley{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} }}\n\nThe ideologies which populism can be paired with can be contradictory, resulting in different forms of populism that can oppose each other.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=6}} For instance, in Latin America during the 1990s, populism was often associated with politicians like Peru's [[Alberto Fujimori]] who promoted [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economics, while in the 2000s it was instead associated with those like Venezuela's [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] who promoted socialist programmes.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=8\u20139}} As well as populists of the left and right, populist figures like Italy's [[Beppe Grillo]] have been characterised as [[Centrism|centrist]] and [[Liberalism|liberals]],{{sfn|Brett|2013|pp=410\u2013411}} while groups like Turkey's [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] have been described as combining populism with [[Islamism]],{{sfn|Park|2018|p=170}} and India's [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] has been seen as mixing populism with [[Hindu nationalism]].{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=495}} Although populists of different ideological traditions can oppose each other, they can also form coalitions, as was seen in the Greek coalition government which brought together the left-wing populist [[Syriza]] and the right-wing populist [[Independent Greeks]] in 2015.{{sfn|Aslanidis|Rovira Kaltwasser|2016|p=1078}}\n\nAdherents of the ideational definition have also drawn a distinction between left and right-wing populists. The latter are presented as juxtaposing \"the people\" against both \"the elite\" and an additional group who are also regarded as being separate from \"the people\" and whom \"the elite\" is seen to favour, such as immigrants, homosexuals, travellers, or communists.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|pp=487\u2013488}}\nPopulist leaders thus \"come in many different shades and sizes\" but, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, share one common element: \"a carefully crafted image of the vox populi\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=20}} Stanley expressed the view that although there are \"certain family resemblances\" that can be seen between populist groups and individuals, there was \"no coherent tradition\" unifying all of them.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=107}}\nWhile many left-wing parties in the early 20th century presented themselves as the [[vanguard of the proletariat]], by the early 21st century left-wing populists were presenting themselves as the \"voice of the people\" more widely.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=549\u201350|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=67}} On the political right, populism is often combined with nationalism, with \"the people\" and \"the nation\" becoming fairly interchangeable categories in their discourse.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}}\nSome political scientists have also argued that populism can be divided into \"inclusionary\" and \"exclusionary\" forms.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=147}}\n\n===\"The People\"===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Populists (claim to) speak in the name of the 'oppressed people', and they want to emancipate them by making them aware of their oppression.

In such cases\u2014like Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela and [[Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar]] in Slovakia\u2014populists retain their anti-establishment rhetoric by making changes to their concept of \"the elite\" to suit their new circumstances, alleging that real power is not held by the government but other powerful forces who continue to undermine the populist government and the will of \"the people\" itself.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=12}} In these instances, populist governments often conceptualise \"the elite\" as those holding [[economic power]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In Venezuela, for example, Ch\u00e1vez blamed the economic elite for frustrating his reforms, while in Greece, the left-wing populist Prime Minister [[Alexis Tsipras]] accused \"the lobbyists and oligarchs of Greece\" of undermining his administration.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In populist instances like these, the claims made have some basis in reality, as business interests seek to undermine leftist-oriented economic reform.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}}\n\n[[File:Evo Morales 2017.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The Bolivian government of left-wing populist [[Evo Morales]] and his [[Movement for Socialism (Bolivia)|Movement for Socialism]] has been described as the \"prototypical case\" of ethnopopulism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}} ]]\n\nAlthough left-wing populists who combine populist ideas with forms of socialism most commonly present \"the elite\" in economic terms, the same strategy is also employed by some right-wing populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In the United States during the late 2000s, the [[Tea Party movement]]\u2014which presented itself as a defender of the capitalist [[free market]]\u2014argued that big business, and its allies in [[United States Congress|Congress]], seeks to undermine the free market and kill competition by stifling small business.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} Among some 21st century right-wing populists, \"the elite\" are presented as being political [[Progressivism|progressives]] committed to [[political correctness]].{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=561}} The Dutch right-wing populist leader [[Pim Fortuyn]] referred to this as the \"Church of the Left\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=561}}\n\nIn some instances, particularly in Latin America and Africa, \"the elites\" are conceived not just in economic but also in ethnic terms, representing what political scientists have termed [[ethnopopulism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=14, 72|2a1=Resnick|2y=2017|2p=114|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=207}} In Bolivia, for example, the left-wing populist leader [[Evo Morales]] juxtaposed the [[mestizo]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Bolivia|indigenous]] \"people\" against an overwhelmingly [[White Bolivians|European]] \"elite\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} declaring that \"We Indians [i.e. indigenous people] are Latin America's moral reserve\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}} In the Bolivian case, this was not accompanied by a racially exclusionary approach, but with an attempt to build a pan-ethnic coalition which included European Bolivians against the largely European Bolivian elite.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=72\u201373}} In South Africa, the populist [[Julius Malema]] has presented black South Africans as the \"people\" whom he claims to represent, calling for the expropriation of land owned by the white minority without compensation.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=112\u2013113}} In areas like Europe where nation-states are more ethnically homogenous, this ethnopopulist approach is rare given that the \"people\" and \"elite\" are typically of the same ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=72}}\n\nIn various instances, populists claim that \"the elite\" is working against the interests of the country.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} In the [[European Union]] (EU), for instance, various populist groups allege that their national political elites put the interests of the EU itself over those of their own nation-states.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=13}} Similarly, in Latin America populists often charge political elites with championing the interests of the United States over those of their own countries.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nAnother common tactic among populists, particularly in Europe, is the accusation that \"the elites\" place the interests of immigrants above those of the native population.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} Such approaches are also found elsewhere; the Zambian populist [[Michael Sata]] for instance adopted a xenophobic stance during his campaigns by focusing his criticism on the country's Asian minority, decrying Chinese and Indian ownership of businesses and mines.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=112}} In India, the right-wing populist leader [[Narendra Modi]] rallied supporters against Muslim Bangladeshi migrants, promising to deport them.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=486}} In instances where populists are also [[antisemitic]] (such as [[Jobbik]] in Hungary and [[Attack (political party)|Attack]] in Bulgaria) the elites are accused of favouring Israeli and wider Jewish interests above those of the national group.  Antisemitic populists often accuse \"the elite\" of being made up of many Jews as well.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=14}} When populists emphasise ethnicity as part of their discourse, \"the elite\" can sometimes be presented as \"ethnic traitors\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}\n\n===General will===\n\nA third component of the ideational approach to populism is the idea of the general will, or ''volont\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale''.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=16}} An example of this populist understanding of the general will can be seen in Ch\u00e1vez's 2007 inaugural address, when he stated that \"All individuals are subject to error and seduction, but not the people, which possesses to an eminent degree of consciousness of its own good and the measure of its independence. Because of that its judgement is pure, its will is strong, and none can corrupt or even threaten it.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=16\u201317}} For populists, the general will of \"the people\" is something that should take precedence over the preferences of \"the elite\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}\n\nAs noted by Stanley, the populist idea of the general will is connected to ideas of majoritarianism and authenticity.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}} Highlighting how populists appeal to the ideals of \"authenticity and ordinariness\", he noted that what was most important to populists was \"to appeal to the ''idea'' of an authentic people\" and to cultivate the idea that they are the \"genuine\" representatives of \"the people\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}} In doing so they often emphasise their physical proximity to \"the people\" and their distance from \"the elites\".{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=105}}\n\nIn emphasising the general will, many populists share the critique of representative democratic government previously espoused by the French philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=151|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=16\u201317}} This approach regards representative governance as an aristocratic and elitist system in which a country's citizens are regarded as passive entities. Rather than choosing laws for themselves, these citizens are only mobilised for elections in which their only option is to select their representatives rather than taking a more direct role in legislation and governance.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} Populists often favour the use of [[direct democracy|direct democratic]] measures such as [[referenda]] and [[plebiscites]].{{sfnm|1a1=Stanley|1y=2008|1p=104|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=17}} For this reason, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"it can be argued that an elective affinity exists between populism and direct democracy\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=17}} although Stanley cautioned that \"support for direct democracy is not an essential attribute of populism.\"{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=104}}\nPopulist notions of the \"general will\" and its links with populist leaders are usually based on the idea of \"[[common sense]]\".{{sfnm|1a1=Akkerman|1y=2003|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=18}}\n\n===Versus elitism and pluralism===\n\n[[File:9.12 tea party in DC.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters from the [[Tea Party movement]], a right-wing populist formation in the [[United States]]]]\n\nStanley noted that rather than being restricted purely to populists, appeals to \"the people\" had become \"an unavoidable aspect of modern political practice\", with elections and referenda predicated on the notion that \"the people\" decide the outcome.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=102}} Thus, a critique of the ideational definition of populism is that it becomes too broad and can potentially apply to all political actors and movements. Responding to this critique, Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that the ideational definition did allow for a \"non-populism\" in the form of both [[elitism]] and [[pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=543|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7}}\n\nElitists share the populist binary division but reverse the associations. Whereas populists regard the elites as bad and the common people as good, elitists view \"the people\" as being vulgar, immoral, and dangerous and \"the elites\" as being morally, culturally, and intellectually superior.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1pp=543\u201344|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2013|2p=152|3a1=Mudde|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2017|3p=7|4a1=Hawkins|4a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|4y=2019|4p=4}} Elitists want politics to be largely or entirely an elite affair; some\u2014such as Spain's [[Francisco Franco]] and Chile's [[Augusto Pinochet]]\u2014reject democracy altogether, while others\u2014like Spain's [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]] and Austria's [[Joseph Schumpeter]]\u2014support a limited model of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=7}}\n\nPluralism differs from both elitism and populism by rejecting any dualist framework, instead viewing society as a broad array of overlapping social groups, each with their own ideas and interests.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=544|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=7|3a1=Hawkins|3a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|3y=2019|3p=4}} Pluralists argue that political power should not be held by any single group\u2014whether defined by their gender, ethnicity, economic status, or political party membership\u2014and should instead be distributed. Pluralists encourage governance through compromise and consensus in order to reflect the interests of as many of these groups as possible.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2013|1p=152|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=7\u20138}} Unlike populists, pluralists do not believe that such a thing as a \"general will\" exists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2013|p=152}} Some politicians do not seek to demonise a social elite; for many conservatives for example, the social elite are regarded as the bulwark of the traditional social order, while for some liberals, the social elite are perceived as an enlightened legislative and administrative cadre.{{sfn|Stanley|2008|p=103}}\n\n==Other definitions==\n\nThe popular agency definition to populism uses the term in reference to a democratic way of life that is built on the popular engagement of the population in political activity. In this understanding, populism is usually perceived as a positive factor in the mobilisation of the populace to develop a communitarian form of democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}} This approach to the term is common among historians in the United States and those who have studied the late 19th century [[People's Party (United States)|People's Party]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=3}}\n\n[[File:Presentaci\u00f3n del Documental CATASTROIKA y Presentaci\u00f3n de la Revista Debates y Combates (7215329954).jpg|thumb|left|The Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]] developed his own definition of populism.

in Latin America, for example, many countries passed unpopular economic reforms under pressure from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] while in Europe, many [[Member state of the European Union|countries in the European Union]] were pushed to implement unpopular economic [[austerity]] measures by the union's authorities.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n===Leaders===\nPopulism is often associated with charismatic and dominant leaders,{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=268}} and the populist leader is, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"the quintessential form of populist mobilisation\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} These individuals campaign and attract support on the basis of their own personal appeal.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Their supporters then develop a perceived personal connection with the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} For these leaders, populist rhetoric allows them to claim that they have a direct relationship with \"the people\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=44}} and in many cases they claim to be a personification of \"the people\" themselves,{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=43|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=197}} presenting themselves as the ''vox populi'' or \"voice of the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=62|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=204}} Chavez for instance stated: \"I demand absolute loyalty to me. I am not an individual, I am the people.\"{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=202}} Populist leaders can also present themselves as the saviour of the people because of their perceived unique talents and vision, and in doing so can claim to be making personal sacrifices for the good of the people.{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Because loyalty to the populist leader is thus seen as representing loyalty to the people, those who oppose the leader can be branded \"enemies of the people\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=7}}\n\nThe overwhelming majority of populist leaders have been men,{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} although there have been various females occupying this role.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=69}} Most of these female populist leaders gained positions of seniority through their connections to previously dominant men; [[Eva Per\u00f3n]] was the wife of [[Juan Per\u00f3n]], [[Marine Le Pen]] the daughter of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]], [[Keiko Fujimori]] the daughter of [[Alberto Fujimori]], and [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] the sister of [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n====Rhetorical styles====\n\n{{Multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Sarah Palin by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Silvio Berlusconi (2010) cropped.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Populist leaders often play on gendered stereotypes.

Australia is my home and the Australian people are my children.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=70}}\n\nPopulist leaders typically portray themselves as outsiders who are separate from the \"elite\". Female populist leaders sometimes reference their gender as setting them apart from the dominant \"old boys' club\",{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=69\u201370}} while in Latin America a number of populists, such as Evo Morales and Alberto Fujimori, emphasised their non-white ethnic background to set them apart from the white-dominated elite.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=72\u201373|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Other populists have used clothing to set them apart.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In South Africa, the populist [[Julius Malema]] and members of his [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] attended parliament dressed as miners and workers to distinguish themselves from the other politicians wearing suits.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=110}} In instances where wealthy business figures promote populist sentiments, such as [[Ross Perot]], Thaksin Shinawatra, or Berlusconi, it can be difficult to present themselves as being outside the elite, however this is achieved by portraying themselves as being apart from the political, if not the economic elite, and portraying themselves as reluctant politicians.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=70\u201371}}\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that \"in reality, most populist leaders are very much part of the national elite\", typically being highly educated, upper-middle class, middle-aged males from the majority ethnicity.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that \"true outsiders\" to the political system are rare, although cited instances like Venezuela's Ch\u00e1vez and Peru's Fujimori.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=74\u201375}} More common is that they are \"insider-outsiders\", strongly connected to the inner circles of government but not having ever been part of it.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=75}} The Dutch right-wing populist [[Geert Wilders]] had for example been a prominent back-bench MP for many years before launching his populist [[Party for Freedom]],{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}} while in South Africa, Malema had been leader of the governing [[African National Congress]] (ANC) youth league until he was expelled, at which he launched his own populist movement.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=111}} Only a few populist leaders are \"insiders\", individuals who have held leading roles in government prior to portraying themselves as populists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75\u201376}} One example is Thaksin Shinawatra, who was twice deputy prime minister of Thailand before launching his own populist political party;{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=75\u201376}} another is [[Rafael Correa]], who served as the Ecuadorean finance minister before launching a left-wing populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=74}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = RETRATO FOTOGR\u00c1FICO DE PER\u00d3N.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = Pim Fortuyn - May 4.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | footer = Some populist leaders give their name to wider populist political movements;

these include Italy's Berlusconi, Slovakia's Me\u010diar, and Thailand's [[Thaksin Shinawatra]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}\nPopulism and strongmen are not intrinsically connected, however; as stressed by Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, \"only a minority of strongmen are populists and only a minority of populists is a strongman\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}} Rather than being populists, many strongmen\u2014such as Spain's Francisco Franco\u2014were elitists who led authoritarian administrations.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=63}}\n\nIn most cases, these populist leaders built a political organisation around themselves, typically a political party, although in many instances these remain dominated by the leader.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=43\u201344}} These individuals often give a populist movement its political identity, as is seen with movements like [[Fortuynism]] in the Netherlands, [[Peronism]] in Argentina, [[Berlusconism]] in Italy and [[Chavismo]] in Venezuela.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=43}} Populist mobilisation is not however always linked to a charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=42}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that populist personalist leadership was more common in countries with a presidential system rather than a parliamentary one because these allow for the election of a single individual to the role of head of government without the need for an accompanying party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}} Examples where a populist leader has been elected to the presidency without an accompanying political party have included Peron in Argentina, Fujimori in Peru, and Correa in Ecuador.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=58}}\n\n===Political parties===\n\n[[File:Acto de Posesion del Gobernador Arias Cardenas.jpg|thumb|right|A 2012 rally by members of the left-wing populist United Socialist Party of Venezuela in [[Maracaibo]]]]\n\nA second form of mobilisation is through the form of the populist political party.\nPopulists are not generally opposed to political representation, but merely want their own representatives, those of \"the people\", in power.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} In various cases, non-populist political parties have transitioned into populist ones;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54\u201355|2a1=Hawkins|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2019|2p=10}} the elitist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], a Marxist-Leninist group which governed [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]], later transitioned after German re-unification into a populist party, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=54\u201355}} In other instances, such as the Austrian FP\u00d6 and Swiss SVP, a non-populist party can have a populist faction which later takes control of the whole party.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=55}}\n\nIn some examples where a political party has been dominated by a single charismatic leader, the latter's death has served to unite and strengthen the party, as with Argentina's [[Justicialist Party]] after Juan Per\u00f3n's death in 1974, or the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] after Ch\u00e1vez's death in 2013.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In other cases, a populist party has seen one strong centralising leader replace another, as when [[Marine Le Pen]] replaced her father Jean-Marie as the leader of the National Front in 2011, or when [[Heinz-Christian Strache]] took over from Haider as chair of the Freedom Party of Austria in 2005.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nMany populist parties achieve an electoral breakthrough but then fail to gain electoral persistence, with their success fading away at subsequent elections.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} In various cases, they are able to secure regional strongholds of support but with little support elsewhere in the country; the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6) for instance gained national representation in the Austrian parliament solely because of its strong support in [[Carinthia]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}} Similarly, the Belgian [[Vlaams Belang]] party has its stronghold in [[Antwerp]], while the [[Swiss People's Party]] has its stronghold in [[Zurich]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=60}}\n\n[[Tabloid journalism|Tabloid]]s are often stereotyped as presenting a platform for populist politics due to their tendency toward melodrama, infotainment, and conflict, and thus provide support for populist parties.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Examples of this have been the support given by ''Kronen Zeitung'' to the Austrian Freedom Party and the Berlusconi-owned presses' support for Italy's [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]] in the mid-1990s.{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=932}} Based on his analysis of Dutch and British media, Tjitske Akkerman however argued that tabloids were no more prone to populism than the [[quality press]].{{sfn|Akkerman|2011|p=942}} In the 21st century, populist parties have increasingly used [[social media]] to bypass the mainstream media and directly approach their target audiences.{{sfn|Stier|Posch|Bleier|Strohmaier|2017|p=1365}}\n\n===Social movements===\n\n[[File:Madrid - Acampada Sol 2011 43.JPG|\"Hear the wrath of the people,\" a member of the Indignados, a Spanish left-wing populist movement, in [[Puerta del Sol]]|thumb|right|170px]]\n\nAn additional form is that of the populist social movement.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=10}} Populist social movements are comparatively rare, as most [[social movement]]s focus on a more restricted social identity or issue rather than identifying with \"the people\" more broadly.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=51}} However, after the Great Recession of 2007 a number of populist social movements emerged, expressing public frustrations with national and international economic systems. These included the [[Occupy movement]], which originated in the US and used the slogan \"We are the 99%\", and the Spanish [[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|Indignados movement]], which employed the motto: \"real democracy now \u2013 we are not goods in the hands of politicians and bankers\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=48}}\n\nFew populist social movements survive for more than a few years, with most examples, like the Occupy movement, petering out after their initial growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} In some cases, the social movement fades away as a strong leader emerges from within it and moves into electoral politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} An example of this can be seen with the [[India Against Corruption]] social movement, from which emerged [[Arvind Kejriwal]], who founded the [[Aam Aadmi Party]] (\"Common Man Party\").{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=56}} Another is the Spanish Indignados movement which appeared in 2011 before spawning the [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] party led by [[Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=56\u201357|2a1=Tormey|2y=2018|2pp=266\u201367}} These populist social movements can exert a broader societal impact which results in populist politicians emerging to prominence; the Tea Party and Occupy movements that appeared in the U.S. during the late 2000s and early 2010s have been seen as an influence on the rise of Donald Trump and [[Bernie Sanders]] as prominent figures in the mid-2010s.{{sfn|Hawkins|Rovira Kaltwasser|2019|p=11}}\n\nSome populist leaders have sought to broaden their support by creating supporter groups within the country. Chavez, for instance, ordered the formation of Bolivarian Circles, Communal Councils, Urban Land Committees, and Technical Water Roundtables across Venezuela.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}} These could improve political participation among poorer sectors of Venezuelan society, although also served as networks through which the state transferred resources to those neighbourhoods which produced high rates of support for Chavez government.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=205}}\n\n==Other themes==\n\n===Democracy===\n\nThere have been intense debates about the relationship between populism and democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=79}} Some regard populism as being an intrinsic danger to democracy; others regard it as the only \"true\" form of democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Canovan|1y=2004|1p=244|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=79}} Populists often present themselves as \"true democrats\".{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=4}} Albertazzi and McDonnell stated that populism and democracy were \"inextricably linked\",{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=10}} the political scientist Manuel Anselmi described populism as being \"deeply connected with democracy\",{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=2}} and March suggested that populism represented a \"critique of democracy, not an alternative to it\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser write that \"In a world that is dominated by democracy and liberalism, populism has essentially become an illiberal democratic response to undemocratic liberalism.\"{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}}\n\nPopulism can serve as a democratic corrective by contributing to the mobilisation of social groups who feel excluded from political decision making.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=72|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=83, 84}} It can also raise awareness among the socio-political elites of popular concerns in society, even if it makes the former uncomfortable.{{sfn|March|2007|pp=72\u201373}} When some populists have taken power\u2014most notable Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela\u2014they have enhanced the use of direct democracy through the regular application of referenda.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=93\u201394}} For this reason, some democratic politicians have argued that they need to become more populist: [[Ren\u00e9 Cuperus]] of the [[Dutch Labour Party]] for instance called for [[social democracy]] to become \"more 'populist' in a leftist way\" in order to engage with voters who felt left behind by cultural and technological change.{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\n[[File:Referendum 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been cited as a populist leader who has undermined liberal democracy on taking power{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}}]]\n\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser argued that \"populism is essentially democratic, but at odds with ''liberal'' democracy,\" since populism is based on putting into effect \"the will of the people\". It is therefore majoritarian in nature, and opposed to the safeguarding of minority rights, which is a defining feature of liberal democracy.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=90\u201381}} Populism also undermines the tenets of liberal democracy by rejecting notions of pluralism and the idea that anything, including constitutional limits, should constrain the \"general will\" of \"the people\".{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=73|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=81|3a1=McDonnell|3a2=Cabrera|3y=2019|3p=493}} In this, populist governance can lead to what the liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] described as the \"[[tyranny of the majority]]\".{{sfn|March|2007|p=73}}\n\nPopulists tend to view democratic institutions as alienating,{{sfn|Akkerman|2003|p=56}} and in practice, populists operating in liberal democracies have often criticised the independent institutions designed to protect the fundamental rights of minorities, particularly the judiciary and the media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} Berlusconi for instance criticised the Italian judiciary for defending the rights of communists.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=81}} In countries like Hungary, Ecuador, and Venezuela, populist governments have curtailed the independent media.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=82}} Minorities have often suffered as a result; in Europe in particular, ethnic minorities have had their rights undermined by populism, while in Latin America it is political opposition groups who have been undermined by populist governments.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=84}} In several instances\u2014such as Orban in Hungary\u2014the populist leader has set the country on a path of de-democratisation by changing the constitution to centralise increasing levels of power in the head of government.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=91}} A December 2018 study of 46 populist leaders argued that populists, regardless of their position on the political spectrum, were more likely to damage democratic institutions, erode checks and balances on the executive branch, cause democratic backsliding and attack individual rights than non-populists.<ref>Jordan Kyle, Yascha Mounk, [https://institute.global/insight/renewing-centre/populist-harm-democracy \"The Populist Harm to Democracy: An Empirical Assessment], Institute for Global Change, 26 December 2018, accessed 29 March 2019</ref>\n\nEven when not elected into office, populist parties can have an impact in shaping the national political agenda; in Western Europe, parties like the French National Front and Danish People's Party did not generally get more than 10 or 20% of the national vote, but mainstream parties shifted their own policies to meet the populist challenge.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=98}}\n\n===Mainstream responses===\nMudde and Rovira Kaltwasser suggested that to deflate the appeal of populism, those government figures found guilty of corruption need to be seen to face adequate punishment.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=110}} They also argued that stronger [[rule of law]] and the elimination of systemic corruption were also important facets in preventing populist growth.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=111}} They believed that mainstream politicians wishing to reduce the populist challenge should be more open about the restrictions of their power, noting that those who backed populist movements were often frustrated with the dishonesty of established politicians who \"claim full agency when things go well and almost full lack of agency when things go wrong\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} They also suggested that the appeal of populism could be reduced by wider civic education in the values of liberal democracy and the relevance of pluralism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=112}} What Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser believed was ineffective was a full-frontal attack on the populists which presented \"them\" as \"evil\" or \"foolish\", for this strategy plays into the binary division that populists themselves employ.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=116}} In their view, \"the best way to deal with populism is to engage\u2014as difficult as it is\u2014in an open dialogue with populist actors and supporters\" in order to \"better understand the claims and grievances of the populist elites and masses and to develop liberal democratic responses to them\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=118}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=In trying to win over populist supporters, and perhaps even some elites, liberal democrats should avoid both simplistic solutions that pander to \"the people\" and elitist discourses that dismiss the moral and intellectual competence of ordinary citizens \u2013 both will only strengthen the populists.

It was only with the coming of Boulangism in France and the American People's Party, which was also known as the Populist Party, that the foundational forms of populism can fully be discerned.

Europe ===\n\n{{main|Draft:Populism in Europe}}\n\n====19th and 20th centuries====\n\nIn the Russian Empire during the late 19th century, the ''[[narodnichestvo]]'' movement emerged, championing the cause of the empire's peasantry against the governing elites.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=32}} The movement was unable to secure its objectives, however it inspired other agrarian movements across eastern Europe in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Although the Russian movement was primarily a movement of the middle class and intellectuals \"going to the people\", in some respects their agrarian populism was similar to that of the U.S. People's Party, with both presenting small farmers (the peasantry in Europe) as the foundation of society and main source of societal morality.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} According to Eatwell, the narodniks \"are often seen as the first populist movement\".{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}}\n\n[[File:Arrest of a Propagandist.jpg|250 px|left|thumb|[[Ilya Repin]]'s painting, ''Arrest of a Propagandist'' (1892), which depicts the arrest of a narodnik.]]\n\nIn German-speaking Europe, the [[v\u00f6lkisch movement]] has often been characterised as populist, with its exultation of the German people and its anti-elitist attacks on capitalism and Jews.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|p=366}} In France, the [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|Boulangist movement]] also utilised populist rhetoric and themes.{{sfn|Eatwell|2017|pp=366\u2013367}} In the early 20th century, adherents of both [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]] flirted with populism, but both movements remained ultimately elitist, emphasising the idea of a small elite who should guide and govern society.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}} Among Marxists, the emphasis on [[class struggle]] and the idea that the working classes are affected by [[false consciousness]] are also antithetical to populist ideas.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=33}}\n\nIn the years following the [[Second World War]], populism was largely absent from Europe, in part due to the domination of elitist Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe and a desire to emphasise moderation among many West European political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=33\u201334}} However, over the coming decades, a number of right-wing populist parties emerged throughout the continent.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} These were largely isolated and mostly reflected a conservative agricultural backlash against the centralisation and politicisation of the agricultural sector then occurring.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} These included [[Guglielmo Giannini]]'s [[Common Man's Front]] in 1940s Italy, [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union for the Defense of Tradesmen and Artisans]] in late 1950s France, [[Hendrik Koekoek]]'s [[Farmers' Party (Netherlands)|Farmers' Party]] of the 1960s Netherlands, and [[Mogens Glistrup]]'s [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party]] of 1970s Denmark.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=548}} Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s there also came a concerted populist critique of society from Europe's [[New Left]], including from the [[new social movements]] and from the early [[Green politics|Green parties]].{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=548|2a1=March|2y=2007|2p=66}} However it was only in the late 1990s, according to Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser, that populism became \"a relevant political force in Europe\", one which could have a significant impact on mainstream politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}}\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]] of the early 1990s, there was a rise in populism across much of Central and Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=35}} In the first multiparty elections in many of these countries, various parties portrayed themselves as representatives of \"the people\" against the \"elite\", representing the old governing Marxist-Leninist parties.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} The Czech [[Civic Forum]] party for instance campaigned on the slogan \"Parties are for party members, Civic Forum is for everybody\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=36}} Many populists in this region claimed that a \"real\" revolution had not occurred during the transition from Marxist-Leninist to liberal democratic governance in the early 1990s and that it was they who were campaigning for such a change.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} The collapse of Marxism-Leninism as a central force in socialist politics also led to a broader growth of left-wing populism across Europe, reflected in groups like the [[Dutch Socialist Party]], [[Scottish Socialist Party]], and German's [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] party.{{sfn|March|2007|p=67}} Since the late 1980s, populist experiences emerged in Spain around the figures of [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ruiz Mateos]], [[Jes\u00fas Gil]] and [[Mario Conde]], businessmen who entered politics chiefly to defend their personal economic interests, but by the turn of the millennium their proposals had proved to meet a limited support at the ballots at the national level.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ultrapatriotas.

For example, in [[2001 United Kingdom general election|the 2001 electoral campaign]], the Conservative Party leader [[William Hague]] accused [[Tony Blair]]'s governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] government of representing \"the condescending liberal elite\". Hague repeatedly referring to it as \"metropolitan\", implying that it was out of touch with \"the people\", who in Conservative discourse are represented by \"Middle England\".{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=550}} Blair's government also employed populist rhetoric; in outlining legislation to curtail [[fox hunting]] on [[animal welfare]] grounds, it presented itself as championing the desires of the majority against the upper-classes who engaged in the sport.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} Blair's rhetoric has been characterised as the adoption of a populist style rather than the expression of an underlying populist ideology.{{sfn|Bang|Marsh|2018|p=354}}\n\nBy the 21st century, European populism was again associated largely with the political right.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The term came to be used in reference both to [[Radical right (Europe)|radical right]] groups like J\u00f6rg Haider's FP\u00d6 in Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen's FN in France, as well as to non-radical right-wing groups like [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]] or [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s LPF in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=549}} The populist radical right combined populism with authoritarianism and nativism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=34}} Conversely, the Great Recession also resulted in the emergence of left-wing populist groups in parts of Europe, most notably the [[Syriza]] party which gained political office in Greece and the Podemos party in Spain, displaying similarities with the US-based Occupy movement.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}} Like Europe's right-wing populists, these groups also expressed [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment towards the European Union, albeit largely from a socialist and anti-austerity perspective rather than the nationalist perspective adopted by their right-wing counterparts.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=37}}\n\n=== North America ===\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|header=|header_align=left/right/center|header_background=|footer=The [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] saw a wave of populist sentiment in the campaigns of [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|Bernie Sanders]] and [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Donald Trump]], with both candidates running on [[anti-establishment]] platforms in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] parties, respectively|footer_align=left/right/center|footer_background=|width=|image1=Donald Trump by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|width1=250|caption1=|image2=Bernie Sanders by Gage Skidmore.jpg|width2=250|caption2=}}\n\nIn North America, populism has often been characterised by regional mobilisation and loose organisation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=22}} During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, populist sentiments became widespread, particularly in the western provinces of Canada, and in the southwest and Great Plains regions of the United States.

President [[Donald Trump]]]]\nPopulism has been dominant in Latin American politics since the 1930s and 1940s,{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=195}} being far more prevalent here than in Europe.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}} Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser noted that the region has the world's \"most enduring and prevalent populist tradition\".{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=27}} They suggested that this was the case because it was a region with a long tradition of democratic governance and free elections, but with high rates of socio-economic inequality, generating widespread resentments that politicians can articulate through populism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=27\u201328}} March instead thought that it was the important role of \"catch-all parties and prominent personalities\" in Latin American politics which had made populism more common.{{sfn|March|2007|p=69}}\n\nThe first wave of Latin American populism began at the start of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929 and last until the end of the 1960s.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=28}} In various countries, politicians took power while emphasising \"the people\": these included [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] in Brazil, [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] in Argentina, and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]] in Ecuador.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=28\u201329|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=196}} These relied on the ''[[Americanismo]]'' ideology, presenting a common identity across Latin America and denouncing any interference from [[imperialism|imperialist]] powers.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} The second wave took place in the early 1990s;{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} de la Torre called it \"neoliberal populism\".{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=198}} In the late 1980s, many Latin American states were experiencing economic crisis and several populist figures were elected by blaming the elites for this situation.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=29}} Examples include [[Carlos Menem]] in Argentina, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]] in Brazil, and [[Alberto Fujimori]] in Peru.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=29|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=198}} Once in power, these individuals pursued neoliberal economic strategies recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), stabilizing the economy and ending hyperinflation.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1pp=29\u201330|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=199}} Unlike the first wave, the second did not include an emphasis on Americanismo or anti-imperialism.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}}\n\nThe third wave began in the final years of the 1990s and continued into the 21st century.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} It overlapped in part with the [[pink tide]] of left-wing resurgence in Latin America. Like the first wave, the third made heavy use of Americanismo and anti-imperialism, although this time these themes presented alongside an explicitly socialist programme that opposed the free market.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=31}} Prominent examples included Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, Rafael Correa in Ecuador, and [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua.{{sfnm|1a1=March|1y=2007|1p=71|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2p=31|3a1=de la Torre|3y=2017|3p=199}} These socialist populist governments have presented themselves as giving sovereignty \"back to the people\", in particular through the formation of [[constituent assembly|constituent assemblies]] that would draw up new constitutions, which could then be ratified via referendums.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|1y=2017|1p=32|2a1=de la Torre|2y=2017|2p=200}} In this way they claimed to be correcting the problems of social and economic injustice that liberal democracy had failed to deal with, replacing it with superior forms of democracy.{{sfn|de la Torre|2017|p=201}}\n\n=== Oceania ===\n\nDuring the 1990s, there was a growth in populism in both Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=38}}\n\nIn New Zealand, [[Robert Muldoon]], the [[List of Prime Ministers of New Zealand|31st Prime Minister of New Zealand]] from 1975 to 1984, had been cited as a populist.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |title=Feisty, Protectionist Populism?

These have included Kenya's [[Raila Odinga]], Senegal's [[Abdoulaye Wade]], South Africa's [[Julius Malema]], and Zambia's [[Michael Sata]].{{sfn|Resnick|2017|p=106}} These populists have arisen in democratic rather than authoritarian states, and have arisen amid dissatisfaction with democratisation, socio-economic grievances, and frustration at the inability of opposition groups to oust incumbent parties.{{sfn|Resnick|2017|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\n===Asia and the Arab world===\n\n[[File:President Rodrigo Roa Duterte poses for a photo with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi prior to the start of the bilateral meeting at the Hyderabad House in New Delhi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] of [[Philippines]] and [[Narendra Modi]] of [[India]], they are both considered populist leaders]]\n\nIn North Africa, populism was associated with the approaches of several political leaders active in the 20th century, most notably Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and Libya's [[Muammar Gaddafi]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} However, populist approaches only became more popular in the Middle East during the early 21st century, by which point it became integral to much of the region's politics.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=39}} Here, it became an increasingly common element of mainstream politics in established representative democracies, associated with longstanding leaders like Israel's [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and Turkey's [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]].{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=39\u201340}} Although the [[Arab Spring]] was not a populist movement itself, populist rhetoric was present among protesters.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=40}}\n\nIn southeast Asia, populist politicians emerged in the wake of the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]]. In the region, various populist governments took power but were removed soon after: these include the administrations of [[Joseph Estrada]] in the Philippines, [[Roh Moo-hyun]] in South Korea, [[Chen Shui-bian]] in Taiwan, and [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] in Thailand.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|pp=38\u201339}}\nIn India, the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) which rose to increasing power in the early 21st century adopted a right-wing populist position.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=484}} Unlike many other successful populist groups, the BJP was not wholly reliant on the personality of its leader, but survived as a powerful electoral vehicle under several leaders.{{sfn|McDonnell|Cabrera|2019|p=485}}\n\n===Late 20th- and early 21st-century growth===\nIn the early 1990s, there was an increasing awareness of populism in established liberal democracies, sometimes referred to as the \"New Populism\".{{sfn|Canovan|2004|p=242}} The UK's [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|referendum on European Union membership]] and the election of Donald Trump, both in 2016, generated a substantial rise in interest in the concept from both academics and the public.{{sfn|Tormey|2018|p=260}} By 2016, \"populism\" was regularly used by political commentators.{{sfn|Anselmi|2018|p=1}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote=The rise of populism in Western Europe is, in large part, a reaction to the failure of traditional parties to respond adequately in the eyes of the electorate to a series of phenomena such as [[economic globalization|economic]] and [[cultural globalisation]], the speed and direction of [[European integration]], immigration, the decline of ideologies and class politics, exposure of elite corruption, etc. It is also the product of a much-cited, but rarely defined, \"political malaise\", manifested in steadily falling [[voter turnout]] across Western Europe, declining [[political party]] membership, and ever-greater numbers of citizens in surveys citing a lack of interest and distrust in politics and politicians.|source=Albertazzi and McDonnell, 2008{{sfn|Albertazzi|McDonnell|2008|p=1}} }}\n\nMudde argued that by the early 1990s, populism had become a regular feature in Western democracies.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=551}} He attributed this to changing perceptions of government that had spread in this period, which in turn he traced to the changing role of the media to focus increasingly on sensationalism and scandals.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} Since the late 1960s, the emergence of [[television]] had allowed for the increasing proliferation of the Western media, with media outlets becoming increasingly independent of political parties.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=553}} As private media companies have had to compete against each other, they have placed an increasing focus on scandals and other sensationalist elements of politics, in doing so promoting anti-governmental sentiments among their readership and cultivating an environment prime for populists.{{sfnm|1a1=Mudde|1y=2004|1p=553|2a1=Mudde|2a2=Rovira Kaltwasser|2y=2017|2pp=103\u2013104}} At the same time, politicians increasingly faced television interviews, exposing their flaws.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} News media had also taken to interviewing fewer accredited experts, and instead favouring interviewing individuals found on the street as to their views about current events.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}} At the same time, mass media was giving less attention to the \"[[high culture]]\" of elites and more to other sectors of society, as reflected in [[reality television]] shows such as ''[[Big Brother (franchise)|Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Mudde|Rovira Kaltwasser|2017|p=108}}\n\nMudde argued that another reason for the growth of Western populism in this period was the improved education of the populace; since the 1960s, citizens have expected more from their politicians and felt increasingly competent to judge their actions. This in turn has led to an increasingly sceptical attitude toward mainstream politicians and governing groups.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=554}} In Mudde's words, \"More and more citizens think they have a good understanding of what politicians do, and think they can do it better.\"{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nAnother factor is that in the post-[[Cold War]] period, liberal democracies no longer had the one-party states of the Eastern Bloc against which to favourably compare themselves; citizens were therefore increasingly able to compare the realities of the liberal democratic system with theoretical models of democracy, and find the former wanting.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=555}} There is also the impact of [[globalisation]], which is seen as having seriously limited the powers of national elites.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|pp=555\u201356}} Such factors undermine citizens' belief in the competency of governing elite, opening up space for [[charismatic authority|charismatic leadership]] to become increasingly popular; although charismatic leadership is not the same as populist leadership, populists have been the main winners of this shift towards charismatic leadership.{{sfn|Mudde|2004|p=556}}\n\nPeter Wilkins argued that \"The end of history and the post-Cold War extension and deepening of capitalism are central to understanding the rise of contemporary populist movements.\"<ref>Wilkins, Peter (2018) [http://jwsr.pitt.edu/ojs/index.php/jwsr/article/view/855 \"Rip It Up and Start Again: The Challenge of Populism in the 21st Century\"] in ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]''. v.24, no.22, p.317</ref> In [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2818659 Trump, Brexit and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash] Pippa Norris and Ronald F. Inglehart examine two theories on the causes of support for the growing populist movements in Western societies. The first is the economic insecurity perspective which focuses on the consequences created by a transforming contemporary workforce and society in [[post-industrial economy|post-industrial economies]]. Norris suggests that events such as globalisation, China's membership of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]] and cheaper imports have left the unsecured members of society (low-waged unskilled workers, single parents, the long term unemployed and the poorer white populations) seeking stronger authoritarian populist leaders such as [[Donald Trump]] and [[Nigel Farage]].  The other theory is the cultural backlash thesis, in which Norris and Inglehart suggest that the rise of populism is a reaction from previously dominant sectors of the population, the white, uneducated, elderly men of today, who feel threatened and marginalised by the progressive values of modern society. These groups in particular have a growing resentment towards their traditional values being scolded as politically incorrect and are much more likely to become supportive of anti-establishment, xenophobic political parties.{{sfn|Inglehart|Norris|2016|p=1-2|pp=29-30|loc=Bibliography}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Black populism]]\n* [[Communitarianism]]\n* [[List of populists]]\n* [[Ochlocracy]] (mob rule)\n* [[Paternalism]]\n* [[Penal populism]]\n* [[Politainment]]\n* [[Poporanism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n: {{cite chapter|last=Abi-Hassan|first=Sahar|chapter=Populism and Gender|year=2017|title=The Oxford Handbook of Populism|editors=Crist\u00f3bal Rovira Kaltwasser, Paul Taggart, Paulina Ochoa Espejo, and Pierre Ostiguy|location=Oxford and New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=426\u2013445|isbn=9780198803560|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Populism and Democracy: Challenge or Pathology?|url=|journal=Acta Politica|year=2003|volume=38|issue=2|pages=147\u2013159|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ap.5500021|ref=harv}}\n\n: {{cite journal|last=Akkerman|first=Tjitske|title=Friend or Foe?

It runs from [[Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin|Pleasant Prairie]] on the [[Illinois]] border north to [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]] on the [[Michigan]] border. Most of the route is concurrent with [[Interstate 41]] in the state, with the exception of the portion between [[Howard, Wisconsin|Howard]], a suburb of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]],  and [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]].\n\n==Route description==\nUS&nbsp;41 is a [[freeway]] for nearly 85&nbsp;percent of its route through Wisconsin, with the exceptions being a {{convert|29|mi|km|adj=on}} [[limited-access road|expressway]] section from the US 141 interchange in [[Oconto County, Wisconsin|Oconto County]] to Marinette and a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} surface arterial section within Marinette. The highway [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with I-94 from Milwaukee to the Illinois border and concurrently with I-41 from Howard to the Illinois border.\n\nUS&nbsp;41 runs northwest from Milwaukee and passes [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] before heading to Green Bay. The route is a major access point for [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], home of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[Major League Baseball]] club, the [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] air show in Oshkosh, and for [[Lambeau Field]], the home of the [[Green Bay Packers]] [[NFL]] football team.\n\nAfter leaving Green Bay, US&nbsp;41 continues north to [[Abrams, Wisconsin|Abrams]] co-signed with [[U.S. Route 141|US&nbsp;141]], and then it turns east off the co-signed route toward Marinette and into Michigan.\n\n==History==\nThe first alignment of US 41 in Wisconsin, which extended south from Marinette to the Illinois state line, was defined generally by two state trunk highways in existence in 1926: [[Wisconsin Highway 15|WIS&nbsp;15]] from Marinette to Milwaukee, and [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] from Milwaukee to the Illinois state line. Signs for the newly established highway were to be placed in spring of 1927.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/287475637 |title = State Prepares to Mark New U.S. Thru Highways |last =  |first =  |date = August 18, 1926 |work = Appleton Post-Crescent |access-date = December 23, 2017 |page = 7 |language = en |via = Newspapers.com }}</ref> A meeting of the Wisconsin Highway Commission in 1926 decided that no new U.S. Highway number would overlap with an existing state route number; therefore, [[Wisconsin Highway 41|WIS&nbsp;41]] was retired and renumbered when US 41 came into existence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Milwaukee the original routing of US&nbsp;41 used Lisbon Avenue east to North 27th Street, then south along that road to the Illinois state line. After the Stadium Freeway was built in the 1960s, US&nbsp;41 followed that road from Lisbon Avenue south across I-94 to National Avenue and then east to 27th Street, which is known as Layton Boulevard between National Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. WisDOT rerouted US&nbsp;41 along I-94 from the Stadium Interchange to the Illinois state line, removed Layton Boulevard north of Forest Home Avenue from the state highway system and gave Layton Boulevard and 27th Street south of Forest Home Avenue the designation of [[Wisconsin Highway 241|WIS&nbsp;241]] in a compromise to avoid expansion of the original route. The old US&nbsp;41 freeway section south of I-94 to National Avenue (which was realigned to accommodate the construction of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]) was designated [[Wisconsin Highway 341|WIS&nbsp;341]] but is unsigned. Trailblazer signs label it Miller Park Way.\n\nBy 1955, US&nbsp;41 was relocated from the corridor of today's [[Wisconsin Highway 175|WIS&nbsp;175]] and its successors to a nearby expressway in [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago]], [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]], [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington]], [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha]], and [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] Counties.<ref name=\"bessert01\">{{cite web |first = Christopher J. |last = Bessert |title = US&nbsp;41, The Complete History |work = Wisconsin Highways |publisher = Self-published |date = January 31, 2009 |url = http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/indepth/US-41_history.html |accessdate = December 14, 2006 }}{{SPS|certain=y|date= August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], the road was rerouted in 1953 to make a curve to the right west of [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]], going onto Ashland Avenue to the Green Bay city limits. It then turned left onto Highland Avenue (after 1968, Lombardi Avenue), going past [[Lambeau Field]] and curving right onto Military Avenue. It then turned left at Velp Avenue. US 41 then followed present day Velp Avenue north to Suamico where it merged with what is now the US&nbsp;41 freeway. Until 1968 this was the outer highway for Green Bay; the area now is urbanized. The 1953\u20131968 Green Bay bypass was once again bypassed, sequentially, with the present US&nbsp;41 freeway beginning at Velp, southerly to Lombardi in 1968; Velp north to Suamico in 1971; then from Lombardi south to De Pere in 1974.<ref name=\"bessert01\"/>\n\n[[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] also saw US&nbsp;41 realignments over the course of time, beginning with the 1937 two-lane bypass (along the present freeway route) from [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] northerly to a T-intersection with US&nbsp;10 (today's Wisconsin Avenue, [[Wisconsin Highway 96|WIS&nbsp;96]]). There, US&nbsp;41 turned east with US&nbsp;10, back to its original route at the intersection of US&nbsp;10 (Wisconsin Avenue) and Richmond Street north of downtown Appleton, then north on Richmond to present day Northland Avenue. There it turned east on new alignment back to the original route northeast of [[Kaukauna, Wisconsin|Kaukauna]]. In 1940, US&nbsp;41 was extended northerly from the T-intersection at US&nbsp;10 for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}, before making a large sweeping curve onto present day Northland Avenue to join back up with the previous bypass at Richmond Street. By 1962, the original Appleton bypass had been converted to four-lane divided highway from Oshkosh north to Northland Avenue, then north and east on new alignment bypassing the Northland Avenue bypass with the current freeway easterly to Kaukauna.\n\n==Exit list==\n{{mileposts}}\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"WisDOT\">Wisconsin State Trunk Highway Logs:<br/>\n*{{cite book |author = Southeast

north\u2013south highway [[United States Numbered Highway]] in eastern [[Wisconsin]]. It runs from [[Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin|Pleasant Prairie]] on the [[Illinois]] border north to [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]] on the [[Michigan]] border. Most of the route is concurrent with [[Interstate 41]] in the state, with the exception of the portion between [[Howard, Wisconsin|Howard]], a suburb of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]],  and [[Marinette, Wisconsin|Marinette]].\n\n==Route description==\nUS&nbsp;41 is a [[freeway]] for nearly 85&nbsp;percent of its route through Wisconsin, with the exceptions being a {{convert|29|mi|km|adj=on}} [[limited-access road|expressway]] section from the US 141 interchange in [[Oconto County, Wisconsin|Oconto County]] to Marinette and a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} surface arterial section within Marinette. The highway [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with I-94 from Milwaukee to the Illinois border and concurrently with I-41 from Howard to the Illinois border.\n\nUS&nbsp;41 runs northwest from Milwaukee and passes [[Fond du Lac, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Oshkosh, Wisconsin|Oshkosh]], and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] before heading to Green Bay. The route is a major access point for [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]], home of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] [[Major League Baseball]] club, the [[EAA AirVenture Oshkosh]] air show in Oshkosh, and for [[Lambeau Field]], the home of the [[Green Bay Packers]] [[NFL]] football team.\n\nAfter leaving Green Bay, US&nbsp;41 continues north to [[Abrams, Wisconsin|Abrams]] co-signed with [[U.S. Route 141|US&nbsp;141]], and then it turns east off the co-signed route toward Marinette and into Michigan.\n\n==History==\nThe first alignment of US 41 in Wisconsin, which extended south from Marinette to the Illinois state line, was defined generally by two state trunk highways in existence in 1926: [[Wisconsin Highway 15|WIS&nbsp;15]] from Marinette to Milwaukee, and [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] from Milwaukee to the Illinois state line. Signs for the newly established highway were to be placed in spring of 1927.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news |url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/287475637 |title = State Prepares to Mark New U.S. Thru Highways |last =  |first =  |date = August 18, 1926 |work = Appleton Post-Crescent |access-date = December 23, 2017 |page = 7 |language = en |via = Newspapers.com }}</ref> A meeting of the Wisconsin Highway Commission in 1926 decided that no new U.S. Highway number would overlap with an existing state route number; therefore, [[Wisconsin Highway 41|WIS&nbsp;41]] was retired and renumbered when US 41 came into existence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Milwaukee the original routing of US&nbsp;41 used Lisbon Avenue east to North 27th Street, then south along that road to the Illinois state line. After the Stadium Freeway was built in the 1960s, US&nbsp;41 followed that road from Lisbon Avenue south across I-94 to National Avenue and then east to 27th Street, which is known as Layton Boulevard between National Avenue and Lincoln Avenue. WisDOT rerouted US&nbsp;41 along I-94 from the Stadium Interchange to the Illinois state line, removed Layton Boulevard north of Forest Home Avenue from the state highway system and gave Layton Boulevard and 27th Street south of Forest Home Avenue the designation of [[Wisconsin Highway 241|WIS&nbsp;241]] in a compromise to avoid expansion of the original route. The old US&nbsp;41 freeway section south of I-94 to National Avenue (which was realigned to accommodate the construction of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]) was designated [[Wisconsin Highway 341|WIS&nbsp;341]] but is unsigned. Trailblazer signs label it Miller Park Way.\n\nBy 1955, US&nbsp;41 was relocated from the corridor of today's [[Wisconsin Highway 175|WIS&nbsp;175]] and its successors to a nearby expressway in [[Winnebago County, Wisconsin|Winnebago]], [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]], [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington]], [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha]], and [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] Counties.<ref name=\"bessert01\">{{cite web |first = Christopher J. |last = Bessert |title = US&nbsp;41, The Complete History |work = Wisconsin Highways |publisher = Self-published |date = January 31, 2009 |url = http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/indepth/US-41_history.html |accessdate = December 14, 2006 }}{{SPS|certain=y|date= August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], the road was rerouted in 1953 to make a curve to the right west of [[De Pere, Wisconsin|De Pere]], going onto Ashland Avenue to the Green Bay city limits. It then turned left onto Highland Avenue (after 1968, Lombardi Avenue), going past [[Lambeau Field]] and curving right onto Military Avenue. It then turned left at Velp Avenue. US 41 then followed present day Velp Avenue north to Suamico where it merged with what is now the US&nbsp;41 freeway. Until 1968 this was the outer highway for Green Bay; the area now is urbanized. The 1953\u20131968 Green Bay bypass was once again bypassed, sequentially, with the present US&nbsp;41 freeway beginning at Velp, southerly to Lombardi in 1968; Velp north to Suamico in 1971; then from Lombardi south to De Pere in 1974.<ref name=\"bessert01\"/>\n\n[[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]] also saw US&nbsp;41 realignments over the course of time, beginning with the 1937 two-lane bypass (along the present freeway route) from [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] northerly to a T-intersection with US&nbsp;10 (today's Wisconsin Avenue, [[Wisconsin Highway 96|WIS&nbsp;96]]). There, US&nbsp;41 turned east with US&nbsp;10, back to its original route at the intersection of US&nbsp;10 (Wisconsin Avenue) and Richmond Street north of downtown Appleton, then north on Richmond to present day Northland Avenue. There it turned east on new alignment back to the original route northeast of [[Kaukauna, Wisconsin|Kaukauna]]. In 1940, US&nbsp;41 was extended northerly from the T-intersection at US&nbsp;10 for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}}, before making a large sweeping curve onto present day Northland Avenue to join back up with the previous bypass at Richmond Street. By 1962, the original Appleton bypass had been converted to four-lane divided highway from Oshkosh north to Northland Avenue, then north and east on new alignment bypassing the Northland Avenue bypass with the current freeway easterly to Kaukauna.\n\n==Exit list==\n{{mileposts}}\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=<ref name=\"WisDOT\">Wisconsin State Trunk Highway Logs:<br/>\n*{{cite book |author = Southeast

Shuttle describes \"the Bibby Line SS Nevasa, a 9000 tonne coal burning troopship of ancient lineage\". Christopher Repton sent letters to his family from on board HMT Nevasa between December 1939 and January 1940. Both men were later interned as PoWs on Burma-Siam railway.)  and launched on 30 November 1955. The ship was the first troopship built since the end of the [[Second World War]] and the largest troopship at that time to be built in the [[United Kingdom]]. \n\nThe ''Nevasa'' was owned by the [[British India Steam Navigation Company]] and was 20,527 tons. New features of the ship included stabilisers to reduce rolling in rough seas. The ''Nevasa'' had the capacity to accommodate 500 officers and their families and 1,000 [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]] and men on the troop deck. The ship was used to transport troops during the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956. The ship transported many regiments to the Middle East and Far East including the [[1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd)]] who left [[Southampton]] on 7 April 1962 and arrived at [[Penang]] on 28 April 1962 via [[Port Said]] and including stops at [[Malta]] and [[Aden]]. The [[1st Green Jackets (43rd and 52nd)]] was the first unit to be posted to the Far East without any National Servicemen, following the end of [[conscription]] in 1961. The ending of [[National Service]] and the British Government's decision in 1962 to reduce the use of ships for movement of troops and increase usage of aircraft led to the ''Nevasa'' being withdrawn from service.\n\nThe ship was laid up in the [[River Fal]] from October 1962 to 1965. After this she became an educational cruise ship, later from 1968 with a sister ship the {{SS|Uganda|1952|6}}. The conversion of the ship cost \u00a3500,000 and took place in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]].

The recommendation was to build two new terminals, and in 1998 Terminal 2 was completed. Terminal 2 was nicknamed the Centennial Terminal as its completion coincided with the 100th anniversary of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain. In 1997 the government approved the construction of Terminal 3, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 2002. After many delays caused by technical and legal issues, the terminal became partially operational in mid-2008 and fully operational in August 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://business.inquirer.net/174122/naia-3-fully-operational-by-aug-1-miaa-officials|title=Naia 3 fully operational by Aug. 1\u2013Miaa officials|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=July 4, 2014|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> The government aims to return services from many of the airlines which cancelled services to Manila as a result of Terminal 1's problems.\n\n===1990s===\n[[Image:NAIA Terminal 3 Departure 2009 MC.jpg|thumb|Departure hall of NAIA Terminal 3]]\nThe original proposal for the construction of a third terminal was proposed by Asia's Emerging Dragon Corporation (AEDP).<ref name=\"AEDC\">{{cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/columns/view/20110417-331708/Impossible-Dream|title=Impossible Dream|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|accessdate=September 13, 2014}}</ref> AEDP eventually lost the bid to PairCargo and its partner [[Fraport|Fraport AG]] of Germany, who went on to begin construction of the terminal under the administration of Joseph Estrada.

However, before the terminal could be fully completed, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, called the contract \"onerous\" and therefore formed a committee to evaluate the agreement to buy out Fraport AG. It is this action that sparked the most controversy. The Philippine Supreme Court eventually found the Piatco contract \"null and void\" citing a variety of anomalies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsflash.org/2003/05/hl/hl017922.htm|title=PIATCO NAIA3 Deal Null and Void -- Supreme Court|publisher=newsflash.org|date=May 6, 2003|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo eventually abrogated Piatco's BOT Contract for allegedly having been anomalous in certain important respects. In a subsequent decision, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld the Philippine Government's position on the matter and declared the BOT contract \"null and void\" for, among other things, violations of certain provisions of the BOT law. More specifically, the Court found that the original contract was revised to allow for a Philippine government guarantee of Piatco's obligations to its creditors, contractors and suppliers. The BOT law disallows the granting of such sovereign guarantees. Piatco disagrees and continues to maintain that the provisions cited by the Supreme Court do not amount to a prohibited sovereign guarantee by the Philippine Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/philippines/ninoy_aquino_intl_philippines.php|publisher=airports-worldwide.com|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:NAIA from the Air.JPG|thumb|right|A shot of the airport taken from a departing aircraft]]\nIn December 2004, the Philippine government expropriated the terminal project from Piatco through an order of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court. However, the court only allowed the Philippine government to take over the terminal upon payment of an initial amount of {{Philippine peso|3 billion}} (approximately US$64 million) to Piatco. The Philippine government paid Piatco this amount during the second week of September 2006. According to the Philippine government, NAIA-3 was 98% complete (prior in 2006) and required at least an additional US$6 million to complete. The government was then in the process of negotiating a contract with the builder of the terminal, [[Takenaka Corporation]], because another factor that delayed the terminal's opening was the ongoing investigation into the collapse of an {{convert|100|m2|adj=on}} area of the terminal's ceiling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/119513/news/nation/naia-terminal-3-ceiling-falls-off-one-more-time|title=NAIA terminal 3 ceiling falls off one more time|publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPiatco (and its German partner, Fraport) have instituted arbitration proceedings before different international bodies to recover a fair settlement.

It is divided into two wings: the North Wing, for international flights, and the South Wing, which handles domestic operations. It currently has 12 jet bridges. There are several cafes and restaurants in the Terminal post-security. There is also a small duty-free section in the north wing. The need for two more terminals was proposed by a Master Plan Review of the Airport that was undertaken in 1989 by A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP). The study was facilitated by means of a grant from the [[French Government]]. The review cost 2.9 million [[French franc]]s and was submitted to the Philippine Government for evaluation in 1990.<ref name=\"T1\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the French government granted a 30-million-franc soft loan to the Philippine government, which was to be used to cover the Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design of the NAIA Terminal 2. ADP completed the design in 1992 and in 1994, the Japanese Government granted an 18.12-billion-[[Japanese yen|yen]] soft loan to the Philippine Government to finance 75% of the terminal's construction costs and 100% of the supervision costs. Construction of the Centennial Terminal began on December 11, 1995, and was formally turned over to the government of the Philippines on December 28, 1998.

Terminal 2 was nicknamed the Centennial Terminal as its completion coincided with the 100th anniversary of the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]] from Spain. In 1997 the government approved the construction of Terminal 3, which was originally scheduled to be completed in 2002.

However, before the terminal could be fully completed, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, called the contract \"onerous\" and therefore formed a committee to evaluate the agreement to buy out Fraport AG.

In a subsequent decision, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld the Philippine Government's position on the matter and declared the BOT contract \"null and void\" for, among other things, violations of certain provisions of the BOT law. More specifically, the Court found that the original contract was revised to allow for a Philippine government guarantee of Piatco's obligations to its creditors, contractors and suppliers. The BOT law disallows the granting of such sovereign guarantees. Piatco disagrees and continues to maintain that the provisions cited by the Supreme Court do not amount to a prohibited sovereign guarantee by the Philippine Government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/philippines/ninoy_aquino_intl_philippines.php|publisher=airports-worldwide.com|accessdate=November 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:NAIA from the Air.JPG|thumb|right|A shot of the airport taken from a departing aircraft]]\nIn December 2004, the Philippine government expropriated the terminal project from Piatco through an order of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court. However, the court only allowed the Philippine government to take over the terminal upon payment of an initial amount of {{Philippine peso|3 billion}} (approximately US$64 million) to Piatco. The Philippine government paid Piatco this amount during the second week of September 2006. According to the Philippine government, NAIA-3 was 98% complete (prior in 2006) and required at least an additional US$6 million to complete. The government was then in the process of negotiating a contract with the builder of the terminal, [[Takenaka Corporation]], because another factor that delayed the terminal's opening was the ongoing investigation into the collapse of an {{convert|100|m2|adj=on}} area of the terminal's ceiling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/119513/news/nation/naia-terminal-3-ceiling-falls-off-one-more-time|title=NAIA terminal 3 ceiling falls off one more time|publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPiatco (and its German partner, Fraport) have instituted arbitration proceedings before different international bodies to recover a fair settlement.

It is divided into two wings: the North Wing, for international flights, and the South Wing, which handles domestic operations. It currently has 12 jet bridges. There are several cafes and restaurants in the Terminal post-security. There is also a small duty-free section in the north wing. The need for two more terminals was proposed by a Master Plan Review of the Airport that was undertaken in 1989 by A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP). The study was facilitated by means of a grant from the [[French Government]]. The review cost 2.9 million [[French franc]]s and was submitted to the Philippine Government for evaluation in 1990.<ref name=\"T1\"/>\n\nIn 1991, the French government granted a 30-million-franc soft loan to the Philippine government, which was to be used to cover the Detailed Architectural and Engineering Design of the NAIA Terminal 2. ADP completed the design in 1992 and in 1994, the Japanese Government granted an 18.12-billion-[[Japanese yen|yen]] soft loan to the Philippine Government to finance 75% of the terminal's construction costs and 100% of the supervision costs. Construction of the Centennial Terminal began on December 11, 1995, and was formally turned over to the government of the Philippines on December 28, 1998.

Per key guidelines, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nMal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos visit the Isle of the Lost to choose four new villain's kids (VKs) to take to Auradon. They pick Dizzy, daughter of Drizella and granddaughter of Lady Tremaine, Celia, daughter of Dr. Facilier, and Squeaky and Squirmy, the twin sons of Mr. Smee. The day the kids are to be picked up, Ben, Mal's boyfriend and the king of Auradon, proposes to her. She accepts; Ben's ex-girlfriend Audrey seethes with jealousy and her grandmother Queen Leah admonishes her for failing to secure the family legacy by marrying Ben.\n\nWhen the barrier is opened for the new VKs, Hades, the god of the underworld, attempts to escape, but Mal beats him back in her dragon form. That night, unable to contain her jealousy of Mal, Audrey steals the Queen's Crown and Maleficent's Scepter from The Museum of Cultural History. The theft and Hades' escape attempt has the citizens panicking. Mal, as future Queen, decides the best way to protect the subjects and restore peace is to close the barrier permanently, meaning no new VKs can come, nor can anyone enter the Isle.\n\nAudrey attacks Mal with Maleficent's scepter, turning her into an old hag. Mal and the other VKs go to the Isle to get Hades' ember, the only thing powerful enough to break the scepter's curse. Mal is restored upon entering the Isle due to the suppression of evil magic there. Celia gets Mal into Hades' lair, but he thwarts their effort to steal the ember. He is revealed to be Mal's absentee father and reluctantly gives her the ember, warning her that it mustn't get wet and will not exhibit its full powers for her. While leaving the Isle, Mal and the others are stopped by Uma, Gil, and Harry, who take the Ember; they agree to help after Mal agrees to release all the children from the Isle.\n\nIn Auradon, Audrey attacks Jane's birthday party with a sleeping curse; Chad obsequiously aligns himself with Audrey, while Jane escapes into the Enchanted Lake. As the entire kingdom falls under Audrey's spell, she offers to reverse it if Ben will marry her; he refuses, so she turns him into a beast and begins turning people to stone. Mal and Uma, vying for leadership of the VKs, return to Auradon with their friends. Despite their bickering, they defeat suits of armor animated by Audrey. Uma finds Audrey's diary and learns that she spends time at Fairy Cottage, a contribution for which Mal thanks her. Evie, nervous to define her feelings for Doug, wakes him with \"true love's kiss.\" Carlos calms Ben, in beast form, until Jane restores him with lake water. As Mal and Uma are thawing towards each other, Audrey traps them in Evie's house; they reverse Audrey's spell by combining their magic, and they all reunite there.\n\nAt the Fairy Cottage, they find only a shell-shocked Chad. When Mal admits that she plans to seal off the Isle permanently, the group implodes and Celia, learning she can never see her father again, throws the ember in a birdbath and Uma and Harry leave. After Evie tells Mal how upset she is for lying to her and their friends, they are all suddenly turned to stone, except for Mal. Audrey takes Celia hostage and attacks Mal, who turns into her dragon form. Realizing she is Mal's only hope, Uma combines their magic to reignite the ember; Mal overcomes Audrey, who falls comatose, and the curses are lifted. The ember could revive Audrey, but only in Hades' hands; Ben agrees to send for him, while Uma, Harry, Gil, and Celia plan to return to the Isle. Mal apologizes for lying; her friends and former rivals forgive her as they understood that she was just trying to do the right thing. Hades arrives and revives Audrey, but decries the double standard by which Audrey is immediately forgiven because she is not considered a villain. Mal and Ben apologize to Audrey; in response, Audrey and Queen Leah apologize to Mal.\n\nMal announces that she cannot be the Queen of Auradon unless she can also be the Queen of the Isle because everyone is capable of being good and bad.

Per key guidelines, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nMal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos visit the Isle of the Lost to choose four new villain's kids (VKs) to take to Auradon. They pick Dizzy, daughter of Drizella and granddaughter of Lady Tremaine, Celia, daughter of Dr. Facilier, and Squeaky and Squirmy, the twin sons of Mr. Smee. The day the kids are to be picked up, Ben, Mal's boyfriend and the king of Auradon, proposes to her. She accepts; Ben's ex-girlfriend Audrey seethes with jealousy and her grandmother Queen Leah admonishes her for failing to secure the family legacy by marrying Ben.\n\nWhen the barrier is opened for the new VKs, Hades, the god of the underworld, attempts to escape, but Mal beats him back in her dragon form. That night, unable to contain her jealousy of Mal, Audrey steals the Queen's Crown and Maleficent's Scepter from The Museum of Cultural History. The theft and Hades' escape attempt has the citizens panicking. Mal, as future Queen, decides the best way to protect the subjects and restore peace is to close the barrier permanently, meaning no new VKs can come, nor can anyone enter the Isle.\n\nAudrey attacks Mal with Maleficent's scepter, turning her into an old hag. Mal and the other VKs go to the Isle to get Hades' ember, the only thing powerful enough to break the scepter's curse. Mal is restored upon entering the Isle due to the suppression of evil magic there. Celia gets Mal into Hades' lair, but he thwarts their effort to steal the ember. He is revealed to be Mal's absentee father and reluctantly gives her the ember, warning her that it mustn't get wet and will not exhibit its full powers for her. While leaving the Isle, Mal and the others are stopped by Uma, Gil, and Harry, who take the Ember; they agree to help after Mal agrees to release all the children from the Isle.\n\nIn Auradon, Audrey attacks Jane's birthday party with a sleeping curse; Chad obsequiously aligns himself with Audrey, while Jane escapes into the Enchanted Lake. As the entire kingdom falls under Audrey's spell, she offers to reverse it if Ben will marry her; he refuses, so she turns him into a beast and begins turning people to stone. Mal and Uma, vying for leadership of the VKs, return to Auradon with their friends. Despite their bickering, they defeat suits of armor animated by Audrey. Uma finds Audrey's diary and learns that she spends time at Fairy Cottage, a contribution for which Mal thanks her. Evie, nervous to define her feelings for Doug, wakes him with \"true love's kiss.\" Carlos calms Ben, in beast form, until Jane restores him with lake water. As Mal and Uma are thawing towards each other, Audrey traps them in Evie's house; they reverse Audrey's spell by combining their magic, and they all reunite there.\n\nAt the Fairy Cottage, they find only a shell-shocked Chad. When Mal admits that she plans to seal off the Isle permanently, the group implodes and Celia, learning she can never see her father again, throws the ember in a birdbath and Uma and Harry leave. After Evie tells Mal how upset she is for lying to her and their friends, they are all suddenly turned to stone, except for Mal. Audrey takes Celia hostage and attacks Mal, who turns into her dragon form. Realizing she is Mal's only hope, Uma combines their magic to reignite the ember; Mal overcomes Audrey, who falls comatose, and the curses are lifted. The ember could revive Audrey, but only in Hades' hands; Ben agrees to send for him, while Uma, Harry, Gil, and Celia plan to return to the Isle. Mal apologizes for lying; her friends and former rivals forgive her as they understood that she was just trying to do the right thing. Hades arrives and revives Audrey, but decries the double standard by which Audrey is immediately forgiven because she is not considered a villain. Mal and Ben apologize to Audrey; in response, Audrey and Queen Leah apologize to Mal.\n\nMal announces that she cannot be the Queen of Auradon unless she can also be the Queen of the Isle because everyone is capable of being good and bad. With Ben and the Fairy Godmother's agreement, Mal removes the barrier and creates a bridge, and the people of the newly merged society celebrate. Also, Jane and Carlos become official, Mal and Ben are engaged, and Audrey has eyes for Harry (after Uma rejects him).\n\nIn the [[mid-credits scene]], Mal, Evie, Jay, and Carlos are seen looking at the Isle of the Lost; then racing across the bridge to their parents.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Note: Cast listed in the same order as in the first two films, which is presumed to be the listed order for this film -->\n* [[Dove Cameron]] as Mal, daughter of [[Maleficent]], and later revealed also to be the daughter of Hades<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n* [[Cameron Boyce]] as Carlos, son of [[Cruella de Vil]]<ref name=\"Variety\" /><!--See talk page regarding Boyce's death.-->\n* [[Sofia Carson]] as Evie, daughter of [[Evil Queen (Disney)|The Evil Queen]]<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n* [[Booboo Stewart]] as Jay, son of [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]]<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n* Mitchell Hope as Ben, son of [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] and [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]]<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n* [[Sarah Jeffery]] as Princess Audrey, daughter of [[Aurora (Disney character)|Princess Aurora]] and [[Prince Phillip (Disney)|Prince Phillip]]<ref name=\"Jeffery\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/descendants-3-sarah-jeffery-thomas-doherty-dylan-playfair-reprise-roles-1202372916/|title='Descendants 3': Sarah Jeffery, Thomas Doherty & Dylan Playfair To Reprise Roles In Threequel|work=Deadline Hollywood|author=Denise Petski|date=April 20, 2018|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n* Brenna D'Amico as Jane, daughter of the Fairy Godmother<ref name=\"E!\" />\n* [[Melanie Paxson]] as [[Fairy Godmother (Disney)|the Fairy Godmother]], the headmistress of Auradon Prep and Jane's mother<ref name=\"Hades2\" />\n* [[Thomas Doherty (actor)|Thomas Doherty]] as Harry Hook, son of [[Captain Hook (Disney)|Captain Hook]] and ally of Uma<ref name=\"Jeffery\" />\n* Dylan Playfair as Gil, son of [[Gaston (Disney)|Gaston]] and ally of Uma<ref name=\"Jeffery\" />\n* Zachary Gibson as Doug, son of [[Dopey (Disney)|Dopey]] the [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|Dwarf]]<ref name=\"E!\" />\n* Jedidiah Goodacre as Chad Charming, son of [[Cinderella (Disney character)|Cinderella]] and [[Prince Charming]]<ref name=\"E!\" />\n* [[Anna Cathcart]] as Dizzy Tremaine, daughter of [[Drizella Tremaine]] and granddaughter of Lady Tremaine<ref name=\"Facilier2\">{{cite web|author=Maureen Lee Lenker|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/04/descendants-3-cast-princess-and-the-frog-dr-facilier-daughter/|title=''Descendants 3'' casts The Princess and the Frog's Dr. Facilier and his daughter|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 4, 2018|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n* Jadah Marie as Celia, the daughter of Dr. Facilier<ref name=\"Facilier2\" /><ref name=\"Facilier\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/tv-news-roundup-youtube-red-dallas-robo-1202799856/|title=TV News Roundup: 'Descendants 3' Adds Two More to Cast|work=Variety|author=Ariana Brockington|date=May 4, 2018|accessdate=2018-05-05}}</ref>\n* [[Dan Payne]] as King [[Beast (Disney)|Beast]], Queen Belle's husband and Ben's father<ref name=\"Hades2\" />\n* [[Keegan Connor Tracy]] as Queen [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]], Beast's wife and Ben's mother<ref name=\"Hades2\" />\n* [[Bobby Moynihan]] as the Voice of Dude, Carlos' dog who gained the power of speech in ''[[Descendants 2]]''\n<!-- With -->\n* [[Cheyenne Jackson]] as [[Hades (Disney)|Hades]], ruler of the underworld and later revealed to be Mal's father<ref name=\"Hades2\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/05/descendants-3-cheyenne-jackson-hades-disney-channel-hercules-villain-1202395347/|title='Descendants 3': Disney Channel Pic Adds Cheyenne Jackson As Hades From 'Hercules'|work=Deadline Hollywood|author=Erik Pedersen|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-05-28}}</ref><ref name=\"Hades\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/descendants-3-cheyenne-jackson-1202817717/|title=TV News Roundup: 'Descendants 3' Casts Cheyenne Jackson as Hades|work=Variety|author=Kirsten Chuba|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=2018-05-28}}</ref>\n<!-- And -->\n* [[China Anne McClain]] as Uma, daughter of [[Ursula (Disney)|Ursula]]<ref name=\"Variety\" />\n<!-- End of main end-credits -->\n\nAdditionally, Judith Maxie reprises her role as [[Queen Leah]], Princess Audrey's grandmother, from the first ''Descendants'' film.<ref name=\"casting-tweet\">{{cite tweet|user=descendants|number=998609560956030976|title=Casting is complete!
