[[Mohamed Atta]] deliberately crashed the plane into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City, killing all 92 people aboard and an unknown number in the building's impact zone. The aircraft involved, a [[Boeing 767#767-200ER|Boeing 767-223ER]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|N|334AA|,}} was flying [[American Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning [[transcontinental flight|transcontinental service]] from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\nFifteen minutes into the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), forcibly breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, [[flight attendant]]s [[Madeline Amy Sweeney|Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]] contacted [[American Airlines]], and provided information about the [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] and injuries to passengers and crew.\n\nThe aircraft crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 [[Eastern Daylight Time|local time]]. Countless people in the streets of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment by local people. Documentary film maker [[Jules and Gedeon Naudet|Jules Naudet]] captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102&nbsp;minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks|recovery effort]] at the [[World Trade Center site]], workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight&nbsp;11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.\n\n==Flight==\n[[File:N334AA B767-223ER American MAN 08APR01 (6839074488).jpg|thumb|left|N334AA, the aircraft involved, taxiing at [[Manchester Airport]] on April 8, 2001, five months before the attacks.|alt=Sideview of N334AA at Manchester Airport]]\nThe American Airlines Flight 11 aircraft was a [[Boeing 767]]-223ER delivered in 1987, [[Aircraft registration|registration]] number N334AA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/GenPDF.asp?id=DCA01MA060&rpt=fi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531210846/http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/GenPDF.asp?id=DCA01MA060&rpt=fi |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |title=Brief of Accident |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=March 7, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref> The capacity of the aircraft was 158&nbsp;passengers, but the September 11 flight carried 81&nbsp;passengers and 11&nbsp;crew members.

[[Mohamed Atta]] deliberately crashed the plane into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City, killing all 92 people aboard and an unknown number in the building's impact zone. The aircraft involved, a [[Boeing 767#767-200ER|Boeing 767-223ER]], [[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|N|334AA|,}} was flying [[American Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning [[transcontinental flight|transcontinental service]] from [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n\nFifteen minutes into the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), forcibly breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, [[flight attendant]]s [[Madeline Amy Sweeney|Amy Sweeney]] and [[Betty Ong]] contacted [[American Airlines]], and provided information about the [[Hijackers in the September 11 attacks|hijackers]] and injuries to passengers and crew.\n\nThe aircraft crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 08:46:40 [[Eastern Daylight Time|local time]]. Countless people in the streets of New York City witnessed the strike, but few video recordings captured the moment by local people. Documentary film maker [[Jules and Gedeon Naudet|Jules Naudet]] captured the only known footage of the initial impact from start to finish. Before the hijacking was confirmed, news agencies began to report on the incident and speculated that the crash had been an accident. The impact and subsequent fire caused the North Tower to collapse 102&nbsp;minutes after the crash, resulting in hundreds of additional casualties. During the [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks|recovery effort]] at the [[World Trade Center site]], workers recovered and identified dozens of remains from Flight&nbsp;11 victims, but many body fragments could not be identified.\n\n==Flight==\n[[File:N334AA B767-223ER American MAN 08APR01 (6839074488).jpg|thumb|left|N334AA, the aircraft involved, taxiing at [[Manchester Airport]] on April 8, 2001, five months before the attacks.|alt=Sideview of N334AA at Manchester Airport]]\nThe American Airlines Flight 11 aircraft was a [[Boeing 767]]-223ER delivered in 1987, [[Aircraft registration|registration]] number N334AA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/GenPDF.asp?id=DCA01MA060&rpt=fi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531210846/http://www.ntsb.gov/ntsb/GenPDF.asp?id=DCA01MA060&rpt=fi |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |title=Brief of Accident |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=March 7, 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 5, 2007}}</ref> The capacity of the aircraft was 158&nbsp;passengers, but the September 11 flight carried 81&nbsp;passengers and 11&nbsp;crew members.

The series were developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Geoff Johns]], [[Ali Adler]], [[Phil Klemmer]], [[Salim Akil]] and [[Caroline Dries]], and based on characters appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. Set in a [[shared fictional universe|shared fictional multiverse]] much like the [[DC Universe]] and [[DC Multiverse]] in comic books, it was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters that span six live-action television series and two animated series.\n\nThe franchise began with ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', based on the character [[Green Arrow]], which debuted in October 2012. It was followed by ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' in 2014, and the animated web-series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' in 2015. The franchise was further expanded in 2016, when in January of that year a new series titled ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' debuted, starring characters that originally appeared on both ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''. Later that year, the [[CBS]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', having already crossed-over with ''The Flash'', was moved to The CW for its second season, where it has remained since. A second animated web-series, ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', was released in 2017, which followed [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray Terrill / The Ray]], who would make a live-action appearance during that year's crossover event \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\". In addition to the live-action and web-based series, the franchise has spawned three promotional tie-in live-action web series, ''Blood Rush'', ''Chronicles of Cisco'', and ''The Flash: Stretched Scenes''; released in 2013, 2016, and 2017 respectively. A fifth series, ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', premiered in 2019. Since 2014, there has been a yearly crossover event involving many of the live-action series of the Arrowverse.

''Supergirl'' already has that problem built-in with Superman, who it seems will not be a regular fixture on the show, and I'm sure there will be many excuses as to why he's too busy to help Supergirl fight her latest battle. Add in ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' mythology, and it's probably too much to juggle....I think ''Supergirl'' deserves to launch without ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' on its shoulders, and be allowed to find itself before being assimilated into an existing universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/#730b6ac65b57 |title=Why Supergirl Shouldn't Join The Flash/Arrowverse |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=May 14, 2015 |website=[[Forbes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130114227/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the premiere of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ScreenRant's Alice Walker discussed how the series \"has hurt ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''\", noting that the latter required minimal setup when it was spun-off from the former and had an element of mystery surrounding its quality with \"a \"wait and see\" attitude\" from audiences, while ''Legends'' was instead met with much excitement long before its release leading to each piece of news concerning it being \"publicized and met with fanfare \u2013 to the detriment of the other shows involved.\" Walker felt that audiences knowing which characters would appear in ''Legends'', and how, took \"the thrill out of the story\" of the other series as such information spoiled some of their upcoming plot twists, including the resurrection of Sara Lance or the fact that Ray Palmer \"could never really pose a threat to Oliver [Queen] and Felicity [Smoak]'s relationship, or run Palmer Technologies long term, since it was widely known that he would be a huge part of ''Legends''.\" Additionally, the annual ''Arrow''/''The Flash'' crossover suffered from also trying to set up ''Legends'', which was \"too much to ask from the already crowded storylines and ended up feeling like an exercise in synchronicity, with producers planting more seeds than they could reap. The crossover event was no longer a fun way to contrast the two shows; it now had to serve the much larger purpose of setting up an entirely new world.\" Walker stated that the premiere of ''Legends'' \"means that ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' can finally stop dedicating so much time and plot to laying the groundwork for the spin-off, and start focusing on the fundamentals of their own shows again.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |title=How Legends Of Tomorrow Has Hurt Arrow & The Flash |last=Walker |first=Alice |date=January 20, 2016 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408004114/http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Elseworlds\" crossover teased the comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' would be adapted in the 2019 crossover, Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek stated, \"The Arrowverse is becoming the most intricate, risky live action superhero universe in history.

various interconnected [[television series]] primarily airing on [[The CW]] and [[web series]] airing on [[CW Seed]]. The series were developed by [[Greg Berlanti]], [[Marc Guggenheim]], [[Andrew Kreisberg]], [[Geoff Johns]], [[Ali Adler]], [[Phil Klemmer]], [[Salim Akil]] and [[Caroline Dries]], and based on characters appearing in publications by [[DC Comics]]. Set in a [[shared fictional universe|shared fictional multiverse]] much like the [[DC Universe]] and [[DC Multiverse]] in comic books, it was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters that span six live-action television series and two animated series.\n\nThe franchise began with ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', based on the character [[Green Arrow]], which debuted in October 2012. It was followed by ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' in 2014, and the animated web-series ''[[Vixen (web series)|Vixen]]'' in 2015. The franchise was further expanded in 2016, when in January of that year a new series titled ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' debuted, starring characters that originally appeared on both ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''. Later that year, the [[CBS]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', having already crossed-over with ''The Flash'', was moved to The CW for its second season, where it has remained since. A second animated web-series, ''[[Freedom Fighters: The Ray]]'', was released in 2017, which followed [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray Terrill / The Ray]], who would make a live-action appearance during that year's crossover event \"[[Crisis on Earth-X]]\".

''Supergirl'' already has that problem built-in with Superman, who it seems will not be a regular fixture on the show, and I'm sure there will be many excuses as to why he's too busy to help Supergirl fight her latest battle. Add in ''Arrow'', ''The Flash'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' mythology, and it's probably too much to juggle....I think ''Supergirl'' deserves to launch without ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' on its shoulders, and be allowed to find itself before being assimilated into an existing universe.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/#730b6ac65b57 |title=Why Supergirl Shouldn't Join The Flash/Arrowverse |last=Tassi |first=Paul |date=May 14, 2015 |website=[[Forbes]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130114227/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/05/14/why-supergirl-shouldnt-join-the-flasharrowverse/ |archive-date=January 30, 2016 |access-date=January 24, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith the premiere of ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ScreenRant's Alice Walker discussed how the series \"has hurt ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash''\", noting that the latter required minimal setup when it was spun-off from the former and had an element of mystery surrounding its quality with \"a \"wait and see\" attitude\" from audiences, while ''Legends'' was instead met with much excitement long before its release leading to each piece of news concerning it being \"publicized and met with fanfare \u2013 to the detriment of the other shows involved.\" Walker felt that audiences knowing which characters would appear in ''Legends'', and how, took \"the thrill out of the story\" of the other series as such information spoiled some of their upcoming plot twists, including the resurrection of Sara Lance or the fact that Ray Palmer \"could never really pose a threat to Oliver [Queen] and Felicity [Smoak]'s relationship, or run Palmer Technologies long term, since it was widely known that he would be a huge part of ''Legends''.\" Additionally, the annual ''Arrow''/''The Flash'' crossover suffered from also trying to set up ''Legends'', which was \"too much to ask from the already crowded storylines and ended up feeling like an exercise in synchronicity, with producers planting more seeds than they could reap. The crossover event was no longer a fun way to contrast the two shows; it now had to serve the much larger purpose of setting up an entirely new world.\" Walker stated that the premiere of ''Legends'' \"means that ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' can finally stop dedicating so much time and plot to laying the groundwork for the spin-off, and start focusing on the fundamentals of their own shows again.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |title=How Legends Of Tomorrow Has Hurt Arrow & The Flash |last=Walker |first=Alice |date=January 20, 2016 |website=ScreenRant |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408004114/http://screenrant.com/legends-tomorrow-arrow-flash-plots/ |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |access-date=January 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"Elseworlds\" crossover teased the comic ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' would be adapted in the 2019 crossover, Mike Cecchini of Den of Geek stated, \"The Arrowverse is becoming the most intricate, risky live action superhero universe in history.
