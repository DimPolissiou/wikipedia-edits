It appeared in the 1909 supplement to the ''[[Century Dictionary]],'' where it was described as a [[trade name]] and \"a '[[portmanteau]]-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar12whituoft#page/1256/mode/2up/search/spork|title=The Century dictionary and cyclopedia; a work of universal reference in all departments of knowledge with a new atlas of the world|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>   The word \"spork\" was later registered as a [[trademark]] in the US and the UK.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Spork.jpg|thumb|left|A lightweight Snow Peak brand [[titanium]] spork held by a hand]]\n[[File:Ice cream fork, Shreve & Company, Iris service, silver, 1903-1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.4|An ice cream fork from the early 20th century]]\n[[Image:spork.png|thumb|left|Drawing from a {{US-patent|D388,664|1998 spork design patent}}]]\n[[File:18-03-25-K\u00fcchenutensil-DSCF1431.jpg|thumb|Special sporks for salad]]\nIn the US, patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued {{US Patent|147,119}} on February 3, 1874.<ref>{{US-patent|147,119}}</ref> Other early patents predating the modern spork include {{US Patent|904,553}},<ref>{{US-patent|904,553}}</ref> for a \"cutting spoon\", granted on November 24, 1908 to Harry L. McCoy and {{US Patent | 1,044,869}},<ref>{{US-patent|1,044,869}}</ref> for a spoon with a tined edge, granted to Frank Emmenegger in November 1912. Many of these inventions predated the use of the term \"spork\". Given this significant prior art, the basic concept of combining aspects of a spoon and fork is well established; more modern patents have limited themselves to the specific implementation and appearance of the spork. These [[design patent]]s do not prevent anyone from designing and manufacturing a different version of a spork. Examples of modern US design patents for sporks include patent number D247,153 issued in February 1978<ref>{{US-patent|D247,153}}</ref> and patent D388,664 issued in January 1998.<ref>{{US-patent|D388,664}}</ref>\n\n==The word \"spork\"==\n{{Wiktionary|spork}}\nThe ''word'' \"spork\" [[neologism|originated]] in the early 20th century to describe such devices.

Sporks are used by fast food restaurants, schools, prisons, the military, backpackers and in [[airline meal]]s.\n\nThe word ''spork'' combines ''spoon'' and ''fork''. It appeared in the 1909 supplement to the ''[[Century Dictionary]],'' where it was described as a [[trade name]] and \"a '[[portmanteau]]-word' applied to a long, slender spoon having, at the end of the bowl, projections resembling the tines of a fork\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar12whituoft#page/1256/mode/2up/search/spork|title=The Century dictionary and cyclopedia; a work of universal reference in all departments of knowledge with a new atlas of the world|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-05-19}}</ref>   The word \"spork\" was later registered as a [[trademark]] in the US and the UK.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Spork.jpg|thumb|left|A lightweight Snow Peak brand [[titanium]] spork held by a hand]]\n[[File:Ice cream fork, Shreve & Company, Iris service, silver, 1903-1917.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.4|An ice cream fork from the early 20th century]]\n[[Image:spork.png|thumb|left|Drawing from a {{US-patent|D388,664|1998 spork design patent}}]]\n[[File:18-03-25-K\u00fcchenutensil-DSCF1431.jpg|thumb|Special sporks for salad]]\nIn the US, patents for sporks and proto-sporks have been issued. A combined spoon, fork, and knife closely resembling the modern spork was invented by Samuel W. Francis and issued {{US Patent|147,119}} on February 3, 1874.<ref>{{US-patent|147,119}}</ref> Other early patents predating the modern spork include {{US Patent|904,553}},<ref>{{US-patent|904,553}}</ref> for a \"cutting spoon\", granted on November 24, 1908 to Harry L. McCoy and {{US Patent | 1,044,869}},<ref>{{US-patent|1,044,869}}</ref> for a spoon with a tined edge, granted to Frank Emmenegger in November 1912. Many of these inventions predated the use of the term \"spork\". Given this significant prior art, the basic concept of combining aspects of a spoon and fork is well established; more modern patents have limited themselves to the specific implementation and appearance of the spork. These [[design patent]]s do not prevent anyone from designing and manufacturing a different version of a spork. Examples of modern US design patents for sporks include patent number D247,153 issued in February 1978<ref>{{US-patent|D247,153}}</ref> and patent D388,664 issued in January 1998.<ref>{{US-patent|D388,664}}</ref>\n\n==The word \"spork\"==\n{{Wiktionary|spork}}\nThe ''word'' \"spork\" [[neologism|originated]] in the early 20th century to describe such devices.

The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].\n\nThe company controls the American [[biotechnology]] company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2018 were 56.85 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,<ref name=\"FR18\" /> or approximately US$57 billion.

In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.\n\nIn 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>\n\nRoche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s.

The company headquarters are located in [[Basel]].\n\nThe company controls the American [[biotechnology]] company [[Genentech]], which is a wholly owned affiliate, and the Japanese biotechnology company [[Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.|Chugai Pharmaceuticals]], as well as the United States-based [[Ventana Medical Systems|Ventana]]. Roche's revenues during fiscal year 2018 were 56.85 billion [[Swiss franc]]s,<ref name=\"FR18\" /> or approximately US$57 billion.

In 1934, it became the first company to mass-produce synthetic [[vitamin C]], under the brand name [[Redoxon]]. In 1957 it introduced the class of [[tranquilizer]]s known as [[benzodiazepine]]s (with [[Diazepam|Valium]] and [[Flunitrazepam|Rohypnol]] being the best known members). It manufactures and sells several [[cancer]] drugs and is a leader in this field. In 1956, the first antidepressant, [[iproniazid]], was accidentally created during an experiment while synthesizing [[isoniazid]]. Originally, it had been intended to create a more efficient drug at combatting [[Tuberculosis]]. [[Iproniazid]], however, revealed to have its own benefits; some people felt it made them feel happier. It was withdrawn from the market in the early 1960s due to toxic side-effects.\n\nIn 1976, an accident at a chemical factory in [[Seveso]], Italy, owned by a subsidiary of Roche, caused a large [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] contamination; see [[Seveso disaster]]. In 1982, the United States arm of the company acquired Biomedical Reference Laboratories for US$163.5 million. That company dated from the late 1960s, and was located in [[Burlington, North Carolina]]. That year Hoffmann-La Roche then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington. By the early 1990s, Roche Biomedical became one of the largest clinical laboratory networks in the United States, with 20 major laboratories and US$600 million in sales.<ref name=\"fundingroche\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Roche-Biomedical-Laboratories-Inc-Company-History.html|title=Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc|publisher= FundingUniverse.com}}</ref>\n\nRoche has also produced various [[HIV test]]s and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. It bought the [[patent]]s for the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) technique in 1992. In 1995 the era of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|highly active anti-retroviral therapy]] (HAART) was initiated by the United States FDA's approval of Hoffman LaRoche's HIV protease inhibitor saquinavir. Within 2 years of its approval (and that of ritonavir 4 months later) annual deaths from AIDS in the United States fell from over 50,000 to approximately 18,000 <ref>{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = HIV Surveillance --- United States, 1981\u20142008 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6021a2.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 8 November 2013 }}</ref> On 28 April 1995 Hoffmann-La Roche sold Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. to National Health Laboratories Holdings Inc.
