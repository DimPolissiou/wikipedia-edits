The second is that the name comes from the Belarusian word \"\u043b\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0439\" meaning \"the best place to live in\".   The third theory for the name ''Lepel'' is that it derives from the Belarusian word \"\u043b\u044f\u043fi\u0446\u044c\" meaning \"well-developed pottery\".\n\n== History ==\nThe first known mention of Lepel dates back to 1439.  In the 15th century, the town belonged to the [[Lithuanian Grand Duchy]]. In 1439, thanks to efforts of a Roman Catholic priest, Kucharski, [[Sigismund Kestutaitis|Grand Lithuanian Duke Sigismund K\u0119stutaitis]]' son Michael gave Lepel to the [[Vitebsk]] Roman Catholic church.  [[Sigismund I the Old|King Sigismund I the Old]] subsequently confirmed the gift and in 1541 by approbation of pontiff, the townlands were given to the [[Vitebsk Cathedral]].\n\nAfter [[Polatsk]] was captured by the Russian army in 1563, the Vitebsk government was no longer able to protect its property from the attacks of the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].  The decision was made to donate Lepel to [[Sigismund II Augustus|King Sigismund II Augustus]] on the erroneous assumption that the king would return the gift by awarding the Vitebsk government with other property of the same value. Instead, the king gave the property by way of life tenure to Yury Zenovich, the mayor of [[Smolensk]]. After Yury Zenovich died, Sigismund gave the town to Michael Daragastaisky and it then came into the hands of [[Stefan Batory]].  Batory eventually returned the property to the Vitebsk government when [[Polatsk]] was liberated.[[File:Lepiel, ka\u015bcio\u0142 (13.08.2008).jpg|thumb|St. Casimir's Catholic Church in Lepel]]It remained difficult for the Vitebsk authorities to protect their holdings in Lepel and thus the decision was made in 1586 to sell the townlands to [[Lew Sapieha]], a leading politician. Sapieha eventually donated Lepel in 1609 to [[Bernardine order|Bernardine]] nuns in [[Vilnius]] (Wilno) who lived next to St. Michael's Church.\n\nAfter the annexation of Belarus to Russia in 1772, Lepel remained in Lithuania due to the border being traced by the river [[Daugava River|Dvina]].   After the second division of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1793, Lepel was annexed by Russia and in 1802 the town became the center of the region. The town suffered greatly in the 1812 [[French invasion of Russia]] due to the passing troops razing many buildings to the ground.  On 9 September 1852 Lepel was awarded its own coat of arms.  [[Jan Czeczot]] worked as an engineer on the [[Berezina Canal]] in Lepel between 1833 and 1839. In 1880, the population of Lepel consisted of 5,284 people, including 2,458 Jews, 2,281 Orthodox, and 536 Roman Catholics.\n\nBy 1913 Lepel had lost its strategic and economic importance and was a quiet regional town center.\n\nOn November 10, 1919 in the neighbourhood of Lepel there was a clash between the company of the 13th infantry regiment of the Polish Army sitting in an ambush and the Soviet troops advancing into the region. The fighting was successful for the Poles though their commanding officer, lieutenant Stanis\u0142aw Jache\u0107, was the only Polish victim of the clash. Heavy fighting between the Bolshevik troops and the Polish Army's 30th regiment of the Rifles of Kani\u00f3w of the XX brigade continued through November 1919 and the Polish-Soviet frontline was established there until spring 1920.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began. Lepiel was captured by the rapidly advancing German troops on 3 July. While the Lepel's Jewish population had once been as high as 3,379 (53.7%) in 1897,<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/lepel</ref> by 1941 this had dwindled to only 1,919, or 13.6 percent of the townspeople. The German occupation authorities created a ghetto and appointed a Jewish elder.  On February 28, 1942, almost all of the 1,000 residents remaining in the ghetto were shot <ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/lepel</ref> by an [[Einsatzgruppe]].

He was considered a prominent poet and playwright and proponent of [[Bohemianism]] during the first quarter of the twentieth century. His work was admired by writers as diverse as [[Jack London]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Sinclair Lewis]], but is largely neglected today.\n\n==Life and career==\nSterling was born in [[Sag Harbor, New York]], the eldest of nine children.  His father was Dr. George A. Sterling, a physician who determined to make a priest of one of his sons, and George was selected to attend, for three years, [[St. Charles College, Maryland|St. Charles College]] in [[Maryland]]. He was instructed in English by poet [[John B. Tabb]].  His mother Mary was a member of the Havens family, prominent in Sag Harbor and the [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Shelter Island]] area.  Her brother, [[Frank C. Havens]], Sterling's uncle, went to San Francisco in the late 19th century and established himself as a prominent lawyer and real estate developer.  Sterling eventually followed him to the West in 1890 and worked as a real estate broker in [[Oakland, California]].  With the publication of his small volume of poetry in 1903, ''The Testimony of the Sun and Other Poems'', he quickly became a hero among the East Bay literati and artists, some of whom included [[Joaquin Miller]], [[Jack London]], [[Xavier Martinez]], [[Harry Leon Wilson]], Perry H. Newberry, Henry Lafler, [[Gelett Burgess]], and [[James Hopper (writer)|James Hopper]].\n\n[[File:Portrait photograph of George Sterling.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of George Sterling taken by [[Arnold Genthe]] February 9, 1904<ref>''Dear Master: Letters of George Sterling to Ambrose Bierce, 1900\u20131912'', Roger K.

He was considered a prominent poet and playwright and proponent of [[Bohemianism]] during the first quarter of the twentieth century. His work was admired by writers as diverse as [[Jack London]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Sinclair Lewis]], but is largely neglected today.\n\n==Life and career==\nSterling was born in [[Sag Harbor, New York]], the eldest of nine children.  His father was Dr. George A. Sterling, a physician who determined to make a priest of one of his sons, and George was selected to attend, for three years, [[St. Charles College, Maryland|St. Charles College]] in [[Maryland]]. He was instructed in English by poet [[John B. Tabb]].  His mother Mary was a member of the Havens family, prominent in Sag Harbor and the [[Shelter Island (town), New York|Shelter Island]] area.  Her brother, [[Frank C. Havens]], Sterling's uncle, went to San Francisco in the late 19th century and established himself as a prominent lawyer and real estate developer.  Sterling eventually followed him to the West in 1890 and worked as a real estate broker in [[Oakland, California]].  With the publication of his small volume of poetry in 1903, ''The Testimony of the Sun and Other Poems'', he quickly became a hero among the East Bay literati and artists, some of whom included [[Joaquin Miller]], [[Jack London]], [[Xavier Martinez]], [[Harry Leon Wilson]], Perry H. Newberry, Henry Lafler, [[Gelett Burgess]], and [[James Hopper (writer)|James Hopper]].\n\n[[File:Portrait photograph of George Sterling.jpg|thumb|Portrait photograph of George Sterling taken by [[Arnold Genthe]] February 9, 1904<ref>''Dear Master: Letters of George Sterling to Ambrose Bierce, 1900\u20131912'', Roger K.

Of the means he employed to get a glimpse of that other world, I am not so sure.\" He observes that \"many before Sterling had used narcotics to this end;\" that \"George, a doctor's son, had always had access to whatever drugs he fancied;\" says that Sterling's wife said \"that George had purloined a great quantity of [[opium]] from his brother Wickham,\" and speaks of \"internal evidence in the poem\" in which \"Sterling writes his Fancy awakened with a 'brow caressed by poppybloom.'\" Despite all this, Noel makes a point of saying \"there is no direct evidence that Sterling used narcotics.\"\n\nSterling also wrote for children ''The Saga of the Pony Express''.\n\nDespite such famous mentors as Bierce and [[Ina Coolbrith]], and his long association with London, Sterling himself never became well known outside California.\n\nSterling's poetry is both visionary and mystical, but he also wrote ribald quatrains that were often unprintable and left unpublished. &nbsp; His style reflects the Romantic charm of such poets as [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], and he provided guidance and encouragement to the similarly-inclined Clark Ashton Smith at the beginning of Smith's own career.\n\nSterling carried a vial of [[cyanide poisoning|cyanide]] for many years. When asked about it he said, \"A prison becomes a home if you have the key\".<ref>The Documentary \"[http://www.google.com/search?q=gospel+according+to+philip+k.+dick The Gospel According to [[Philip K.

Kevin Starr wrote that \"When George Sterling's corpse was discovered in his room at the Bohemian Club... the golden age of San Francisco's bohemia had definitely come to a miserable end.\"\n\nSterling's most famous line was delivered to the city of San Francisco, \"the cool, grey city of love!\".<ref>[http://alangullette.com/lit/sterling/coolgrey.htm The Cool, Grey City of Love, by George Sterling<!-- bot-generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903110210/http://alangullette.com/lit/sterling/coolgrey.htm |date=September 3, 2007 }} at alangullette.com</ref>\n\n==Memorials==\n* Sterling Road in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] is named for George Sterling.\n* It is thought that Sterling Avenue in [[Alameda, California|Alameda]] is named for George Sterling.\n* A stone bench was dedicated to Sterling on June 25, 1926 at the crest of [[Hyde Street]] on [[Russian Hill]].

He also has history with Riley, because he was once in a relationship with her mother and had an altercation with her deadbeat father.

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal....

Trained as an [[Bomb disposal|EOD technician]] for the Army, Mac prefers to use non-lethal means to stop his enemies; he is never without his trusty [[Swiss Army knife]] and uses anything in his environment to his advantage. At the end of Season 2, Mac leaves the Phoenix due to his lack of trust in its leadership, but eventually returns when he realises how much his skillset is needed.\n* [[George Eads]] as [[List of MacGyver characters#Jack Dalton|Jack Dalton]] (seasons 1\u20133): Mac's partner in the field and a former [[Delta Force]] operator. Jack's history with Mac goes back to his days in the Army and unlike Mac, he is not afraid to use guns in the field. He also has history with Riley, because he was once in a relationship with her mother and had an altercation with her deadbeat father. While mostly easy-going and laid-back, Jack can get serious when the situation calls for it and often calls upon his special operations training to help the team get out of a tight spot.

He is initially a struggling film director possessing several artistic talents. His ability to create lifelike masks and facial prosthetics gets him hired at the Phoenix Foundation.

When Bozer trains to be an agent at the Operative Training Center, he falls for fellow recruit Leanne Martin.\n* [[Meredith Eaton]] as [[List of MacGyver characters#New main characters in the 2016 reboot|Matilda \"Matty\" Webber]] (season 1\u2013present<!--Do not remove this section, it is necessary to denote that she was not main from the beginning but episode counts are not allowed per [[MOS:TVCAST]]-->): Thornton's replacement as Director of Operations at Phoenix Foundation and Jack's ex-boss from the CIA.

response===\n''MacGyver'' has received generally negative reviews from television critics, with many comparing it poorly to the original and some praising and criticizing CBS for making it an updated show. ''Variety'' wrote: \"Lucas Till\u2019s performance as the title character misses the mark completely; even when MacGyver explains the contraptions he builds on the fly via voiceovers, Till\u2019s delivery is wooden and clunky. The writing doesn\u2019t help \u2014 the pilot script is full of silly plot short-cuts and painfully cheesy lines \u2014 but there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the new version of the character has very little appeal....

Although Thomas's elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas himself was not implicated, and on 2 May 1666, he became a member of [[Gray's Inn]], and was called to the bar on 16 June 1673.{{sfn |Lee |1897}}\n\n==Career==\nRymer's first appearance in print{{refn|A 1688 translation into English of [[William Bellenden]]'s ''Ciceronis Princeps'' (first published anonymously in Paris in 1608)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cicero's prince the reasons and counsels for settlement and good government of a kingdom, collected out of Cicero's works / by T.

He was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, [[lord of the manor]] of [[Brafferton, North Yorkshire|Brafferton]] in Yorkshire, described by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] as possessed of a good estate. The father was executed for his part in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] of 1663.

This may have been due to the financial problems his father was suffering at the time, or the fact that on 13 October 1663 his father was arrested, and executed the following year, for his involvement in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] to stage an uprising in Yorkshire against Charles II. Although Thomas's elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas himself was not implicated, and on 2 May 1666, he became a member of [[Gray's Inn]], and was called to the bar on 16 June 1673.{{sfn |Lee |1897}}\n\n==Career==\nRymer's first appearance in print{{refn|A 1688 translation into English of [[William Bellenden]]'s ''Ciceronis Princeps'' (first published anonymously in Paris in 1608)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cicero's prince the reasons and counsels for settlement and good government of a kingdom, collected out of Cicero's works / by T.
