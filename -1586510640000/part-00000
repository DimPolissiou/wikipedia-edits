He is interested in becoming a storyteller of mythological epics, but no one is interested in his work. He has a daughter Radha & son Banwari both of marriageable age. Radha is a school teacher & in relationship with a Gopal who comes from a well-to-do family. The only hurdle in their marriage is her father's inability to arrange enough funds for her marriage. After a long argument with her in-laws over the date, it is decided that the marriage cannot be postponed any further & has to happen on 21st of this month, hence the name of the film ekkees (21) tareekh (date).\n\nNow that the date is set, Girdhari has no choice but to arrange for the funds. He meets his relatives, friends & acquaintances but doesn't get any assistance. His friend Bulaki suggests that the only way is that he should marry off his son Banwari who has just completed his exams for IAS ( [[Indian Administrative Services|Indian Administrative Service]]) & has good chances of clearing the exam. Most people would pay a hefty dowry for such a prospect. However, due to the marriage deadline, Banwari has to do this before his results are out which is a tricky situation.  Banwari agrees to this as he wishes to see his sister happy. They meet a few prospects, but it something or the other is always amiss. Finally, Girdhari comes across a matrimonial ad & call Pankhuri's mother Indrani who live in Kolkatta. Indrani agrees to visit Mathura with her daughter. \n \nBanwari is smitten by Pankhuri & it seems that the relationship has good prospects. Indrani & Girdhari have a few drinks & then she reveals that Pankhuri is a widow & agrees to pay 25 Lakhs in dowry. Girdhari is taken aback as he would not want to marry his son to a widow which is considered as a bad omen. He nevertheless agrees due to looming pressure of Radha's marriage. It is decided that both weddings would take place at the same time.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, the Banwari's results are announced & he has cleared the IAS exams. Girdhari becomes greedy & hatches a plan. He asks a local muscleman Robdar to abduct his son for a few hours at the time of the wedding so that he would get along with the wedding of his daughter & then call-off the wedding of his son somehow. As fate would have happened Robdar has to kidnap Gopal he tries to fight off the kidnap attempt. Girdhari & Radha's father-in-law of visit the local police station for help, the police officer scoffs them off saying the guys must have run away with someone else & would return after some time. Girdhari asks Radha's father-in-law to go home & inform that police is taking some action so that there is some calm at home meanwhile, he meets Robdar.\n\nRobdar refuses to let off his son & son-in-law (as per their original agreement) because now is also is aware that his son has cleared the exam & intends to marry his daughter to Banwari. When Girdhari refuses, Robdar ties him up as well & sends his daughter to seduce Banwari. Next day secretary of local Politician visits Girdhari's home to wish Banwari on his success. When he is informed of the abduction he takes Girdhari's father to the politician who then calls the police officer who had earlier rejected his complaint. The police officer now gets in action & visit Robdar who is the usual suspect for kidnapping. When he comes to know that Banwari has cleared IAS exam, he threatens Robdar & offers Girdhari his daughter in marriage. Next day, the politician visits Robdar, he too threatens Girdhari to marry his niece with Banwari. Now with all the threats, Girdhari hatches a plan. He informs Robdar that Banwari has agreed to marry his daughter after 2 days of everyone convincing him. Now to take care of police officer & politician all he has to do is put his daughter in place of politician's niece as the face of the bride is covered by the bridal attire. Robdar agrees & sets everyone free. Girdhari then meets the police officer saying the same thing & gives him a letter which is part of his plan. The marriage is set & Radha takes each of the prospective brides inside her room on the pretext of dressing them with bridal attire & ties them up with Pankhuri's assistance. Eventually, Radha's marriage is done.\n\nEveryone smells something fishy & they discover that each of the prospective brides is tied up. Before any ruckus is created the police officer intervenes & reads out the letter which was earlier given to him by Girdhari where he has confessed to his crimes. Girdhari & Robdar are arrested for kidnapping & before leaving blesses Pankhuri & Banwari (consenting to their marriage). In prison, Girdhari finally realises his dream of storytelling & where the prisoners are listening to him ardently.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatvnews.com/entertainment/bollywood-here-s-how-sanjay-mishra-was-roped-in-for-ekkees-tareekh-shubh-muhurat-476185|title=Here\u2019s how Sanjay Mishra was roped in for Ekkees Tareekh Shubh Muhurat|first=Reshu|last=Manglik|date=26 October 2018|website=indiatvnews.com}}</ref>\n*[[Brijendra Kala]]\n*[[Mukesh Tiwari]]\n*[[Sitaram Panchal]]\n*[[Masaan|Bhagwan Tiwari]]\n*[[Kajal Jain]]\n*[[Dum Laga Ke Haisha|Chandrachoor Rai]]\n*[[Sui Dhaaga|Mahesh Sharma]]\n*[[Kamalika Banerjee]]\n*Meena Nathani\n*Banwari Lal Jhol\n*Anjanikumar Khanna\n*Riya Chanda\n*Bhavya Chaudhary\n*Harshit\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|7769346}}\n\n[[Category:2018 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Indian romantic thriller films]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s Hindi-language films]]\n[[Category:2010s romantic thriller films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Ekkees Tareekh Shubh Muhurat<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/movie-reviews/ekkees-tareekh-shubh-muhurat/movie-review/66467113.cms|title=Ekkees Tareekh Shubh Muhurat Movie Review {1.5/5}: Critic Review of Ekkees Tareekh Shubh Muhurat by Times of India|via=timesofindia.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n| image          = \n| alt            = \n| caption        = \n| director       = Pavan Kumar\n| producer       = Mukesh Jodhani<br>Rajesh Jodhani\n| writer         = Pavan Kumar\n| screenplay     = \n| story          = \n| starring       = [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]<br>[[Brijendra Kala]]\n| music          = [[Vickey Prasad]]\n| cinematography = Sudhir Chandra\n| editing        = Suraj Gunjal\n| studio         = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = 2 november 2018<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/2018/nov/01/ekkees-tareekh-shubh-muhurat-is-an-entertaining-film-with-a-message-director-pavan-kumar-chauhan-1892605.html|title=Ekkees Tareekh Shubh Muhurat is an entertaining film with a message: Director Pavan Kumar Chauhan|website=The New Indian Express}}</ref>\n| runtime        = 1 hours 40 minutes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/movie-masti/movie-review/ekkees-tareekh-shubh-muhurat-movie-review-in-hindi/moviereview/66478354.cms|title=\u092e\u0942\u0935\u0940 \u0930\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0942: \u0907\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0940\u0938 \u0924\u093e\u0930\u0940\u0916 \u0936\u0941\u092d \u092e\u0941\u0939\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0924|date=2 November 2018|website=https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n| country        = India\n| language       = Hindi\n}}\n\n'''''Ekkees Tareekh Shubh Muhurat''''' is directed by Pavan Kumar.

In 2019, more than 26 million passengers arrived or departed at Brussels Airport, making it the 24th [[List of the busiest airports in Europe|busiest airport in Europe]]. It is located in the municipality of [[Zaventem]] in the [[Flemish Brabant|Province of Flemish Brabant]] in the [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]]. It is home to around 260 companies, together directly employing 20,000 people and serves as the home base for [[Brussels Airlines]] and [[TUI fly Belgium]].\n\nThe company operating the airport is known as The Brussels Airport Company N.V./S.A.; before 19 October 2006, the name was BIAC (Brussels International Airport Company), which was created by Belgian law through a merger of BATC with the ground operations departments of the RLW/RVA. Since 2011, the airport has been owned by the [[Toronto]]-based [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] (39%), [[Macquarie Group]] (Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund I and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund III) (36%) and the [[Federal Government of Belgium|Belgian State]] (25%).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-assigns-PBaa1-rating-to-Brussels-Airport-Holding-SANVs-senior--PR_273301|title=Moody's assigns (P)Baa1 rating to Brussels Airport Holding SA/NV's senior secured debt; stable outlook|work=Moodys.com|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 March 2016 the airport's departures hall was severely damaged by [[2016 Brussels bombings|two terrorist bomb blasts]].

There the [[Luftwaffe]] established '''Fliegerhorst Melsbroek''' and constructed 3 [[runway]]s in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or \"Fliegerhorst Melsbroek\" in German). There is an [[urban legend]] that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it\u2013the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.\n\nAfter the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the [[Evere Airport|old civilian airport]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2450|m|abbr=on}} respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}}. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], the [[Prince Regent]], on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.\n\nIn 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] on 15 May 1955.\n\nIn 1956 a new {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}} runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to {{convert|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In April 1956 the [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the [[Expo 58|1958 World Fair]]. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the [[Belgian Air Component|Belgian Air Force]] ([[15th Air Transport Wing]]), and this is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both [[Zaventem Airport]] and [[Melsbroek Air Base]], the military airfield, share the same runways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|title=Brussels Explosion rocks Europe!|author=Robert Tom|work=Innovative Report|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165822/http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\n[[File:Boeing_707-329C,_Sabena_JP6848038.jpg|thumb|[[Sabena]] [[Boeing 707-300]] at Brussels Airport in 1966]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, Air Zaire AN0199454.jpg|thumb|[[Air Za\u00efre]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] at Brussels Airport at night in 1990]]\nDuring the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]] was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline [[Sabena]], a new pier was opened.\n\nIn 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by [[Airports Council International]]/[[International Air Transport Association]] (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] was opened on 12 December 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18.5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.<ref>Expatica: [http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/Record-number-of-passengers-at-Brussels-airport_48886.html Record numbers of passengers at Brussels Airport]</ref>\n\nSabena's demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow from which the airport only slowly recovered. The airport's future is threatened by disagreement between the governments of [[Flanders]] and the Brussels Capital Region concerning night-time air traffic routes.\n\nIn March 2009, the old mechanical [[Flight information display system]]s were replaced by electronic ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|title=Brussels Airport vervangt borden met vluchtinformatie|work=HLN|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110827/http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref> In September 2009, CEO Wilfried Van Assche resigned.

The terminal building consists of several levels. The [[Brussels National Airport railway station|railway station]] is located on \u22121, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3. Levels 2 and 3 are connected to the airport's two piers (A and B).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Plattegrond terminal|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014055/http://www.brusselsairport.be/nl/passngr/at_the_airport/airport_map/|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Pier A===\nPier A is the newest pier on Brussels Airport and was opened on 15 May 2002. This pier was destined to support flights from and to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all [[Brussels Airlines]] flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines' daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.\n\nUntil 26 March 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/connhome/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Introduction|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Pier A was connected to the main building via a {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check. This tunnel was replaced by the \"Connector\", a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe's largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.\n\n===Pier B===\nPier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the [[Baggage claim|baggage claim area]].\n\n===Planned===\n\n====Pier A West====\nPier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-[[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Brussels Airport lowers airport tariffs by 5.2% and invests over \u20ac550 million in its infrastructure|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221153852/http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|archivedate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Low-cost pier====\nJust as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] pier is currently on hold.

A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, [[Relay (shop)|Relay]] stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control \u2013and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Protestants]]), as well as a place for meditation for [[Humanism|humanists]]. The airport provides meeting facilities and can host congresses up to 600 participants, either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or in the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Brussels Airport Hotel.

[[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] operates a self-service [[Filling station|gas station]] near the exit of the airport complex.\n\nSeveral car rental services are located in the airport as well. [[Europcar]], [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]], [[Sixt]] and [[Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group|Thrifty]] all operate at Brussels Airport.

At least four trains per hour serve the most used link to [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels South Railway Station]], where international connections are offered by [[Eurostar]] (to London), [[Thalys]] (to [[Amsterdam]], [[Avignon]], [[Cologne]], [[Essen]], [[Lille]], [[Marseille]], Paris and [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]]), [[Intercity-Express|ICE]] (to [[Cologne]] and [[Frankfurt]]), and [[Eurocity]] (to [[Basel]], [[Bern]], [[Chur]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Z\u00fcrich]]).\n\nA direct train link with Leuven was opened on 12 December 2005. A direct link with [[Antwerp]] and [[Mechelen]] via the so-called [[Diabolo project|Diabolo]] line was opened for public service on 10 June 2012. The Diabolo project is a [[public-private partnership]].

There the [[Luftwaffe]] established '''Fliegerhorst Melsbroek''' and constructed 3 [[runway]]s in the shape of a triangle: runway 02/20, runway 07L/25R (both of which are still in use today) and runway 12/30. The airport buildings were constructed in the nearby municipality of Melsbroek and not of Zaventem, which is why the airfield was known to the locals as Melsbroek (in Dutch) (or \"Fliegerhorst Melsbroek\" in German). There is an [[urban legend]] that the site of the airport was chosen by the Germans after asking locals where to build it\u2013the Belgians then pointed to this location as it was often foggy.\n\nAfter the liberation on 3 September 1944, the German infrastructure at Melsbroek fell into the hands of the British. When the [[Evere Airport|old civilian airport]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]] became too small, the Belgian authorities decided to use the aerodrome at Melsbroek for the new national airport. By 1948, a new [[airport terminal|terminal]] building was constructed to replace the old wooden building. In the same year, the lengths of both runways 02/20 and 07L/25R were increased, to {{convert|1200|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2450|m|abbr=on}} respectively, whereas 12/30 remained at {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on}}. The civil aerodrome of Melsbroek was officially opened by [[Prince Charles, Count of Flanders]], the [[Prince Regent]], on 20 July 1948. From 1948 to 1956 many more buildings and facilities were erected, mostly on the Melsbroek side of the site.\n\nIn 1955, a railway line from Brussels city centre to the airport was constructed. The line was officially opened by [[Baudouin I of Belgium|King Baudouin]] on 15 May 1955.\n\nIn 1956 a new {{convert|2300|m|abbr=on}} runway was constructed, 07R/25L, which almost runs parallel with 07L/25R. The runway is still in use today and saw its length later increased to {{convert|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In April 1956 the [[Belgian federal government|Belgian government]] decided to build a new airport, using the same runways, but with the buildings located within the municipality of Zaventem. In April 1957, construction started of the new terminal, preparing the airport for the [[Expo 58|1958 World Fair]]. The grass runway 12/30 had to make way to allow for the new passenger terminal. This new airport was inaugurated 5 July 1958, almost just in time for the 1958 World Fair. The buildings on the Melsbroek side are still in use by the [[Belgian Air Component|Belgian Air Force]] ([[15th Air Transport Wing]]), and this is still known as Melsbroek airfield. Both [[Zaventem Airport]] and [[Melsbroek Air Base]], the military airfield, share the same runways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|title=Brussels Explosion rocks Europe!|author=Robert Tom|work=Innovative Report|access-date=22 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220165822/http://www.innovativereport.com/brussels-explosion/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Development since the 1960s===\n[[File:Boeing_707-329C,_Sabena_JP6848038.jpg|thumb|[[Sabena]] [[Boeing 707-300]] at Brussels Airport in 1966]]\n[[File:McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, Air Zaire AN0199454.jpg|thumb|[[Air Za\u00efre]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]] at Brussels Airport at night in 1990]]\nDuring the boom of commercial aviation in the 1960s and 1970s, several hangars were constructed. A new [[Container terminal|cargo terminal]] was constructed in 1976. In 1994, a brand new terminal was constructed adjacent to the old 1958 building. Two old piers were torn down and replaced by modern ones. In 2002, amidst the turmoil surrounding the demise of the national airline [[Sabena]], a new pier was opened.\n\nIn 2005, the airport was awarded Best Airport in Europe by [[Airports Council International]]/[[International Air Transport Association]] (ACI/IATA), based on a survey of over 100,000 passengers worldwide. Brussels Airport continued to appear in top airports lists as of 2012. A direct train link with [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]] was opened on 12 December 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the airport served 17.8 million passengers, an increase of 7% over 2006. The cargo volume in the same year amounted to 780,000 tonnes, an increase of 8.9% over 2006. In 2008, the airport served 18.5 million passengers, which was an increase of 3.7% over the previous year.<ref>Expatica: [http://www.expatica.com/be/news/local_news/Record-number-of-passengers-at-Brussels-airport_48886.html Record numbers of passengers at Brussels Airport]</ref>\n\nSabena's demise meant a sharp fall in passenger traffic, a blow from which the airport only slowly recovered. The airport's future is threatened by disagreement between the governments of [[Flanders]] and the Brussels Capital Region concerning night-time air traffic routes.\n\nIn March 2009, the old mechanical [[Flight information display system]]s were replaced by electronic ones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|title=Brussels Airport vervangt borden met vluchtinformatie|work=HLN|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110827/http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/782602/2009/03/20/Brussels-Airport-vervangt-borden-met-vluchtinformatie.dhtml|archivedate=11 June 2011}}</ref> In September 2009, CEO Wilfried Van Assche resigned.

The terminal building consists of several levels. The [[Brussels National Airport railway station|railway station]] is located on \u22121, buses and taxis arrive at 0, arrivals are located on level 2 and departures on level 3.

This pier was destined to support flights from and to the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries (A-gates). However, since 15 October 2008 all [[Brussels Airlines]] flights to African destinations are also handled at this pier. Therefore, border control was installed towards the end of the pier in order to create a new pier. As a result, gates A61-72 were renamed T61-72. Later, Brussels Airlines' daily flight to New York was also moved here from pier B.\n\nUntil 26 March 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/corporate/connector/connhome/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Introduction|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Pier A was connected to the main building via a {{convert|400|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} tunnel under the apron. Each pier used to have its own security zone, so transfer between the piers involved a security check. This tunnel was replaced by the \"Connector\", a new building that links both piers above ground and allows passengers to walk straight from the check-in desk to their gate in pier A or B, without changing floors. In the opposite direction, the building provides arriving passengers with a smooth and convenient passage to the baggage reclaim hall and the exit. Furthermore, border control has been relocated behind the 25-lane screening platform (Europe's largest) inside the Connector which means that changing planes no longer requires a security check.\n\n===Pier B===\nPier B is the oldest pier still in use at Brussels Airport and is only used for flights outside the [[Schengen Area]]. Pier B is connected immediately to the main departure hall and consists of two decks. The upper deck (level 3) is at the same level as the departure halls and is used for the departing passengers, whereas the lower deck (level 2) is used for arriving passengers and connects immediately to border control and the [[Baggage claim|baggage claim area]].\n\n===Planned===\n\n====Pier A West====\nPier A West is a planned expansion of Pier A, and is meant to relieve Pier B by also handling flights from non-[[Schengen Agreement|Schengen]] countries. Pier A West was due to open in 2016, but because of the slow passenger growth, Brussels Airport announced in July 2013 that the works would be delayed. However, in November 2015, Brussels Airport announced a major 550 million euro investment and pointed out that within this investment the extension of the pier is included.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Brussels Airport lowers airport tariffs by 5.2% and invests over \u20ac550 million in its infrastructure|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221153852/http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/mediaroom/news/66931/|archivedate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Low-cost pier====\nJust as is the case for Pier A West, the construction of a new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] pier is currently on hold. It will be built roughly where the old south pier used to be. At present, several low-cost airlines including [[Ryanair]] and [[Wizz Air]] fly to [[Charleroi Airport|Brussels-South Charleroi Airport]], {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} away from Brussels.<ref>[http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=1101&tid=101&site=1&lg=2 Shuttles Brussels&nbsp;\u2013 Charleroi Airport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012195240/http://www.charleroi-airport.com/doc.php?nd=1101&tid=101&site=1&lg=2 |date=12 October 2007 }}</ref> In autumn 2013, low-cost carrier [[Pegasus Airlines]] announced it would end its flights between Brussels Airport and [[Turkey]]. The service between Brussels and [[Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en International Airport|Istanbul\u2013Sabiha G\u00f6k\u00e7en]] would relocate to Brussels-South Charleroi Airport. However, [[Turkish Airlines]] announced on 26 November 2013 it would offer one daily flight on the same route, starting one month after Pegasus terminated its operations at the airport.<ref name=\"airlineroute.net\">{{cite web|url=http://airlineroute.net/2013/11/26/tk-brutxl-s14/|title=Turkish Airlines Adds Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen \u2013 Brussels / Berlin in S14}}</ref> One day later, Ryanair announced the opening of a second Belgian base at Brussels Airport, giving a boost to low-cost traffic at Brussels Airport. Ryanair announced on 27 November 10 new routes from Brussels Airport,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/ryanair-announces-brussels-zaventem-base-from-feb-2014|title=Welcome to Ryanair!|work=Ryanair.com}}</ref> although Brussels-South Charleroi Airport will remain the low-cost carrier's primary Belgian base.\n\n===Services===\nShops, bars and restaurants are scattered throughout the building. A few facilities are located in the departure area. These are mostly convenience stores and small shops such as the airport shop, a pharmacy, [[Relay (shop)|Relay]] stores and a coffee shop. But most of the facilities can only be accessed after Security control \u2013and are tax free. Several brands and chains have a branch in both piers, however several only operate in pier A. The airport also features places of worship (for [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], [[Jews]], [[Muslims]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Protestants]]), as well as a place for meditation for [[Humanism|humanists]]. The airport provides meeting facilities and can host congresses up to 600 participants, either in the Regus Skyport Meeting Center or in the [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] Brussels Airport Hotel. The latter is the only hotel located on the airport grounds, opposite the terminal. Shuttle services are provided to 14 nearby hotels.\n\nAll passengers now have unlimited free Wi-Fi access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/facilities/freewifi/|title=Brussels Airport Website:  Unlimited free Wi-Fi|website=www.brusselsairport.be|access-date=2016-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsairport.be/en/passngr/services/internet_telephony/|title=Brussels Airport Website: Internet & Telephony}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/BrusselsAirport/status/951486523899371520|title=Brussels Airport on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThere is a small smoking room next to gate A67 in the transfer section of pier A.\n\n===Other facilities===\nSeveral airlines have or had its head offices at the grounds of Brussels Airport.

Total aid was $943 million in 2006, which was 4% of [[gross national income]].<ref>http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2009/1/kenya-aid-mwega/01_kenya_aid_mwega.pdf</ref> These investments come from Russia, China, the developed Western countries and Japan. Kenya hosts a large number of foreign multinational companies, as well as international organizations such as [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and many other non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.italafricacentrale.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=40&Itemid=99&lang=en|title=Kenya Economy|last=Mariarosaria|website=italafricacentrale.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref> China's involvement has been increasing, while that of Western countries such as the United Kingdom has fallen significantly. Investments from multilateral agencies, particularly the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Development Fund]], have increased. The most active investors currently are the [[Africa-China Relations|Chinese]].\n\nKenya is active within regional trade blocs such as the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA) and the [[East African Community]] (EAC), a partnership of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]. The aim of the EAC is to create a common market of the three states modelled on the [[European Union]].<ref name=cp/> Among the early steps toward integration is the customs union which has eliminated duties on goods and non-tariff trade barriers among the members.\n\n=== Exports ===\nKenya's chief exports are horticultural products and tea. In 2005, the combined value of these commodities was US$1,150 million, about 10 times the value of Kenya's third most valuable export, coffee. Kenya's other significant exports are petroleum products, sold to near neighbours, fish, cement, pyrethrum, and sisal. The leading imports are crude petroleum, chemicals, manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment. Africa is Kenya's largest export market, followed by the European Union.<ref name=cp/>\n\nThe major destinations for exports are Uganda, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Major suppliers are China, India, [[United Arab Emirates]], Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. Kenya's main exports to the United States are garments traded under the terms of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Despite AGOA, Kenya's apparel industry is struggling to hold its ground against Asian competition and runs a trade deficit with the United States. Many of Kenya's problems relating to the export of goods are believed by economists to be caused by the fact that Kenya's exports are inexpensive items that do not bring substantial amounts of money into the country.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya is the dominant trade partner for Uganda (12.3% exports, 15.6% imports) and [[Rwanda]] (30.5% exports, 17.3% imports).<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ug.html Uganda country profile, CIA World Factbook</ref><ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rw.html Rwanda country profile, CIA World Fact book</ref>\n\n=== Balance of trade ===\nKenya typically has a substantial trade deficit. The trade balance fluctuates widely because Kenya's main exports are primary commodities subject to the effects of both world prices and weather. In 2005 Kenya's income from exports was about US$3.2 billion. The payment for imports was about US$5.7B, yielding a trade deficit of about US$2.5B.<ref name=cp/>\n\n=== Foreign investment policies ===\nKenyan policies on foreign investment generally have been favourable since independence, with occasional tightening of restrictions to promote the africanisation of enterprises. Foreign investors have been guaranteed ownership and the right to remit [[dividend]]s, [[royalties]], and capital. In the 1970s, the government disallowed foreign investment unless there was also some government participation in the ownership of an enterprise.<ref name=cp/>\n\nDespite these restrictions, between 60% and 70% of industry is still owned from abroad. A significant portion of this can be traced to fraudulent asset transfers by British colonialists during the transition to independence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wMyADAAAQBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=fraudulent+asset+transfers+by+British+colonialists+kenya&source=bl&ots=AONwjSab-Z&sig=ACfU3U1GTWnPJaWxp1huS2OXOoKffG64Fg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7wrLTrrjnAhXFbc0KHVsCC6gQ6AEwAHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=fraudulent%20asset%20transfers%20by%20British%20colonialists%20kenya&f=false|title=DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS : A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE|last=MUKHERJEE|first=APARAJITA|last2=CHAKRABARTI|first2=SAUMYA|date=2016-05-16|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

However, Kenyan has had more economic success and more success raising its own quality of life than many of its neighbours in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Industries==\n\n===Agriculture===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Kenya}}\n{{See also|Coffee industry of Kenya|Tea Production in Kenya}}\n[[File:Worker with Summer Flowers.jpg|thumb|left|Flower production]]\n[[File:Kenya-Tealand-Near-Kericho-2012.JPG|thumb|right|Tea farm, [[Kericho County]]]]\nThe agricultural sector continues to dominate Kenya's economy, although only 15% of Kenya's total land area has sufficient [[fertility]] and rainfall to be farmed, and only 7 or 8% can be classified as first-class land. In 2006, almost 75% of working Kenyans made their living on the land, compared with 80% in 1980.<ref name=cp/> About one-half of total agricultural output is non-marketed subsistence production. Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector. In 2005 agriculture, including [[forestry]] and fishing, accounted for about 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports. The principal cash crops are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee; horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the most valuable of all of Kenya's exports. In 2005 horticulture accounted for 23% and tea for 22% of total export earnings. Coffee has declined in importance with depressed world prices, accounting for just 5% of export receipts in 2005. The production of major food staples such as [[Maize|corn]] is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations. Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid\u2014for example, in 2004 aid was needed for 1.8 million people\u23afbecause of Kenya's intermittent [[droughts]]. However, the expansion of credit to the agricultural sector has enabled farmers to better deal with the large risk of agriculture based on rainfall and the dramatic fluctuations of the prices of agricultural products.<ref name=cp/>\n\nTea, coffee, [[sisal]], [[pyrethrum]], corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. [[Coconuts]], [[pineapples]], [[cashew nuts]], cotton, [[sugarcane]], [[sisal]], and [[Maize|corn]] are grown in the lower-lying areas.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Forestry and fishing===\nResource degradation has reduced output from forestry. In 2004 [[Wood production|roundwood]] removals came to 22,162,000 cubic meters. Fisheries are of local importance around [[Lake Victoria]] and have potential on [[Lake Turkana]]. Kenya's total catch reported in 2004 was 128,000 metric tons. However, output from fishing has been declining because of ecological disruption. Pollution, [[overfishing]], and the use of unauthorised fishing equipment have led to falling catches and have endangered local fish species.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Mining and minerals===\n[[File:Soda train, Magadi, Kenya.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Soda Ash]] train, '''[[Lake Magadi]]''', [[Kajiado County]]]]\nKenya has no significant mineral endowment. The mining and quarrying sector makes a negligible contribution to the economy, accounting for less than 1% of GDP. The majority of this is contributed by the [[soda ash]] operation at [[Lake Magadi]] in south-central Kenya. Thanks largely to rising soda ash output, Kenya's mineral production in 2005 reached more than 1 million tons. One of Kenya's largest foreign-investment projects in recent years is the planned expansion of Magadi Soda. Apart from soda ash, the chief minerals produced are [[limestone]], gold, salt, large quantities of [[niobium]], [[fluorspar]], and [[fossil fuel]].<ref name=cp/>\n\nAll unextracted minerals are government property, under the Mining Act. The Department of Mines and Geology, under the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, controls exploration and exploitation of minerals.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\nAlthough Kenya is the most industrially developed country in East Africa, manufacturing still accounts for only 14% of GDP. This represents only a slight increase since independence. The rapid expansion of the sector immediately after independence stagnated in the 1980s, hampered by shortages in [[hydroelectric power]], high energy costs, dilapidated [[transport infrastructure]], and the dumping of cheap imports. However, due to urbanisation, the industry and manufacturing sectors have become increasingly important to the Kenyan economy, and this has been reflected by an increasing GDP per capita. Industrial activity, concentrated around the three largest urban centres, [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Kisumu]], is dominated by food-processing industries such as grain milling, beer production, and sugarcane crushing, and the fabrication of consumer goods, e.g., vehicles from kits. Kenya also has an [[oil refinery]] that processes imported crude petroleum into petroleum products, mainly for the domestic market. In addition, a substantial and expanding [[informal sector]] engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya's inclusion among the beneficiaries of the US Government's African Growth and Opportunity Act ([[AGOA]]) gave a boost to manufacturing. Since AGOA took effect in 2000, Kenya's clothing sales to the United States increased from US$44 million to US$270M in 2006. Other initiatives to strengthen manufacturing include favourable tax measures, including the removal of duty on capital equipment and other raw materials.<ref name=cp/>\n\n=== Energy===\n{{Further|Energy in Kenya}}\n\nThe largest segment of Kenya's electricity supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]], as well as the [[Turkwel Gorge Dam]] in the west. A petroleum-fired plant on the coast, geothermal facilities at [[Olkaria]] (near Nairobi), and electricity imported from [[Uganda]] make up the balance. Kenya's installed capacity stood at 1,142 [[megawatts]] a year between 2001 and 2003. The state-owned [[Kenya Electricity Generating Company]] (KenGen), established in 1997 under the name Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while the [[Kenya Power and Lighting Company]] (KPLC)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.plc.co.ke/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106170811/http://plc.co.ke/ |archive-date=6 November 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> handles transmission and distribution. Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow. In 1997 and 2000, for example, drought prompted severe power rationing, with economically damaging 12-hour [[Rolling blackout|blackouts]]. Frequent outages and high cost of power remain serious obstacles to economic activity. Tax and other concessions are planned to encourage investment in hydroelectricity and in [[geothermal energy]], in which Kenya is a pioneer. The government plans to open two new power stations in 2008, Sondu Miriu (hydroelectric) and Olkaria IV (geothermal), but power demand growth is strong, and demand is still expected to outpace supply during periods of drought.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya currently imports all crude petroleum requirements, and petroleum accounts for 20% to 25% of the national import bill. [[Hydrocarbon]] reserves were recently found in Kenya's semi-arid northern region of [[Turkana County|Turkana]] after several decades of intermittent exploration. Offshore prospecting also continues. [[Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited|Kenya Petroleum Refineries]], a 50:50 joint venture between the government and several major oil corporations, operates the country's sole oil refinery in [[Mombasa]]. The refinery's production is transported via Kenya's Mombasa\u2013Nairobi pipeline.<ref name=\"cp\" /> However, the refinery is currently non-operational.{{When|date=September 2019}} In 2004, oil consumption was estimated at {{convert|55000|oilbbl}} a day.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Kenya}}\n[[File:Lady tour guide.jpg|thumb|left|Guided tours.]]\n[[File:WaterLovers Beach Resort.jpg|thumb|WaterLovers Beach Resort, [[Diani Beach]].]]\nKenya's services sector, which contributes about 63% of GDP, is dominated by tourism. The tourism sector exhibited steady growth after independence and by the late 1980s had become the country's principal source of foreign exchange. In the late 1990s, a terrorism-related downturn in tourism followed the 1998 [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombing of the U.S Embassy in Nairobi]] and subsequent negative travel advisories from Western governments. The government of Kenya and tourism industry organisations have taken steps to address security issues and to reverse negative publicity, including establishing a tourist police and launching marketing campaigns in key tourist origin markets.<ref name=\"cp\" />\n\nTourists are attracted to the coastal [[beaches]] and the [[game reserve]]s, notably the expansive [[Tsavo East National Park]] and [[Tsavo West National Park]] (20,808 square kilometres) in the southeast. The majority of tourists are from Germany and the United Kingdom.  In 2006 tourism generated US$803 million, up from US$699 million the previous year.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya has also contributed to boosting tourism in other countries; the Nairobi-headquartered [[Serena Hotel]] is the most consistently high-rated hotel in [[Pakistan]].\n\n===Financial services===\nKenya is East Africa's hub for financial services. The [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE) is ranked 4th in Africa in terms of market capitalisation.\n\nThe Kenya banking system is supervised by the [[Central Bank of Kenya]]. As of late July 2004, the system consisted of 43 commercial banks (down from 48 in 2001), several [[non-bank financial institution]]s, including mortgage companies, four savings and loan associations, and many foreign-exchange bureaus. Two of the four largest banks, the [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] and the [[National Bank of Kenya]], are partially government-owned, and the others, [[Barclays]] Bank and [[Standard Chartered]], are majority foreign-owned. Most of the smaller banks are family-owned and -operated.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Labour==\nIn 2006, Kenya's labour force was estimated to include about 12 million workers, almost 75% in agriculture. The number employed outside small-scale agriculture and pastoralism was about 6 million. In 2004, about 15% of the labour force was officially classified as unemployed. Other estimates place Kenya's unemployment much higher, in some estimates up to 40%. In recent years, Kenya's labour force has shifted from the countryside to the cities, such as Nairobi, as Kenya becomes increasingly urbanised.<ref name=cp/>\n\nThe labour force participation rate in Kenya has been constant from 1997 to 2010 for both women and men. In 1997, 65% of women were employed in some type of labour and 76% of men were employed.<ref name=\"world bank\">{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?page=2|title=Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> In 2005, 60% of women and 70% of men were in the labour force, increasing slightly to 61% of women and 72% of men in 2010.<ref name=\"world bank\"/>\n\n===Family farm labour===\nIn the past 20 years, Kenyans have moved away from family farming towards jobs that pay wages or to start small businesses outside of agriculture.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\">[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/257994-1335471959878/kenya-economic-update-december-2012.pdf Kenya Economic Update: Kenya at work: Energizing the economy and creating jobs.] World Bank.

The informal sector contributes economic activity equal to 35% of the total GDP in Kenya, provides an informal finance structure in the shape of the [[rotating savings and credit association]]s (ROSCAs), and provides an income for those with lower socioeconomic status.<ref name=\":32\"/>\n\nThe drawbacks of the informal economy are that it promotes smuggling and tax evasion, and lacks social protection. Most members of the informal sector have low educational attainment but are responsible for developing all of their own skilled labour through apprenticeships. Many choose to enter the informal economy due to the lack of fees, shorter training sessions, and the availability of practical content that is largely absent from formal education. The rising cost of education and lack of guarantees of future employment have caused many workers to transfer to informal apprenticeships.<ref name=\":2\">Barasa, Fred Simiyu, and Eleanor SM Kaabwe. \"Fallacies in policy and strategies of skills training for the informal sector: evidence from the jua kali sector in Kenya.\" ''Journal of education and work'' 14.3 (2001): 329-353.</ref>\n\n==== The impact of customary law on the informal economy ====\n[[Customary law]] has some adverse impacts on women in the informal sector.<ref name=\":112\">Ellis, Amanda.

The agricultural sector employs nearly 75% of the country's 38 million people. Half of the sector's output remains [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] production.<ref name=\"cp\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Kenya.pdf Kenya country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (June 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nKenya's economic performance has been hampered by numerous factors: heavy dependence on a few agricultural exports that are vulnerable to world price fluctuations, population growth that has outstripped economic growth, prolonged drought that has necessitated power rationing, deteriorating infrastructure, and extreme disparities of wealth that have limited the opportunities of most to develop their skills and knowledge. Poor [[governance]] and [[Corruption in Kenya|corruption]] also have had a negative impact on growth, making it expensive to do business in Kenya. Increased levels of insecurity brought on from [[terrorism]] has become one of the largest impediments to sustainable growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000165929/insecurity-holding-back-kenya-s-growth|title=Insecurity holding back Kenya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth|last=Sunday|first=Frankline|website=The Standard|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> According to [[Transparency International]], Kenya ranks among the world's six most corrupt countries.

Investments from multilateral agencies, particularly the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Development Fund]], have increased. The most active investors currently are the [[Africa-China Relations|Chinese]].\n\nKenya is active within regional trade blocs such as the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA) and the [[East African Community]] (EAC), a partnership of [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]. The aim of the EAC is to create a common market of the three states modelled on the [[European Union]].<ref name=cp/> Among the early steps toward integration is the customs union which has eliminated duties on goods and non-tariff trade barriers among the members.\n\n=== Exports ===\nKenya's chief exports are horticultural products and tea. In 2005, the combined value of these commodities was US$1,150 million, about 10 times the value of Kenya's third most valuable export, coffee. Kenya's other significant exports are petroleum products, sold to near neighbours, fish, cement, pyrethrum, and sisal. The leading imports are crude petroleum, chemicals, manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment. Africa is Kenya's largest export market, followed by the European Union.<ref name=cp/>\n\nThe major destinations for exports are Uganda, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Major suppliers are China, India, [[United Arab Emirates]], Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. Kenya's main exports to the United States are garments traded under the terms of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Despite AGOA, Kenya's apparel industry is struggling to hold its ground against Asian competition and runs a trade deficit with the United States. Many of Kenya's problems relating to the export of goods are believed by economists to be caused by the fact that Kenya's exports are inexpensive items that do not bring substantial amounts of money into the country.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya is the dominant trade partner for Uganda (12.3% exports, 15.6% imports) and [[Rwanda]] (30.5% exports, 17.3% imports).<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ug.html Uganda country profile, CIA World Factbook)</ref><ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rw.html Rwanda country profile, CIA World Fact book</ref>\n\n=== Balance of trade ===\nKenya typically has a substantial trade deficit. The trade balance fluctuates widely because Kenya's main exports are primary commodities subject to the effects of both world prices and weather. In 2005 Kenya's income from exports was about US$3.2 billion. The payment for imports was about US$5.7B, yielding a trade deficit of about US$2.5B.<ref name=cp/>\n\n=== Foreign investment policies ===\nKenyan policies on foreign investment generally have been favourable since independence, with occasional tightening of restrictions to promote the africanisation of enterprises. Foreign investors have been guaranteed ownership and the right to remit [[dividend]]s, [[royalties]], and capital. In the 1970s, the government disallowed foreign investment unless there was also some government participation in the ownership of an enterprise.<ref name=cp/>\n\nDespite these restrictions, between 60% and 70% of industry is still owned from abroad. A significant portion of this can be traced to fraudulent asset transfers by British colonialists during the transition to independence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wMyADAAAQBAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=fraudulent+asset+transfers+by+British+colonialists+kenya&source=bl&ots=AONwjSab-Z&sig=ACfU3U1GTWnPJaWxp1huS2OXOoKffG64Fg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj7wrLTrrjnAhXFbc0KHVsCC6gQ6AEwAHoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=fraudulent%20asset%20transfers%20by%20British%20colonialists%20kenya&f=false|title=DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS : A CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE|last=MUKHERJEE|first=APARAJITA|last2=CHAKRABARTI|first2=SAUMYA|date=2016-05-16|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

In 2006, almost 75% of working Kenyans made their living on the land, compared with 80% in 1980.<ref name=cp/> About one-half of total agricultural output is non-marketed subsistence production. Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector. In 2005 agriculture, including [[forestry]] and fishing, accounted for about 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports. The principal cash crops are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee; horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the most valuable of all of Kenya's exports. In 2005 horticulture accounted for 23% and tea for 22% of total export earnings. Coffee has declined in importance with depressed world prices, accounting for just 5% of export receipts in 2005. The production of major food staples such as [[Maize|corn]] is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations. Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid\u2014for example, in 2004 aid was needed for 1.8 million people\u23afbecause of Kenya's intermittent [[droughts]]. However, the expansion of credit to the agricultural sector has enabled farmers to better deal with the large risk of agriculture based on rainfall and the dramatic fluctuations of the prices of agricultural products.<ref name=cp/>\n\nTea, coffee, [[sisal]], [[pyrethrum]], corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa. Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. [[Coconuts]], [[pineapples]], [[cashew nuts]], cotton, [[sugarcane]], [[sisal]], and [[Maize|corn]] are grown in the lower-lying areas.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Forestry and fishing===\nResource degradation has reduced output from forestry. In 2004 [[Wood production|roundwood]] removals came to 22,162,000 cubic meters. Fisheries are of local importance around [[Lake Victoria]] and have potential on [[Lake Turkana]]. Kenya's total catch reported in 2004 was 128,000 metric tons. However, output from fishing has been declining because of ecological disruption. Pollution, [[overfishing]], and the use of unauthorised fishing equipment have led to falling catches and have endangered local fish species.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Mining and minerals===\n[[File:Soda train, Magadi, Kenya.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Soda Ash]] train, '''[[Lake Magadi]]''', [[Kajiado County]]]]\nKenya has no significant mineral endowment. The mining and quarrying sector makes a negligible contribution to the economy, accounting for less than 1% of GDP. The majority of this is contributed by the [[soda ash]] operation at [[Lake Magadi]] in south-central Kenya. Thanks largely to rising soda ash output, Kenya's mineral production in 2005 reached more than 1 million tons. One of Kenya's largest foreign-investment projects in recent years is the planned expansion of Magadi Soda. Apart from soda ash, the chief minerals produced are [[limestone]], gold, salt, large quantities of [[niobium]], [[fluorspar]], and [[fossil fuel]].<ref name=cp/>\n\nAll unextracted minerals are government property, under the Mining Act. The Department of Mines and Geology, under the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, controls exploration and exploitation of minerals.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\nAlthough Kenya is the most industrially developed country in East Africa, manufacturing still accounts for only 14% of GDP. This represents only a slight increase since independence. The rapid expansion of the sector immediately after independence stagnated in the 1980s, hampered by shortages in [[hydroelectric power]], high energy costs, dilapidated [[transport infrastructure]], and the dumping of cheap imports. However, due to urbanisation, the industry and manufacturing sectors have become increasingly important to the Kenyan economy, and this has been reflected by an increasing GDP per capita. Industrial activity, concentrated around the three largest urban centres, [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Kisumu]], is dominated by food-processing industries such as grain milling, beer production, and sugarcane crushing, and the fabrication of consumer goods, e.g., vehicles from kits. Kenya also has an [[oil refinery]] that processes imported crude petroleum into petroleum products, mainly for the domestic market. In addition, a substantial and expanding [[informal sector]] engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, motor-vehicle parts, and farm implements.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya's inclusion among the beneficiaries of the US Government's African Growth and Opportunity Act ([[AGOA]]) gave a boost to manufacturing. Since AGOA took effect in 2000, Kenya's clothing sales to the United States increased from US$44 million to US$270M in 2006. Other initiatives to strengthen manufacturing include favourable tax measures, including the removal of duty on capital equipment and other raw materials.<ref name=cp/>\n\n=== Energy===\n{{Further|Energy in Kenya}}\n\nThe largest segment of Kenya's electricity supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]], as well as the [[Turkwel Gorge Dam]] in the west. A petroleum-fired plant on the coast, geothermal facilities at [[Olkaria]] (near Nairobi), and electricity imported from [[Uganda]] make up the balance. Kenya's installed capacity stood at 1,142 [[megawatts]] a year between 2001 and 2003. The state-owned [[Kenya Electricity Generating Company]] (KenGen), established in 1997 under the name Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while the [[Kenya Power and Lighting Company]] (KPLC)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.plc.co.ke/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106170811/http://plc.co.ke/ |archive-date=6 November 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> handles transmission and distribution. Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow. In 1997 and 2000, for example, drought prompted severe power rationing, with economically damaging 12-hour [[Rolling blackout|blackouts]]. Frequent outages and high cost of power remain serious obstacles to economic activity. Tax and other concessions are planned to encourage investment in hydroelectricity and in [[geothermal energy]], in which Kenya is a pioneer. The government plans to open two new power stations in 2008, Sondu Miriu (hydroelectric) and Olkaria IV (geothermal), but power demand growth is strong, and demand is still expected to outpace supply during periods of drought.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya currently imports all crude petroleum requirements, and petroleum accounts for 20% to 25% of the national import bill. [[Hydrocarbon]] reserves were recently found in Kenya's semi-arid northern region of [[Turkana County|Turkana]] after several decades of intermittent exploration. Offshore prospecting also continues. [[Kenya Petroleum Refineries Limited|Kenya Petroleum Refineries]], a 50:50 joint venture between the government and several major oil corporations, operates the country's sole oil refinery in [[Mombasa]]. The refinery's production is transported via Kenya's Mombasa\u2013Nairobi pipeline.<ref name=\"cp\" /> However, the refinery is currently non-operational.{{When|date=September 2019}} In 2004, oil consumption was estimated at {{convert|55000|oilbbl}} a day.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Kenya}}\n[[File:Lady tour guide.jpg|thumb|left|Guided tours.]]\n[[File:WaterLovers Beach Resort.jpg|thumb|WaterLovers Beach Resort, [[Diani Beach]].]]\nKenya's services sector, which contributes about 63% of GDP, is dominated by tourism. The tourism sector exhibited steady growth after independence and by the late 1980s had become the country's principal source of foreign exchange. In the late 1990s, a terrorism-related downturn in tourism followed the 1998 [[1998 United States embassy bombings|bombing of the U.S Embassy in Nairobi]] and subsequent negative travel advisories from Western governments. The government of Kenya and tourism industry organisations have taken steps to address security issues and to reverse negative publicity, including establishing a tourist police and launching marketing campaigns in key tourist origin markets.<ref name=\"cp\" />\n\nTourists are attracted to the coastal [[beaches]] and the [[game reserve]]s, notably the expansive [[Tsavo East National Park]] and [[Tsavo West National Park]] (20,808 square kilometres) in the southeast. The majority of tourists are from Germany and the United Kingdom.  In 2006 tourism generated US$803 million, up from US$699 million the previous year.<ref name=cp/>\n\nKenya has also contributed to boosting tourism in other countries; the Nairobi-headquartered [[Serena Hotel]] is the most consistently high-rated hotel in [[Pakistan]].\n\n===Financial services===\nKenya is East Africa's hub for financial services. The [[Nairobi Stock Exchange]] (NSE) is ranked 4th in Africa in terms of market capitalisation.\n\nThe Kenya banking system is supervised by the [[Central Bank of Kenya]]. As of late July 2004, the system consisted of 43 commercial banks (down from 48 in 2001), several [[non-bank financial institution]]s, including mortgage companies, four savings and loan associations, and many foreign-exchange bureaus. Two of the four largest banks, the [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] and the [[National Bank of Kenya]], are partially government-owned, and the others, [[Barclays]] Bank and [[Standard Chartered]], are majority foreign-owned. Most of the smaller banks are family-owned and -operated.<ref name=cp/>\n\n==Labour==\nIn 2006, Kenya's labour force was estimated to include about 12 million workers, almost 75% in agriculture. The number employed outside small-scale agriculture and pastoralism was about 6 million. In 2004, about 15% of the labour force was officially classified as unemployed. Other estimates place Kenya's unemployment much higher, in some estimates up to 40%. In recent years, Kenya's labour force has shifted from the countryside to the cities, such as Nairobi, as Kenya becomes increasingly urbanised.<ref name=cp/>\n\nThe labour force participation rate in Kenya has been constant from 1997 to 2010 for both women and men. In 1997, 65% of women were employed in some type of labour and 76% of men were employed.<ref name=\"world bank\">{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?page=2|title=Labor force participation rate, female (% of female population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)|publisher=|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> In 2005, 60% of women and 70% of men were in the labour force, increasing slightly to 61% of women and 72% of men in 2010.<ref name=\"world bank\"/>\n\n===Family farm labour===\nIn the past 20 years, Kenyans have moved away from family farming towards jobs that pay wages or to start small businesses outside of agriculture.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\">[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTAFRICA/Resources/257994-1335471959878/kenya-economic-update-december-2012.pdf Kenya Economic Update: Kenya at work: Energizing the economy and creating jobs.] World Bank.

Twice as many men as women hold wage jobs, and more men work principally in wage jobs than on family farms. Most Kenyans are now striving to get modern, wage jobs.\"<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\"/> Modern wage jobs include being an \"engineer, telecommunication specialist, cut flower worker, teacher, construction worker, housekeepers, professionals, any industrial and manufacturing job, and port and dock workers.\"<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\"/> In 1989, there were only 1.9M Kenyans employed in wage work. In 2009 this number had increased to 5.1M.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\"/> In 2009, 3.4M men and 1.3M women were employed in wage jobs.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\"/>\n\n===Non-farm self-employment/\"Jua Kali\"===\nIn Kenya, the \"Jua Kali\" sector is another name for the informal economy, also described as non-farming self-employment.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\" /> Jua Kali is Swahili for \"hot sun\" and refers to the idea that the workers in the informal economy work under the fierce sun.<ref name=\":32\">Ronald Hope Sr, Kempe. \"Informal economic activity in Kenya: benefits and drawbacks.\" ''African Geographical Review'' 33.1 (2014): 67-80.</ref> The informal sector consists of self-employment and wage employment that are neither regulated by the Kenyan government nor recognized for legal protection. As a result, informal sector employment does not contribute to Kenya's GDP.<ref name=\":32\" /> Non-farm self-employment has risen from 1989 to 2009.\n\nThe World Bank characterizes non-farm self-employment to include jobs such as \"street vendor, shop owner, dressmaker, assistant, fishmonger, caterer, etc.\"<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\" /> Non-farm self-employment has risen from a total of 0.9M in 1989 to a total of 2.7M in 2009.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\" />  Men make up 1.4M workers, and women workers number 1.3M.<ref name=\"2012 Kenya Economic Update\" />\n\nAs of 2009, Kenya's informal economy accounts for about 80% of the total employment for the country.<ref name=\":32\"/> Most informal workers are self-employed, with few entrepreneurs who employ others. The informal sector contributes economic activity equal to 35% of the total GDP in Kenya, provides an informal finance structure in the shape of the [[rotating savings and credit association]]s (ROSCAs), and provides an income for those with lower socioeconomic status.<ref name=\":32\"/>\n\nThe drawbacks of the informal economy are that it promotes smuggling and tax evasion, and lacks social protection. Most members of the informal sector have low educational attainment but are responsible for developing all of their own skilled labour through apprenticeships. Many choose to enter the informal economy due to the lack of fees, shorter training sessions, and the availability of practical content that is largely absent from formal education. The rising cost of education and lack of guarantees of future employment have caused many workers to transfer to informal apprenticeships.<ref name=\":2\">Barasa, Fred Simiyu, and Eleanor SM Kaabwe. \"Fallacies in policy and strategies of skills training for the informal sector: evidence from the jua kali sector in Kenya.\" ''Journal of education and work'' 14.3 (2001): 329-353.</ref>\n\n==== The impact of customary law on the informal economy ====\n[[Customary law]] has some adverse impacts on women in the informal sector.<ref name=\":112\">Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.</ref> The 1882 Married Women's Property Act gives married women equal property rights and the Law of Succession Act gives women inheritance rights, but the constitution exempts those who are considered \u201cmembers of a particular race or tribe\u201d from being governed by these laws, and instead allows customary law to remain in practice.<ref name=\":112\" /> Customary law allows for discrimination against women and keeps them from accessing assets, land, and property that might otherwise allow them to have collateral for business finance. This restricts the amount of credit that women entrepreneurs might otherwise use to enter either the formal or informal sector. Some examples of discriminatory statutes in the constitution are the Law of Succession Act, the Divorce Laws, and the Children's Act 2001.<ref name=\":112\" /> The overall result is that unmarried women inherit less than their brothers, married women are not expected to receive any inheritance, and a woman only has permission to manage her husband's property as a surrogate for her sons.<ref name=\":112\" /> Women without children are still omitted from inheritance on the death of their husband.<ref name=\":112\" /> Because women have fewer assets and low educational attainment, women are more likely to turn to the informal economy than men.<ref name=\":122\"/>\n\n==Challenges==\nThe economy's heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and the tourism sector leaves it vulnerable to cycles of [[boom and bust]]. The agricultural sector employs nearly 75% of the country's 38 million people. Half of the sector's output remains [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] production.<ref name=\"cp\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Kenya.pdf Kenya country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (June 2007). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nKenya's economic performance has been hampered by numerous factors: heavy dependence on a few agricultural exports that are vulnerable to world price fluctuations, population growth that has outstripped economic growth, prolonged drought that has necessitated power rationing, deteriorating infrastructure, and extreme disparities of wealth that have limited the opportunities of most to develop their skills and knowledge. Poor [[governance]] and [[Corruption in Kenya|corruption]] also have had a negative impact on growth, making it expensive to do business in Kenya. Increased levels of insecurity brought on from [[terrorism]] has become one of the largest impediments to sustainable growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000165929/insecurity-holding-back-kenya-s-growth|title=Insecurity holding back Kenya\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth|last=Sunday|first=Frankline|website=The Standard|language=en|access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref> According to [[Transparency International]], Kenya ranks among the world's six most corrupt countries. Bribery and fraud cost Kenya as much as US$1 billion a year. Kenyans pay some 16 bribes a month, for two in every three encounters with public officials, even though 23% of them live on less than US$1 per day. Another large drag on Kenya's economy is the burden of [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category: Companies of Kenya]]\n*[[List of counties of Kenya by GDP]]\n* [[Eco-Pesa]]\n* [[Kenya Vision 2030|Vision 2030]]\n* [[Central Bank of Kenya]]\n* [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{CIA World Factbook}}\n\n{{OA-attribution|Ellis, Amanda; Cutura, Jozefina; Dione, Nouma; Gillson, Ian; Manuel, Clare; Thongori, Judy. 2007.
