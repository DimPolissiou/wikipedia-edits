Feodosia serves as the administrative center of [[Feodosia Municipality]], one of the regions into which Crimea is divided.

Noted for its rich agricultural lands, on which its trade depended, it was destroyed by the [[Huns]] in the 4th century AD.\n\nTheodosia remained a minor village for much of the next nine hundred years. It was at times part of the [[sphere of influence]] of the [[Khazars]] (excavations have revealed Khazar artifacts dating back to the 9th century) and of the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nLike the rest of [[Crimea]], this place (village) fell under the domination of the [[Kipchaks]] and was conquered by the [[Mongols]] in the 1230s.\n\n===Kaffa===<!-- This section is linked from [[Crimea]] -->\n[[File:Satellite picture of Crimea, Terra-MODIS, 05-16-2015.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Satellite image.

The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] also adds that the city of Caffa was established during the times when the area was ruled by the Khan of Golden Horde [[Mengu-Timur]].<ref>[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article075451.html Mengu-Timur (\u041c\u0435\u043d\u0433\u0443-\u0422\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0440)].

The [[papal bull]] of appointment of the first bishop attributed to him a vast territory: \"a villa de [[Varna]] in [[Bulgaria]] usque [[Sarai (city)|Sarey]] inclusive in longitudinem et a [[Black Sea|mari Pontico]] usque ad [[Ruthenia|terram Ruthenorum]] in latitudinem\" (\"from the city of Varna in Bulgaria to Sarey inclusive in longitude, and from the Black Sea to the land of the Ruthenians in latitude\"). The first bishop was Fra' Gerolamo, who had already been consecrated seven years before as a missionary bishop ''ad partes Tartarorum''. The diocese ended as a residential bishopric with the capture of the city by the [[Ottomans]] in 1475.<ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;432</ref><ref>Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], pp.&nbsp;154\u2013155; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002717&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 2], pp.&nbsp;XVIII e 117; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002718&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 3], p.&nbsp;145; [https://archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol05eubeuoft#page/134/mode/1up vol. 5], p.&nbsp;134</ref><ref>Gasparo Luigi Oderico, [https://archive.org/details/lettereligustic00massgoog ''Lettere ligustiche ossia Osservazioni critiche sullo stato geografico della Liguria fino ai Tempi di Ottone il Grande, con le Memorie storiche di Caffa ed altri luoghi della Crimea posseduti un tempo da' Genovesi''], Bassano 1792 (especially p.&nbsp;166 ff.)</ref> Accordingly, Kaffa is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 855</ref>\n\nIt is believed that the devastating [[pandemic]] the [[Black Death]] entered Europe for the first time via Kaffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under [[Janibeg]] was reportedly withering from the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of [[biological warfare]]. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach [[Europe]] from [[Crimea]]. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under [[Mongols|Mongol]] control, so it is unlikely that Kaffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. Additionally, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wheelis |first=Mark |date=September 2002 |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Kaffa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971\u201375 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silk Roads|last=Frankopan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183}}</ref>\n\nKaffa eventually recovered.

He was at no loss for a pretext to extinguish this last Genoese colony on the Black sea. In 1473, the ''tudun'' (or governor) of the [[Crimean Khanate]] died and a fight developed over the appointment of his successor. The Genoese involved themselves in the dispute, and the Tatar notables who favored the losing candidate finally asked Mehmed to settle the dispute. Mehmed dispatched a fleet under the Ottoman commander [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]], which left [[Constantinople]] 19 May 1475. It anchored before the walls of the city on 1 June, started the bombardment the next day, and on 6 June the inhabitants capitulated. Over the next few days the Ottomans proceeded to extract the wealth of the inhabitants, and abduct 1,500 youths for service in the Sultan's palace. On 8 July the final blow was struck when all inhabitants of Latin origin were ordered to relocate to  Istanbul, where they founded a quarter (''Kefeli Mahalle'') which was named after the town they had been forced to leave.<ref>Franz Babinger, ''Mehmed the Conqueror and his Time'' (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 343ff.</ref> Renamed ''Kefe'', Caffa became one of the most important Turkish ports on the Black Sea.\n\nIn 1615 [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] under the leadership of [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] destroyed the Turkish fleet and captured Caffa. Having conquered the city, the cossacks released the men, women and children who were slaves.\n\n===Feodosia again===\nOttoman control ceased when the expanding [[Russian Empire]] took over Crimea between 1774 and 1783.

Theodosia.jpg|thumb|View from Tepe-Oba over Ordzhonikidze (Urban-type settlement under the town's jurisdiction)]]\n\nModern Feodosiya is a resort city with a population of about 69,000 people. It has beaches, mineral springs, and mud baths, sanatoria, and rest homes. Apart from tourism, its economy rests on agriculture and fisheries. Local industries include fishing, brewing and canning. As with much of the Crimea, most of its population is ethnically [[Russians|Russian]]; the [[Ukrainian language]] is infrequently used. In June 2006, Feodosiya made the news with the [[2006 port riot in Feodosiya|2006 anti-NATO port riot]].\n\nWhile most beaches in Crimea are made of pebbles, there is a unique Golden Beach (Zolotoy Plyazh) made of small seashells in the Feodosiya area. The Golden Beach stretches for 15&nbsp;km.\n\nThe city is sparsely populated during the winter months. Most cafes and restaurants are closed. Business and tourism increase in mid-June and peak during July and August. Like in the other [[resort town]]s in Crimea, the tourists come mostly from the [[C.I.S.]] countries of the former Soviet Union. Feodosiya was the city where the seascape painter [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] lived and worked all his life, and where general [[Pyotr Kotlyarevsky]] and the writer [[Alexander Grin]] spent their declining years. Popular tourist locations include the [[Aivazovsky National Art Gallery]] and the Genoese fortress.\n\n=== 2014 Russian annexation ===\n{{main|Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation}}\nFeodosia, [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] <nowiki/>territory since 1991, was annexed by [[Russia]] in early 2014. The international community has overwhelmingly condemned the Russian Federation's acts in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. Seven United Nations General Assembly Resolutions 68/262 of 27 March 2014 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/68/262], 71/205 of 19 December 2016 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/205], 72/190 of 19 December 2017 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/72/190], 73/194 of 17 December 2018 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/73/194], 73/263 of 22 December 2018 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/73/263], 74/17 of 9 December 2019 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/74/17] and 74/168 of 18 December 2019 [http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/74/168] confirmed the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol as part of the territory of Ukraine, condemned the occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and reaffirmed the non-recognition of the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. The United Nations also called upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status.\n\n==Economy and industry==\n*[[More (Feodosiya)|More PO]] (Primorsk)\n*Sudokompozit - ship design R&D naval hardware\n: Kasatka TsNII Gp NPO Uran (Gagra Pitsunda) - ship design R&D naval hardware\n*Gidropribor FeOMMZ, torpedo manufacturing and ship yard (Ordzhonikidze)\n: NPO Uran TsNII Gp \"Kasatka\" (Lab N\u00b05 NII400) torpedoes (Gagra Pitsunda)\n*Russia Black Sea Fleet Navy Ship repair Yards\n*FOMZ Opto Mechanical Plant FKOZ\n*Feodosia Economic Industrial Zone FPZ (west)\n*Feodosia FMZ Engineering/Machine-building Plant\n*Feodosia FPZ (Priborostroeni Priladobudivni) Instrument-making Plant\n\n==Twin towns\u2014sister cities==\n*{{Flagicon|Armenia}} [[Armavir, Armenia|Armavir]], [[Armenia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Azov]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Kronstadt]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Stavropol]], [[Russia]]\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Ko\u0142obrzeg]], [[Poland]]\n*and others <!-- see ru.wikipedia -->\n\n==People from Feodosiya==\n*[[Ivan Aivazovsky]] (1817-1900), Russian painter\n*[[Roman Kapitonenko]] (born 1981), Ukrainian boxer\n*[[Andrzej Liczik]] (born 1977), Ukrainian-Polish boxer\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe late-medieval city of Caffa is the locale in a section of the novel ''Caprice and Rondo'' by [[Dorothy Dunnett]].\n\nAn early 14th-century bishop of Caffa appears in [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[The Name of the Rose]]'', making several sharp replies in a long, tempestuous debate within a group of monks and clerics; he is portrayed as aggressive and somewhat narrow-minded.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[List of traditional Greek place names]]\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:\u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430 03.JPG|View from Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0435 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430 01.JPG|Ancient [[Crimean Karaites|Karaites]] cemetery\nFile:Theodosia_castle.JPG|Genoese castle Caffa\nFile:\u0412\u0438\u0434 \u043d\u0430 \u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442 \u0437 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430.JPG|Port and Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u041c\u0430\u044f\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0438\u0441\u0456 \u0406\u043b\u043b\u0456-\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0456\u043d\u0435\u0447\u043d\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0445\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0442\u0430 \u0422\u0435\u043f\u0435-\u041e\u0431\u0430.jpg|Lighthouse on Tepe-Oba\nFile:\u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u044f-001.jpg|Feodosia downtown\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book |publisher = Hurst and Blackett |location = London |author= Annette M.

The [[papal bull]] of appointment of the first bishop attributed to him a vast territory: \"a villa de [[Varna]] in [[Bulgaria]] usque [[Sarai (city)|Sarey]] inclusive in longitudinem et a [[Black Sea|mari Pontico]] usque ad [[Ruthenia|terram Ruthenorum]] in latitudinem\" (\"from the city of Varna in Bulgaria to Sarey inclusive in longitude, and from the Black Sea to the land of the Ruthenians in latitude\"). The first bishop was Fra' Gerolamo, who had already been consecrated seven years before as a missionary bishop ''ad partes Tartarorum''. The diocese ended as a residential bishopric with the capture of the city by the [[Ottomans]] in 1475.<ref>Pius Bonifacius Gams, [http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=65154&dirids=1 ''Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae''], Leipzig 1931, p.&nbsp;432</ref><ref>Konrad Eubel, ''Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi'', [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002716&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 1], pp.&nbsp;154\u2013155; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002717&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 2], pp.&nbsp;XVIII e 117; [http://sul-derivatives.stanford.edu/derivative?CSNID=00002718&mediaType=application/pdf vol. 3], p.&nbsp;145; [https://archive.org/stream/hierarchiacathol05eubeuoft#page/134/mode/1up vol. 5], p.&nbsp;134</ref><ref>Gasparo Luigi Oderico, [https://archive.org/details/lettereligustic00massgoog ''Lettere ligustiche ossia Osservazioni critiche sullo stato geografico della Liguria fino ai Tempi di Ottone il Grande, con le Memorie storiche di Caffa ed altri luoghi della Crimea posseduti un tempo da' Genovesi''], Bassano 1792 (especially p.&nbsp;166 ff.)</ref> Accordingly, Kaffa is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 855</ref>\n\nIt is believed that the devastating [[pandemic]] the [[Black Death]] entered Europe for the first time via Kaffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under [[Janibeg]] was reportedly withering from the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of [[biological warfare]]. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach [[Europe]] from [[Crimea]]. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under [[Mongols|Mongol]] control, so it is unlikely that Kaffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. Additionally, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wheelis |first=Mark |date=September 2002 |title=Biological Warfare at the 1346 Siege of Kaffa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=971\u201375 |doi=10.3201/eid0809.010536 |pmid=12194776 |pmc=2732530}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Silk Roads|last=Frankopan|first=Peter|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=183}}</ref>\n\nKaffa eventually recovered.

He was at no loss for a pretext to extinguish this last Genoese colony on the Black sea. In 1473, the ''tudun'' (or governor) of the [[Crimean Khanate]] died and a fight developed over the appointment of his successor. The Genoese involved themselves in the dispute, and the Tatar notables who favored the losing candidate finally asked Mehmed to settle the dispute. Mehmed dispatched a fleet under the Ottoman commander [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]], which left [[Constantinople]] 19 May 1475. It anchored before the walls of the city on 1 June, started the bombardment the next day, and on 6 June the inhabitants capitulated. Over the next few days the Ottomans proceeded to extract the wealth of the inhabitants, and abduct 1,500 youths for service in the Sultan's palace. On 8 July the final blow was struck when all inhabitants of Latin origin were ordered to relocate to  Istanbul, where they founded a quarter (''Kefeli Mahalle'') which was named after the town they had been forced to leave.<ref>Franz Babinger, ''Mehmed the Conqueror and his Time'' (Princeton: University Press, 1978), pp. 343ff.</ref> Renamed ''Kefe'', Caffa became one of the most important Turkish ports on the Black Sea.\n\nIn 1615 [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] under the leadership of [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny]] destroyed the Turkish fleet and captured Caffa. Having conquered the city, the cossacks released the men, women and children who were slaves.\n\n===Feodosia again===\nOttoman control ceased when the expanding [[Russian Empire]] took over Crimea between 1774 and 1783.

It has beaches, mineral springs, and mud baths, sanatoria, and rest homes. Apart from tourism, its economy rests on agriculture and fisheries. Local industries include fishing, brewing and canning. As with much of the Crimea, most of its population is ethnically [[Russians|Russian]]; the [[Ukrainian language]] is infrequently used. In June 2006, Feodosiya made the news with the [[2006 port riot in Feodosiya|2006 anti-NATO port riot]].\n\nWhile most beaches in Crimea are made of pebbles, there is a unique Golden Beach (Zolotoy Plyazh) made of small seashells in the Feodosiya area. The Golden Beach stretches for 15&nbsp;km.\n\nThe city is sparsely populated during the winter months. Most cafes and restaurants are closed. Business and tourism increase in mid-June and peak during July and August. Like in the other [[resort town]]s in Crimea, the tourists come mostly from the [[C.I.S.]] countries of the former Soviet Union. Feodosiya was the city where the seascape painter [[Ivan Aivazovsky]] lived and worked all his life, and where general [[Pyotr Kotlyarevsky]] and the writer [[Alexander Grin]] spent their declining years.

He was the brother of literary critic [[Anthony Nuttall|A. D. Nuttall]].\n\n==Life and work==\nNuttall was born in [[Clitheroe]], [[Lancashire]], and grew up in [[Herefordshire]]. He studied painting in the years after the [[Second World War]] and began publishing poetry in the early 1960s. Together with [[Bob Cobbing]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Sheppard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/07/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |title=Obituary: Bob Cobbing &#124; Books |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref> he founded the influential [[Writers Forum]] press and writers' workshop.<ref>[http://www.lawrenceupton.org/guest-wf/wf.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121034733/http://www.lawrenceupton.org/guest-wf/wf.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHe also associated with many of the American [[beat generation]] writers, especially [[William Burroughs]]. Nuttall's self-published ''[[My Own Mag]]'' mimeographed newsletter provided Burroughs with an important outlet for his experimental literature in the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1966 he was one of the founders of the [[People Show]], an early and long-lasting [[performance art]] group and was involved in the founding of the UK underground newspaper ''[[International Times]]''. In 1967 two of his illustrations appeared in the counter-cultural tabloid newspaper ''The Last Times'' (Volume 1, number 1, Fall 1967) published by [[Charles Plymell]].\n\nHis book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) was one of the key texts of the countercultural revolution of the time, a work which drew links between the emergence of alternatives to mainstream societal norms and the threatening backdrop of potential nuclear annihilation. Nuttall was one of the pioneers of the [[happening]] in Britain.\n\nNuttall served as Chairman of the [[Poetry Society|National Poetry Society]] from 1975 to 1976, a period when the Society briefly served as a home for the [[British Poetry Revival]].

He was the brother of literary critic [[Anthony Nuttall|A. D. Nuttall]].\n\n==Life and work==\nNuttall was born in [[Clitheroe]], [[Lancashire]], and grew up in [[Herefordshire]]. He studied painting in the years after the [[Second World War]] and began publishing poetry in the early 1960s. Together with [[Bob Cobbing]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Sheppard |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/oct/07/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries |title=Obituary: Bob Cobbing &#124; Books |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2014-07-24}}</ref> he founded the influential [[Writers Forum]] press and writers' workshop.<ref>[http://www.lawrenceupton.org/guest-wf/wf.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121034733/http://www.lawrenceupton.org/guest-wf/wf.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHe also associated with many of the American [[beat generation]] writers, especially [[William Burroughs]]. Nuttall's self-published ''[[My Own Mag]]'' mimeographed newsletter provided Burroughs with an important outlet for his experimental literature in the early 1960s.\n\nIn 1966 he was one of the founders of the [[People Show]], an early and long-lasting [[performance art]] group and was involved in the founding of the UK underground newspaper ''[[International Times]]''. In 1967 two of his illustrations appeared in the counter-cultural tabloid newspaper ''The Last Times'' (Volume 1, number 1, Fall 1967) published by [[Charles Plymell]].\n\nHis book ''[[Bomb Culture]]'' (1968) was one of the key texts of the countercultural revolution of the time, a work which drew links between the emergence of alternatives to mainstream societal norms and the threatening backdrop of potential nuclear annihilation. Nuttall was one of the pioneers of the [[happening]] in Britain.\n\nNuttall served as Chairman of the [[Poetry Society|National Poetry Society]] from 1975 to 1976, a period when the Society briefly served as a home for the [[British Poetry Revival]]. He was poetry critic for several national newspapers and was the Poetry Society nominee for [[Poet Laureate]] but was overlooked in favour of [[Ted Hughes]].\n\nNuttall worked as an art teacher; senior lecturer at [[Leeds Beckett University|Leeds Polytechnic]] and was head of fine art at [[Liverpool John Moores University|Liverpool Polytechnic]].

Since 1989 he has been the lead singer of the British rock band [[Marillion]], for which he also performs additional keyboards and guitar. Hogarth was formerly a keyboard player and co-lead vocalist with [[The Europeans (band)|the Europeans]] and vocalist with [[How We Live]]. [[AllMusic]] has described Hogarth as having a \"unique, expressive voice\" with \"flexible range and beautiful phrasing\".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/seasons-end-mw0000205251 | title= Seasons End | publisher=AllMusic | first=Jeri | last= Montesano| accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHogarth was born in [[Kendal]], Westmorland. His father was an engineer in the [[British Merchant Navy]]. He was brought up on a council estate in [[Doncaster]], [[South Yorkshire]] from the age of two.  As a child he became interested in music, his earliest influences being [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]].  He taught himself to play piano. Leaving school at the age of eighteen, Hogarth spent three years studying for a degree in [[electrical engineering]] at [[Nottingham Trent University|Trent Polytechnic]] (now [[Nottingham Trent University]]).  He was also a member of a band during this time, Harlow, who played working men's clubs. They recorded the single Harry de Mazzio on the Pepper record label in 1978. The band split in 1981 and Hogarth left his engineering degree, moving to London to further his music career.<ref>Mick Wall ''Pre-Season Friendlies'' ''[[Kerrang!]]'' 23 September 1989</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn London, after responding to an advertisement in the music press Hogarth joined the band Motion Pictures. They were subsequently renamed [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]]. Initially joining just as a keyboard player, Hogarth later shared the vocal duties with Ferg Harper. Signed to [[A&M Records]], [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]] released two studio albums and one live album. Hogarth sang just one track on the first studio album but sang five of the eight tracks on the second album.\n\nIn 1985, Hogarth and guitarist Colin Woore left the band to form [[How We Live]],  The duo were signed to [[Columbia Records]]. In 1987, following record company changes, How We Live's debut album ''Dry Land'' was unsuccessful. Hogarth considered leaving the music industry and becoming a milkman or postman. However, a meeting with his publishers arranged by a friend, [[Darryl Way]], a founding member of [[Curved Air]], persuaded him to send a tape to Marillion, who were recruiting for a new lead vocalist following the departure of [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] in late 1988.\n\nMarillion heard the tape and were interested enough to ask for a meeting with the singer. Later accounts of this first meeting record that Hogarth turned up at band member [[Pete Trewavas]]' house with his demo tapes contained in a red plastic fire bucket \u2013 the audition taking place in Trewavas' garage, due to the presence of cats in the house (see [[Steve Hogarth#Personal life|below]]). The band were immediately impressed by his vocal prowess. Hogarth himself, however, took a little longer to make up his mind, holding as he did at the time a potentially lucrative offer to tour the [[United States|U.S.]] on [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] with [[The The]]. As he later recalled in a 2001 interview by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', he had a choice \"between the most hip band in the world, and the least...\". In the end he accepted the position with Marillion, won over as the band wanted an equal partner and were offering a potentially permanent arrangement.\n\nHogarth's first album with the band, released in September 1989, was ''[[Seasons End]]'', their fifth studio album. Since then, Marillion have recorded a further thirteen albums with Hogarth on vocals, the most recent being ''[[Fuck Everyone and Run (F E A R)]]'' released in September 2016.\n\nHogarth has also released one solo studio album under the name 'h' called ''Ice Cream Genius''. This album had contributions from ex-[[Japan (band)|Japan]]/ [[Porcupine Tree]] synthesiser/keyboard maestro [[Richard Barbieri]], former [[XTC]] guitarist [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] drummer [[Clem Burke]], bassist [[Chucho Merchan]] and percussionist [[Lu\u00eds Jardim]].\n\nSubsequently, Hogarth's side-project, '''The H-Band''', has played live across the UK and Europe featuring a variety of musicians, including former [[The Stone Roses]] MKII guitarist [[Aziz Ibrahim]], [[Massive Attack]] and [[The Bays]] drummer Andy Gangadeen, [[session musician]] Jingles on [[bass guitar|bass]], Aziz's regular musical partner Dalbir Singh Rattan on tablas and Stephanie Sobey-Jones on cello. With Barbieri and Gregory, this line up recorded a double album entitled ''Live Spirit: Live Body'' in 2001 (released in 2002). Writing for a forthcoming second solo studio album occurred in December 2004.\n\nIn Spring / Summer 2006 Hogarth undertook a solo, 'h Natural', during which he played around 20 dates in the UK and Europe . It was billed as an evening of music and conversation with Hogarth at the piano. These shows were mixed and released for download, one at a time and for a limited period only, on Hogarth's (now defunct) H-Tunes website.\n\nOn 14 May 2010 Hogarth performed at the Relentless Garage in London to celebrate his birthday. On the following two days he also performed in Liverpool and Sheffield. To coincide with these shows a CD was released featuring some of the best tracks taken from his H Natural shows. This collection is called H Natural Selection and was available at the shows and from the Marillion website.\n\nIn 2012 Hogarth joined forces with [[Richard Barbieri]] again, releasing an album as a duo called ''Not the weapon but the hand''.\n\nIn 2014 it was announced that Hogarth was releasing two volumes of diaries, written between 1991 and 2014.

Since 1989 he has been the lead singer of the British rock band [[Marillion]], for which he also performs additional keyboards and guitar. Hogarth was formerly a keyboard player and co-lead vocalist with [[The Europeans (band)|the Europeans]] and vocalist with [[How We Live]]. [[AllMusic]] has described Hogarth as having a \"unique, expressive voice\" with \"flexible range and beautiful phrasing\".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/seasons-end-mw0000205251 | title= Seasons End | publisher=AllMusic | first=Jeri | last= Montesano| accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHogarth was born in [[Kendal]], Westmorland. His father was an engineer in the [[British Merchant Navy]]. He was brought up on a council estate in [[Doncaster]], [[South Yorkshire]] from the age of two.  As a child he became interested in music, his earliest influences being [[The Beatles]] and [[The Kinks]].  He taught himself to play piano. Leaving school at the age of eighteen, Hogarth spent three years studying for a degree in [[electrical engineering]] at [[Nottingham Trent University|Trent Polytechnic]] (now [[Nottingham Trent University]]).  He was also a member of a band during this time, Harlow, who played working men's clubs. They recorded the single Harry de Mazzio on the Pepper record label in 1978. The band split in 1981 and Hogarth left his engineering degree, moving to London to further his music career.<ref>Mick Wall ''Pre-Season Friendlies'' ''[[Kerrang!]]'' 23 September 1989</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn London, after responding to an advertisement in the music press Hogarth joined the band Motion Pictures. They were subsequently renamed [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]]. Initially joining just as a keyboard player, Hogarth later shared the vocal duties with Ferg Harper. Signed to [[A&M Records]], [[The Europeans (band)|The Europeans]] released two studio albums and one live album. Hogarth sang just one track on the first studio album but sang five of the eight tracks on the second album.\n\nIn 1985, Hogarth and guitarist Colin Woore left the band to form [[How We Live]],  The duo were signed to [[Columbia Records]]. In 1987, following record company changes, How We Live's debut album ''Dry Land'' was unsuccessful. Hogarth considered leaving the music industry and becoming a milkman or postman. However, a meeting with his publishers arranged by a friend, [[Darryl Way]], a founding member of [[Curved Air]], persuaded him to send a tape to Marillion, who were recruiting for a new lead vocalist following the departure of [[Fish (singer)|Fish]] in late 1988.\n\nMarillion heard the tape and were interested enough to ask for a meeting with the singer. Later accounts of this first meeting record that Hogarth turned up at band member [[Pete Trewavas]]' house with his demo tapes contained in a red plastic fire bucket - the audition taking place in Trewavas' garage, due to the presence of cats in the house (see [[Steve Hogarth#Personal life|below]]). The band were immediately impressed by his vocal prowess. Hogarth himself, however, took a little longer to make up his mind, holding as he did at the time a potentially lucrative offer to tour the [[United States|U.S.]] on [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] with [[The The]]. As he later recalled in a 2001 interview by ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', he had a choice \"between the most hip band in the world, and the least...\". In the end he accepted the position with Marillion, won over as the band wanted an equal partner and were offering a potentially permanent arrangement.\n\nHogarth's first album with the band, released in September 1989, was ''[[Seasons End]]'', their fifth studio album. Since then, Marillion have recorded a further thirteen albums with Hogarth on vocals, the most recent being ''[[Fuck Everyone and Run (F E A R)]]'' released in September 2016.\n\nHogarth has also released one solo studio album under the name 'h' called ''Ice Cream Genius''. This album had contributions from ex-[[Japan (band)|Japan]]/ [[Porcupine Tree]] synthesiser/keyboard maestro [[Richard Barbieri]], former [[XTC]] guitarist [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] drummer [[Clem Burke]], bassist [[Chucho Merchan]] and percussionist [[Lu\u00eds Jardim]].\n\nSubsequently, Hogarth's side-project, '''The H-Band''', has played live across the UK and Europe featuring a variety of musicians, including former [[The Stone Roses]] MKII guitarist [[Aziz Ibrahim]], [[Massive Attack]] and [[The Bays]] drummer Andy Gangadeen, [[session musician]] Jingles on [[bass guitar|bass]], Aziz's regular musical partner Dalbir Singh Rattan on tablas and Stephanie Sobey-Jones on cello. With Barbieri and Gregory, this line up recorded a double album entitled ''Live Spirit: Live Body'' in 2001 (released in 2002). Writing for a forthcoming second solo studio album occurred in December 2004.\n\nIn Spring / Summer 2006 Hogarth undertook a solo, 'h Natural', during which he played around 20 dates in the UK and Europe . It was billed as an evening of music and conversation with Hogarth at the piano. These shows were mixed and released for download, one at a time and for a limited period only, on Hogarth's (now defunct) H-Tunes website.\n\nOn 14 May 2010 Hogarth performed at the Relentless Garage in London to celebrate his birthday. On the following two days he also performed in Liverpool and Sheffield. To coincide with these shows a CD was released featuring some of the best tracks taken from his H Natural shows. This collection is called H Natural Selection and was available at the shows and from the Marillion website.\n\nIn 2012 Hogarth joined forces with [[Richard Barbieri]] again, releasing an album as a duo called ''Not the weapon but the hand''.\n\nIn 2014 it was announced that Hogarth was releasing two volumes of diaries, written between 1991 and 2014. The first was released in June 2014 by Miwk Publishing and is called 'The Invisible Man'. Volume 2 followed in December 2014.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nHogarth has three children: a daughter named Sofi and a son named Nial with his first wife Sue,<ref>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/club/your_reports/newsid_3650000/3650053.stm | title= Our dad's a rock star  | work=BBC News | date=26 April 2004 | accessdate=13 Nov 2011}}</ref> and a son named Emil from his current relationship with Linette.\n\nHogarth is violently allergic to cats, first learning this when hospitalised as a child after visiting a Liverpudlian Auntie \"...whose house was full of 'em!\"{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Musical inspirations==\n\nHogarth has cited [[The Blue Nile]], [[Paddy McAloon]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Mike Scott (musician)|Mike Scott]], [[John Lennon]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] as musical inspirations, and [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Massive Attack]] as artists he would like to work with.

Increasingly accurate measurements were required, and scientists looked for measures that were universal and could be based on natural phenomena rather than royal decree or physical prototypes. Rather than the various complex systems of subdivision in use, they also preferred a decimal system to ease their calculations.\n\nWith the [[French Revolution]] (1789) came a desire to replace many features of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], including [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|the traditional units of measure]]. As a base unit of length, many scientists had favoured the [[seconds pendulum]] (a pendulum with a half-period of one second) one century earlier, but this was rejected as it had been discovered that it varied from place to place with local gravity and that it could complement [[History of geodesy|meridian arc measurements]] in determining the [[figure of the Earth]]. A new unit of length, the ''metre'' was introduced \u2013 defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator [[Paris meridian|passing through Paris]], assuming an Earth's [[flattening]] of 1/334.\n\nFor practical purposes however, the standard metre was made available in the form of a platinum bar held in Paris. This in turn was replaced in 1889 at the initiative of the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] by thirty platinum-iridium bars kept across the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/international-metre-commission.html|title=BIPM - Commission internationale du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of a special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale.<ref name=\"la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre\" /> Progress in science finally allowed to dematerialize the definition of the metre, so in 1960 a new definition based on a specific number of wavelengths of light from a specific transition in krypton-86 allowed the standard to be universally available by measurement. In 1983 this was updated to a length defined in terms of the [[speed of light]], which was reworded in 2019:<ref name=2019metre>{{citation \n |title = 9th edition of the SI Brochure\n |publisher = [[BIPM]]\n |url = https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/\n |date = 2019\n |page=131\n |df = dmy-all\n }}</ref>\n\n:The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum {{mvar|c}} to be {{val|299792458}} when expressed in the unit m\u22c5s{{sup|\u22121}}, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency {{math|\u0394''&nu;''<sub>Cs</sub>}}.\n\nDuring the mid nineteenth century the metre gained adoption worldwide, particularly in scientific usage, and was officially established as an international measurement unit by the [[Metre Convention]] of 1875. Where older traditional length measures are still used, they are now defined in terms of the metre \u2013 for example the [[yard]] has since 1959 officially been defined as exactly 0.9144 metre.<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\n==Universal measure==\n[[File:Giovanni Cassini.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]]]]\n\nThe standard measures of length in Europe diverged from one another after the fall of the [[Carolingian Empire]] (around 888): while measures could be standardised within a given jurisdiction (which was often little more than a single market town), there were numerous variations of measure between regions. Indeed, as the measures were often used as the basis for taxation (of cloth, for example), the use of a particular measure was associated with the sovereignty of a given ruler and often dictated by law.<ref name=\"Nelson\">{{cite journal | first=Robert A. | last=Nelson | title=Foundations of the international system of units (SI) | journal=[[The Physics Teacher]] | volume=19 | issue=9 | date=December 1981 | pages=596\u2013613 | url=http://www.physics.umd.edu/deptinfo/facilities/lecdem/services/refs/refsa/Nelson-FoundationsSI.pdf| bibcode=1981PhTea..19..596N | doi=10.1119/1.2340901 }}</ref><ref name=\"Larousse\">{{Cite LarousseXIXe | title=M\u00e9trique | volume=11 | pages=163\u2013164}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, with the increasing scientific activity of the 17th century came calls for the institution of a standard measure<ref name=Bigourdan>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lesystmemtri00bigo|title=Le syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique des poids et mesures ; son \u00e9tablissement et sa propagation graduelle, avec l'histoire des op\u00e9rations qui ont servi \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le m\u00e8tre et le kilogramme|last=Bigourdan|first=Guillaume|date=1901|publisher=Paris : Gauthier-Villars|others=University of Ottawa|isbn=|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/lesystmemtri00bigo/page/7 7], 148, 154}}</ref> or \"''{{lang|it|metro cattolico}}''\" (as Italian [[Tito Livio Burattini]] said <ref>{{citation | title=Misura Universale | year=1675}}</ref>), which would be based on natural phenomena rather than royal decree, and would also be [[decimal]] rather than using the various systems of subdivision, often [[duodecimal]], which coexisted at the time.\n\nIn 1645 [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] had been the first to determine the length of a \"[[seconds pendulum]]\" (a [[pendulum]] with a half-period of one [[second]]). In 1671 [[Jean Picard]] measured the length of a \"seconds pendulum\" at the [[Paris Observatory]]. He found the value of 440.5 lines of the Toise of Ch\u00e2telet which had been recently renewed. He proposed a universal toise (French: ''Toise universelle'') which was twice the length of the seconds pendulum.

France was particularly affected by the proliferation of length measures, and the need for reform was widely accepted across all political viewpoints, even if it needed the push of revolution to bring it about. [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord|Talleyrand]] resurrected the idea of the seconds pendulum before the Constituent Assembly in 1790, suggesting that the new measure be defined at 45\u00b0N (a latitude that, in France, runs just north of Bordeaux and just south of Grenoble): despite the support of the Assembly, nothing came of Talleyrand's proposal.<ref name=\"Larousse\"/><ref group=\"Note\">The idea of the [[seconds pendulum]] as a length standard did not die completely, and such a standard was used to define the [[yard]] in the United Kingdom from 1843 to 1878.</ref>\n\n==Meridional definition==\n{{see also|Earth's circumference#Historical use in the definition of units of measurement|Meridian arc#History of measurement}}\n<!-- \"Meridional definition\" links here -->\n[[File:Dunkerque Belfort.JPG|thumb|upright|Belfry, Dunkirk \u2013 the northern end of the [[meridian arc]]]]\n[[File:Reflecting circle-CnAM 1842-IMG 4998-gradient.jpg|left|thumb|[[Repeating circle]]]]\n\nThe question of measurement reform was placed in the hands of the [[Academy of Sciences (France)|Academy of Sciences]], who appointed a commission chaired by [[Jean-Charles de Borda]]. Borda was an avid supporter of [[decimalisation]]: he had invented the \"[[repeating circle]]\", a surveying instrument which allowed a much-improved precision in the measurement of angles between landmarks, but insisted that it be calibrated in \"''[[grad (angle)|grade]]s''\" ({{frac|100}} of a quarter-circle) rather than [[degree (angle)|degree]]s, with 100&nbsp;minutes to a ''grade'' and 100&nbsp;seconds to a minute.<ref>{{cite web | title = Jean Charles de Borda | url = http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Borda.html | first1=J.

Indeed, we know now that the resulting acceleration towards the ground is about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator. It follows that the polar diameter of the Earth is smaller than its equatorial diameter. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] planned to infer the [[flattening]] of the Earth from both the length's differences between meridional portions corresponding to one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] and the variations of gravitational acceleration (see [[Clairaut's theorem]]). [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] published in 1821 their observations completing those of Delambre and Mechain. It was an account of the length's variation of the degrees of latitude along the Paris meridian as well as the account of the variation of the [[seconds pendulum]]'s length along the same meridian. The seconds pendulum's length was a mean to measure ''g'', the local acceleration resulting from combinaison of local gravity and centrifugal acceleration, which varies with [[latitude]] (see [[Gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]]).<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/6/2075/ |title=Figure de la Terre |trans-title=Figure of the Earth |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/4/3824/ |title=Degr\u00e9 |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |url=https://artflsrv03.uchicago.edu/philologic4/encyclopedie1117/navigate/12/1152/|title=Pendule |editor-first1=Denis |editor-last1=Diderot |editor-first2=Jean le Rond |editor-last2=d'Alembert |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e9die ou Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers |publisher=Une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Gens de lettres |location=Paris |via=University of Chicago |access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3047v|title=Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences / publi\u00e9s... par MM. les secr\u00e9taires perp\u00e9tuels|last=Faye|first=Herv\u00e9|date=1880|website=Gallica|pages=1463\u20131466|language=EN|access-date=2019-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perrier|first=G\u00e9n\u00e9ral|date=1935|journal=Thal\u00e8s|volume=2|pages=117\u2013129|issn=0398-7817|jstor=43861533|title=Historique Sommaire de la Geodesie}}</ref><ref name=\"gallica\" /><ref name=\"Murdin\" /><ref group=\"Note\">At the time the second was defined as a fraction of the Earth's rotation time and determined by clocks whose precision was checked by astronomical observations.

In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc. In 1870, [[Fran\u00e7ois Perrier (French Army officer)|Fran\u00e7ois Perrier]] was in charge of resuming the triangulation between Dunkirk and Barcelona.

[[Friedrich Bessel|Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] was responsible for the nineteenth-century investigations of the shape of the Earth by means of the pendulum's determination of gravity and the use of [[Clairaut's theorem]]. The studies he conducted from 1825 to 1828 and his determination of the length of the pendulum beating the second in Berlin seven years later marked the beginning of a new era in geodesy.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIndeed, the reversible pendulum as it was used by geodesists at the end of the 19th century was largely due to the work of Bessel, because neither [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]], its inventor, nor [[Henry Kater]] who used it in 1818 did not bring him the improvements which would result from the precious indications of Bessel, and which converted him into one of the most admirable instruments which it was given to the scientists of the nineteenth century to use.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe reversible pendulum built by the Repsold brothers was used in Switzerland in 1865 by [[Emile Plantamour|\u00c9mile Plantamour]] for the measurement of gravity in six stations of the Swiss geodetic network.

On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the device designed by the Repsold brothers on Bessel's indications, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolphe Hirsch found a way to highlight the movements of the pendulum suspension plane by an ingenious optical amplification process.

The natural unit for expressing a length measured by interferometry was the \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m, but this result then had to be converted into metres using an experimental conversion factor \u2013 the wavelength of light used, but measured in metres rather than in \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms.

Advances in both experimental technique and theory showed that the cadmium line was actually a cluster of closely separated lines, and that this was due to the presence of different [[isotope]]s in natural cadmium (eight in total).

Increasingly accurate measurements were required, and scientists looked for measures that were universal and could be based on natural phenomena rather than royal decree or physical prototypes. Rather than the various complex systems of subdivision in use, they also preferred a decimal system to ease their calculations.\n\nWith the [[French Revolution]] (1789) came a desire to replace many features of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], including [[Units of measurement in France before the French Revolution|the traditional units of measure]]. As a base unit of length, many scientists had favoured the [[seconds pendulum]] (a pendulum with a half-period of one second) one century earlier, but this was rejected as it had been discovered that it varied from place to place with local gravity and that it could complement [[History of geodesy|meridian arc measurements]] in determining the [[figure of the Earth]]. A new unit of length, the ''metre'' was introduced \u2013 defined as one ten-millionth of the shortest distance from the North Pole to the equator [[Paris meridian|passing through Paris]], assuming an Earth's [[flattening]] of 1/334.\n\nFor practical purposes however, the standard metre was made available in the form of a platinum bar held in Paris. This in turn was replaced in 1889 at the initiative of the [[International Association of Geodesy|International Geodetic Association]] by thirty platinum-iridium bars kept across the globe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/fr/measurement-units/history-si/international-metre-commission.html|title=BIPM - Commission internationale du m\u00e8tre|website=www.bipm.org|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The comparison of the new prototypes of the metre with each other and with the Committee metre (French: ''[[M\u00e8tre des Archives]]'') involved the development of a special measuring equipment and the definition of a reproducible temperature scale.<ref name=\"la d\u00e9finition du m\u00e8tre\" /> Progress in science finally allowed to dematerialize the definition of the metre, so in 1960 a new definition based on a specific number of wavelengths of light from a specific transition in krypton-86 allowed the standard to be universally available by measurement. In 1983 this was updated to a length defined in terms of the [[speed of light]], which was reworded in 2019:<ref name=2019metre>{{citation \n |title = 9th edition of the SI Brochure\n |publisher = [[BIPM]]\n |url = https://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/\n |date = 2019\n |page=131\n |df = dmy-all\n }}</ref>\n\n:The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length.

Indeed, we know now that the resulting acceleration towards the ground is about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the Equator. It follows that the polar diameter of the Earth is smaller than its equatorial diameter. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] planned to infer the [[flattening]] of the Earth from both the length's differences between meridional portions corresponding to one [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] and the variations of gravitational acceleration (see [[Clairaut's theorem]]). [[Jean-Baptiste Biot]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Arago]] published in 1821 their observations completing those of Delambre and Mechain. It was an account of the length's variation of the degrees of latitude along the Paris meridian as well as the account of the variation of the [[seconds pendulum]]'s length along the same meridian.

[[Louis Puissant]] declared in 1836 in front of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] that Delambre and M\u00e9chain had made an error in the measurement of the French meridian arc. That is why from 1861 to 1866, Antoine Yvon Villarceau checked the geodesic op\u00e9rations in eight points of the meridian arc. Some of the errors in the operations of Delambre and M\u00e9chain were corrected. In 1866, at the conference of the [[International Association of Geodesy]] in [[Neuch\u00e2tel]] [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero]] announced Spain's contribution to the measurement of the French meridian arc.

[[Friedrich Bessel|Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] was responsible for the nineteenth-century investigations of the shape of the Earth by means of the pendulum's determination of gravity and the use of [[Clairaut's theorem]]. The studies he conducted from 1825 to 1828 and his determination of the length of the pendulum beating the second in Berlin seven years later marked the beginning of a new era in geodesy.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIndeed, the reversible pendulum as it was used by geodesists at the end of the 19th century was largely due to the work of Bessel, because neither [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]], its inventor, nor [[Henry Kater]] who used it in 1818 did not bring him the improvements which would result from the precious indications of Bessel, and which converted him into one of the most admirable instruments which it was given to the scientists of the nineteenth century to use.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe reversible pendulum built by the Repsold brothers was used in Switzerland in 1865 by [[Emile Plantamour|\u00c9mile Plantamour]] for the measurement of gravity in six stations of the Swiss geodetic network. Following the example set by this country and under the patronage of the International Geodetic Association, Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, Russia and Saxony undertook gravity determinations on their respective territories.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHowever, these results could only be considered provisional insofar as they did not take into account the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its suspension plane, which constitute an important factor of error in measuring the duration of the oscillations. and the length of the pendulum.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIndeed, the determination of gravity by the pendulum is subject to two types of error. On the one hand the resistance of the air and on the other hand the movements that the oscillations of the pendulum impart to its plane of suspension. These movements were particularly important with the device designed by the Repsold brothers on Bessel's indications, because the pendulum had a large mass in order to counteract the effect of the viscosity of the air. While Emile Plantamour was carrying out a series of experiments with this device, Adolphe Hirsch found a way to highlight the movements of the pendulum suspension plane by an ingenious optical amplification process.

If precision metrology had needed the help of geodesy, it could not continue to prosper without the help of metrology. Indeed, how to express all the measurements of terrestrial arcs as a function of a single unit, and all the determinations of the force of gravity with the [[Seconds pendulum|pendulum]], if metrology had not created a common unit, adopted and respected by all civilized nations, and if in addition one had not compared, with great precision, to the same unit all the rulers for measuring geodesic bases, and all the pendulum rods that had hitherto been used or would be used in the future? Only when this series of metrological comparisons would be finished with a probable error of a thousandth of a millimeter would geodesy be able to link the works of the different nations with one another, and then proclaim the result of the last measurement of the Globe. As the [[figure of the Earth]] could be inferred from variations of the [[seconds pendulum]] length with [[latitude]]s, the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey']]<nowiki/>s direction instructed [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the spring of 1875 to proceed to Europe for the purpose of making pendulum experiments to chief initial stations for operations of this sort, in order to bring the determinations of the forces of gravity in America into communication with those of other parts of the world; and also for the purpose of making a careful study of the methods of pursuing these researches in the different countries of Europe.<ref name=Faye /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=http://www.rac.es/ficheros/Discursos/DR_20080825_173.pdf|title=Discursos leidos ante la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas Fisicas y Naturales en la recepcion p\u00fablica de Don Joaquin Barraquer y Rovira|last=Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez e Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez de Ibero|first=Carlos|publisher=Imprenta de la Viuda e Hijo de D.E.

The natural unit for expressing a length measured by interferometry was the \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m, but this result then had to be converted into metres using an experimental conversion factor \u2013 the wavelength of light used, but measured in metres rather than in \u00e5ngstr\u00f6ms. This added an additional [[measurement uncertainty]] to any length result in metres, over and above the uncertainty of the actual interferometric measurement.\n\nThe solution was to define the metre in the same manner as the \u00e5ngstr\u00f6m had been defined in 1907, that is in terms of the best interferometric wavelength available. Advances in both experimental technique and theory showed that the cadmium line was actually a cluster of closely separated lines, and that this was due to the presence of different [[isotope]]s in natural cadmium (eight in total). To get the most precisely defined line, it was necessary to use a monoisotopic source and this source should contain an isotope with even numbers of protons and neutrons (so as to have zero [[nuclear spin]]).<ref name=\"Nelson\"/>\n\nSeveral isotopes of [[cadmium]], [[krypton]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] both fulfil the condition of zero nuclear spin and have bright lines in the visible region of the spectrum.\n\n==Krypton standard==\nKrypton is a gas at room temperature, allowing for easier [[isotopic enrichment]] and lower operating temperatures for the lamp (which reduces [[Doppler broadening|broadening]] of the line due to the [[Doppler effect]]), and so it was decided to select the orange line of [[krypton-86]] (''\u03bb''&nbsp;\u2248 606&nbsp;nm) as the new wavelength standard.<ref name=\"Nelson\"/><ref>{{cite journal | title=The International Length Standard | first1=K.
