Today it is a popular tourist attraction better known as Givat HaTurmusim.

The biblical account states that the [[Philistines]] encamped between Sokho and Azekah in the [[Valley of Elah]] before [[Goliath]]'s historic encounter with [[David]], the son of Jesse ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 17:1}}). David slew the Philistine giant with a stone slung from a shepherd's sling. [[Rehoboam]] fortified the place ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 11:7}}), but it is not clear which of the two sites is referred to.<ref>{{Citation |contribution= |title= The Anchor Bible Dictionary|editor-last1=Freedman |editor-first1=David Noel |editor-last2= |editor-first2=  |editor-link= David Noel Freedman|volume= 6 |publisher= |place =New York|page=s.v. Socho |year=1992 }}</ref> Socho was one of the cities occupied temporarily by the Philistines in the time of [[Ahaz]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 28:18}}).\n\nThe word \"Sokho\" appears on certain [[LMLK seal]]s during the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judean monarchy]]. It is believed by many scholars to be one of four cities that acted in some administrative capacity.\n\nThe [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] [[Rabbi]] [[Antigonus of Sokho]], mentioned in ''Ethics of the Fathers'' ([[Pirkei Avot]] 1:3), likely came from the Hebron-region town. Rabbi Levi Sukia, of the first generation of [[Amoraim]], also came from Sokho (Jerusalem Talmud, Eruvim).\n\nIn [[Byzantine]] times, [[Eusebius]] described Sokho (\u03a3\u03bf\u03ba\u03c7\u03c9\u03b8) as a double village at the ninth milestone between [[Eleutheropolis]] (Bet Guvrin) and Jerusalem (Eusebius, ''[[Onomasticon (Eusebius)|Onomasticon]]'' 156:18 ff.), which would correspond to the Elah Valley location. The 6th-century [[Madaba Map]] also depicts Sokho (\u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03c9).\n\n==Givat HaTurmusim==\n[[File:Cave-like cistern at Tel-Socho (Khirbet Shuweikah) - 2 Feb. 2015.JPG|thumb|Ancient cistern at Tel Socho]]\nThe hill of Tel Sokho is now known as ''Givat HaTurmusim'', or \"Hill of the [[Lupinus pilosus|Lupines]]\". In late March, the entire hill is covered with wild blue mountain lupines (''[[Lupinus pilosus]]'') and becomes a popular outing destination for Israeli families.<ref>[https://www.gemsinisrael.com/the-gems/biblical-places-and-people/the-valley-of-elah/ The Valley of Elah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208155727/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000096482.htm |date=2006-02-08 }}</ref>\nThe hill is surrounded by precipitous slopes on its north side, making it almost impassable. Trails ascend the mountain on its northwestern and southeastern sides. The Elah Valley runs in a westerly-easterly direction on its north side, the hilltop affording a good view of the valley below.\n\nOn the elevated plateau, one can see the foundations of ancient dwellings carved into the bedrock with individual chambers divided by broken stone protuberances. Caves and grottoes dot the landscape, and cisterns are carved deep into the rock. Oak trees, fig trees, and terebinths grow on the mountainside and piles of large ashlar boulders, covered with lichen, attest to the presence of a defensive wall around the city in antiquity. According to the biblical narrative, when [[Joshua]] captured the city from the Canaanites, the city and environs became the inheritance of Judah.\n\n==Archaeology==\nA survey of the site in the Elah Valley was conducted in 2010 by Joseph Garfinkel on behalf of the [[Hebrew University]]'s Institute of Archaeology and by Michael Gerald Hasel on behalf of [[Southern Adventist University]].<ref>[[Israel Antiquities Authority]], [http://www.antiquities.org.il/m_digs_eng.aspx?shana=2010 Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010], Survey Permit # S-217</ref> Excavations at the foot of the northern slope exposed a Byzantine building from the 5th to 6th centuries. Remains dating to [[Iron Age II]] were uncovered in another dig at the foot of the northern slope, and walls dating to the Middle Bronze Age were discovered in probe trenches. Potsherds dating to the Late Bronze Age and later periods were gathered, along with a terracotta figurine of reddish-brown clay depicting a naked woman.<ref>[http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1728 Israel Antiquities Authority]</ref>\n\nThe discovery of a pre\u00ebxilic stamp with the imprint ''[[LMLK seal|La-melekh]]'' ('''\u05dc\u05de\u05dc\u05da'''), and in which Sokho is named with another three cities, has led archaeologists to conclude that Sokho may have served as an administrative or storage center. One of the wells to the west in the valley, mentioned by Claude Conder, was destroyed with explosives by Arab infiltrators (''mistanenim'') in 1956, never being rebuilt. An intensive survey conducted in 2010 included an examination of Middle Bronze and Iron Age burial caves, as well as slag from a pottery workshop (which probably dates to the Crusader/Mamluk period).<ref>{{cite book | author1=Hasel, Michael G. |author2=Garfinkel, Yosef | author3=Weiss, Shifra |title=Socoh of the Judean Shephelah: The 2010 Survey | publisher=Eisenbrauns Inc. | location=Winona Lake, Indiana | date=2017 | isbn=9781575067667}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Levantine archaeology]]\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Tel Socho}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://holyland-pictures.com/tag/shephela-judea/sokho/ Pictures of Tel Sokho]\n*[http://www.archives.gov.il/en/archives/#/Archive/0b071706800225ea/File/0b07170680e3a69e Jebel Shuweikeh Forest Reserve, 1926], British Mandate document, designating forest as State Domain\n\n[[Category:Canaanite cities]]\n[[Category:Archaeology of Palestine (region)]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Israel]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the West Bank]]\n[[Category:Ancient Israel and Judah]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in the State of Palestine]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Israel]]\n[[Category:Hebrew Bible cities]]\n[[Category:Establishments in the Kingdom of Judah]]\n[[Category:Tells]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Judah]]\n[[Category:Biblical geography]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canaanite era ruin in Israel}}\n{{about||the neighbourhood of Rawalpindi, Pakistan|Sukho|the Korean given name|Seok-ho}}\n{{Infobox ancient site\n|name           = Sokho\n|native_name= \n|alternate_name= \n|image          = File:Stone wall at Tel Socho, Israel, Feb. 2015.jpg\n|alt=\n|caption        = Stone wall at Tel Socho, Elah Valley, 2015\n|map_type       = Israel\n|map_alt=\n|map_size       = 150\n|location= {{flagicon|Palestine}} {{flagicon|Israel}}\n|coordinates    = {{coord|31.682108|N|34.973866|E|type:city_region:IL|display=inline,title}}\n|grid_position = 148.2/120.7 [[Palestine grid|PAL]]\n|type=\n|material=\n|built=\n|abandoned=\n|epochs=\n|cultures=\n|condition      = Ruin\n|ownership=\n|public_access=\n|website=\n|notes=\n}}\n\n[[File:Lupinus pilosus (Zachi Evenor for Wiki).jpg|thumb|right|Blue Lupines at Tel Socho]]\n'''Sokho''' (alternate spellings: '''Sokhoh''', '''Sochoh''', '''Soco''', '''Sokoh'''; {{lang-he|\u05e9\u05d5\u05db\u05d4 ,\u05e9\u05d5\u05db\u05d5 ,\u05e9\u05db\u05d4}}) is the name given to two ancient towns in the territorial domain of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] as mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]], in what is now the [[West Bank]].

The site, occupied as early as the [[Iron Age]], was visited by [[Claude Conder]] in 1881, who writes that it was already a ruin in his days, with two wells in the valley towards the west.<ref>See p. 410 in: {{cite book|last1=Conder|first1=C.R.|authorlink1=Claude Reignier Conder|last2=Kitchener|first2=H.H.|authorlink2=Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|year=1883|url=https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/410/mode/2up|title=The Survey of Western Palestine: Memoirs of the Topography, Orography, Hydrography, and Archaeology|location=London|publisher=[[Palestine Exploration Fund|Committee of the Palestine Exploration Fund]]|volume=3}}</ref>\n\nA third town by this name, [[Shuwaykah]],<!-- This determination is based on the conclusion of modern-day historical geographers who all concur that the Arabic name \"Shuwaykah\", in all places, is a corruption of the Hebrew word \"Sukho\".

The biblical account states that the [[Philistines]] encamped between Sokho and Azekah in the [[Valley of Elah]] before [[Goliath]]'s historic encounter with [[David]], the son of Jesse ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 17:1}}). David slew the Philistine giant with a stone slung from a shepherd's sling. [[Rehoboam]] fortified the place ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 11:7}}), but it is not clear which of the two sites is referred to.<ref>{{Citation |contribution= |title= The Anchor Bible Dictionary|editor-last1=Freedman |editor-first1=David Noel |editor-last2= |editor-first2=  |editor-link= David Noel Freedman|volume= 6 |publisher= |place =New York|page=s.v. Socho |year=1992 }}</ref> Socho was one of the cities occupied temporarily by the Philistines in the time of [[Ahaz]] ({{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles 28:18}}).\n\nThe word \"Sokho\" appears on certain [[LMLK seal]]s during the [[Kingdom of Judah|Judean monarchy]]. It is believed by many scholars to be one of four cities that acted in some administrative capacity.\n\nThe [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] [[Rabbi]] [[Antigonus of Sokho]], mentioned in ''Ethics of the Fathers'' ([[Pirkei Avot]] 1:3), likely came from the Hebron-region town. Rabbi Levi Sukia, of the first generation of [[Amoraim]], also came from Sokho (Jerusalem Talmud, Eruvim).\n\nIn [[Byzantine]] times, [[Eusebius]] described Sokho (\u03a3\u03bf\u03ba\u03c7\u03c9\u03b8) as a double village at the ninth milestone between [[Eleutheropolis]] (Bet Guvrin) and Jerusalem (Eusebius, ''[[Onomasticon (Eusebius)|Onomasticon]]'' 156:18 ff.), which would correspond to the Elah Valley location. The 6th-century [[Madaba Map]] also depicts Sokho (\u03a3\u03c9\u03ba\u03c9).\n\n==Givat HaTurmusim==\n[[File:Cave-like cistern at Tel-Socho (Khirbet Shuweikah) - 2 Feb. 2015.JPG|thumb|Ancient cistern at Tel Socho]]\nThe hill of Tel Sokho is now known as ''Givat HaTurmusim'', or \"Hill of the [[Lupinus pilosus|Lupines]]\". In late March, the entire hill is covered with wild blue mountain lupines (''[[Lupinus pilosus]]'') and becomes a popular outing destination for Israeli families.<ref>[https://www.gemsinisrael.com/the-gems/biblical-places-and-people/the-valley-of-elah/ The Valley of Elah] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208155727/http://www.gemsinisrael.com/e_article000096482.htm |date=2006-02-08 }}</ref>\nThe hill is surrounded by precipitous slopes on its north side, making it almost impassable. Trails ascend the mountain on its northwestern and southeastern sides. The Elah Valley runs in a westerly-easterly direction on its north side, the hilltop affording a good view of the valley below.\n\nOn the elevated plateau, one can see the foundations of ancient dwellings carved into the bedrock with individual chambers divided by broken stone protuberances. Caves and grottoes dot the landscape, and cisterns are carved deep into the rock. Oak trees, fig trees, and terebinths grow on the mountainside and piles of large ashlar boulders, covered with lichen, attest to the presence of a defensive wall around the city in antiquity. According to the biblical narrative, when [[Joshua]] captured the city from the Canaanites, the city and environs became the inheritance of Judah.\n\n==Archaeology==\nA survey of the site in the Elah Valley was conducted in 2010 by Joseph Garfinkel on behalf of the [[Hebrew University]]'s Institute of Archaeology and by Michael Gerald Hasel on behalf of [[Southern Adventist University]].<ref>[[Israel Antiquities Authority]], [http://www.antiquities.org.il/m_digs_eng.aspx?shana=2010 Excavators and Excavations Permit for Year 2010], Survey Permit # S-217</ref> Excavations at the foot of the northern slope exposed a Byzantine building from the 5th to 6th centuries. Remains dating to [[Iron Age II]] were uncovered in another dig at the foot of the northern slope, and walls dating to the Middle Bronze Age were discovered in probe trenches. Potsherds dating to the Late Bronze Age and later periods were gathered, along with a terracotta figurine of reddish-brown clay depicting a naked woman.<ref>[http://www.hadashot-esi.org.il/report_detail_eng.aspx?id=1728 Israel Antiquities Authority]</ref>\n\nThe discovery of a pre\u00ebxilic stamp with the imprint ''[[LMLK seal|La-melekh]]'' ('''\u05dc\u05de\u05dc\u05da'''), and in which Sokho is named with another three cities, has led archaeologists to conclude that Sokho may have served as an administrative or storage center. One of the wells to the west in the valley, mentioned by Claude Conder, was destroyed with explosives by Arab infiltrators (''mistanenim'') in 1956, never being rebuilt. An intensive survey conducted in 2010 included an examination of Middle Bronze and Iron Age burial caves, as well as slag from a pottery workshop (which probably dates to the Crusader/Mamluk period).<ref>{{cite book | author1=Hasel, Michael G. |author2=Garfinkel, Yosef | author3=Weiss, Shifra |title=Socoh of the Judean Shephelah: The 2010 Survey | publisher=Eisenbrauns Inc. | location=Winona Lake, Indiana | date=2017 | isbn=9781575067667}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Levantine archaeology]]\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Tel Socho}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://holyland-pictures.com/tag/shephela-judea/sokho/ Pictures of Tel Sokho]\n*[http://www.archives.gov.il/en/archives/#/Archive/0b071706800225ea/File/0b07170680e3a69e Jebel Shuweikeh Forest Reserve, 1926], British Mandate document, designating forest as State Domain\n\n[[Category:Canaanite cities]]\n[[Category:Archaeology of Palestine (region)]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Israel]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the West Bank]]\n[[Category:Ancient Israel and Judah]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in the State of Palestine]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Israel]]\n[[Category:Hebrew Bible cities]]\n[[Category:Establishments in the Kingdom of Judah]]\n[[Category:Tells]]\n[[Category:Kingdom of Judah]]\n[[Category:Biblical geography]]\n", "name_user": "CaeserKaiser", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokho"}
