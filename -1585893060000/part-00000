The film was written by [[Jon Hurwitz]] and [[Hayden Schlossberg]], and directed by [[Danny Leiner]].\n\nThe story follows Harold Lee ([[John Cho]]) and Kumar Patel ([[Kal Penn]]) as they decide to go to the fast food chain [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] after smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], but end up on a series of comical misadventures along the way.\n\nThe film also features [[Fred Willard]], [[Paula Garc\u00e9s]], [[Anthony Anderson]], Dan Bochart, [[Ethan Embry]], [[Jamie Kennedy]], [[Bobby Lee]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Shaun Majumder]], [[David Krumholtz]], [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]], [[Malin \u00c5kerman]], and [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who plays a fictionalized version of himself.\n\n==Plot==\nInvestment banker cubicle worker Harold Lee is persuaded by his colleagues to do their work while they leave for the weekend. Meanwhile, Kumar Patel attends a medical school interview, but intentionally botches it to avoid getting accepted. Harold is attracted to his neighbor, Maria, but is unable to admit his feelings. After smoking marijuana and seeing an advertisement for [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], the pair decide to get hamburgers. After traveling to the nearest White Castle in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]], they find it replaced by \"Burger Shack\". The drive-thru employee informs them of another White Castle in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]].\n\nKumar suggests stopping at [[Princeton University]] to buy more marijuana. Kumar buys marijuana from one of the students and they are discovered by campus security and forced to flee, losing their marijuana. They resume their drive, and when Kumar pulls over to urinate, a raccoon gets in the car and bites Harold.  Kumar takes Harold to a hospital where Kumar's father and older brother work. After Kumar's father confronts him over the failed interview, Kumar fakes an apology and steals ID badges to obtain [[medical cannabis|medical marijuana]]. However, Kumar is then mistaken for his brother and is forced to perform surgery on a gunshot victim. To the amazement of Harold and the nurses, Kumar effortlessly saves the patient\u2019s life in the nick of time; afterwards, the patient tells them how to reach White Castle.\n\nKumar spots Maria at a movie theater and decides to get her attention so Harold can talk to her, but Harold panics and crashes the car. They are rescued by Freakshow, a tow-truck driver covered with oozing boils, who takes them to his house to repair their car. Harold and Kumar are propositioned by Freakshow's surprisingly alluring wife, but after Freakshow suggests a [[foursome (group sex)|foursome]], Harold and Kumar flee in disgust. Kumar picks up a hitchhiker, [[Neil Patrick Harris]], who is high on [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. Harold and Kumar go into a convenience store to get directions and Harris drives away in their car. The duo are then harassed by a racist police officer for jaywalking. Harold attempts to punch Kumar for antagonizing the officer, but ends up punching the officer instead, resulting in his arrest.\n\nKumar makes a 911 call to distract the police and breaks into the station to free Harold. After Harold and Kumar flee, they encounter an escaped cheetah. After smoking marijuana with it, they decide to ride it to White Castle. Harold hits his head on a branch, destroying his laptop containing all the work that he just completed for his coworkers. Harold and a reluctant Kumar decide to not continue on their trek, but after encountering a group of extreme sports punks who have been harassing the pair, the duo change their mind and steal their truck. A State trooper spots the speeding truck and chases them. They are trapped when they reach the edge of a cliff. Spotting the White Castle below, Harold and Kumar use a hang glider from the truck to reach their destination.\n\nThe pair place their orders but are disheartened to find they have no money. Harris suddenly appears, having craved the food when hearing them talk about it and pays for their meal as an apology for stealing their car; he also further pays for \"repairs\". Kumar realizes he wants to be a doctor, but is afraid of conforming to the stereotype of Indians becoming doctors. Harold then notices his co-workers pull up and gets angry at them because they said they had to work with clients but were actually out partying. He tells them off and threatens to get them fired if it happens again.\n\nAfter returning to their apartment they encounter Maria, Harold professes his feelings for her and they kiss. She informs Harold that she is leaving for [[Amsterdam]] but will return in ten days. Kumar convinces Harold to go with him to Amsterdam to pursue Maria, reminding him that marijuana is legal in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nDuring the end credits, it's revealed in a news report that Harold's Black cellmate and a Black Attorney who the officers arrested due to Kumar's call have sued them for police brutality and wrongful arrest, which results in their arrests, the State Trooper has arrested the sports punks for destruction of convenience stores and shopping malls after finding a bag of marijuana, which actually belonged to the duo in their truck, and the police are looking for Harold and Kumar after escaping from the station. The two look at the police sketches of them, which are simply two racist stereotypes, and laugh as the movie ends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n* [[John Cho]] as Harold Lee, a second-generation [[Korean-Americans|Korean-American]] man working at his first job in [[investment banking]].\n* [[Kal Penn]] as Kumar Patel, a second generation [[Indian American|Indian-American]] whose family thinks that he will become a doctor like his father and brother.\n* [[Paula Garc\u00e9s]] as Maria Perez, Harold and Kumar's neighbor, on whom Harold has a crush.\n* [[Neil Patrick Harris]] as a fictionalized version of himself.\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as an OR nurse\n* [[David Krumholtz]] as Goldstein, Harold and Kumar's neighbor and Rosenberg's roommate\n* [[Eddie Kaye Thomas]] as Rosenberg, Harold and Kumar's neighbor and Goldstein's roommate\n* [[Brooke D'Orsay]] as Clarissa, twin sister student at Princeton University who agreed to smoke weed with Kumar\n* [[Kate Kelton]] as Chrissy, twin sister student at Princeton University who agreed to smoke weed with Kumar\n* [[Steve Braun (actor)|Steve Braun]] as Cole, the leader of a reoccurring gang of five obnoxious [[Extreme sport|extreme-sports]]-obsessed delinquents who often harass the pair or others around them.\n* [[Christopher Meloni]] as Randy/Freakshow, a car mechanic with infected pimples on his face and neck who fixed Harold and Kumar's car\n* Sandy Jobin Bevans as Officer Palumbo, a racist police officer who bullies Harold and Kumar.\n* [[Fred Willard]] as Dr. Willoughby, medical school dean who interviewed Kumar\n* [[Robert Tinkler]] as J.D.\n* [[Anthony Anderson]] as the Burger Shack Employee\n* [[Siu Ta]] as Cindy Kim, student at Princeton University who has a crush on Harold\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Liane, Freakshow's wife\n* [[Dov Tiefenbach]] as Bradley Thomas, student at Princeton University who sold weed to Kumar\n* [[Gary Anthony Williams]] as Tarik Jackson, a philosophical black man who has been arrested for being black\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as E.R.

It was the second round of the [[2000 Formula One World Championship]] and the 29th overall edition of the [[Brazilian Grand Prix|event]]. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race from a third position start. [[Giancarlo Fisichella]] of the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] team finished in second and [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan]]'s [[Heinz-Harald Frentzen]] was third.\n\n[[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] of the [[McLaren]] team took [[pole position]] by recording the fastest lap in qualifying.

He retook the lead after H\u00e4kkinen retired with a loss of engine oil pressure ten laps later. [[David Coulthard]] in the other McLaren reduced the advantage of Michael Schumacher in the final 12 laps as the latter slowed to manage an [[oil pressure]] problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season, his third in Brazil and the 37th of his career.\n\nAfter the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate.

Fisichella moved from fifth to second as [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race.

It was the second round of the [[2000 Formula One World Championship]] and the 29th overall edition of the [[Brazilian Grand Prix|event]]. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Michael Schumacher]] won the 71-lap race from a third position start.

Thereafter, Michael Schumacher opened up a 17.6 second lead before his first of two [[pit stop]]s for fuel and tyres on lap 20. He retook the lead after H\u00e4kkinen retired with a loss of engine oil pressure ten laps later. [[David Coulthard]] in the other McLaren reduced the advantage of Michael Schumacher in the final 12 laps as the latter slowed to manage an [[oil pressure]] problem. He was not close enough to make a pass for the win and Michael Schumacher took his second consecutive victory of the season, his third in Brazil and the 37th of his career.\n\nAfter the race, Coulthard was disqualified from second place due to an illegal front wing endplate. McLaren filed an appeal to the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]]'s International Court of Appeal, which was rejected. It advanced every driver who finished behind Coulthard by a single position. The result extended Michael Schumacher's lead atop the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]] to 12 [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|points]]. Fisichella moved from fifth to second as [[Rubens Barrichello]] in the second Ferrari fell to third after not finishing the race.

The country became an independent [[nation]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] on 15 August 1947. Direct administration by the British, which began in 1858, effected a political and economic unification of the subcontinent. When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries\u2014India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/India|title=India {{!}} History, Map, Population, Economy, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>Concurrently the Muslim-majority northwest and east of [[British India]] was separated into the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], by the [[partition of India]]. The partition led to a [[population transfer]] of more than 10 million people between India and Pakistan and the death of about one million people. [[Indian National Congress]] leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] became the first [[Prime Minister of India]], but the leader most associated with the [[Indian independence movement|independence struggle]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], accepted no office.

India has unresolved territorial disputes with [[China]] which in 1962 escalated into the [[Sino-Indian War]], and with [[Pakistan]] which resulted in wars in [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947|1947]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|1965]], [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971]] and [[Kargil War|1999]].

Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] boundaries, and the cities of [[Calcutta]], [[Delhi]] and [[Lahore]]. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of [[Mohandas Gandhi]], the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a ''fast-unto-death'' in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the [[Indian Army]] was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\n\nThe [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination of Mohandas Gandhi]] on 30 January 1948 was carried out by [[Nathuram Vinayak Godse]], a nationalist, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\n\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into [[West Bengal]] and other states from [[East Pakistan]], owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this [[appeasement]], Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\n\n===Integration of princely states===\n{{Main|Political integration of India}}\n{{Infobox\n| title = [[Political integration of India]]\n| image =\n{{image array|perrow=2|width=180|height=150\n| image1 = Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|caption1=[[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] as [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister for Home and States Affairs]] had the responsibility of welding the British Indian provinces and the princely states into a united India.\n| image2 = Op Polo Surrender.jpg|caption2=[[General El Edroos]] (at right) offers his surrender of the [[Hyderabad State]] Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]] at [[Secunderabad]].\n| image3 = Maharani kanchan prabhadevi.jpg|caption3=Queen [[Kanchan Prava Devi|Kanchan Prabha Devi]] of the [[Kingdom of Tripura]] signed the [[instrument of accession]] to India.

The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in some cases in particular \u2014 [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] \u2014 after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented nation with independent provinces and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of the military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and [[V. P. Menon]] convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made [[Rajpramukh]] (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashra]], [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|PEPSU]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Bharat]]. Some princely states such as [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]] and [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] acceded later in 1949.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\n# [[Junagadh]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) \u2013 a December 1947 [[plebiscite]] resulted in a 99% vote<ref name=\"RJ\">{{cite book\n|last = Gandhi\n|first = Rajmohan\n|authorlink = Rajmohan Gandhi\n|year = 1991\n|title = Patel: A Life\n|publisher = Navajivan\n|location = India\n|id = ASIN B0006EYQ0A\n|page = 292\n}}</ref> to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the [[Nawab]] against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly [[Hindu]] and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.\n# [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)\u2013 Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the [[Nizam]], code-named [[Operation Polo]], after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13\u201317 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\n# The area of [[Kashmir]] (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the [[First Indo-Pakistani War]] which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] initially agreed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten's]] proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state.\n\n===Constitution===\n{{Main|Constitution of India}}\nThe [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]] became the first [[President of India]]. The three words 'socialist', 'secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976.\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948===\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\n[[File:Indian soldiers fighting in 1947 war.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Indian soldiers during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]].]]\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948 was fought between [[Union of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] over the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]] from 1947 to 1948.

Although resisted by Desai and India's business community, the policy was popular with the masses.

In 1974, the [[Allahabad]] High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi. In 1975, Gandhi advised President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] to declare a [[state of emergency]] under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many [[civil liberties]] and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned and a programme of compulsory birth control introduced.<ref name=\"BBC India Profile and Timeline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12641776|title=India profile \u2013 Timeline|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\n\nIndia's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and [[authoritarian]] conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's son and political advisor, [[Sanjay Gandhi]], was accused of committing gross excesses \u2013 Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced [[vasectomies]] of men and [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]] of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in [[Delhi]] near the Turkmen Gate, which left thousands of people dead and many more displaced.\n\n===Janata interlude===\n{{Main|Janata Party}}\n[[File:Morarji Desai 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Morarji Desai]], the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India, signing the \"New Delhi\" declaration during a visit by US President [[Jimmy Carter]].]]\nIndira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the [[Janata Party]], an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of opposition parties.<ref>M.R.

The economic reforms were a reaction to an [[1991 Indian economic crisis|impending balance of payment crisis]]. The Rao administration initiated the [[privatisation]] of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound [[fiscal policy]] aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works. Cities like [[Bangalore]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Pune]], and [[Ahmedabad]] have risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment and firms.

With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the [[Janata Dal]] emerged to form a government known as the United Front.

[[Inder Kumar Gujral]] replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition.\n\nIn November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with Vajpayee again serving as Prime Minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of five underground nuclear weapons tests, known collectively as [[Pokhran-II]] \u2014 which caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year.<ref>''CIA Factbook''.

Communal violence killed an estimated one million Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and gravely destabilised both dominions along their [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] boundaries, and the cities of [[Calcutta]], [[Delhi]] and [[Lahore]]. The violence was stopped by early September owing to the co-operative efforts of both Indian and Pakistani leaders, and especially due to the efforts of [[Mohandas Gandhi]], the leader of the Indian freedom struggle, who undertook a ''fast-unto-death'' in Calcutta and later in Delhi to calm people and emphasise peace despite the threat to his life. Both governments constructed large relief camps for incoming and leaving refugees, and the [[Indian Army]] was mobilised to provide humanitarian assistance on a massive scale.\n\nThe [[assassination of Mahatma Gandhi|assassination of Mohandas Gandhi]] on 30 January 1948 was carried out by [[Nathuram Vinayak Godse]], a nationalist, who held him responsible for partition and charged that Mohandas Gandhi was appeasing Muslims. More than one million people flooded the streets of Delhi to follow the procession to cremation grounds and pay their last respects.\n\nIn 1949, India recorded almost 1 million Hindu refugees into [[West Bengal]] and other states from [[East Pakistan]], owing to communal violence, intimidation, and repression from Muslim authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, who were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this [[appeasement]], Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Although opposed to the principle, Patel decided to back this pact for the sake of peace, and played a critical role in garnering support from West Bengal and across India, and enforcing the provisions of the pact. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral disputes through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir dispute.\n\n===Integration of princely states===\n{{Main|Political integration of India}}\n{{Infobox\n| title = [[Political integration of India]]\n| image =\n{{image array|perrow=2|width=180|height=150\n| image1 = Sardar patel (cropped).jpg|caption1=[[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] as [[Minister of Home Affairs (India)|Minister for Home and States Affairs]] had the responsibility of welding the British Indian provinces and the princely states into a united India.\n| image2 = Op Polo Surrender.jpg|caption2=[[General El Edroos]] (at right) offers his surrender of the [[Hyderabad State]] Forces to Major General (later General and Army Chief) [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]] at [[Secunderabad]].\n| image3 = Maharani kanchan prabhadevi.jpg|caption3=Queen [[Kanchan Prava Devi|Kanchan Prabha Devi]] of the [[Kingdom of Tripura]] signed the [[instrument of accession]] to India.

The provinces were given to India or Pakistan, in some cases in particular \u2014 [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] \u2014 after being partitioned. The princes of the princely states, however, were given the right to either remain independent or join either dominion. Thus India's leaders were faced with the prospect of inheriting a fragmented nation with independent provinces and kingdoms dispersed across the mainland. Under the leadership of [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], the new Government of India employed political negotiations backed with the option (and, on several occasions, the use) of the military action to ensure the primacy of the central government and of the Constitution then being drafted. Sardar Patel and [[V. P. Menon]] convinced the rulers of princely states contiguous to India to accede to India. Many rights and privileges of the rulers of the princely states, especially their personal estates and privy purses, were guaranteed to convince them to accede. Some of them were made [[Rajpramukh]] (governor) and Uprajpramukh (deputy governor) of the merged states. Many small princely states were merged to form viable administrative states such as [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashra]], [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|PEPSU]], [[Vindhya Pradesh]] and [[Madhya Bharat]]. Some princely states such as [[Tripura (princely state)|Tripura]] and [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipur]] acceded later in 1949.\n\nThere were three states that proved more difficult to integrate than others:\n# [[Junagadh]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim Nawab) \u2013 a December 1947 [[plebiscite]] resulted in a 99% vote<ref name=\"RJ\">{{cite book\n|last = Gandhi\n|first = Rajmohan\n|authorlink = Rajmohan Gandhi\n|year = 1991\n|title = Patel: A Life\n|publisher = Navajivan\n|location = India\n|id = ASIN B0006EYQ0A\n|page = 292\n}}</ref> to merge with India, annulling the controversial accession to Pakistan, which was made by the [[Nawab]] against the wishes of the people of the state who were overwhelmingly [[Hindu]] and despite Junagadh not being contiguous with Pakistan.\n# [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] (Hindu-majority state with a Muslim nizam)\u2013 Patel ordered the Indian army to depose the government of the [[Nizam]], code-named [[Operation Polo]], after the failure of negotiations, which was done between 13\u201317 September 1948. It was incorporated as a state of India the next year.\n# The area of [[Kashmir]] (Muslim-majority state with a Hindu king) in the far north of the subcontinent quickly became a source of controversy that erupted into the [[First Indo-Pakistani War]] which lasted from 1947 to 1949. Eventually, a United Nations-overseen ceasefire was agreed that left India in control of two-thirds of the contested region. [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] initially agreed to [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten's]] proposal that a plebiscite be held in the entire state as soon as hostilities ceased, and a UN-sponsored cease-fire was agreed to by both parties on 1 Jan. 1949. No statewide plebiscite was held, however, for in 1954, after Pakistan began to receive arms from the United States, Nehru withdrew his support. The Indian Constitution came into force in Kashmir on 26 January 1950 with special clauses for the state.\n\n===Constitution===\n{{Main|Constitution of India}}\nThe [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] adopted the Constitution of India, drafted by a committee headed by Dr. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], on 26 November 1949. India became a sovereign democratic republic after its constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]] became the first [[President of India]]. The three words 'socialist', 'secular' and 'integrity' were added later with the 42nd Constitution Amendment 1976.\n\n===Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948===\n{{main|Indo-Pakistani War of 1947}}\n[[File:Indian soldiers fighting in 1947 war.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Indian soldiers during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]].]]\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1947\u20131948 was fought between [[Union of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] over the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]] from 1947 to 1948.

She successfully ended the [[Privy Purse in India|Privy Purse]] guarantee for former Indian royalty, and waged a major offensive against party hierarchy over the nationalisation of India's banks. Although resisted by Desai and India's business community, the policy was popular with the masses.

In 1974, the [[Allahabad]] High Court found Indira Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted nationwide strikes and protests demanding her immediate resignation. Various political parties united under [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] to resist what he termed Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading strikes across India that paralysed its economy and administration, Narayan even called for the Army to oust Gandhi. In 1975, Gandhi advised President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] to declare a [[state of emergency]] under the constitution, which allowed the central government to assume sweeping powers to defend law and order in the nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order and threat to national security as her primary reasons, Gandhi suspended many [[civil liberties]] and postponed elections at national and state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition political leaders and activists were imprisoned and a programme of compulsory birth control introduced.<ref name=\"BBC India Profile and Timeline\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-south-asia-12641776|title=India profile \u2013 Timeline|date=15 August 2018|accessdate=15 August 2018|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Strikes and public protests were outlawed in all forms.\n\nIndia's economy benefited from an end to paralysing strikes and political disorder. India announced a 20-point programme which enhanced agricultural and industrial production, increasing national growth, productivity, and job growth. But many organs of government and many Congress politicians were accused of corruption and [[authoritarian]] conduct. Police officers were accused of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's son and political advisor, [[Sanjay Gandhi]], was accused of committing gross excesses \u2013 Sanjay was blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced [[vasectomies]] of men and [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]] of women as a part of the initiative to control population growth, and for the demolition of slums in [[Delhi]] near the Turkmen Gate, which left thousands of people dead and many more displaced.\n\n===Janata interlude===\n{{Main|Janata Party}}\n[[File:Morarji Desai 1978.jpg|thumb|[[Morarji Desai]], the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India, signing the \"New Delhi\" declaration during a visit by US President [[Jimmy Carter]].]]\nIndira Gandhi's Congress Party called for general elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating electoral defeat at the hands of the [[Janata Party]], an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of opposition parties.<ref>M.R.

In [[Assam]], there were many incidents of communal violence between native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as well as settlers from other parts of India. When Indian forces, undertaking [[Operation Blue Star]], raided the hideout of self-rule pressing<ref name=\"BBC India Profile and Timeline\"/> [[Khalistan]] militants in the [[Golden Temple]] \u2014 Sikhs\u2019 most holy shrine \u2014 in [[Amritsar]], the inadvertent deaths of civilians and damage to the temple building inflamed tensions in the Sikh community across India. The Government used intensive police operations to crush militant operations, but it resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties. Northeast India was paralysed owing to the [[ULFA]]'s clash with Government forces.\n\nOn 31 October 1984, the Prime Minister's own Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]] erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab, causing the deaths of thousands of Sikhs along with terrible pillage, arson, and rape. Senior members of the Congress Party have been implicated in stirring the violence against Sikhs. Government investigation has failed to date to discover the causes and punish the perpetrators, but public opinion blamed Congress leaders for directing attacks on Sikhs in Delhi.\n\n===Rajiv Gandhi administration===\n[[File:STS008-44-611.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[INSAT]] system is the largest domestic communication system in the [[Asia Pacific]] Region.

Rajiv had been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40, was the youngest national political leader and Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience were an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and looking for newer policies and a fresh start to resolve the country's long-standing problems. The Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the Congress party to its largest majority in history (over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a sympathy vote over his mother's assassination.<ref>{{cite news | work=BBC News | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/29/newsid_3314000/3314987.stm | title =  \n1984: Rajiv Gandhi wins landslide election victory | date=29 December 1984 | accessdate=1 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms: the [[Licence Raj]] was loosened, and government restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign investment, and imports decreased considerably. This allowed private businesses to use resources and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of foreign investment increased India's national reserves. As Prime Minister, Rajiv broke from his mother's precedent to improve relations with the United States, which increased economic aid and scientific co-operation.

India's domestic politics also took new shape, as traditional alignments by [[caste]], creed, and ethnicity gave way to a plethora of small, regionally-based political parties.\n\nBut India was rocked by communal violence (see [[Bombay riots]]) between Hindus and Muslims that killed over 10,000 people, following the [[Babri Mosque]] demolition by Hindu extremists in the course of the [[Ram Janmabhoomi]] dispute in [[Ayodhya]] in 1992. The final months of the Rao-led government in the spring of 1996 suffered the effects of several major political corruption scandals, which contributed to the worst electoral performance by the Congress Party in its history as the Hindu nationalist [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] emerged as the largest single party.\n\n===Economic reforms===\n{{Main|Economic liberalisation in India}}\n{{See also|Indian Century}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Pumapaparti.N.rao.jpg\n| width1 = 125\n| alt1 = P.

Narasimha Rao#Economic reforms|policies]] initiated by late Prime Minister [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]] and his then-Finance Minister Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]], India's economy expanded rapidly. The economic reforms were a reaction to an [[1991 Indian economic crisis|impending balance of payment crisis]]. The Rao administration initiated the [[privatisation]] of large, inefficient, and loss-inducing government corporations. The UF government had attempted a progressive budget that encouraged reforms, but the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] and political instability created economic stagnation. The Vajpayee administration continued with privatisation, reduction of taxes, a sound [[fiscal policy]] aimed at reducing deficits and debts, and increased initiatives for public works. Cities like [[Bangalore]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Pune]], and [[Ahmedabad]] have risen in prominence and economic importance, becoming centres of rising industries and destinations for foreign investment and firms. Strategies like forming Special Economic Zones \u2013 tax amenities, good communications infrastructure, low regulation \u2013 to encourage industries has paid off in many parts of the country.<ref name=\"oecdindia2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf |title=Economic Survey of India 2007: Policy Brief |publisher=OECD |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606112149/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/17/52/39452196.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA rising generation of well-educated and skilled professionals in scientific sectors of the industry began propelling the Indian economy, as the information technology industry took hold across India with the proliferation of computers. The new technologies increased the efficiency of activity in almost every type of industry, which also benefitted from the availability of skilled labor. Foreign investment and outsourcing of jobs to India's labor markets further enhanced India's economic growth. A large middle class has arisen across India, which has increased the demand, and thus the production of a wide array of [[consumer goods]]. Unemployment is steadily declining, and [[poverty]] has fallen to approximately 22%. Gross Domestic Product growth increased to beyond 7%. While serious challenges remain, India is enjoying a period of economic expansion that has propelled it to the forefront of the world economy, and has correspondingly increased its influence in political and diplomatic terms.{{sfn|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p = 304}}\n\n===Era of coalitions===\n[[File:Agni-II missile (Republic Day Parade 2004).jpeg|thumb|250px|Nuclear capable [[Agni-II|Agni-II ballistic missile]]. Since May 1998, India declared itself to be a full-fledged nuclear state.]]\nThe [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) emerged from the May 1996 national elections as the single-largest party in the [[Lok Sabha]] but without enough strength to prove a majority on the floor of that Parliament. Under Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days. With all political parties wishing to avoid another round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by the [[Janata Dal]] emerged to form a government known as the United Front. A United Front government under former [[Chief Minister of Karnataka]] [[H.D. Deve Gowda]] lasted less than a year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew support in March 1997. [[Inder Kumar Gujral]] replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front coalition.\n\nIn November 1997, the Congress Party again withdrew support for the United Front. New elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March 1998, the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition government, with Vajpayee again serving as Prime Minister. On 11 and 13 May 1998, this government conducted a series of five underground nuclear weapons tests, known collectively as [[Pokhran-II]] \u2014 which caused Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year.<ref>''CIA Factbook''.

In May and June 1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign of terrorist infiltration that resulted in the [[Kargil War]] in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace process that had begun only three months earlier when Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan, inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore bus service.

[[Manmohan Singh]] became the Prime Minister, after the Congress President [[Sonia Gandhi]], the widow of former Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], declined to take the office, in order to defuse the controversy about whether her foreign birth should be considered a disqualification for the Prime Minister's post. The Congress formed a coalition called the United Progressive Alliance with Socialist and regional parties, and enjoyed the outside support of India's [[Communist Party of India|Communist parties]].
