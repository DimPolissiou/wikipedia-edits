From arstechnica on 04/02: \"California has 8,200 confirmed cases. On a per-capita basis, that makes California about average among the states. However, that figure comes with a big caveat: California has only gotten results back for about 30,000 tests, and it says it has 57,400 test results pending. The tests returned so far have shown a positive rate of 27 percent. If the backlogged specimens are positive at a similar rate, it will add thousands of people to California's count of confirmed coronavirus carriers.

The tests returned so far have shown a positive rate of 27 percent.

Officially styled '''Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria''', the Vice President is elected alongside the President in national elections. The office is currently held by [[Yemi Osinbajo]].\n\n==Eligibility==\nA person shall be eligible for the office of Vice President if he or she is a citizen of [[Nigeria]] by birth, at least 40 years of age, is a member of a political [[List of political parties in Nigeria|party]] and is sponsored by that political party'\n\n==Oath of office==\nThe [[Constitution of Nigeria]] specifies an oath of office for the Vice President of the federation. The oath is administered by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Nigeria or the person for the time being appointed to exercise the functions of that office. It is the same oath recited by Deputy State Governors, [[Federal Executive Council (Nigeria)|Ministers]], Commissioners and Special Advisers to the President:\n{{cquote|I, do solemnly swear/affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Federal Republic of Nigeria; that as Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I will discharge my duties to the best of my ability, faithfully and in accordance with the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the law, and always in the interest of the sovereignty, integrity, solidarity, well-being and prosperity of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; that I will strive to preserve the Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy contained in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; that I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions, that I will to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; that I will abide by the Code of Conduct contained in the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; that in all circumstances, I will do right to all manner of people, according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will; that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as Vice-President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. So help me God.}}\n\n==Functions of the Vice President of Nigeria==\nThe executive functions of the Nigerian vice president includes participation in all cabinet meetings and, by statute, membership in the [[National Security Council]], the National Defence Council, [[Cabinet of Nigeria|Federal Executive Council]], and the Chairman of [[National Economic Council]]. Although the vice president may take an active role in establishing policy in the Executive Branch by serving on such committees and councils, the relative power of the Nigerian vice president's office depends upon the duties delegated by the president.\n\n== List of Vice Presidents ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=2\n|- bgcolor=#cccccc\n!

She speaks [[English language|English]] and has acted in several international and English language productions. Among the directors she worked with were [[Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3]], [[G\u00f6tz Spielmann]], [[Tom Tykwer]], [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]], [[Robert Dornhelm]], and [[Doris D\u00f6rrie]].  She is also an accomplished vocalist, and has been recorded several times, though she has always made acting her primary focus.\n\nAt the [[59th Berlin International Film Festival]] 2009 Minichmayr was awarded the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]] for her performance in [[Maren Ade]]'s ''Alle Anderen'' ([[Everyone Else]]).\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Date'''\n| '''Film'''\n| '''Role'''\n| '''Director'''\n| '''Notes'''\n|-\n| 2000\n| ''[[The Farewell (2000 film)|Abschied]]''\n| Barbara Brecht\n| [[Jan Sch\u00fctte]]\n|\n|-\n| 2000\n| ''[[Tatort]] - B\u00f6ses Blut''\n| Kathi\n| [[Peter S\u00e4mann]]\n| TV film - Awarded [[Nestroy Theatre Prize|Nestroy Prize]] for ''Best Young Talent''\n|-\n| 2001\n| ''[[Taking Sides (film)|Taking Sides]]''\n| Emmi Straube\n| [[Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3]]\n|\n|-\n| 2001\n| ''[[Spiel im Morgengrauen]]''\n| Steffi\n| [[G\u00f6tz Spielmann]]\n| TV film\n|-\n| 2002\n| ''[[Liegen Lernen]]''\n| Tina\n| [[Hendrik Handloeghten]]\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| ''[[Hotel (2004 film)|Hotel]]''\n| Petra\n| [[Jessica Hausner]]\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]''\n| [[Gerda Christian]]\n| [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]]\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| ''[[Spiele Leben]]''\n| Tanja\n| [[Antonin Svoboda (director)|Antonin Svoboda]]\n|\n|-\n| 2004\n| ''[[Daniel K\u00e4fer]] - Die Villen der Frau H\u00fcrsch''\n| Mirz Schl\u00f6mmer\n| [[Julian P\u00f6lsner]]\n| TV film\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''[[Perfume: The Story of a Murderer]]''\n| Grenouille's Mother\n| [[Tom Tykwer]]\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''[[Fallen (2005 film)|Fallen]]''\n| Brigitte\n| [[Barbara Albert]]\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Krankheit der Jugend]]''\n| \n| Students of [[Michael Haneke]]\n|\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kronprinz Rudolfs letzte Liebe (2006)|de|3=Kronprinz Rudolfs letzte Liebe (2006)|lt=Kronprinz Rudolfs letzte Liebe}}''\n| [[Mizzi Kasper]]\n| [[Robert Dornhelm]]\n| TV film\n|-\n| 2006\n| ''[[Polizeiruf 110]] - Kellers Kind''\n| Aglaia\n| [[Titus Selge]]\n| TV film\n|-\n| 2007\n| ''[[Midsummer Madness (2007 film)|Midsummer Madness]]'' \n| Maja\n| [[Alexander Hahn (film director)|Alexander Hahn]]\n|\n|-\n| 2008\n| ''[[Cherry Blossoms (film)|Kirschbl\u00fcten - Hanami]]''\n| Karolin Angermeier  \n| [[Doris D\u00f6rrie]]\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[Der Knochenmann]]''\n| Birgit\n| [[Wolfgang Murnberger]]\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[The White Ribbon]]''\n| Frieda\n| [[Michael Haneke]]\n|\n|-\n| 2009\n| ''[[Everyone Else]]''\n| Gitti\n| [[Maren Ade]]\n|\n|-\n| 2012\n| ''[[Mercy (2012 film)|Mercy]]''\n| Maria\n| [[Matthias Glasner]]\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|''[[Jack (2015 film)|Jack]]''\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|''[[Animals (2017 film)|Animals]]''\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n* 2000: [[Nestroy Theatre Prize|Nestroy Prize]] for Best Young Talent\n* 2004/2009: Nestroy Prize for Best Actress<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=21 November 2004 |title=\"Nestroy\"-Preis an Toni Slama und Birgit Minichmayr |url=https://www.derstandard.at/story/1865533/nestroy-preis-an-toni-slama-und-birgit-minichmayr |work=[[Der Standard]] |location=Vienna |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=12 October 2009 |title=Nestroy: Birgit Minichmayr r\u00e4umt doppelt ab |url=https://www.diepresse.com/514596/nestroy-birgit-minichmayr-raumt-doppelt-ab |work=[[Die Presse]] |location=Vienna |access-date=13 October 2019}}</ref>\n* 2009: 59th Berlin International Film Festival, Best Actress for [[Everyone Else]]\n* 2010: German Film Awards, Nomination Best Actress for [[Everyone Else]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb name|0591352}}\n\n{{Silver Bear for Best Actress}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minichmayr, Birgit}}\n[[Category:Austrian film actresses]]\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:People from Linz]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Shakespearean actresses]]\n[[Category:Austrian stage actresses]]\n[[Category:Silver Bear for Best Actress winners]]\n[[Category:21st-century Austrian actresses]]\n[[Category:Austrian female singers]]\n[[Category:Austrian television actresses]]\n", "name_user": "Diopic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:more accurate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birgit_Minichmayr"}

His books include ''Lizard Music'', ''The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death'', ''Fat Men from Space'', ''[[Borgel]]'', and the picture book ''[[The Big Orange Splot]]''. He has also written an adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', and essay collections derived from his talks on [[National Public Radio]].\n\nMany elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.\n\nPinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.\n\nPinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \"Daniel Pinkwater\", \"Daniel M. Pinkwater\", \"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\", \"D. Manus Pinkwater\").\n\nHe was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrant parents from [[Poland]].  He describes his father as a \"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\" His parents moved to [[Chicago]], where he grew up. He attended [[Bard College]].\n\n==Themes==\nPinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (''Lizard Music''), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (''[[Borgel]]''), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar [[radio]] antennae (''Fat Men from Space'').  They are often, though not always, set in thinly\u2014or not at all\u2014disguised versions of Chicago and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head.  This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in ''Lizard Music'' he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man.  Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the [[Chicago Loop]] that changed features daily and stayed open all night), [[Bughouse Square]], and Ed & Fred's Red Hots.  Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in [[Yiddish]]-influenced dialogue or participating in [[Borscht Belt]] culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \"-stein\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \"Wentworthstein\").\n\nIn 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky [[Catskills]] resort populated by \"circumferentially challenged\" deceased.\n\n==Comics and radio==\nPinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip ''[[Norb (comic)|Norb]]'', which was illustrated by [[Tony Auth]].  The strip, syndicated by [[King Features]], was cancelled after 52 weeks.<ref>\n[http://www.toonopedia.com/norb.htm Norb] ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'',  accessed on May 10, 2007.</ref>  The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by [[MU Press]] in 1992.\n\nPinkwater is also a longtime commentator on [[National Public Radio]].  He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's ''Weekend Edition Saturday''.  For several years, he had his own NPR show: ''Chinwag Theater''.  Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of [[automobile]]s.  In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.\n\n==Challenged book==\nFollowing an appearance by Pinkwater on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''[[This American Life]]'',<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/faustian-bargains?act=4 This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains], broadcast 22 November 1996.

He has also written an adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', and essay collections derived from his talks on [[National Public Radio]].\n\nMany elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.\n\nPinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.\n\nPinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \"Daniel Pinkwater\", \"Daniel M. Pinkwater\", \"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\", \"D. Manus Pinkwater\").\n\nHe was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrant parents from [[Poland]].  He describes his father as a \"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\" His parents moved to [[Chicago]], where he grew up. He attended [[Bard College]].\n\n==Themes==\nPinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (''Lizard Music''), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (''[[Borgel]]''), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar [[radio]] antennae (''Fat Men from Space'').  They are often, though not always, set in thinly\u2014or not at all\u2014disguised versions of Chicago and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head.  This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in ''Lizard Music'' he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man.  Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the [[Chicago Loop]] that changed features daily and stayed open all night), [[Bughouse Square]], and Ed & Fred's Red Hots.  Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in [[Yiddish]]-influenced dialogue or participating in [[Borscht Belt]] culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \"-stein\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \"Wentworthstein\").\n\nIn 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky [[Catskills]] resort populated by \"circumferentially challenged\" deceased.\n\n==Comics and radio==\nPinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip ''[[Norb (comic)|Norb]]'', which was illustrated by [[Tony Auth]].  The strip, syndicated by [[King Features]], was cancelled after 52 weeks.<ref>\n[http://www.toonopedia.com/norb.htm Norb] ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'',  accessed on May 10, 2007.</ref>  The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by [[MU Press]] in 1992.\n\nPinkwater is also a longtime commentator on [[National Public Radio]].  He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's ''Weekend Edition Saturday''.  For several years, he had his own NPR show: ''Chinwag Theater''.  Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of [[automobile]]s.  In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.\n\n==Challenged book==\nFollowing an appearance by Pinkwater on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''[[This American Life]]'',<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/faustian-bargains?act=4 This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains], broadcast 22 November 1996.
