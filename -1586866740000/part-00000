He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident [[George W. Bush]] picked Paul O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be respected by those on Wall Street and Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not in fact turn out to be the good in the role as the Presisent had hoped he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002, as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors. Bush was not just disasified with O'Neil job proformence, he wanted to make it clear to the American people that he was taking the economic downturn that had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously, Bush hoped to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle,  O'Neil did not take his removal well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms, but Bush felt it was the right decision done at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |editor1-last= Desmond |editor1-first= Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-59061-9 |pages=85-86 |url= |chapter=3.

In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-5545-3}}) 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.

He met his wife at [[Anchorage High School]] in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], from which they both graduated in 1954. He lived on the military base there with his parents. He received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Economics]] from [[California State University, Fresno]], studied economics at [[Claremont Graduate University]] in 1961, and received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]]. O'Neill and his wife Nancy Jo have four children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great grandchildren.\n\nHe began his public service as a computer systems analyst with the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Administration]], where he served from 1961 to 1966. He joined the [[United States Office of Management and Budget]] in 1967, and was deputy director of OMB from 1974 to 1977.\n\n==Private sector==\nAfter President [[Gerald Ford]] lost the 1976 election, O'Neill took an executive job at [[International Paper]] in [[New York City]]. He was vice president of the company from 1977 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1987.\n\nIn 1989, he was approached by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to be [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]]. O'Neill declined, but recommended [[Dick Cheney]] for the position. Bush then pursued O'Neill to chair an advisory group on education that included [[Lamar Alexander]], [[Bill Brock]], and [[Richard Riley]].\n\nO'Neill was chairman and CEO of the Pittsburgh industrial giant [[Alcoa]] from 1987 to 1999, and retired as chairman at the end of 2000. At the beginning of his tenure O'Neill encountered significant resistance from the Board of Directors due to his stance on prioritizing [[Occupational safety and health|worker safety]]. The company's market value increased from $3 billion in 1986 to $27.53 billion in 2000, while net income increased from $200 million to $1.484 billion.<ref>[[The Power of Habit]]: why we do what we do in life and business [[Charles Duhigg]] - Random House -({{ISBN|978-0812981605}}) 2012</ref>\n\nIn 1995, O'Neill was made chairman of the [[RAND Corporation]].\n\n==Community service career==\nIn December 1997, O'Neill together with [[Karen Wolk Feinstein]], President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, founded the [[Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative]] (PRHI).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prhi.org/about/history |title=History of Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative |publisher=Prhi.org |accessdate=2016-01-13}}</ref> They assembled a wide-ranging coalition of healthcare interests to begin to address the problems of healthcare, as a region.

O'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright|Official portrait as Secretary of the Treasury]]\n\nPresident [[George W. Bush]] picked Paul O'Neil as the Sectary of the Treasury in 2001 causes the President felt he had a strong resume, both from his time in the Ford administration, and his success in the private sector, Bush took the view that O'Neil would be seen as a figure to respect by those on Wall Street and on Capitol Hill. In his memoir ''Decision Points'' Bush reflected that he felt O'Neil did not turn out to be the good spokesperson or leader he had hoped he would be, saying of O'Neil: \"He and I met regularly, but never clicked. He didn't gain my confidence, nor did he build credibility with the financial community, Congress or his colleagues in the administration.\" Bush likewise, was unhappy that O'Neil was criticizing the President key economic policy of tax cuts behind his back. O'Neil was removed from his post in late 2002 as part of a reshuffle of the key economic advisors that Bush hoped would show the American people would see as the President taking the economic downturn that cost had cost over two million American their jobs very seriously and looking to not make the same political mistake his father [[George H. W. Bush]] had made in 1992 in being perceived as disengaged with the economic hardships of the American people. Bush reflected that unlike economist [[Larry Lindsey]] the Director of the National Economic Council, who was also removed in the reshuffle, O'Neil did not take his removal professionally or well and he and the President did not leave things on good terms but Bush felt it was the right decision at the right time.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bush |first1=George W. |editor1-last= Desmond |editor1-first= Sean |title=Decision Points |date=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing. |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-59061-9 |pages=85-86 |url= |chapter=3.

In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-5545-3}}) 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in Iraq was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.

After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred and reviews the footage himself, burns the store as he leaves, then begins calling travel resorts to track down Werner. Pretending to work for Gus, Lalo obtains some details about the construction of the meth lab before Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call.

The cover story explains events of which Lalo was aware, and he accepts Gus's explanation and apology, but remains suspicious. Juan privately warns Lalo that [[Don Eladio Vuente]] and the cartel trust Gus, or at least consider him a valuable earner, so Lalo should consider the matter closed. Lalo later receives confirmation from Hector that Gus enjoys cartel protection as long as he remains a top earner. Because of Lalo's suspicions, Gus shuts down work on his underground meth lab and Mike sends Werner's men home, paid in full for the half-completed job and warned to remain silent.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nGus demands that Nacho find a way to gain Lalo's trust and start passing inside information about the Salamancas.

In 1798, in the area of \u200b\u200bthe current City Palace of Culture, a wooden Pokrovskaya single-faith church was built. At the beginning of the 19th century, a stone church was built in a new place (GDK square). In place of the central part of Suvorov Square, a bridge was built across the river that flows into the Dniester. The bridge connected the western and eastern parts of the city and existed until the reconstruction of the center of Tiraspol in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1912, at the entrance to the bridge, on the west side, a Arc de Triomphe was installed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the [[Patriotic War of 1812|Patriotic War]]. A chapel-monument to Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] was erected n Pokrovskaya Square. In Soviet times, Pokrovskaya Square was renamed the Stalin Constitution Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0412 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|url=https://m.point.md/ru/novosti/obschestvo/v-pridnestrovje-pochti-vse-ulici-sohranili-svoi-prezhnie-nazvaniya|publisher=point.md|accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> and later the Sqaure of the Soviet Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u041d\u0430\u0434 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0445\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e|url=http://karavan.md/article/83|publisher=karavan.md|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the square began to take on recognizable features: the majestic Memorial of Glory was built and in 1979 an equestrian monument to Suvorov was erected, which became the symbol of the city.

In 1798, in the area of \u200b\u200bthe current City Palace of Culture, a wooden Pokrovskaya single-faith church was built. At the beginning of the 19th century, a stone church was built in a new place (GDK square). In place of the central part of Suvorov Square, a bridge was built across the river that flows into the Dniester. The bridge connected the western and eastern parts of the city and existed until the reconstruction of the center of Tiraspol in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1912, at the entrance to the bridge, on the west side, a Arc de Triomphe was installed in honor of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the [[Patriotic War]]. A chapel-monument to Tsar [[Alexander II]] was erected n Pokrovskaya Square. In Soviet times, Pokrovskaya Square was renamed the Stalin Constitution Square,<ref>{{cite web|title=\u0412 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u044c\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0441\u0435 \u0443\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044b \u0441\u043e\u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0436\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|url=https://m.point.md/ru/novosti/obschestvo/v-pridnestrovje-pochti-vse-ulici-sohranili-svoi-prezhnie-nazvaniya|publisher=point.md|accessdate=2017-08-07}}</ref> and later the Sqaure of the Soviet Constitution.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u041d\u0430\u0434 \u0442\u0440\u0438\u0431\u0443\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438 \u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u0445\u043c\u0443\u0440\u043e|url=http://karavan.md/article/83|publisher=karavan.md|accessdate=2017-08-01}}</ref> Since the 1970s, the square began to take on recognizable features: the majestic Memorial of Glory was built and in 1979 an equestrian monument to Suvorov was erected, which became the symbol of the city.
