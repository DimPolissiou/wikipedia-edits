The building dates from Chile's colonial period. The parish belongs to the '''Diocese of Linares''']]\nThe '''[[Roman Catholic]] [[Diocese]] of [[Linares, Chile|Linares]]''' ({{lang-la|Dioecesis Linarensis}}) was established in Linares, [[Chile]], by [[Pope Pius XI]] on October 18, 1925, by means of the [[Papal Bull|Bulla]] ''Notabiliter Aucto''.\n\nThe [[Diocese]] of San Ambrosio de Linares, a [[suffragan Diocese|suffragan diocese]] of [[Santiago de Chile]], is located in the geographical center of the [[Chile|country]]. The [[Diocese|diocesan]] territory consists of two [[province]]s, [[Linares Province]] and [[Cauquenes Province]], and part of a third, [[Talca Province]], all of them in the [[Maule Region]] of Chile. Compared to other Chilean dioceses, Linares has a higher proportion of [[rural]] inhabitants. Numerous [[chapel]]s have been raised, particularly in rural areas, over the last twenty years. The total number of chapels in the diocese is currently more than 450.\n\n==Brief History of the Diocese==\n\nIn 1963, the territory of the Diocese of Linares expanded to include the [[parish]]es of the then Province of Maule (currently known as the [[Cauquenes Province|Province of Cauquenes]]) that belonged to the [[Diocese of Chill\u00e1n]], and a parish ([[Put\u00fa]]), carved out from [[Talca Province]]. Prior to 1925, the territory now comprised by the Diocese was part of the ancient [[Diocese of La Sant\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]] \u2013- now the [[Archdiocese of Concepci\u00f3n]]. The [[episcopal see|see]] of the Diocese and residence of the [[bishop]] is the city of [[Linares, Chile|Linares]]. The beautiful [[Cathedral|Cathedral Church]] is dedicated to [[Saint Ambrose]] of [[Milan]].\n\n===Beginnings of Catholicism in the Region===\n\n[[Catholic]] [[evangelization]] in [[Chile]] began in the middle of the 16th century, shortly after the arrival of the [[Spaniards]]. [[Pedro de Valdivia]] granted Juan Jofr\u00e9 de Loaiza the [[encomienda]] of Peteroa, north of the [[Maule river]] on November 1, 1552, and shortly after, on 1554, ''Doctrina de Peteroa''<ref>The site where the evangelical proclamation took place was called a ''doctrina'' and the person in charge of a ''doctrina'' was a ''doctrinero''. In general, the terms [[missionary]] and doctrinero had the same meaning</ref> was created under the care of [[priest]] Juan de Oc\u00e9s, son of Don Rodrigo de Oc\u00e9s, with orders to cross to \"other towns\" of remaining [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] to the north and south of the [[river Maule|Maule]] river. As a result of the successful campaigns in southern Chile, the Diocese of Imperial was created on March 22, 1563. Following the [[Arauco War]] Bishop Don [[Reginaldo de Liz\u00e1rraga]] went to the King [[Philip III of Spain|Felipe III]] to obtain from the [[Pope]] the annexation of his [[Diocese|Bishopric]] to the one of Santiago, to which the Supreme Pontiff acceded provisionally. This situation persisted from 1609 until 1623.\n\nOn February 18, 1585, the third Bishop of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] in his detailed report to King [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]] mentions the [[Spanish missions in South America|missions]] of \"Longomilla and Purapel\", \"[[Chanco, Chile|Chanco]] and Loanco\" taken care of by the ''[[priest|presb\u00edtero]]'' Francisco de Maestanza, with a salary of three hundred and eighty [[peso]]s in [[gold]] and food.\n\n===The ''Doctrinas'' of Cauquenes and Putag\u00e1n===\n\nWhen the [[Diocese]]s of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and ''La Imperial'' were erected (in 1561 and 1564, respectively), the [[Maule river]] was considered the [[border|dividing line]] between the two dioceses. However, it seems that the division was not sufficiently clear because the Bishop of Santiago, [[Priest|Fray]] [[Diego de Medell\u00edn]] (1576\u20131592), created two ''docrinas'' south of the [[Maule River|Maule]] river that remained under the [[jurisdiction]] of the Santiago bishops for more than one hundred and seventy years. The ''doctrinas'' at issue were ''[[Cauquenes]]'' and ''[[Putag\u00e1n]]''. ''Cauquenes'' was erected in an area inhabited by the \"cauquenes\" Indians, who gave name to the region and the ''doctrina'' that was based there. In 1739 the ''[[missionary|Doctrinero]]'' Don Jos\u00e9 de Rozas and Amaza, who resided in Chanco, built a [[chapel]] in the seat of [[Cauquenes]], the same place where Don [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Manso de Velasco]] later founded the [[Cauquenes|Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes de Jos\u00e9 de Manso de Tutuv\u00e9n]] (Town of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of the Mercedes de Jos\u00e9 de Manso of [[Tutuv\u00e9n]], now ''[[Cauquenes]]'') on May 9, 1742.\n\n[[Image:Catedral de Linares Imagen 007.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Cathedral of \"San Ambrosio\", Linares]]\n\n==The Cathedral of ''San Ambrosio de Linares''==\n\nThe Cathedral Church of [[San Ambrosio]], of Linares Diocese is considered to be one of the most important and finest religious buildings erected in Chile in the twentieth century. It replaced the original cathedral, after the latter was destroyed by an [[earthquake]], in 1928. The new cathedral was conceived by bishop [[Juan Subercaseaux Err\u00e1zuriz]] and its works were conducted by the renowned Chilean architects Carlos Bresciani and Jorge del Campo, the same duo that would be responsible, several years later, for the construction of another remarkable religious building, that of the parish church of Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (Sacred Heart) in [[Providencia (municipality, Chile)|Providencia]], [[Santiago de Chile]].\n\nMgr. Subercaseaux gave a great initial impulse to the construction of the Linares Cathedral, which has been characterized as \"the plastic expression of his refined artistic culture\". Mgr. Subercaseaux, a dynamic and enterprising man, was not deterred by the shortage of resources available for the great work that had to be done. In his travels abroad, he was untiring to ask for greater resources for his diocese, which badly required some material aid that would help to finance the cathedral works as well as additional priests that would exercise their pastoral vocation in Linares diocese. In several countries ([[Italy]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]]) Mgr Subercaseaux appealed to the local Catholics in their own languages, urging them to contribute to the progress of his far away diocese.\n\nThe cathedral was built according to the model of the famous [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio of Milan]], a noble religious building built in [[Romanesque style]] and begun in the 4th century. The cathedral [[apse]] is remarkable for the outstanding [[mosaic]] work made by the Italian-born artist [[Giulio Di Girolamo]]. This mosaic work is one of the most important of its sort in [[South America]].\n\nOn the 18 October 2006 the remains of Giulio Di Girolamo's wife, Elvira, brought from Italy, were buried in the Cathedral together with those of her husband, who had died in 1998 and had been buried in the Cathedral years before.\n\n==Diocesan Statistics==\n\nThe Diocese of Linares has an area of 15,111&nbsp;km\u00b2 and its [[population]] is close to 350,000. More than 70% of its [[inhabitant]]s consider themselves [[Catholic]], (2002 [[Census]]).\n\n==Deaneries, parishes and priests of the Diocese==\n\nThere are 33 '''[[parish]]es''' grouped into six '''[[deanery|Deaneries]]''', including: [[urban area|Urban]] [[Linares, Chile|Linares]], [[Parral, Chile|Parral]], [[Cauquenes]], [[Constituci\u00f3n, Chile|Constituci\u00f3n]], [[San Javier,

In 1739 the ''[[missionary|Doctrinero]]'' Don Jos\u00e9 de Rozas and Amaza, who resided in Chanco, built a [[chapel]] in the seat of [[Cauquenes]], the same place where Don [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Manso de Velasco]] later founded the [[Cauquenes|Villa de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de las Mercedes de Jos\u00e9 de Manso de Tutuv\u00e9n]] (Town of [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Our Lady]] of the Mercedes de Jos\u00e9 de Manso of [[Tutuv\u00e9n]], now ''[[Cauquenes]]'') on May 9, 1742.\n\n[[Image:Catedral de Linares Imagen 007.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Cathedral of \"San Ambrosio\", Linares]]\n\n==The Cathedral of ''San Ambrosio de Linares''==\n\nThe Cathedral Church of [[San Ambrosio]], of Linares Diocese is considered to be one of the most important and finest religious buildings erected in Chile in the twentieth century. It replaced the original cathedral, after the latter was destroyed by an [[earthquake]], in 1928. The new cathedral was conceived by bishop [[Juan Subercaseaux Err\u00e1zuriz]] and its works were conducted by the renowned Chilean architects Carlos Bresciani and Jorge del Campo, the same duo that would be responsible, several years later, for the construction of another remarkable religious building, that of the parish church of Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n (Sacred Heart) in [[Providencia (municipality, Chile)|Providencia]], [[Santiago de Chile]].\n\nMgr. Subercaseaux gave a great initial impulse to the construction of the Linares Cathedral, which has been characterized as \"the plastic expression of his refined artistic culture\". Mgr. Subercaseaux, a dynamic and enterprising man, was not deterred by the shortage of resources available for the great work that had to be done. In his travels abroad, he was untiring to ask for greater resources for his diocese, which badly required some material aid that would help to finance the cathedral works as well as additional priests that would exercise their pastoral vocation in Linares diocese. In several countries ([[Italy]], [[Germany]], the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[Netherlands]]) Mgr Subercaseaux appealed to the local Catholics in their own languages, urging them to contribute to the progress of his far away diocese.\n\nThe cathedral was built according to the model of the famous [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio|Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio of Milan]], a noble religious building built in [[Romanesque style]] and begun in the 4th century. The cathedral [[apse]] is remarkable for the outstanding [[mosaic]] work made by the Italian-born artist [[Giulio Di Girolamo]]. This mosaic work is one of the most important of its sort in [[South America]].\n\nOn the 18 October 2006 the remains of Giulio Di Girolamo's wife, Elvira, brought from Italy, were buried in the Cathedral together with those of her husband, who had died in 1998 and had been buried in the Cathedral years before.\n\n==Diocesan Statistics==\n\nThe Diocese of Linares has an area of 15,111&nbsp;km\u00b2 and its [[population]] is close to 350,000. More than 70% of its [[inhabitant]]s consider themselves [[Catholic]], (2002 [[Census]]).\n\n==Deaneries, parishes and priests of the Diocese==\n\nThere are 33 '''[[parish]]es''' grouped into six '''[[deanery|Deaneries]]''', including: [[urban area|Urban]] [[Linares, Chile|Linares]], [[Parral, Chile|Parral]], [[Cauquenes]], [[Constituci\u00f3n, Chile|Constituci\u00f3n]], [[San Javier, Chile|San Javier]], [[Rural]] [[Linares, Chile|Linares]].\n\n===Parishes of the Diocese===\n\n====Urban Linares and Rural Linares Deaneries====\n* El Sagrario ([[Cathedral]]), [[Linares, Chile|Linares]] \n* Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rosario, Linares  \n* Inmaculado Coraz\u00f3n de Mar\u00eda, Linares  \n* Mar\u00eda Auxiliadora, Linares  \n* Jes\u00fas Obrero, Linares  \n* Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen, Linares  \n* Mar\u00eda Peregrina, Linares  \n* San Antonio de Padua, Linares \n* Santos Chilenos, Linares \n* Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Buena Esperanza, [[Panim\u00e1vida]] \n* San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, [[Colb\u00fan]]  \n* De la Santa Cruz, [[Yerbas Buenas]]\n\n====San Javier Deanery====\n\n* San Francisco Javier, [[San Javier, Chile|San Javier]]  \n* Sant\u00edsima Virgen de la Merced, San Javier \n* Santa Rosa, Melozal   \n* Del Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas, [[VIlla Alegre, Chile|Villa Alegre]] \n* San Francisco, [[Huerta de Maule]]   \n* San Juan, Orilla de Maule\n\n====Parral Deanery====\n\n* San Jos\u00e9 de Parral, [[Parral, Chile|Parral]]\n* San Francisco de Parral, Parral  \n* San Sebasti\u00e1n de Los Cuarteles, Parral \n* San Lorenzo, [[Longav\u00ed]]\n* San Ram\u00f3n, [[Retiro, Chile|Retiro]]\n\n====Constituci\u00f3n Deanery====\n\n* San Jos\u00e9, [[Constituci\u00f3n, Chile|Constituci\u00f3n]]   \n* Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Tr\u00e1nsito, [[Put\u00fa]] \n* Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen, [[Nirivilo]]  \n* San Ignacio, [[Empedrado, Chile|Empedrado]]\n\n====Cauquenes Deanery====\n\n* San Pedro, [[Cauquenes]]  \n* San Alfonso, Cauquenes  \n* [[Convent]]o San Francisco, Cauquenes   \n* Santo Toribio, [[Curanipe]]   \n* San Luis Gonzaga, [[Sauzal]] \n* San Ambrosio, [[Chanco, Chile|Chanco]]\n\n===Priests of the Diocese===\n\nFrancisco Lav\u00edn, Juvenal Pereira, Ren\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, Erasmo Salazar, Pl\u00e1cido Grove, Hern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez, Rolf Schnitzler, Gabriel Lacaux, Jaime Vallet, Ram\u00f3n Iturra, Luis Alarc\u00f3n, Germ\u00e1n C\u00e1ceres, Silvio Jara, Lorenzo Solari, Jos\u00e9 Ulloa, Luis Retamal, Benjam\u00edn Retamales, Francisco Hormaz\u00e1bal, Jos\u00e9 Prado, Gonz\u00e1lo Aravena, Luis Fuentealba, Ra\u00fal Moris, Alejandro Quiroz, Waldo Alfaro, Mario Agurto.\n\n==Ordinaries==\n\n===Bishops of Linares===\n* Miguel Le\u00f3n Prado (1925-1934)\n* [[Juan Subercaseaux Err\u00e1zuriz]] (1935-1940), appointed [[Archdiocese of La Serena|Archbishop of La Serena]]\n* Francisco Javier Valdivia Pinedo (1940-1941)\n* Roberto Moreira Mart\u00ednez (1941-1958)\n* Augusto Osvaldo Salinas Fuenzalida (1958-1976)\n* [[Carlos Marcio Camus Larenas]] (1976-2003)\n* Tomislav Koljatic Maroevic (2003-present)\n\n==Notes==\n\n<!-- Use MLA style citation format for books, encyclopedias, and periodicals -->\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.iglesia.cl/linares Website of the diocese (in Spanish)]\n*[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dlinr.html Diocese of Linares at the www.catholic-hierarchy.org website]\n\n{{coord|35.8456|S|71.5992|W|source:wikidata-and-enwiki-cat-tree_region:CL|display=title}}\n\n{{R-C dioceses in Chile}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Linares}}\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Chile]]\n[[Category:Christian organizations established in 1925]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses and prelatures established in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic Ecclesiastical Province of Santiago de Chile|Linares, Roman Catholic Diocese of]]\n", "name_user": "Jzsj", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Doctrinas of Cauquenes and Putag\u00e1n:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Linares"}
